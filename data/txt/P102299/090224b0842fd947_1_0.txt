F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to assist the Government of Botswana to increase the
coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of targeted and evidence-based HIV/AIDS interventions
through (i) strengthening the National AIDS Coordinating Agency's institutional management
and coordination capacity; and (ii) financing strategic and innovative HIV/AIDS-related
prevention and mitigation activities. This project development objective will be measured by

utilizing indicators addressing the longer-term planning, implementation, and effectiveness of
national and decentralized coordination efforts.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
To assist the Government of Botswana to increase access to prioritized prevention services that
reduce the risk of HIV transmission. (Revised on the basis of agreements during the Mid Term
Review (MTR) in May 2011 and approved by the World Bank Board on December 29, 2011).

Indicators
 At project approval, 6 Project Outcome Indicators (PDOs) and 13 Intermediate Outcome
   Indicators (IOs) comprised the project’s Results Framework (RF). PDO Indicator #4 was
   mistakenly reported on as an IO indicator during implementation. This was eventually
   corrected in March 2015.
 During the ICR process, it was necessary to review and include additional indicators in order
   to more fully reflect project achievements and measure the impact project activities had on
   the PDO. As a result, three additional PDO indicators have been included in the datasheet
   (PDO 7-9): (i) improving TB case detection; and TB treatment success rate; (ii) percentage
   of population (10-64 years) who have ever received an HIV test; and (iii) percentage of adults
   (15-49 years) who received an HIV test in the past 12 months and who know their results.

(a) PDO Indicator(s)
                  PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE INDICATORS (PDO)
                   Percentage of youths aged 10 to 14*, 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 who (a) correctly identify
                   three ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and (b) who reject three
                   major misconceptions about HIV transmission.

Indicator 1:      This indicator measures the “coverage” dimension of the original PDO (Phase 1) and
                  “access to prioritized prevention to reduce the risk of HIV transmission” in the revised
                  PDO (Phase 2). Causal Pathway: improved coverage / access through improved
                  knowledge of HIV prevention and transmission (i.e., increased demand for prevention
                  through IEC to reduce the risk of HIV transmission).

                  be reduced by having sex with only one uninfected partner who has no other partners?
                  Can a person reduce the risk of getting HIV by using a condom every time they have
                  sex? Can having no sex at all can prevent HIV infection?” and three misconception
                  rejections: “Can a healthy-looking person have HIV? Can a person get HIV from
                  mosquito bites? Can a person get HIV by sharing food with someone who is infected?”

                  sustainability of responding to HIV.

                  inputs are listed among the core sector indicators. Indirectly, this biomedical indicator
                  is related to efficiency and sustainability. While these dimensions were only explicit in

                  efficiency and sustainability, such effects should also be assessed for Phase 2.
                  The target values are based on the National TB Program Report of the MOH (NTBR-

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country Profile, Economic Growth and Governance. During project preparation,
Botswana had a population of 1.8 million, about half residing in rural areas. The administrative
structure is composed of 9 districts,1 5 urban districts, and 28 subdistricts. Botswana's post-
independence history has been characterized by good governance, democracy, strong
macroeconomic policies, an open economy, relatively strong institutions and high revenues from
diamond-mining industries. With a gross national income per capita of US$5,750 in 2008,
Botswana was classified as an upper middle-income country. The government managed the
country's resources prudently and kept its recurrent expenditure within its revenue, allowing for
investment in human and physical capital. In 2007, Botswana ranked as Africa's least corrupt
country, placing above many European and Asian countries, on Transparency International’s
ranking.

2.      Discordance between Economic and Human Development. The Government of
Botswana (GoB) had made a concerted effort to achieve sustainable economic growth. Economic
growth was robust, with an average of 5.7% real growth rate between 2002 and 2008. Although
this growth earned favorable global recognition, it was accompanied by unintended
consequences. Growth was largely driven by the mining sector, and it was inequitable, associated
with persisting poverty and unemployment. In 2012, Botswana had one of the highest Gini
coefficients (60.5) in Africa and globally. The HIV epidemic had a substantial negative impact
on fundamental indicators as shown by its declining Human Development Index (HDI) ranking
from 71 in 1996 to 124 in 2005. Lower life expectancy affected demography and the economy,
for example, through higher dependency ratios and an increased share of orphans, representing
20% of all children in 2010. These socio-economic constraints were identified as the major
factors suppressing growth and became the focus areas of the GoB’s economic and development
policies.
 
3.       Health Financing, System, and Outcomes. Botswana had dedicated a significant share
of its resources to health. At appraisal in 2008, total expenditure on health was 5.3% of GDP.
Between 2002 and 2012, allocations from general government expenditures to the health sector
were an average 8.9%. In 2008, the per capita health expenditure (at average exchange rate) was
US$307, of which approximately 69% were government expenditures. By 2013 per capita health
expenditure was US$397, of which 57% was publicly funded (WHO, 2014). At appraisal,
Botswana had 24 health districts. At the time of the ICR the MOH listed 27 health districts, and
the service delivery infrastructure included 3 referral hospitals, 12 district hospitals, 17 primary
hospitals, 222 clinics, 220 health posts, and 740 mobile stops (MOH, 2015). The HIV/AIDS
epidemic had a severe impact on the health system, in skewing resource allocation and disease
control efforts away from other diseases. For example, compared to the national AIDS treatment
program and despite the high prevalence of HIV/TB incidence, there was not an equally strong
response to TB. Case detection was 80% in 2006, down from 88% in 2000. Treatment success
fell from 77% (2000) to 70% (2005). The PAD noted that the implementation of the joint TB-
HIV/AIDS strategy needed to be strengthened, particularly at community level where these
programs operated in parallel. In sum, at appraisal, key health and human development indicators
were not commensurate with the investments in the sector. The low HDI ranking, the increasing
infant mortality rate (from 45/1,000 births in 1990 to 85 in 2005), and TB incidence (from
236/100,000 in 1990 to 670 in 2005, and accounting for 38% of AIDS deaths) indicated that for
its income and health expenditure levels, Botswana could buy more health for the money by

improving sector efficiency. Given the share of HIV/AIDS in total health expenditures and the
rising concerns regarding expenditure inefficiencies, the innovations envisaged to contribute to
system level value-for-money objectives included improved prevention efforts, integrated care
delivery, and engaging communities and the private sector in healthcare delivery.
4.       HIV/AIDS Epidemiology. The first case of HIV infection in Botswana was diagnosed
in 1985. The number of new infections rose rapidly during the early 1990s, peaking in the mid-
1990s (Figure A10-1 Panel A, Annex 10). Botswana faced the second most severe HIV epidemic
in the world (after Swaziland). In 2008, 283,000 adults (over 15 years of age) were living with
HIV/AIDS in Botswana (prevalence: 23.8%; NACA, 2008). Rising mortality rates paralleled a
maturing epidemic, reaching a peak in 2003. AIDS-attributed mortality increased from 4 to 27%
of all reported deaths between 1992 and 2003 (Figure A10-1 Panel A, Annex 10). The principal
mode of transmission in Botswana was and remains heterosexual. Factors fueling the epidemic
include: (i) multiple concurrent sexual partnerships (MCP); (ii) unprotected and intergenerational
sex; (iii) vulnerability of women; (iv) persistent inequality and poverty; and (v) high levels of
population mobility, including cross-border challenges. These dimensions indicated complex
behavioral and socio-economic dynamics, which required a multisectoral response.
Geographically, the epidemic had been diverse, with the highest infection rates reported from the
northeastern2 areas of the country. The 2004 Botswana AIDS Impact Survey (BAIS II) estimated
the highest prevalence among women 30-34 years of age (44%). The 2006 Botswana HIV/AIDS
Sentinel Surveillance Technical Report corroborated these findings, and showed that almost half
of women aged 25-34 years were HIV positive (Table A10-1, Annex 10).
5.       Fiscal Space for HIV/AIDS. In 2001, Botswana was the first African country to provide
no-cost antiretroviral therapy (ART) to its citizens. The benefits of the rollout were twofold:
preventing 52,000 HIV/AIDS-related deaths by 2007; and slowing the rate of decline in GDP
growth from 1-1.2 to 0.8%. However, concerns were rising regarding the expenditure implication
of HIV/AIDS. The combination of (i) high HIV prevalence rate; (ii) increasing ART coverage;
and (iii) increasing life expectancy as a result of treatment success rate (92%) were exerting ever-
growing pressure on the sector’s budget and, consequently, on general government expenditures.
The disease-specific government allocation increased from US$69.8 million in 2000-2001 to an
average of US$163 million in 2006-2007 (Table A10-2, Annex 10). Estimates at the time of the
appraisal put the GoB’s share of HIV/AIDS-related total expenditures at 57% and the external
resource share at 43%, reaching half of HIV/AIDS spending by 2008 (Table A10-2, Annex 10).3
Yet, even the combined donor4 and GoB resources could not keep pace with the escalating cost
of the response to the epidemic. The fiscal space implication of the epidemic became a concern
of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP); specifically, whether the national
HIV/AIDS-related investments could increasingly displace other budget priorities. This concern
was aggravated by donor flight, with more domestic resources needed to maintain treatment
coverage. This meant that sustained commitments to fighting HIV could consume a progressively
larger share of the economy. Botswana’s HIV/AIDS-related expenditures grew from 2.6% of
GDP during appraisal (Table A10-3, Annex 10) to 3.5% in 2010 (Lule and Haacker, 2012). It
became clear that the new direction for the national response must incorporate more focus on
efficiency and sustainability.

6.       Government strategy to fight HIV/AIDS. The increase in the AIDS-attributed mortality
rate triggered the emergency expansion of the national HIV/AIDS treatment program, and an
increase in the proportion of patients initiating prophylaxis/treatment (from 34.3% in 2001/2002

to 89% in 2006/2007). However, the treatment-oriented program resulted in lesser focus on
prevention priorities and outcomes. On the demand side, this pattern could be explained by a
combination of knowledge gap, behavioral dynamics, and high levels of stigma associated with
HIV. Regarding the knowledge gap, although 93% of respondents had heard of HIV/AIDS, the
proportion who correctly identified HIV prevention and transmission increased from 36% (2001)
to 38% (BAIS II, 2004) against the target of 90% by 2005. As to the behavioral aspects, 76% of
the 15-24 cohort had non-regular partner sex in the last 12 months (BAIS 2004). The share
reporting unprotected sex increased from 5% (2002) to 14.7% (2007). The share of young people
15-19 who had multiple concurrent partnership (MCP) in the last 12 months greatly increased
from 0.3% (2001) to 17.1% (2005). In 2003, 24% of sexually active men (15-24) reported sex
with someone outside their primary relationship. Such behavior had a 72% acceptance rate.
Therefore, at appraisal, the most significant challenge for the national response was to strengthen
efforts to reduce the annual number of new infections, projected at over 14,000 in 2008. Evidence
from BAIS II (2004) suggested that to complement the successful rollout of the treatment
program (2001), an effective HIV/AIDS response must strengthen prevention, with an emphasis
on knowledge and behavior. The findings called for gradually optimizing the balance between
the biomedical focus and prevention within the national response.5 Such a balanced approach
required a new delivery platform; closer linkage with communities to influence behavior and
deliver services at the lowest levels of the health system. Prior to BNAPS, there was limited
progress at community level due to weak community health systems. A required paradigm shift
was the introduction of community-centered approaches in HIV/AIDS prevention to ensure
broader and more sustainable coverage. The linkages between the national response to the
epidemic and higher level development objectives were reinforcing. The National Strategic
Framework for HIV/AIDS (NSF I, 2003-2009) -- which focused on: (i) articulating,
disseminating, and educating the public on agreed priorities and strategies within the scope of
Vision 2016; (ii) providing clear guidance and a collaborative framework for ministries, districts,
CSOs, and the private sector “to eliminate the incidence of HIV and reduce the impact of AIDS
in Botswana; and (iii) strengthening coordination across NACA, the MOH, and at decentralized
levels.” -- was linked to the National Development Plan (NDP-9, 2003-2009). The National
Strategy for Poverty Reduction noted HIV/AIDS as both a cause and consequence of poverty and
unemployment. 
7.      Rationale for Bank Assistance. The GoB requested the BNAPS Project – a proposed
concessional IBRD operation (see more on the innovative instrument, the ‘IBRD buy-down,’ in
paragraph 21 under Section 2.1) – in anticipation that the financial and technical resources
mobilized through the Bank would play a strategic role in supporting an evidence-based response
to the national prevention program. BNAPS was aligned with Botswana’s overarching
development agenda (NDP-9 and the Poverty Strategy) and the national response to the epidemic,
which was defined in the NSF I (2003-2009) and related operational plans, such as the National
Operational Plan for Scaling-up HIV Prevention (2008), which focused on prioritizing
interventions with the greatest potential impact for preventing new infections. The Project was
consistent with relevant sectoral and regional World Bank strategies and policies,6 and the
Interim Strategy Note for Botswana (2008), the first Bank strategy for Botswana, which included
HIV/AIDS among its three strategic priorities. Regarding the bigger picture, BNAPS was
envisioned to (i) catalyze the transition from an “emergency” response to a broader, strategic,
and sustainable approach; (ii) facilitate complementary response from development partners
(DPs); and (iii) create opportunities to advance regional goals.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
8.      The PDO aimed to “assist the GoB to increase the coverage, efficiency, and sustainability
of targeted and evidence-based HIV/AIDS interventions through (i) strengthening the National
AIDS Coordinating Agency's institutional management and coordination capacity; and (ii)
financing strategic and innovative HIV/AIDS-related prevention and mitigation activities.” The
6 original PDO indicators were: (1) percentage of youths aged 10-14, 15-19 and 20-24 who (a)
correctly identify three ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and (b) who reject
three major misconceptions about HIV transmission; (2) Proportion of youth aged 10-14, 15-19
and 20-24 years reporting either (a) no sexual activity or (b) condom use during the last sexual
encounter with a non-regular partner in the past 12 months; (3) percentage of sexually active
males/females (M/F) who report having had sex with more than one partner in the past 12 months;
(4) The number of male circumcision procedures performed in selected health facilities; (5)
Health facilities constructed, renovated, and or equipped to be highly active anti-retroviral
therapy (HAART) compliant (core sector indicator); and (6) People receiving tuberculosis
treatment in accordance with the WHO-recommended “Directly Observed Treatment Strategy”
(DOTS).
1.3 Revised PDO and Justification
9.      The Restructuring Paper (November 14, 2011) assessed that, based on a more
comprehensive understanding of Botswana’s HIV/AIDS epidemic and implementation
experience obtained from the May 2011 MTR, efficiency and sustainability would not be easily
measurable or attainable in a short time span, even though these goals remained highly relevant.
Consequently, the December 2011 level 1 restructuring simplified the PDO, focusing on
prevention. The revised PDO is: “To assist the Government of Botswana to increase access to
prioritized prevention services that reduce the risk of HIV transmission.” This change reflects
decreased emphasis on the Project’s institutional aspect, the strengthening of NACA’s
coordination and management capacity. The PDO revision was not accompanied by changes in
the indicators proposed in the original Results Framework.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.      Geographic and Population Coverage. At appraisal, in 2006, approximately eighty
percent of the estimated 1.8 million population of Botswana was estimated to be affected by
BNAPS. To attain the PDO and to target resources, BNAPS focused on the 15-19, 20-24 and 25-
49 age groups and vulnerable groups, as defined in the Operations Manual, including
children/youth and women. The “prioritized and phased implementation” indicates that the
number of beneficiaries would increase over time. Phase I (years 1-2) was to cover five health
districts on the eastern border, including South East, Kweneng East, Francistown, Selebi-Phikwe
districts, and Goodhope subdistrict. Phase II (years 3-5) was to attain the nationwide rollout of
BNAPS, following satisfying the fiduciary requirements.

1.5 Original Components
11.    The design of project components was based on analysis of identified challenges in the
national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and reflected NACA’s key program coordination
and implementation areas, as follows:
12.     Component 1: Support to NACA (US$7.2 million). This component focused on
building NACA’s internal capacity to coordinate HIV/AIDS activities effectively. Design
features included: (i) coordination of program components by NACA that are decentralized and
implemented by the Ministry of Local Government (MLG), the district administration, or NGOs;
(ii) NACA, as the financial intermediary, to channel funds from the MFDP to implementing
agencies; (iii) NACA to support improving the design and strengthening the National M&E


                                               4
Framework, centrally and at district level; (iv) BNAPS to leverage long-term technical assistance
(TA)/capacity building to NACA through consultants (see Table A2-2, Annex 2); (v) NACA to
finance capacity training for CSOs and annual capacity assessments; and (vi) NACA to
commission a social assessment study of the epidemic.
13.      Component 2: Public Sector Ministries (US$19.2 million). This component was
designed to support public sector ministries focusing on initiatives aligned with the earlier noted
three priority areas of the NSF I and following consultation with partners. The component
engaged supporting seven ministries (see Table A2-3, Annex 2) to improve HIV-related
knowledge, behavior, and health outcomes by delivering prevention and treatment tailored to
their target groups. Funding was to be based on Annual Work Plans submitted for review by the
Project Steering Committee and the HIV/AIDS Technical Sub-Committee. Upon approval,
funding was to be channeled through NACA for disbursement to ministries. M&E activities
under this component were coordinated by NACA.
14.      Component 3: Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)/Private Sector (US$21.6 million).
This component was allocated the highest share of project funds, reflecting the importance of
civil society and private sector organizations (CSOs/PSOs) in the achievement of the PDO. This
component made “community grants” available to CSOs/PSOs, focusing on initiatives in line
with the NSF I. Performance-based financing (PBF) was applied, involving four interlinked
processes: (i) developing calls for proposals (CFP); (ii) evaluating, and awarding proposals by
CSOs/PSOs; (iii) monitoring outputs by grantees; and (iv) disbursement linked to achievement
of agreed output targets. Further, this component targeted community-level activities that
prioritized specific HIV/AIDS prevention results and targeted vulnerable populations, as defined
in the Operations Manual. These design features were expected to streamline funding procedures
and deliver value for money by improving efficiency and focusing on specific thematic areas.
1.6 Revised Components
15.     Components were not formally revised. However, there were some changes made as part
of the natural course correction during implementation. This included scaling back BNAPS’
geographic coverage from nationwide, as described originally in the PAD, down to 11 districts
(out of the total 15 nationally) to enable capacity building and avoid spreading resources thinly.
Also, allocation of project financing across the three components was slightly modified,
increasing resources for prevention activities implemented by CSOs/PSOs under Component 3
(Table A10-5, Annex 10). Lastly, allocations within Component 2 were augmented towards
better performing ministries (MOH and the Ministry of Education and Skills Development
(MOESD) in line with the MTR’s recommendations. Together these ministries accounted for the
largest share (69.1%) of project expenditures7 (Figure A1-2, Annex 1). For example, fund
allocations to the MOH increased from 2012, when there was a relative increase in the focus on
biomedical prevention, such as safe male circumcision (SMC), and on the integration agenda
(TB-HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer-HIV/AIDS) to boost project performance.

1.7 Other significant changes
16.     The BNAPS was extended twice: (i) a year extension, from September 30, 2013 to
September 30, 2014, and (ii) a six months extension until March 31, 2015. The rationale for the
additional 18 months was to provide the necessary time to complete the project, particularly since
one year was essentially lost at the start of the project due to the delay in the signing of the Loan
Agreement and subsequent delay in project effectiveness. The extension therefore allowed for
the Loan to be fully disbursed, as well as to enable the project to realize its full impact (Table
A10-5, Annex 10). In addition, the second extension was accompanied by a loan category

    Data by ministry for 2014-2015 was not available, inhibiting a trend analysis for the Project’s duration.

reallocation to reflect the agreed activities in the Implementation Plan over the period of the
proposed extension. Allocations for goods and non-consulting services under subprojects were
increased from 44.6% to 82.7%.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17.     Project Preparation. Initially, the project was planned to be processed with urgency8 in
response to the GoB’s emphasis on the severity of the epidemic. However, the BNAPS took 20
months to prepare given the complexity of the project and the proposed IBRD buy-down
mechanism (see more in paragraph 21) which required a high level of coordination with the EC
as the co-financier, in addition to Government counterparts, and other key country-level DPs.
The Bank may have underestimated the time required for coordination and to design such a novel
instrument. Also, it is important to note that during project preparation there was no WBG
presence in Botswana. In fact, BNAPS was the first project after a long time, preceding the
development of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The WB Country Office was opened
during the third year of BNAPS’ implementation. Hence, throughout preparation (as well as
implementation), the Bank team placed an extra emphasis on providing client support in the form
of capacity building in Bank policies and procedures.

18.     Risks. At appraisal, the overall risk rating was ‘Moderate.’ While the ratings for the nine
risk dimensions presented a largely realistic assessment of the possible challenges that could
affect BNAPS, the overall ‘Moderate’ risk rating was somewhat optimistic; a ‘Substantial’ rating
would have been more accurate (see Table A10-6, Annex 10). The highest risks were associated
with the magnitude of the epidemic and the measurability of impact in the short run, the capacity
limitations of NACA, limited government experience in collaborating with civil society and the
private sector, and potential delays with audits or accounting for fund utilization under
Component 3. Most concerns were legitimate but some have been attenuated as a result of
technical assistance.

19.    Participatory Process and Learning from Previous Operations. The project appraisal and
design process was participatory, involving consultations with the GoB, including key ministries,
a wide range of local CSOs, the Private Sector, and the main DPs.9 As there had not been any
prior Bank-financed projects in many years in Botswana, the team drew on the experiences of
other DPs. For example, the design of fund flows was influenced by the experience of the Global
Fund. To mitigate the concern that resources may not reach intended implementers, especially at
the community level, BNAPS funds were to be channeled through the District Councils, which
were familiar with donor funded project disbursements.

20.    Overall, project preparation was moderately effective. It was successful in terms of its
emphasis on capacity building and inclusiveness. However, the time required for preparing such
a complex an innovative project with a new Borrower was underestimated and the risk
assessment was somewhat optimistic.

  References to urgency and ‘emergency’ in the PAD (e.g., p. 8) are based on the severity of the epidemic and the
importance of combating HIV/AIDS for the GoB. It does not refer to the project preparation process, as defined for
Emergency Operations supported by the World Bank, which go through a simplified preparation (i.e., fast track).  
9
  Major partners: the US government (CDC, PEPFAR, and BOTUSA), the Global Fund (GFATM), ACHAP
(partnership between the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, Merck and the GoB), and key UN agencies (e.g.
UNAIDS). Consultations were held with the EC on M&E targets and buy-down triggers to apply a performance-
based modality for tranche disbursements.


                                                               6
21.     Project Design. Focus and PDO: The Project was designed to address strategic and
implementation gaps identified in the Mid-term Review (MTR) of the NSF I (2003-2009), such
as prevention as a national survival strategy, and was developed to support and catalyze the
implementation of the National Operational Plan for Scaling-up HIV Prevention (2008).
Regarding the broader design aspects, apart from being a Specific Investment Loan (SIL),
BNAPS features two novel financing instruments: (i) an IBRD buy-down mechanism; and (ii)
performance based financing (PBF), which, respectively, were introduced to reduce the cost of
the loan to the Government and introduce more focus on results through output-based
development financing. These were both important elements for the efficiency and sustainability
of public financing.

22.      IBRD Buy-down. BNAPS was recognized as a flagship project because of the IBRD “buy-
down” innovation. This was the first IBRD buy-down in Africa and the second globally. Given
that its upper middle-income status excludes Botswana from the World Bank’s concessional IDA
resources, the GoB requested that the proposed operation be financed utilizing an IBRD loan
buy-down mechanism, developed to increase the flexibility and concessionality of funding for
projects where it is justified by global public good or cross-border externalities. This instrument
relies on donor resources to lower the cost of borrowing an IBRD loan. The release of the buy-
down donor funds depends on project performance against agreed indicators targets. For
Botswana, the European Commission (EC) agreed to support the buy-down of BNAPS,
approving an additional €14 million (~US$20) grant for sector budget support (SBS) within its
four-year Economic Development Framework (EDF10, 2010-2014).10 A structural distinction,
compared to buy-downs in other countries, was that the EC and the GoB agreed on the flow of
funds directly from the EC to the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP). By
design, the release of the buy-down contribution from the EC was conditional on reaching the
targets set for the Intermediate Outcome (IO) indicators of the Project’s Results Framework. The
release of the first tranche was to be based on the results of the MTR, and of the second/last
tranche was to be tied to results at project closing and were planned be discussed with the
National Authorizing Office of the MFDP before submission to Brussels. By design, the
allocation of the grant across the components favored the CSO/PSO component (50%). The
remaining funds were to be equally split between NACA (25%) and participating ministries
(25%).

23.      Performance-based Financing (PBF). In line with the Project’s emphasis in the original
PDO on enhancing the ‘efficiency and sustainability’ of the national response, BNAPS involved
a disbursement-linked performance mechanism to strengthen the performance of line ministries
and civil society/private sector organizations (CSOs/PSOs) receiving support under the project.
The principles of PBF (e.g., active purchasing, contracting, internal and external verification,
managerial autonomy, and separation of functions between regulator, fund holder, purchaser, and
provider and beneficiaries) were to be applied through four interlinked processes, as discussed
earlier. These include: (i) calls for proposals (CFP); (ii) evaluating and awarding proposals by
CSOs/PSOs; (iii) monitoring outputs by grantees and verifying results; and (iv) disbursement
linked to achievement of agreed output targets. In addition to enhancing efficiency and
contributing to the sustainability agenda, the PBF was also designed to encourage an ‘evidence-
based’ approach. For example, the capacity assessment through the CFP mechanism, the
monitoring of base and endline values, and the verification of results delivered by CSOs/PSOs
were to ensure focused and evidence-based program implementation.

24.     Component Design: Based on policy documents and extensive consultations, three
components were designed to create an enabling environment and a broad-based platform for
effective, efficient, and sustainable HIV prevention. A critical challenge to enabling a more
technically and financially efficient response was the limited capacity of NACA, as was the case
with other countries in the region. Given its coordination role, NACA was designated as the
primary coordinating implementing agency for BNAPS. However, at appraisal, NACA was yet
to realize its potential due to weak operating systems and HR constraints.11 Given these capacity
constraints, Component 1 focused on improving organizational effectiveness and strengthening
NACA’s coordination function through capacity building, with a strong emphasis on addressing
HR constraints, and strengthening the M&E framework. Component 2 highlighted the
importance of the multisectoral response to the epidemic. It was designed in line with the
comparative advantage of the involved ministries to encourage evidence-based interventions to
reach defined target groups that fall under the mandate and jurisdiction of the given sectoral
ministry. Budget reallocation across and within ministries based on performance targets was
designed to catalyze more focus on outcomes and efficiency. Under Component 3, a paradigm
shift by BNAPS was the introduction of community-centered approaches in HIV/AIDS
prevention. This component moved away from the former multi-layered, top-down and supply-
driven approach that did not allow for a direct purchaser-provider relationship between the GoB
and the CSOs/PSOs, toward a performance-based platform. With the requirement to report
baseline, progress and endline data, this component introduced improved accountability and
transparency elements. The PBF platform was also expected to contribute to improved efficiency
and sustainability.
25.     In sum, the design of BNAPS: (i) focused on prevention; (ii) was policy-based and
harmonized assistance to the GoB with DPs to operationalize the NSF; (iii) was innovative (e.g.,
IBRD buy-down, PBF approaches); (iv) used a multisectoral approach through a combination of
interventions; (v) fostered the creation of a broad-based platform for the national response that
builds on complementarity and harnesses the comparative advantages of the implementing agents
(e.g. government at central, district, and local levels, CSOs, and PSOs); (vi) applied a learning-
by-doing approach, supported by the Bank’s Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) for Africa;
(vii) aimed to be evidence-based by creating systems to store and share evidence to inform
choices in design, implementation, and policymaking. Although the design was based on
identified shortcomings, it had limitations. First, it was complex, particularly for a first-time
operation. Second, while emphasis was placed on necessary institution building, more attention
could have been given to identifying the most strategic interventions (e.g., effectiveness,
targeting, etc.). Third, the application of two innovative instruments (IBRD buy-down and PBF)
with a new Client with a steep learning curve, added to the project’s complexity.
26.     Quality at Entry. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) by the Bank – carried out in
April, 2008 – concluded that the PDO was relevant and appropriate and confirmed the importance
of the operation moving forward on a priority basis. However, the Panel encouraged the Team to
come up with a realistic plan to avoid excessive expectations of what could be achieved in year
one given that the Project was complex and engaged a ‘new’ Borrower. The QER identified three
areas for urgent attention: (i) developing a detailed operational plan; (ii) preparing a
comprehensive social assessment to inform project design, including intervention targeting and
the behavior communication strategy; and (iii) addressing technical issues to achieve
improvement in health outcomes. Among technical issues were: integrating the findings of the

                                                            
11
  Assessments by the GoB, the Global Fund and the Bank provided similar findings on NACA’s institutional
capacity; that it did not possess the requisite internal capacity and processes in order to effectively and efficiently
carry out its assigned function.  


                                                               8
economic analysis into the design; articulating the strategies/technical interventions that would
be undertaken to improve program efficiency and effectiveness; and discussing the impact on
wider health system, STIs programs, and TB/MDR-TB in the southern African context.
Regarding the novel instrument, the Panel noted that the IBRD buy-down would likely create
stronger interest and ownership by the MFDP. To avoid the perception of a financing instrument-
driven approach, the Panel had recommended that the Team focus its efforts on strengthening
some of the technical aspects of the Project to ensure strong ownership by the Ministry of Health.
Despite these limitations, the QER Panel supported the timeline proposed by the Team given the
urgency in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In response to the QER Panel’s recommendation
on the social assessment, the Bank team included among the legal covenants for BNAPS the
implementation of an assessment within one year after effectiveness (June 2010). Regarding the
finalization of the detailed operational plan within the first six months of implementation, the
Team agreed that this was necessary. Addressing the outstanding technical issues identified by
the QER Panel received less attention. Overall, the QER Panel’s recommendations had led to
improved design and also helped identify key action items for Year One supervision, which
included: (i) focus on capacity building, including by establishing effective coordinating
mechanisms by tapping into platforms used by DPs or through local presence; (ii) develop
project-specific indicators (given that the project’s objectives were more time-bound than the
policy objectives of the NSF to which the Results Framework was linked); and (iii) develop a
sound M&E system. Overall, the quality at entry is assessed as “Moderately Satisfactory.’

2.2 Project Implementation
27.     From project inception in 2009 through closure in March 2015, the average rating for
implementation progress (IP) was “Moderately Satisfactory” in Implementation Status Reports
(ISRs). Challenges were faced at the start-up phase and at midterm (Table A10-7, Annex 10).

28.     Start-up Challenges. There was approximately one year between Approval (July, 2008)
and Effectiveness (June, 2009) as a result of a series of country-level delays, including the length
of the GoB’s Parliamentary review, and subsequent delays in addressing effectiveness
conditions12 due to general public sector challenges, as noted in the Country Partnership Strategy,
including HR issues (e.g. civil servant hiring freeze). In December 2009, the Implementation
Performance and a number of other performance sub-dimensions were downgraded by the Bank
to “Moderately Unsatisfactory” because a number of covenants were not met, and because of
limited staff capacity and lack of adequate progress with the M&E framework among other
issues. These delays and the downgrading triggered the need to develop 3-month and 6-month
Action Plans to remedy the identified causes of the delays. The implementation support action
plan was discussed with Sector and Country Management to ensure effective actions and traction
with the Borrower.

29.     Mid Term Review (MTR). The MTR (May 31 - June 12, 2011) took place 2 years into
implementation and was led by a senior Bank adviser. The MTR team conducted a systematic
stock taking of critical issues that had hindered project performance with the objective to
formulate recommendations to remedy the sluggish performance and to increase disbursements.
At the time of the MTR, only 14.4% of funds were disbursed. Despite the low disbursement,
prior to the MTR, the ratings for IP and all sub-dimensions and components, except for
Component 2, were ‘Satisfactory’ (January, 2011; ISR 5). The MTR was hindered by inadequate
internal preparation by NACA, specifically, by the absence of timely updates of agreed project
monitoring indicators. Given the data gaps, the EU’s mid-term assessment was done separately

                                                            
12
     E.g., hiring TAs for FM, procurement, and M&E; clearing audit backlogs; and conducting the social analysis.


                                                               9
during a mission in October 2011, which focused on validating project performance on the trigger
indicators for the IBRD buy-down. The EU confirmed the Bank’s finding regarding “the lack of
basic documentation and management information” that would enable the Project’s performance
assessment. Despite these challenges, based on the intermediate outcome indicators compiled for
the EU’s report, the assessment found that the level of target achievement was generally very
high (Conseil Sante, 2011). While the results related to CSO performance were somewhat lower,
most of the targets related to administrative and reporting aspects of the program were met or
surpassed as a result of the intensive support provided by BNAPS. The policy trigger for the first
tranche of the buy-down was the approval of the NSF II by the GoB, which was attained,
triggering full disbursement (€8 million, Quarter 4/2010).13

30.     The Bank’s MTR identified key implementation challenges as follows: (i) initial
unfamiliarity with IBRD procedures; (ii) high expectations in results and ambitious targets; (iii)
uneven coordination and management oversight by NACA; (iv) limited NACA HR skills in
behavioral science; (v) inadequate oversight of public sector work plans by some implementing
ministries, and often limited ownership of work plans, which yielded a “supply-driven” approach
and challenged the ambition of creating integrated, sustainable programs; and (vi) limited
familiarity with community-based Call for Proposals (CFP) financing mechanisms. While the
overall fiduciary performance of the CSO component improved, substantial additional support
was required on technical design, community-level monitoring, and the performance-based
approach. Further, there was no independent results verification carried out for the PBF. The
MTR also noted the challenges with the cultural context of high-risk sexual behavior.
Particularly, MCPs continued to pose an obstacle to accelerating progress in indicators driven by
behavioral dynamics and the social context. Indeed, despite the HIV/AIDS-related IEC efforts in
Botswana, even when knowledge improved, awareness did not necessarily translate into behavior
change.14

31.     The MTR acknowledged that most risks identified at appraisal materialized. In response
to these challenges, the MTR recommended that targeted and expeditious response was required
from the GoB, with support from the Bank team, to put BNAPS back on track. The MTR
proposed to: (i) revise the PDO to enable a more realistic focus; (ii) improve NACA’s capacity
to coordinate across components through a modified and strengthened TA team, and operational
research to strengthen the evidence base on prevention; (iii) focus on well-performing ministries
and prioritized interventions; and (iv) strengthen the CSO/PSO component by introducing multi-
year grants and providing strong technical and fiduciary TA to ensure the quality of prioritized
interventions. One limitation of the MTR was that although it identified ‘high expectations in
results and ambitious targets’ as a challenge, it did not include among its recommendations the
revision of targets and indicators in the Results Framework. The EU’s October 2011 assessment
mission agreed with the conclusion of the Bank’s MTR regarding the need to refocus the PDO.
Further, the EU recommended that the PDO revision should include the revision of the indicators
and targets, including better definition of some indicators and setting more realistic targets that
correspond to capacity. Last, it noted that progress in treatment was more robust and given that
behavioral change takes a long time, approaches must be urgently discussed and expectations
managed.

                                                            
13
  This is more than 50% of the total buy-down, in contrast with the plan for equal disbursements across tranches.
14
  The causal pathway between knowledge, behavior, and health outcomes is not straightforward. More evidence is
required on which behavior change interventions work and how through encouraging and testing innovative
approaches (see Annex 3). Although its impact has not been quantified, the success of the no-cost national treatment
program may have inadvertently created a sense of false security, undermining efforts that aim to change risky sexual
behavior. The related ‘moral hazard’ could worsen the fiscal space effect of the epidemic.   


                                                               10
32.     In response to MTR’s recommendations on NACA’s capacity and strengthening the
evidence base, BNAPS initiated the procurement of TA to strengthen NACA’s human resources
for the Project on FM, procurement, and behavior change. However, operational research on
prevention did not receive emphasis to inform implementation; for example, exploring which
interventions work under Components 2 and 3, what factors determine implementation progress,
and how to improve Project effectiveness and efficiency. Documentation of operational
experiences was not centralized, despite repeated recommendations, limiting the opportunity to
effectively share results and draw on lessons. To address the issue of prioritization, the project
correctly sharpened its focus by streamlining activities under Component 2 and focusing on better
performing ministries. Further, to improve performance under Component 3, BNAPS introduced
a multi-year grant window and invested in improving project management for grantees. However,
external results verification for the PBF was not implemented until the 2012-2013 cycle.

33.      Following the MTR, an Implementation Improvement Plan (through December 2011)
was put in place and the Level 1 restructuring was processed, which revised the PDO (see Section
1.3). This was a turning point of the project and marks the beginning of Phase 2 of BNAPS. After
this first restructuring, performance initially declined with the PDO and IP ratings downgraded
to “Moderately Unsatisfactory” in April 2012. However, by August 2012, both ratings were
upgraded to “Moderately Satisfactory” as a result of improved project management, which
gradually intensified activities under all components, and the streamlining of activities to
accelerate progress toward the PDO. BNAPS implementation was on an upward trajectory, as
witnessed by increased disbursements from April 2012 onwards.

34.      Regarding the IBRD buy-down, given the persistent challenges experienced with
reporting progress on trigger indicators (particularly updates from line ministries and reporting
on NACA’s capacity building) and accessing related data for performance assessment, the EU
applied a simplified evaluation framework. The disbursement for the second/final tranche was
based on 3 sub-indicators with equal weight: (i) satisfactory progress of NACA strengthening;
(ii) satisfactory progress of strengthening of key ministries’ ability to respond to HIV/AIDS; and
(iii) satisfactory progress of civil society interventions. As not all targets were met under
Component 1 and 2, the disbursement was partial, approximately 67% of the total tranche amount
(€4 million, 1/2013).15,16 Thus, the total IBRD buy-down disbursed by the EU during the first
and second tranches was €12 million, approximately 86% of the total possible buy-down funds.

35.    Overall, while implementation had significant shortcomings prior to the restructuring in
December 2011 (i.e., a ‘Negligible’ rating). Corrective actions following the MTR created the
environment for improved performance in the second half of project implementation (i.e., a
‘Substantial’ rating). All components and the majority of sub-dimensions sustained
“Satisfactory” ratings in ISRs and disbursement attained 100% by the project Closing Date.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
36.   Country M&E Context for HIV/AIDS. The Botswana HIV/AIDS Response Information
Management System (BHRIMS)17 is the national multi-sectoral response M&E system. At

                                                            
15
   The total for the second tranche was €6 million, of which €2 million was released for attaining the targets under
Component 3 and €1 million each for Components 1 and 2 for the partial achievement.
16
   CSO performance was difficult to assess, other than relying on the related IOs as the final close-out report for
CFP3 was not available for this ICR review.
17
   The information management was decentralized under BHRIMS to the district level under the DMSACs. The
DACs, who also serve as secretaries to the DMSACs, act as focal persons in data management at district level. The


                                                               11
assessment, data collection and reporting at national level was found to be advanced. However,
routine data for HIV/AIDS were collected and processed at different levels, making coordination
and data compilation by NACA a challenge. Monitoring of results at local level, as in most
countries, was less well established. Given that changes at community level are critical to alter
the course of the epidemic, improvements in the M&E framework and platform were required to
inform project-level, programmatic, and policy decisions.

37.      BNAPS M&E Objectives and Design by Component. Responding to the national need,
BNAPS was designed to support the strengthening of the M&E system, including at decentralized
levels. The Project’s M&E activities aimed to support: (i) the development of a single national
M&E system; (ii) a system for monitoring of community, district, and national activities (at the
national level and by enabling districts to monitor and improve performance); (iii) the
institutional, HR, and systems development aspects of M&E; and (iv) NACA’s role as the lead
coordinating agency for M&E activities related to HIV/AIDS between all agencies and donors.
Under each component there were shortcomings to address in order to attain an operational M&E
system. In order to improve performance monitoring under Component 1, additional HR in M&E,
a strengthened M&E framework, and a centralized data repository were suggested. Under
Component 2, improved M&E staffing and standardization of metrics/reporting across line
ministries were required. Under Component 3, an enhanced community-based M&E framework
was needed, which was particularly important given the PBF approach.

38.     Design of the Results Framework and Data Sources. The BNAPS’ Results Framework
(RF) was shaped by the Bank’s Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program’s (MAP) Global Results
Scorecard (GRS, 2006). While the MAP was recognized for its flexibility and learning by doing
approach, the GRS had acknowledged limitations, specifically some targets were ambitious and
broad. The 2007 restructuring of the MAP highlighted the need for customized, stronger and
functional M&E systems to demonstrate impact, and enable strategic management of the
epidemic and intense supervision to meet the complexity of national responses to HIV/AIDS.
Hence, the limitations of the GRS affected the RF of the BNAPS. Second, at the national level,
the Project’s RF was closely aligned with BHRIMS, the broader M&E system for HIV/AIDS
that supported the implementation of the NSF. The benefit of this close alignment was that it
ensured ownership and reduced reporting burden. Regarding the data sources for the RF: (i)
routine data was to flow from BHRIMS, with particular strengthening under Component 3 as it
did not have a CSO/PSO module; (ii) population level data (on prevalence and behavioral
change) was to be collected through BAIS; and (iii) efficiency was to be captured through
management systems relevant for Project activities.

39.      One limitation of the RF -- noted by both the QER Panel and the EU -- was that it did not
include enough project-specific SMART18 indicators, which could lead to implementation
challenges in results monitoring. It was noted that some of the PDO indicators were complex
(e.g., compound indicators with age groups for which data was not available) or inadequate (e.g.,
lack of gender breakdown), and that some of the IO indicators were not well defined. Despite the
importance of BCC activities carried out by CSOs to reduce risky sexual behavior, there was no
indicator to measure the coverage of such interventions, or the efficiency of outreaches. The
IBRD-buy down, which worked as output-based budget support, required improved monitoring
and reporting. Hence, the EU substantively contributed to the indicator development during its
appraisal (April-May, 2008), which were to be used to trigger the disbursement of funds related
                                                            
performance of BHRIMS was demonstrated. Yet, capacity constraints were noted in HR in M&E, and related IT
material and software, which delayed the creation of the electronic eBHRIMS. 
18
   SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-related.


                                                               12
to “Improved HIV/AIDS Prevention” (Indicator 8 of the EDF10). The indicators were largely
harmonized; out of the 13 IBRD buy-down trigger indicators, the BNAPS’ RF included 12 as
IOs, one in reduced form (IO2), and one was classified as a PDO indicator.

40.     Another limitation of the RF was that the indicators did not fully capture the PDO, and
focused more on inputs and outputs than on outcomes. Given the PBF platform and the efficiency
agenda, operational research with more specific and standardized measures of costs and effect
could have been considered to improve project monitoring. In addition to MAP’s learning-by-
doing approach, BNAPS could have benefited from a robust evaluation agenda. At the time, a
number of countries engaged in programmatic evaluation through (i) the HIV/AIDS Evaluation
Program of the Africa Impact Evaluation initiative, started in 2007 (later Development Impact
Evaluation Initiative - DIME); and (ii) the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF), which
launched IEs in 2008. While the latter focused on low-income countries and maternal and child
health (MCH) programs, there was an emerging wealth of technical resource base in evaluation
methodology and implementation to draw on to better inform programmatic and policy decisions.

41.      Implementation. The Project’s M&E performed weakly in the first three years due to
HR constraints. Hiring specialists for M&E, periodic understaffing, and HR planning for M&E
delayed defining and calibrating the project monitoring indicators that enable the quantification
of progress toward the PDO. Although the EU’s assessment mission (2008) contributed to the
development of the BNAPS’ RF, which helped project monitoring, there were delays in
developing the overall M&E Framework19 that covers all components in depth. Following the
initial sluggish performance, by January 2011 the M&E rating improved to “Satisfactory.” By
the MTR (May-June 2011), M&E capacity weakened again, especially with respect to support at
decentralized levels (Component 3). Delayed and limited M&E updates resulted in a downgrade
to “Moderately Unsatisfactory” in September 2011.

42.     The EU’s mid-term mission (October, 2011), which focused on assessing progress toward
the targets for the IBRD buy-down tranche disbursement, also assessed indicators quality. The
concerns related to the RF’s design continued during implementation. The EU’s BNAPS Project
MTR Performance report (December, 2011) noted that some of the IO indicators were general,
and the variable definitions and reporting were not standardized, undermining comparability and
defying robust assessment. For example, it was noted that IO1 did not define the type of audit
required (internal or external). IO2 (percentage of proposals originating from the CFP processed
within the standard timeframe) was a crude measure of effectiveness. Unlike the EU’s IBRD
buy-down trigger indicator for this dimension, the BNAPS’ version for this IO in the RF did not
take into account the rejection rate for CSOs applying for a CFPs, which was considerable at the
time of the MTR (63%). IO4 did not define the frequency or depth of independent results
verification during the project (it was defined as a binary ‘yes/no’ variable). IO6 did not probe
for the relevance and timeliness of line ministry HIV/AIDS policies; only for their existence.

43.      The MTR aimed to remedy the noted challenges by specific and time-bound HR
recommendations. As a result of hiring a Senior Community M&E specialist (end of 2011),
performance gradually improved. The Community M&E TA helped setup baseline indicators
and targets for the performance-based community grants, and addressed earlier data gaps. The
External Results Verification (ERV) Report (Euro Health Group, 2013), implemented in 9 health
districts, noted that indicator definition was an issue. There were a multiplicity of indicators at
service delivery points (e.g. different definitions, age groupings, or the number of exposures

                                                            
19
     The M&E Framework accessed by the ERV Team dates December 2012. Earlier versions were not obtained.


                                                               13
required to count as ‘target met’). Some indicators were simple, others were compound, leading
to challenges at reporting. The indicators were not defined to enable measuring the efficiency
and sustainability dimensions of the original PDO. However, acknowledging the progress made
over time, the ERV report assessed that the M&E Framework was comprehensive and useful for
all levels from December 2012. This valuation did not take into account the implications of the
change in the PDO during the level 1 restructuring (December 2011) and the related M&E needs,
such as greater emphasis on tracing preventive and innovative interventions.

44.     Following the MTR, the need for improving alignment between the project monitoring
indicators and the PDO was clear. In addition to the Bank’s MTR recommendations, the EU’s
MTR also underscored the importance of simplifying the PDO and revising the RF to make it
more realistic. Yet, despite the revised PDO (as of the December 2011) and the inclusion of the
integration agenda,20 the PDO indicators remained unchanged. As a result of persistent
challenges with obtaining information on the progress on trigger indicators, the EU applied a
simplified evaluation framework (see paragraph 34) to determine fund release for the
second/final tranche. During the ICR process, it became evident that the indicators in the project’s
RF were not effective at measuring the impact that project activities had on the PDO. In order to
more fully reflect project achievements, it was necessary to include additional indicators to
measure the Project’s effectiveness vis-à-vis the revised PDO and the effect of the integration
agenda, which became pronounced during Phase 2 of the BNAPS.

45.     Although the RF had deficiencies, due to the strengthened capacity and improved
processes, the M&E performance rating remained “Satisfactory” between August 2012 and the
final ISR in March 2015, indicating reliability in the quality and timeliness of reporting and
enhanced accountability.

46.      Utilization. The Botswana 2013 Global AIDS Response Report documents that the
broader health system M&E context in which the Project operated was difficult; characterized by
a (i) lack of a central HIV/AIDS database; (ii) lack of HR in M&E and understaffing at district
level; and (iii) fragmentation in the M&E platform. While M&E continues to be a system-wide
challenge, BNAPS unleashed a momentum to increase transparency and accountability between
the GoB and DPs, across the administrative levels,21 ministries,22 and between the GoB and the
CSOs/PSOs.23 Despite the project-specific performance fluctuations in M&E prior to the June
2011 MTR, BNAPS support to M&E triggered structural and system-level changes. BNAPS
served as a catalyst for strategic harmonization between the in- and outpatient health management
information system (HMIS) platforms (PIMS and IPMS)24 managed by the MOH,25 and
contributed to strengthening the M&E capacity of CSOs. BNAPS substantially contributed to
improving M&E at the lower levels using the PBF and decentralized platforms. BNAPS
strengthened NACA’s M&E capacity and coordinating role. However, the lack of a central
repository for data and survey results constrained the potential for evidence-based project and
policy management. The impact of BNAPS on the institutional and HR aspect of M&E are also

                                                            
20
   The shifting emphasis from the HIV/AIDS focus toward the integration agenda and system strengthening was
motivated by the growing pressure to address inefficiency within the sector (e.g., in the Botswana 2013 Global AIDS
Report (NACA, 2014) and the Investment Case (NACA, 2015).
21
   DACs, who serve as secretaries to the DMSACs, acted as focal persons in data management at district level.
22
   NACA received annual work plans and year-end reports from ministries; used as the basis for resource allocation.
23
   CFP, capacity assessment, baseline/close-out reports improved data and strengthened CSO M&E capacity.
24
   Patient Information Management System (PIMS II): decentralized patient-level data for outpatient care (280 HIV
outpatient sites in 2013). Integrated Patient Management System (IPMS): centralized patient-level data for inpatient
care (operational in 11 of the 28 referral and district hospitals in 2013, i.e., 75%) (NACA, 2014).

   Harmonization started in support of the integrated cervical cancer prevention program. 


                                                               14
less pronounced. For example, M&E staff attrition in line ministries, and challenges with
harmonizing reporting and M&E platforms attenuated progress. The Investment Case (NACA,
2015) identifies M&E as a strategic priority to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
national response to HIV/AIDS. The report notes that across all HIV programs, weaknesses in
data collection and M&E systems are major challenges to programmatic success. Shortages of
HR for data collection and the lack of integration of various data systems are noted as major
obstacles. With the ongoing institutional changes in the sector, it is important to draw on the
lessons from BNAPS on the M&E dimension and strengthen the achievements. M&E remains a
priority agenda beyond BNAPS. The Investment Case (NACA, 2015) argues for more resources
to M&E system strengthening on the grounds that without reliable data, program planning and
budgeting are not evidence-based.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
47.    Safeguards. The Project was classified as “Category C” for environmental screening
purposes, and hence no assessment was required. However, the Government’s national medical
waste management plan was included in the project file, as per agreement with the Bank’s Africa
Regional Safeguards unit.
Fiduciary Compliance
48.     Procurement. Procurement performance was affected by the slow start up of
implementation and initial delays with hiring of technical assistance. The initial post-
procurement assessment (October 2010) provided evidence of satisfactory performance.
However, by April 2012, procurement was downgraded to “Unsatisfactory.” Due to a vacuum
in TA in NACA, procurement stalled during an 8-month period (09/2011-05/2012). From May
2012, the new TA rapidly re-initiated procurement activity, with support and training from the
Bank's procurement specialist. The revised procurement plan (April 2012 - March 2013) was
cleared by the Bank. Most procurement activities in the revised plan remained on track, resulting
in an upgrade of the procurement rating to “Moderately Satisfactory” by August 2012.
Performance further improved with the recruitment of a second position, which improved
processing of tenders, leading to a “Satisfactory” rating in April 2013.

49.      Financial Management (FM). Given Botswana’s good performance on governance and
PFM platform, the FM risk was low. Initial supervisions noted no major deficiencies in FM and
rated it as “Satisfactory.” The PMU’s computerized accounting system performed well. Internal
controls were applied per the Operations Manual. There were no problems with flow of funds
and disbursements. Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were produced on a quarterly basis. By
September 2010, the project met all FM conditions, except for: (i) the office of the Auditor
General had not cleared all audit backlogs; and (ii) recruitment of finance staff in the public
sector. In June 2011, the MTR stated that the project’s FM arrangements26 were acceptable to the
Bank. The FM consultants ensured continued compliance with FM requirements. However, the
report noted challenges using the government accounting system (GABS) in supporting the
preparation of IFRs. Further, as the contracts for the FM TA were coming to an end,27 the report
emphasized the importance of the continuity of FM staff to maintain the adequacy of the FM of
the project, especially as it intended to expand its geographic scope in Phase II and under
Component 3. During CSO consultations for the MTR, representatives commended the NACA
TA team for the training on grants management, financial and procurement management, and
implementation support. Beyond the MTR, there was need for NACA to sustain performance in

                                                            
26
   E.g., recording transactions and balances, supporting the preparation of financial statements, safeguarding the
entity’s assets, and its being subject to auditing arrangements.
27
   Respectively, on 31 July 2011 and 30 September 2011. 


                                                               15
these areas. With the planned expansion, NACA management was advised to ensure that
technical and fiduciary support to Phase I and II health districts was in place. By April 2012, due
to reduced capacity in the FM unit, the FM performance declined. IFR submissions were delayed
and quality deteriorated. The audit report for the fiscal year ending in March 31, 201128 was
submitted five months late.29 In April 2012, FM performance was downgraded to “Moderately
Satisfactory.” By March 2013, the Bank expressed concerns on delays in disbursement and
reporting. To mitigate these, advanced disbursement was proposed to receive funds up to 6
months in advance to pay for eligible expenditures. To improve reporting, the second FM
specialist was to be assigned the responsibility of preparing the Bank reports. Given the noted
challenges, the “MS” rating remained for the duration of the project.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
50.     Sustainability. The project was designed as an integral part of NACA’s work program
and participating ministries’ and aimed to create a strengthened and sustainable30 platform for
multisectoral, coordinated, and broad-based HIV/AIDS prevention with the involvement of civil
society. Regarding institutional sustainability, at appraisal it was expected that the social,
sectoral, and community capacity aspects continue after project closure. Technical sustainability
was assumed given that BNAPS supported ‘proven’ interventions that had been documented to
be effective in other country settings, and by identifying and harnessing complementarities
between the public sector and CSOs/PSOs. Further, the PBF approach was to enhance technical
and allocative efficiency. As to financial sustainability, the economic analysis argued that
Botswana needed a balanced approach of prevention and treatment to ensure that HIV/AIDS
expenditures do not crowd out other budgetary priorities and endanger the fiscal position
achieved through prudent macroeconomic management. As one avenue, through efficiency
gains, the PBF approach was to contribute to improved fiscal space for health.
51.      Compared to expectations at appraisal, at closing, the sustainability assessment of the
BNAPS was mixed, showing successes and challenges. In terms of institutional sustainability,
there were challenges, as reflected in HR retention. The shadowing arrangement for staff capacity
building at NACA was not as effective as expected. Staff turnover challenged all three
components. However, there were some exceptions, such as the prisons project, managed by the
Ministry of Defence, Justice and Security (MDJS), which sustained the staff from BNAPS. The
MDJS ensured that the activities, with the requisite staffing needs, are sustained following
BNAPS. Another notable success was the effective utilization of districts (DAC/DMSAC) in the
context of the decentralized multisectoral management modality. More broadly, the recent
restructuring that has merged NACA into the MOH under the Department of AIDS and
Preventive Care raises questions and draws attention to important dimensions that need to be
carefully managed during the transition phase, which is expected to last for two years (see more
in paragraph 94). The financial sustainability aspect is difficult to assess due to data constraints.
As discussed, the first restructuring simplified the PDO on the grounds that it was difficult to
measure efficiency and sustainability effects during the Project’s timeline. There was lack of
clarity regarding these targets and the metrics to be used to quantify progress. Beyond BNAPS,
lack of micro data to assess efficiency and sustainability has been a limitation in the sector. The
micro data limitations were noted during the preparation of the Investment Case (NACA, 2015)31
                                                            
28
   This was aligned with the FY cycle of the GoB.
29
   The project was included under the internal audit of NACA for the first time for the FY ending in March 31, 2012. 
30
   E.g. through capacity building, under-study/twinning arrangements at various levels of the implementation.
31
   The report notes that without additional HIV/AIDS and health funding, the current levels of treatment will not be
sustainable Simulations show that filling the HIV/AIDS financing gap will require additional funds, which are
significant in relation to the health budget. Relative to the 2014/15 financial years, when the total health budget was
P5.69 billion, an increase of 10-20% will be required.


                                                               16
and by the Bank’s missions between 2014 and 2015, which focused on calibrating a sector
efficiency analysis to inform policymaking. Going forward, further explorations are required to
better understand the financial sustainability aspect of interventions to inform policy decisions.
52.     Continued World Bank Support. Building on the lessons from BNAPS, the Botswana
health team has continued engagement with the GoB on two tracks: (i) Bank-supported analytic
work to explore sector efficiency and related sustainability challenges with respect to health and
HIV/AIDS financing; and (ii) Bank-supported project on health systems strengthening, aligned
with the broader national agenda, currently under preparation for delivery in 2017.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
53.     Methodology. Per the Bank’s ICR Guidelines a split rating is applied to assess the
outcome of the BNAPS Project. The split rating is based on the weighted average of the Project’s
performance against disbursements before the change in the PDO (the period prior to the level 1
restructuring, 2009-2011) and following the PDO revision until project closure (2012-2015).
These periods are referred to as Phase 1 and Phase 2.
 
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

54.    The analysis below summarizes the relevance aspects across the two project phases,
including the relevance of objectives, design and implementation, as follows:

Relevance of Objectives
55.      Phase 1 (rating=High): The original PDO was aligned with the priorities of NSF I (2003-
2009), focusing on prevention, financing innovative and strategic prevention and mitigation
approaches, and strengthening the management and coordination of the national response. At the
regional and global levels, the PDO was relevant for the MDGs, the MAP for Africa, and the
UNAIDS’ “Three Ones Principle.”32 In a country of 2.15 million, where HIV/AIDS remains the
number one cause of mortality, with an estimated 319,750 HIV-infected people in 2013, of which
87.26% are on ARTs, and where the estimated number of new HIV infections was at 9,170 in
2013 (NACA, 2014), the relevance of HIV prevention and finding broad-based, innovative, cost-
effective, and sustainable ways to prevent HIV and reverse the epidemiological trend is
unquestionable. Beyond the sustained relevance of preventive efforts, the emphasis on mitigation
(e.g., education, livelihood training and employment) was also important as part of a structural
and long-term approach to responding to the epidemic. Lastly, the relevance of the PDO with
respect to efficiency and sustainability was fully recognized at the highest levels. As presented
earlier, the fiscal space implication of the epidemic became a concern of the MFDP. The observed
trend of reducing external resources for HIV/AIDS implies that more domestic funds would be
required to maintain treatment coverage, and that sustained commitments to fighting HIV could
increasingly displace other budget priorities and consume a progressively larger share of the
economy. Hence, the focus on efficiency and sustainability of HIV/AIDS financing captures
broader development priorities for which sector-level solutions are required. 
56.      Phase 2 (rating=Modest): The PDO was simplified to one broad objective: “to increase
access to prioritized prevention services that reduce the risk of HIV transmission.” While this
objective was relevant in general, the revised PDO did not fully capture the gradual shift in focus
observed during project implementation, consistent with the parallel move in Government
priorities. Starting around the MTR, the Project strategically adjusted to shifting policy needs by
incorporating the integration agenda with the objective to test and identify ways to improve the

     One national authority for HIV/AIDS, one strategic framework, and one M&E system.


                                                               17
effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery. While this shift was policy-relevant, progressive
in its direction, and contributed to setting the agenda for the sector more broadly, it was not
reflected in the PDO, nor in the RF, which made project performance assessment difficult. The
PDO was not effectively revised to be fully aligned with changing Government priorities or with
the planned project activities. Also, the financing context of HIV/AIDS programs during Phase
2 suggests that sustainability remained policy relevant, as testified by a number of reports. The
Botswana 2013 Global AIDS Response Report (NACA, 2014) lists decreased funding by DPs,
the financial sustainability of no-cost ART, and the financial implications of co-morbidities with
NCDs as top challenges. The Investment Case (NACA, 2015) projects that due to an increasing
share of patients on second and third-line treatment regimens, the annual estimates for treatment
costs per person are expected to increase by about 22% over a 15 year period, by 2030. While
policymaking increased emphasis on improving the efficiency of HIV/AIDS service delivery and
the sustainability of its financing, the revised PDO removed this focus. Therefore, while the
revision served to simplify the focus of the project, it actually did not capture the evolving needs
and priorities. Hence, the overall rating for relevance of the revised PDO is Modest.
Relevance of Design
57.     Phase 1 (rating=Modest). The design of the project was generally adequate in terms of
the nature and type of components and it attempted to bring in innovative instrument, including
the buy-down and the PBF. However, the design was overwhelmingly ambitious for a country
where the Bank did not have a presence and where this was a first health operation. Also, given
the capacity constraints in coordination and management, and the fact that there were a number
of weaknesses in the RF, as discussed above, the overall relevance of design is rated as Modest.

58.     Specifically, Component 1, BNAPS could have considered (i) supporting the
development of a more robust project management platform, particularly given that the Project
was a laboratory for PBF;33 and (ii) undertaking operational research to generate just-in-time
information for project implementation and more systematic evidence for policymaking,
particularly to inform prioritization decisions (e.g. which interventions to choose and scale up
given capacity and/or resource constraints).34 Under Component 2, enabling direct linkages
between line ministries and CSOs/PSOs for activities that required synchronized activities could
have been considered.35 Under Component 3, in line with the MAP’s learning-by-doing
approach, the PBF aspect of the design was evolving as the project matured.36 BNAPS could
have supported the development and piloting of essential PBF tools and processes to enable
informed scale-up. Lastly, regarding the RF, largely, the indicators were relevant but not
sufficiently tailored to trace progress for all aspects of the PDO, particularly for efficiency and
sustainability. Initially, the targets related to prevention were ambitious as the assessments did
not fully account for the complexity of sexual behavioral change.

59.     Phase 2 (rating=Substantial). Relevance of revised design took into account the
limitations raised during the MTR, which led to more focused geographic coverage; more
investment for priority combined preventive interventions rather than relying too heavily on
                                                            
33
   The system-wide challenges in information management affected BNAPS. Project management could have
benefited from a PBF project dashboard and a central repository of data/studies, as planned for at appraisal/MTR.
34
   The economic analysis in the PAD notes the limited understanding of flow of funds, unit costs, cost-effectiveness,
and effects. It refers to need for core diagnostics, operational research, or surveys to inform costs and effects. Yet,
such analytic efforts could not be supported given that capacity constraints required focus on implementation.
35
   Direct link was implemented later between the MOH and CSOs to coordinate supply and demand for SMC.
36
   E.g., the selection/qualification criteria was adjusted as more information was available from the first round of
CFP. Performance metrics and reporting were improved following hiring the Community-Based M&E TA, and the
release of the findings from the ERV (2012-13).


                                                               18
behavioral change; increasing access to prevention also through integrated care delivery and,
thereby, also improving efficiency; streamlining activities carried out by line ministries;37 and,
upgrading the tools and calibrating the processes for PBF for CSOs/PSOs. The technical edge of
BNAPS improved during Phase 2, as reflected in improved ownership by key line ministries
(e.g. MOH and MOESD). Sustainability planning, development of a centralized repository of
information for more effective coordination and project management, and limited analytical work
for evidence-based decisions remained the weak spots of the design.

Relevance of Implementation
60.     Phase 1 (rating=Modest). With respect to the instruments, both the IBRD buy-down and
the PBF were novel and were deemed as relevance instruments during preparation in order to
enhance performance. Specifically, the PBF was chosen to improve project management,
performance standards, and accountability, and the IBRD buy-down was meant to draw attention
to developing the monitoring framework for the trigger indicators. In addition, the conditionality
for the buy-down grant disbursement on attaining the agreed targets was also synergistic with the
PBF approach. However, because of the innovative nature of these instruments, this project may
not have been the right one to employ these. Rather, more time was likely needed to initiate the
HIV/AIDS operation and then introduce these on a pilot basis. This is particularly so because the
project was, as mentioned above, the first Bank-financed project in Botswana in over 20 years.
Therefore, more time would have been beneficial to calibrate the design features of these
instruments. For example, the PBF design could have been strengthened through pre-piloting
before the implementation was scaled up to the initial five districts. Likewise, for the IBRD buy-
down, while the instrument was aimed to help the Government reduce the cost of borrowing, it
required a well-functioning monitoring and evaluation system to be able to meet the triggers. As
has been discussed above, the EU had substantial issues in getting the relevant data from
Government and had issues with the measurability of the indicators. This led to the EU not being
able to fully disburse their buy-down. It is important to note that Phase 1 was essentially spent
on trying to figure out how to make these instrument work; while a noble task, this detracted
attention from the technical issues at hand.

61.     Phase 2 (rating=Substantial). During this phase, relevance of implementation
modalities began to make more sense. Both instruments, the IBRD buy-down and the PBF, were
now more advanced and could be used more effectively. Also, the initial focus on improving
capacity and coordination across the various agencies began to pay off. There was now sustained
capacity building at all levels: (i) between the Borrower and the Bank, (ii) the Government and
CSOs, (iii) NACA’s capacity to effectively manage the PBF. The project modality was an
effective way to foster stronger local presence. Lastly, and most importantly, Phase 2 allowed
for more focus on technical issues and allowed greater focus on M&E which also led to the ability
to measure and monitor project implementation as well as the National program.
62.     Based on the evidence and support available at the time of the design, and acknowledging
the proactive optimization efforts by the team, the proposed rating for Relevance is “Modest” for
Phase 1 and “Substantial” in Phase 2.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
63.     Ten PDO indicators are used to assess project efficacy, of which 6 are original PDO
indicators, 3 were added during the ICR review, and 1 is a reclassified IO. Project performance

                                                            
37
   The variation in the strength of the relationship between NACA and line ministries attenuated the Project’s impact.
This was due to different levels of ownership, commitment, and technical strength, as realized by the MTR.

is presented by phases, before and after the PDO revision (Phase 1 and 2).38 For the assessment,
the number of PDO indicators changes by phase as not all interventions were
applicable/measurable in both phases.39 Varying degrees of progress were made towards the
targets in the original and newly introduced PDO indicators (Table 1).
 In Phase 1, of the total of 8 indicators, two targets were surpassed (“S”: #5 and #9), 2 achieved
   (“A”: #6 and #8), 1 partially achieved (“PA”: #2), and 3 not achieved (“NA”: #1, #3, and #4).
   Based on the share of the total PDO indicators classified as ‘Surpassed, Attained, or Partially
   Attained’ relative to the total number of PDO indicators relevant for Phase 1 (5/8), 62.5% of
   the targets were met, which corresponds to a “Moderately Unsatisfactory” rating (Table 1).
 In Phase 2, of the total of 10 indicators, 4 targets were surpassed (“S”: #5, #7, #9, and IO12),
   2 were achieved (“A”: #6 and #8), 1 was partially achieved (“PA”: #2), and 3 were not achieved
   (“NA”: #1, #3, and #4). The 7/10 ratio translates into a 70% attainment outcome, which
   corresponds to a “Moderately Satisfactory” rating (Table 1).

64.    BNAPS collected routine data on 12 Intermediate Outcome (IOs) indicators, which were
important tracers for the PBF. In Phase 1, out of the 12 IOs, 8 achieved their targets and 4
exceeded their targets, which corresponds to a “Highly Satisfactory” rating. In Phase 2, the total
number of IOs is 11 because IO12 was reclassified during this ICR as PDO. This was motivated
by the importance of this indicator to trace progress by CSOs under the PBF, which is not
captured at all through the original PDOs. The rating for Phase 2 is also “Highly Satisfactory”.

    The split rating approach in this section is challenged by data limitations (e.g., BAIS only provides 2 data points)
and changes in data presentation of PDO and IO indicators before and after restructuring.

     The newly introduced PDO 7 is relevant for Phase 2 as the intervention that is traced by this indicator received
funding from 2012. Results for the IO 12, which is reclassified here as PDO given its importance to measure progress
under the PBF, were not available before the December 2011 restructuring, which marks the start of Phase 2. 


                                                                                  20
Phase 1 – Efficacy Assessment
65.     The original PDO focused on increasing the coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of
targeted HIV/AIDs interventions, particularly financing strategic and innovative prevention and
mitigation activities, and this was to be attained under NACA’s improved management and
coordination capacity. The attainment of these objectives is discussed below.
66.     Coverage. Geographically, as planned, the first phase of BNAPS covered 5 districts,
reaching approximately 58% of the Project’s target population, including the highest prevalence
areas. All original indicators entailed focus on coverage, although for different interventions,
including behavior change communication, biomedical interventions, and focused health
system/infrastructure strengthening. The indicators are knowledge of HIV transmission (PDO 1);
behavior change to alter risky sexual practices and related social norms (PDO 2 and 3); improved
biomedical interventions and increased supply side capacity, such as access to quality SMC, to
HAART compliant facilities (core indicator), and improved TB care, which is indirectly linked
to HIV through the integrated management of comorbidities (PDO 4, 5, and 6). The ICR
introduced 2 new indicators, which focus on knowledge of serostatus (PDO 8 and 9). The baseline
and end-line values for the PDO indicators, as well as other selected relevant statistics
(prevalence, incidence, knowledge and behavior) are presented in Table A10-8 in Annex 10.
Briefly, progress on the PDO indicators is as follows:
 PDO 1 (Not Achieved): IEC coverage increased substantially. Regarding efficiency, there
   were some results with much greater increase in knowledge than previously, although well
   below the target. The data shows slow progress on knowledge of HIV transmission and
   prevention. Between 2008 and 2013 (BAIS III and BAIS IV), with an increase of
   approximately 7 percentage points from 40 to 47%, more than half of the youth does not have
   adequate understanding of HIV/AIDS risk. While this indicates moderate effectiveness,
   relative to the flat trend between 2001 and 2008, BNAPS had an impact, as indicated by the
   higher rate of progress (19%, compared to 5.6% and 5% for the previous periods, which is
   approximately a 4-fold growth (Figure A10-4 Panel A, Annex 10). IEC activities under
   Component 2 and 3 (through mass media, school-based and youth education,
   community/social communication, and individual counseling) enabled this growth (see Top
   10 CSOs’ budget and activities in Table A1-1 and Box A1-1 of Annex 1, and the detailed
   activities by the public sector and CSOs/PSOs in Annex 2).
 PDO 2 (Partially Achieved): The abstinence and condom use targets for the 20-24 age group
   were attained. Yet, the trend is flat, measured against targets that merely sustain not improve
   performance. During and despite BNAPS and other interventions, condom use for the age
   group 15-19 regressed relative to their baseline values. The modest effectiveness is influenced
   by various factors. Apart from the knowledge issues, reports note condom programming40 and
   supply chain bottlenecks,41 which affect physical access to condoms. Further, improving
   condom use may be challenged by ‘behavioral disinhibition’ and/or ‘moral hazard.’ With
   respect to disinhibition, preventive interventions, such as SMC could cause men to abandon
   risk-management behaviors, such as condom use. Risky sexual behaviors may also be
   associated with ‘moral hazard,’ for example, when condom use is perceived to be less critical
   given the free access to treatment (ARVs). Hence, the modest effectiveness of BNAPS must
                                                            
40
   Approximately 20,000,000 male condoms were distributed from the CMS in 2009. Male condom distribution
increased to 22 million (2011). The total need was estimated to be around 33 million. In 2011, the CMS distributed
225,832, female condoms (about 1% of the male condoms).
41
   A comprehensive condom situational analysis and survey by CMS identified challenges in the condom logistics
system: (i) poor warehouse conditions; (ii) inadequate transportation; (iii) non-adherence to inventory control
systems; (iv) few logistics reporting tools at service delivery points (SDPs); (v) lack of central coordination; (vi)
limited logistics skills among healthcare workers; and (vii) limited educational materials on condoms at SDPs
(Badubi, Endailalu, and Shioso, 2012; USAID, 2013).


                                                               21
     be assessed against this context of system-level inhibiting factors. Unless supply chain and
     attitudes are addressed, IEC efforts to improve condom use cannot be fully harnessed.
    PDO 3 (Not Achieved): Despite the extensive IEC efforts by the public sector and the
     community-based platform, MCP outcomes regressed between base- and endline for both
     youth cohorts. This raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of IEC, and points to continued
     challenges with entrenched cultural and social norms with respect to sexual partnership, as
     well as gender aspects, including economic empowerment. BNAPS could have benefited from
     a stronger gender dimension to improve resource targeting and effectiveness. Without
     gradually addressing these structural issues, progress in MCP is expected to be slow.
    PDO 4 (Not Achieved): Although the SMC target was not met, BNAPS showed significant
     progress in this area, reaching a total of 150,136 men between 2012 and 2015, and an annual
     output of 32,527 circumcisions in the last year (Figure A10-3, Panel B). The initial slow uptake
     was caused by inadequate supply-demand coordination between the MOH and CSOs. When
     this was resolved, service delivery intensified, showing the potential of SMC – which is
     recognized as a highly effective prevention – going forward.
    PDO 5 (Surpassed): The increase in the number of HAART compliant health facilities from
     33 to 566 shows extensive expansion in service delivery capacity and indicates a substantial
     improvement in target population coverage and access to HIV prevention and treatment
     services. The magnitude of the expansion suggests that this intervention was highly effective.
     However, this measure is partial. The PDO’s definition is not sufficient to assess the
     effectiveness of this intervention as there is no data on how the HIV/AIDS-related service
     delivery volume changed as a results of operating more facilities.
    PDO 6 (Achieved): The TB treatment with DOTS target was met. Among the contributing
     factors to this are the improved service delivery infrastructure (PDO 5), training of MOH staff
     at the various levels on TB diagnosis and care management, and improved equipment, as
     discussed under PDO 742.
    PDO 8-9 (Achieved and Surpassed): These indicators are linked to voluntary counseling and
     testing (VCT), access to and coverage of which have improved during BNAPS under
     Component 2 and 3 (see Annex 2 and 3). While further improvements are necessary, BNAPS
     played a role in the observed improvement in testing rates and awareness of one’s serostatus.
67.   Based on these results, that 62.5% of the PDO indicators were met, and that some of the
PDO indicators are not defined adequately to assess effective coverage, the rating for the
coverage dimension is “Modest.”

68.     Efficiency and Sustainability of Targeted HIV/AIDS Interventions. The findings on
efficiency and sustainability are mixed and incomplete. The IO indicators that are related to
efficiency and sustainability focus on operational and procedural efficiency43 and not on the
technical efficiency of the interventions (i.e., the extent to which they achieved their main
intended end of reducing transmission). While the targets are met, these measures are limited;
they imply positive trends but do not allow quantifying efficiency gains and sustainability. As
discussed under the M&E section, the PDO indicators were not defined and selected to enable
measuring efficiency and sustainability. Notwithstanding, some progress on efficiency and
sustainability can be expected because of the results-oriented instruments, such as the IBRD buy-
down and the PBF. Phase 1 may also have contributed to improved allocative efficiency, based
on the expectation that more prevention would reduce the need for costly treatment (i.e. improved
allocative efficiency). However, neither the Project’s RF nor the broader monitoring efforts
                                                            
42
  PDO 7 is not presented hare as the funds for the TB intervention that it measured were focused during Phase 2.
43
   E.g., timely disbursement and data submission, transparent financial management, number of organizations
funded, share of organization funded that have reached targets, etc.


                                                               22
include an analytical plan for economic evaluation, which would collect effectiveness (e.g. cases
treated or averted) and cost data (i.e., unit and incremental cost) to assess efficiency and
sustainability based on evidence. There was no trend and counterfactual analysis (e.g., using
epidemiological monitoring and project data) to enable an economic assessment of project
performance over time, across intervention types, or implementers. This is an omission that has
affected and limited decision-making during and beyond BNAPS. Hence, the overall rating for
this dimension is “Negligible.”

69.     Strategic & Innovative Prevention and Mitigation. The results suggest that targets related
to inputs for prevention (e.g., PDO 5: HAART compliant facilities) and biomedical prevention
(e.g. PDO4: SMC) are relatively easier to attain (or manage their progress trajectories). On the
other hand, behavioral outcomes for youth cohorts have proven to be sticky and difficult to
influence (e.g. PDO 2 and 3, which measure abstinence, condom use, and MCP). At appraisal,
the PAD’s economic analysis noted three reasons for high HIV prevalence: MCP, lack of SMC,
and gender dynamics (Halperin, 2007), which can combine to produce a “lethal cocktail” that
may increase HIV transmission to 30-fold (Wilson, 2007). The modest progress in these areas
urges attention and encourages rethinking what interventions and strategies could be used to more
effectively address risky sexual behaviors. Further efforts in designing and testing interventions
are required to inform prioritization and scale-up decisions. While the policy ambition focused
on ‘zero infection’ by 2016, the experience from BNAPS suggests that aiming for incremental
changes is more realistic. Attaining prevention targets requires good data on where and how new
infections are occurring. Moreover, attaining targets through combination prevention (behavioral
and biomedical) may be more feasible, particularly in the short to medium term. Lastly, the
evidence on mitigation interventions is limited. BNAPS was effective in reaching some youth
target groups with life skills training. For example, under the MoLG-supported HIV education
for Vulnerable Children & Children in Difficult Circumstances, 3,200 children received yearly
HIV prevention life skills and 1,280 parents a year were trained on parental skills in psychosocial
support to children. Under the CSO component, annually 300 children benefited from youth
camps for life skills. Beyond these broad coverage measures, there is no evidence on the impact
of these interventions. Strategic multisectoral mitigation interventions (e.g., livelihood skills,
employment, etc.) and gender or poverty-based targeting (e.g. through conditional cash transfer
to single, deprived mothers, etc.) could make investments more strategic and effects more
pronounced. However, more evidence is required to support strategic decision making. The
overall performance of BNAPS on this dimension is Modest.”

70.     Coordination & Management Capacity. BNAPS’ support to NACA improved its
coordination and management capacity, albeit with the delays in TA and HR sustainability
limitations noted earlier. Institutionally, NACA had an uneven relationship with line ministries.
Coordination, ownership, performance heterogeneity, and staff turnover hindered project
outcomes. Yet, substantial progress was attained in capacity building, which laid the foundations
for a more effective and efficient operation during Phase 2. The CSO/PSO component was an
important extension to build a platform for the long-term response to the epidemic. The CSOs
showed agility in implementation and were open to learn and benefit from operating on a PBF
platform. NACA had a successful learning curve with the CSOs and the PBF approach to manage
grants. Notwithstanding the challenges and the overall low performance during Phase 1, the
Project’s impact on improving NACA’s capacity was “Substantial.”
71.    Based on the results attained under the specific project objectives, described above, the
rating for the Efficacy of Phase 1 is Modest.

Phase 2 – Efficacy Assessment
72.    The revised PDO focused on “access to prioritized prevention to reduce the risk of HIV
transmission.”
73.     Access. Access is closely related to the “coverage” dimension that appeared in the
original PDO. During the second phase, as a result of the geographic expansion relative to Phase
1, which covered 5 districts, BNAPS expanded coverage to the remaining target population
reaching a total of 11 districts in the nation, creating access to improved preventive and treatment
services for approximately 80% of the total population.
74.     Compared to Phase 1, effectiveness improved during Phase 2 due to the sharpened focus
on strategic interventions (e.g. improved SMC outcomes, and integrated care delivery), enhanced
targeting of project resources, and the improved efficiency of implementation (e.g., due to
streamlining Component 2 and strengthening PBF under Component 3). These changes led to
improved performance under each component and intensified progress towards the targets in
most areas. Progress on PDO indicators 1-6 and 8-9 are not discussed here for the sake of brevity.
The context is presented in the previous section. The trends are shown in the Data Sheet, as well
as in Table A10-8, Figure A10-3 and Figure A10-4 of Annex 10. Relative to Phase 1,
performance improved, even for some prevention interventions. For example, as a result of
strengthened supply-demand coordination between the MOH and CSOs, uptake for SMC
increased between 2012 and 2015. The acceleration during Phase 2 is partially the result of
creating the multi-year grant window following the MTR and strengthened processes to screen
and monitor CSOs. However, the improvements could not be translated into population level
outcomes collected through BAIS IV, which only captures trends until 2013 and not the Project’s
closure in 2015. Hence, it is possible that the behavioral effects are not fully recognized
(underestimated). To better capture BNAPS’ contribution during Phase 2, additional indicators
were included during the ICR. One is related to the integration agenda (PDO 7: TB diagnosis and
treatment). The other indicator is reclassified IO (IO 12, reclassified as PDO 10).
 PDO 7 (Surpassed): The ICR included this indicator on the grounds that integration is closely
   related to the efficiency and sustainability dimensions, two explicit objectives of the original
   PDO and broader sector objectives. TB case detection and treatment success rate have
   improved (relative to the baseline and regional benchmarks, respectively shown in Table A2-
   12 of Annex 2 and Table A3-6 of Annex 3) due to investments by BNAPS in HR (regional
   TB coordinators and laboratory staff training), procurement of laboratory technology
   (GeneXpert), infrastructure upgrade (TB isolation wards), and coordination and dissemination
   meetings. As noted earlier, this indicator is indirectly related to HIV prevention through
   integrated delivery of preventive activities and managing co-morbidities. Among tuberculosis
   patients registered in the TB program with known HIV status, the frequency of co-infection
   was recorded at 63% in 2012. Testing for HIV in TB infected patients increased to 87% in
   2012 from 68% reported in 2008. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for TB/HIV co-infected patients
   reached 90%. While ART coverage was reported at 65.2%, TB and HIV clinical care
   guidelines were aligned in 2012, making any TB/HIV co-infected patient eligible for life-long
   ART. The TB and HIV Policy Guidelines were completed in 2012.
 PDO 10 (Surpassed): This indicator, originally IO 12, measured the “percentage of
   organizations funded who reached the target specified in their proposal.” The ICR proposes
   this reclassification because of the importance of CSO performance under the PBF, which is
   not captured in the original PDOs. This indicator primarily gauges target met and less so
   efficiency because of the definition challenges noted related to IOs; specifically, that they
   focus more on outputs than outcomes, and the metrics were not standardized to allow for
   comparability across implementing CSOs.



                                                24
75.    Lastly, although efficiency and sustainability are not part of the revised PDO, the
contribution of BNAPS to these dimensions must be recognized because of their continued
importance on the health policy and development agendas. The efficiency gains generated during
Phase 2 through the strengthened PBF and the integration agenda represent important
contributions to the overall ambition of BNAPS in supporting the GoB (see more in the economic
analysis in Annex 3).
76.     As a result of increased access, the strategic refocusing, improved implementation, and
strengthened outcomes, the proposed rating for Efficacy in Phase 2 is Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency
77.     The PAD included an economic analysis,44 which provides a rich context and strong
economic arguments. The analysis primarily relies on a review of the literature and presents
secondary data to build the economic argument for the project. It does not include BNAPS-
specific calculations or estimates of net present value (NPV), economic rate of return (ERR), or
cost-effectiveness. Hence, it is not possible to directly compare such estimates and expectations
between the baseline and the endline (project closure) in this ICR. As in the preceding sections
that discuss project performance, efficiency is assessed by phases, before and after the PDO
revision. The assessment is guided by an updated review of the literature, which is required not
only because new evidence is available since appraisal, but primarily motivated by the fact that
the scope of BNAPS changed, including: (i) its geographic scope (scale back; see Section 1.6);
and (ii) the thematic scope (vertical to diagonal tendency through the integration agenda).
78.     Epidemiology. To contextualize the economic analysis, an overview of HIV
epidemiology before and after BNAPS is provided. With respect to final outcomes, a review and
analysis of BAIS data between 2004 and 2013 shows mixed results. Cohort specific prevalence
data from BAIS II (2004), BAIS III (2008), and BAIS IV (2012) suggests that survival improved
(especially among those age 35 and above) prior to 2008, before BNAPS (Figure A3-1). BAIS
III (2008) and BAIS IV (2013) data show that incidence marginally declined from 1.45 to 1.35
(0.1 over 5 years), which means that the epidemiological context for BNAPS was largely a
stabilized one, as a result of the intensive and effective treatment program from 2001. UNAIDS
cross-country data (Figure A3-2) corroborates this, showing that the largest drop in incidence is
prior to 2007. Because BAIS IV has not published age specific incidence estimates, there is no
firm conclusion about incidence reduction across the age groups to assess the effectiveness of
prevention strategies. Analysis of prevalence data of BAIS from 2004 to 2013 by age-cohorts
shows that prevention efforts for youth were largely ineffective since 2004. Since then, all three
of the youngest cohorts had doubled or tripled their HIV prevalence by 2013 (NACA, 2015).
Cohorts in the 15-19 and 20-24 year old age groups surpassed the national HIV prevalence at
18.5% in 2013.

79.      Given the under-resourced prevention context, although the financial contribution from
BNAPS was small as a share of the total NSFII budget (6.5%), it represented a significant share
of the resources that went toward prevention (65%) (Table A3-2). Overall, there is no strong
evidence on the impact of BNAPS through the behavioral channel. However, through some
targeted BCC interventions and the biomedical prevention interventions BNAPS played a role
in: (i) contributing to stabilizing the epidemic; and (ii) catalyzing system-level changes, required
to enable further/more sustainable gains in this area. The assessment of the interventions that
contributed to these outcomes are briefly discussed below (see Annex 3).

Economic Analysis.” 


                                                               25
   (1) Behavioral Interventions to Prevent HIV Transmission – Phase 1 & 2
80.     PDO-level outcomes on condom use and MCP suggest no improvement on these risky
behaviors, particularly for the 15-19 age group. Knowledge of sexual modes of HIV transmission
remains low, with little progress detected over time (Table A10-8, Annex 10). Despite improved
VCT coverage, further efforts are required to attain a higher coverage and ensure linkage to care.
Due to lack of data on program costs and the observed efficacy in terms of cases averted, it is not
possible to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of behavioral change approaches applied in
BNAPS. Since one objective of BNAPS was to support highly effective innovative preventive
approaches, data limitations affected prioritization and strategic decision making. The status of
these indicators and the data challenges motivate a “Negligible” rating for the efficiency of
behavior change interventions for both phases.
   (2) Biomedical Prevention of HIV Transmission through SMC – Phase 1 & 2
81.      In line with the ‘combination prevention’ method, BNAPS ramped up its prevention
efforts in Phase 2 by adding increased emphasis on SMC, leading to a total of 150,136 males
circumcised by March 2015 (i.e., 39% progress toward the target set by the end of the project).
Although the target was not attained, the coverage enabled by BNAPS is considerable; equivalent
to approximately 35% of the male population covered under BNAPS, and 18% of the total male
population. Although further efforts in demand generation are required to attain the coverage
target, the MOH has been strategic in its targeting (see Box A3-1) and the improved coordination
with CSOs has also contributed to improved efficiency. With regards to effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness, evidence from a randomized control trial in South Africa concludes that in settings
with high or moderate HIV prevalence among the general population, adult SMC is likely to be
a cost-effective HIV prevention strategy, even when it has a low coverage (see more in
paragraphs 135-137 and Box A3-1, Annex 3).

82.     These findings suggest that the increased emphasis on SMC under BNAPS was an
effective shift in the approach mix and led to improved outcomes in prevention. Given the slow
uptake of SMC during Phase 1, the efficiency of this intervention was “Negligible.” Following
improved effectiveness during Phase 2, the efficiency is rated as “Substantial,” particularly
taking into account long-term effects and secondary transmission to women.
   (3) Biomedical Intervention & Integration Agenda: TB-HIV/AIDS – Phase 1 & 2
83.    Apart from high efficacy, the estimates on economic returns indicate good value for
money. The rating on efficiency for Phase 1 is “Substantial” and “High” for Phase 2, during
which BNAPS-supported activities intensified and the integration agenda became more
pronounced.
   (4) Biomedical Intervention & Integration Agenda: Cervical Cancer-HIV – Phase 2
84.     Beyond the biomedical effects and the consequent economic effects, the cervical cancer
program served as a model and had a catalytic role in promoting and operationalizing the
integration agenda, leveraging the support of the MFDP (in the form of resource allocation to
EPI), which led to a national rollout of HPV. The efficiency rating for cervical cancer prevention
and integrated care delivery model is “High,”only applies to Phase 2 given its launch in 2012.
   (5) Broader Effects
85.    In addition to the disease-specific health and economic impact, BNAPS had broader
implication on the health system through catalyzing policy change and harmonization of the
Health Management Information System (HMIS). These broader implications underscore the
relevance and importance of BNAPS and justify a “Modest” rating for Phase 1, which provided
lessons and the context for project design revision, including system-level aspects, and a
“Substantial” rating for Phase 2, which prompted broader changes.

                                                26
Efficiency of Implementation and Overall Efficiency Rating
86.     The sluggish project start-up and initial low effectiveness indicates that the efficiency of
implementation was “Negligible” during Phase 1. Following the restructuring, the efficiency of
implementation significantly improved during Phase 2, including accelerated disbursements,
improved outcomes for the investment, which merits a “Substantial” rating. Given the evident
discontinuity in performance for the above discussed interventions before and after the December
2011 restructuring, the proposed overall rating for efficiency during Phase 1 is “Modest” and
for Phase 2 it is “Substantial.” Overall, while Phase 2 demonstrated good performance, the
development effectiveness potential of BNAPS was weakened by the low implementation
efficiency prior to the restructuring and the inadequate progress on the behavioral dimension.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87.     The proposed overall outcome rating for BNAPS is “Moderately Satisfactory.” The
table below summarizes the proposed ratings for each phase (before and after the level 1
restructuring in December 2011, which revised the PDO) and provides the calculation for the
overall outcome rating for BNAPS (Table 3). The numerical value is 4.23, which corresponds to
the final “MS” rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
88.      BNAPS is aligned with the GoB’s National Strategy for Poverty Reduction, which
emphasized the role of HIV/AIDS as both a cause and consequence of poverty and
unemployment. BNAPS aimed to contribute to breaking this vicious circle by targeting districts
that not only suffer from high HIV/AIDS prevalence but (given the high correlation) also show
high levels of poverty.45 Beyond the broad geographic targeting (focusing on high prevalence
districts/areas), BNAPS is expected to have a favorable poverty effect as a results of the age
cohorts (14-19 and 20-24) at its focus. Poverty in Botswana has a young face, with children less
than 15 years of age representing 46.2% of the poor in 2009/10 (World Bank, 2015). In Botswana,
poverty is found to be highly correlated with family size, which in turn, is correlated with HIV
prevalence.46

89.     Strong gender disparity in HIV prevalence appears throughout all age groups in BAIS IV
(2013). The overall HIV prevalence amongst women was 21% as compared to 14% among men.
The vulnerability of women is related to gender based violence and poverty. In 2012, the Gender
Based Violence Indicator Study reported that 67% of all women in Botswana had experienced
some form of gender related violence in their lifetimes, increasing the risk of HIV acquisition.
Poverty and power discrepancies in intimate relationships particularly drive women to expose
themselves to HIV and sexual violence. The 2011 ANC Sentinel Surveillance Survey showed
that 80% of all mothers were single, and 61% were unemployed with only 25% reporting full
time employment. Through its preventive interventions (e.g. BCC messages targeted at youth
women using the school-based platform under the MoESD and TEC, reinforced by CSOs;
communication via Women Sector Committees implemented under the MIST; and female
condom distribution managed by the MYSC, etc.; see Table A2-4, Table A2-8 and Table A2-9,
Annex 2) BNAPS’ support to vulnerable women has contributed to reducing the gender disparity.
As to the level of impact, given that gender-specific data collection was introduced in BAIS IV,
it is not feasible to compare results at base and endline. Going forward, to further deepen the
impact on vulnerable women, multisectoral mitigation interventions (e.g., livelihood skills,
employment, etc.) and gender or poverty-based targeting (e.g. through conditional cash transfer)
could be harnessed. The Bank’s Botswana portfolio is active in both education and social
protection. School-based interventions, targeted CCTs that reach vulnerable groups could
reinforce health-sector efforts.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
90.     BNAPS had substantial impact on institutional strengthening for NACA, including its
management capacity through improved tools and processes, and the application of the PBF
platform. Beyond strengthening the coordinating body, the Project had a broader effect on the
participating line ministries at the central and decentralized levels. While many of the changes
had catalytic effects, as discussed in Section 2.5 and Section 4, there are elements that face
sustainability risks. Post-completion operations and next steps could focus on consolidating
impact and minimizing institutional risk.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) N/A

                                                            
45
   The majority of the poor live in the South-East and North-East. Acute levels of poverty are found in more remote
areas, prominently in the far North-West (Ngamiland) and in the west and southwest. Pockets of very high poverty
are also found in the South-East, particularly in Kweneng and parts of the Central district (World Bank, 2015).
46
   Larger households with more children have higher poverty rates. Families with both parents have lower poverty
rates than single-parent families. With the world’s 2nd highest HIV/AIDS prevalence, there is a large number of
AIDS deaths and orphans, and a sizeable number of incomplete families, which are more likely to be poor.


                                                               28
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
91.     A BNAPS ICR Survey collected responses from representatives of the implementing
agencies to provide an opportunity to share their views regarding the relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability of the project. The survey was designed and collected through
Survey Monkey, and represented a small sample size (22% of 105 targeted individuals). The
distribution list for the participants was provided by NACA. The survey was not intended to be
a representative survey with full coverage, given the time and budget limitations to implement
the ICR. The objective of the survey was to offer an anonymous platform and an opportunity to
share views. This was considered important due to the large number of implementers, spread
across the country, and the multi-sectoral and decentralized implementation platform, which did
not enable consultations with all implementing agencies at the various levels for this ICR review.
The survey respondents had a largely favorable view of the BNAPS but noted some
implementation challenges. Regarding effectiveness, 75% of respondents expressed satisfaction
with reaching the agreed performance targets (see Annex 5 for more details).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
92.      Overall, the PAD’s risk assessment was somewhat optimistic. A number of the high risk
items materialized. The trend in the ratings indicates that although some of the risks were
underestimated, particularly with respect to implementation during Phase 1, progress was made
during Phase 2 (Table A10-6, Annex 10). Assuming that these improvements can be retained
and form a strong foundation for future undertakings, the risk rating would be “Moderate.”
However, to determine the final risk rating, two critical sustainability factors need to be taken
into account. Given the expectations that (i) financial sustainability and (ii) the fluidity of
institutional context could have significant bearing on the sustained and long-term development
effectiveness of the Project, the proposed rating for development risk is “Substantial.”
93.    Financial/Fiscal Sustainability. A number of documents and analyses (e.g., NDP11 and
the Investment Case by NACA, 2015) emphasize the sustainability aspect of the national
response. Addressing HIV/AIDS requires long-term financial commitments, at a time when tax
revenues are expected to be under pressure due to slowing economic growth and diminishing
fiscal contribution from diamond mining. Expectations of reduced donor funding and
diminishing domestic fiscal resources will lead to more intense competition between the various
claims on government spending, and hence prioritization becomes important. As a result of these
broader macroeconomic and financial trends, combined with the increasing costs47 of HIV/AIDS
programs, a financing gap will emerge over the period to 2030. The lower bound is estimated to
be approximately 500 million Pula (around 10% of the current health budget).48 To boost the
national response to HIV/AIDS in this context of increasing resource constraints, the strategic
investment areas have been identified.49 While there is a defined policy direction and a firm
commitment to finding more efficient ways to operate, during the implementation of BNAPS
there were some inefficiencies. The MOH and NACA both provided national funding to districts
                                                            
47
   The annual per person treatment costs at the end of 2014 were estimated at 4,320 Pula (US$480), expected to
increase to 5,400 Pula (US$600) by 2030 due to increasing patients on 2nd and 3rd-line regimens (NACA, 2015).
48
   1,000 million Pula is estimated annually to maintain current treatment eligibility and programs or the proposed
expanded ART access and improved HIV prevention scenarios. 
49
   The 2014 Investment Case prioritized the following five areas as critical to realizing efficiencies, improving
patients outcomes and ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of the HIV Response: (i) expanding HIV
prevention with focus on adolescent, youth and key populations; (ii) improving M&E (including procurement and
supply chain management); (iii) integrating health services to maintain clinical care excellence; (iv) expanding HIV
testing, tracking and engagement in care; and (v) Community System Strengthening within the National HIV
Response. BNAPS strategically contributed to these priority areas.  


                                                               29
for programming needs and research. DPs may provide funds directly to either or both
institutions. To ensure optimal use of resources, given the sustained multisectoral nature of the
challenge, coordination of responsibilities and activities and transparent budget planning
processes are important to avoid duplications, for example, by agreements on which institution
is to receive, allocate and monitor particular funding of the HIV response.
94.      Institutional Context and Sustainability. A critical factor that may affect the longevity
and sustainability of development effects is the fluidity of the institutional context, specifically
the possible effect of the ongoing institutional transformation within the health sector.  As the
national response has successfully managed the nation out of the “emergency response” mode --
particularly in terms of reduced mortality as a results of accessible and effective treatment -- the
power relationship between NACA and the MOH started to change. This was first marked by the
changes to the resource flow from 2010, the majority of which were channeled to the MOH
leaving a residue – although financially substantial but in relative terms a lighter share – for
NACA. The pressure for efficiency gains, partly through improved integration and coordination,
further accentuated this trend. In 2014, the MOH began the implementation of the national health
care system restructuring. Propelled by the efficiency agenda, a taskforce conducted a
rationalization exercise to inform the restructuring. The integration of NACA into the MOH, now
located in the Department of AIDS and Preventive Care, was recently confirmed (early 2016)
and the transition is projected to take place over 2 years. The institutional change was motivated
by the fact that NACA had fulfilled its mandate; the HIV/AIDS epidemic had been stabilized.
Setting up NACA as a standalone entity was justified at the time of its establishment given the
specific challenges facing the country then. As the MOH shifts toward a more integrated
approach, bringing the institution under the MOH can be justified. However, there are concerns
regarding the institutional transformation which can pose a threat to sustaining progress and thus,
require attention as part of the change management strategy. First, the consolidation of the
organizational structure and the transition management of NACA staff are critical. The
government has committed to addressing the issue of duplication of roles. Further, strategic
relocation would need to ensure the transfer of skills that had been built under Component 1 to
benefit future HIV/AIDS programs. Second, while NACA was acknowledged for its
responsiveness, ministries, in general, are known to be slower. The reorganization provides an
opportunity to ensure that agility continues to be embraced. Third, the dissolution of NACA has
raised questions regarding the coordination of the multisectoral response. Although the MOH has
considerable comparative advantage in sector-level coordination and integration, the importance
of cross-sectoral coordination cannot be underestimated, nor the necessity to connect to the
district level multisectoral platform. HIV/AIDS remains a multisectoral challenge and, hence,
attaining and sustaining development objectives can only be guaranteed on such a platform. The
absence of a clear institutional link between a well-functioning and integrated health care
platform and the multi-sectoral platform for HIV/AIDS response could jeopardize gains and lead
to increased costs, including through the pathway of transaction costs, delayed or inadequate
response. Given these arguments, it was raised that the integration of NACA into the MOH
should be done in a way that contributes to health system strengthening; yet without losing sight
of critical multisectoral contributors to HIV/AIDS outcomes, such as education interventions and
efforts at the grassroots through CSOs, both of which performed well under BNAPS. Lastly,
CSOs expressed reservations regarding the change and noted the lack of formal communication
on the integration, as well as funding challenges. The reorganization offers an entry point for the
MOH to take on the engagement model with civil society. However, this requires continued
resource flows to support such engagement, which could be considered during the budgeting
process. The reorganization creates a strategic opening to address these issues to ensure an
environment for continued progress in responding to HIV/AIDS.

95.     In sum, despite the operational and institutional challenges, BNAPS has left an important
mark on HIV/AIDS control, as well as on the health sector. With respect to the sustainability of
outcomes, BNAPS demonstrated its relevance and showed its potential in effectiveness.
Although the restructuring created space for significant economic impact; the full benefits of the
interventions are yet to be seen given the long-term impact trajectories of some of the
interventions supported by the project (e.g. behavior change, care integration, and cervical cancer
screening). Regarding financial sustainability, the results-oriented PBF and IBRD buy-down
instruments catalyzed more efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, the buy-down – which
leveraged additional resources from the EU – directly contributed to financial sustainability by
lowering the cost of the IBRD loan. Lastly, BNAPS created a robust implementation platform
for future engagements, including through the performance-based management platform used
with implementers in the public sector and civil society. Building on this strong foundation, it is
expected that the take-off for future operations would be significantly shorter, which would
further improve development effectiveness and efficiency (i.e., value-for-money) ratings.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
96.     As the first project in the Bank’s Botswana portfolio and because of the IBRD buy-down
innovation, BNAPS was a flagship project. The Bank closely worked with the Government to
prepare a highly relevant operation. Project preparation was effective with respect to assessing
the context and developing a design through a participatory approach that would contribute to
strengthening management and coordination capacity of the national response. Given the
unfamiliarity of the GoB with Bank operations and procedures at the time and the novelty of the
financing instruments, capacity building was central to BNAPS success. The design was
improved through QER recommendations.
97.     The PAD was evidence-based and in-depth, reflecting robust technical capacity and
pragmatism. However, there were some shortcomings, which – in retrospect – could have raised
early warning flags. Despite the ‘emergency’ modality, the preparatory time (between Concept
Review and Appraisal) was 17 months, followed by a 3-month period from Appraisal to
Approval. While the project was assessed as ‘ready’ for implementation at approval, the long
take-off path indicated otherwise. The pressure created by the context – that this was a debut
operation with Botswana and for the sector, the GoB was in an ‘emergency mode’ with respect
to the national response, and the IBRD buy-down was a novel mechanism – hurried readiness.
Readiness was affected by higher level systemic and structural impediments to effectiveness.
Notwithstanding, BNAPS could have benefited from developing a sharper and more realistic
PDO, a robust and timely RF, and laying out the details of the operational design and requisite
implementation aspects for key performance drivers (e.g. PBF) to manage the components more
effectively and efficiently from the start.

98.     Lastly, although capacity constraints urged the team to prioritize, BNAPS may have
benefited from an evaluation component as an integral part of the Project (or through
complementary ASA)50 to reinforce the importance of data management and utilization to inform
design and implementation, as well as to improve accountability and boost the establishment of
an evidence- and performance-based culture.

                                                            
50
   The QER recommended that BNAPS could integrate the findings of the economic analysis into the project,
including a robust agenda of economic and sector work (e.g., resource tracking, cost-effectiveness analysis, and IE).


                                                               31
99.    Overall, the Bank and the GoB designed an innovative project to respond to the situation
in Botswana. Based on these strengths and limitations, the proposed rating for quality at entry is
“Moderately Satisfactory.”
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
100. Throughout supervision, the Bank team was proactive in identifying bottlenecks and
proposing/finding pragmatic solutions. Given that the Bank did not have an active portfolio in
the country and had not been active in Botswana for 20 years, the team dedicated a great deal of
time to thoroughly explore the country and sector context to build the foundations for a solid
relationship. BNAPS was formative in its relationship building as it laid the foundations for the
engagement between Botswana and the Bank more broadly.51
101. The missions were focused and systematic in their approach to understanding the
strength, weaknesses, threats and opportunities. The project design and Year One plans suggest
enthusiasm, ambition, and dedication. Following effectiveness, the team focused on the most
critical sources of delays, such as issues related to the hiring of the requisite TAs, fine-tuning the
M&E framework, and meeting the legal and technical conditions that were set to commence and
intensify project disbursement. The ISRs were focused and reflected the nature of challenges
accurately and in a problem-solving manner, including constructive comments from Bank Sector
Management. The ISRs’ PDO ratings could have been more consistently assessed throughout
project implementation as some of the ratings were not warranted based on the outcomes at the
time. This would have required that the December 2011 restructuring involved a revision to the
RF to introduce relevant new indicators to better link activities to outcomes. The Aide Memoires
from the missions were well-written and actionable. The Bank team closely monitored activities
and held frequent (weekly) teleconferences to engage in status updates. The team proactively
responded to TA needs, including preparing frameworks, drafting TORs, and other documents
that facilitated project management in a practical manner.
102. The team prepared an excellent MTR Issues Paper, which guided discussions during the
MTR mission and the subsequent the Level-1 restructuring. While the restructuring led to greater
absorptive capacity and improved results on the ground, it failed to align the PDO with the
activities that received increased emphasis and the revised PDO lacked specificity. Despite the
MTR’s and EU’s recommendations, the restructuring did introduce updated indicators of
progress in the RF. Further, strengthened evidence-based for strategic decision-making was also
lacking. In retrospect, it may have been worthwhile for the team to explore the feasibility and
benefit of revision to the indicators and strengthening the evaluation agenda to better inform
implementation, scale up and resource allocation decisions. Overall, the correction path between
the MTR’s findings and the level one restructuring took half a year, which delayed refocusing
resources and accelerating progress.

103. The Borrower’s feedback on the TA from the Bank was positive. However, there were
concerns regarding processes, specifically delays with “No Objections” for procurements due to
the Bank’s arduous procurement requirements. The Bank had a number of quality enhancing
recommendations for the CSO component, including the condition to contract a firm to
implement external results verification to assess the effectiveness of the performance-based
mechanism and, in general, accountability, measured through the frequency and accuracy of data
flows on expenditures and outputs/outcomes. The TA that was provided to CSOs on
management, hiring the community-based M&E expert for the CSO/PSO component, and other
                                                            
51
   WB Gaborone Office did not exist until the third year of project implementation and the first Country Partnership
Strategy was presented to Board after the BNAPS Project was presented to the Board. 


                                                               32
recommendations contributed to the timeliness and quality of implementation. As a result of the
hands-on Bank support, by December 2013, implementation of project activities intensified,
reaching a total disbursement of US$35 million. Performance was turned around from ‘low’ to
‘satisfactory’ and was maintained throughout. The Bank team watched out for occasional red
flags, such as delays with audit and deterioration in the quality of financial reports, to sustain
performance. The Government’s request (July 2013) for a Closing Date extension and Loan
expenditure category reallocation was approved, giving BNAPS another year to complete the
cycle and meet the PDO by September 2014.
104. The Bank team offered a number of practical tools (e.g., Gantt charts for project
management) and had good recommendations to facilitate data flows, including the creation of a
central data repository. Yet, due to capacity constraints and consequent prioritization pressures,
the project could not fully harness the potential of data that could have accrued to BNAPS and
the Government.
105. The Bank had a catalytic effect on broader outcomes, such as the integration agenda and
HMIS harmonization. Further, with respect to client engagement, the Bank team built strong
links and established good rapport with the Government. While during the implementation stage
communication was frequent and effective, local presence of Bank staff in Botswana would have
better facilitated project start-up, monitoring, and daily coordination (there was not a Bank office
in Botswana at the time the project was designed and approved). Lastly, while the Bank team
pursued the possibility of extending BNAPS through an AF mechanism to further strengthen
well-performing initiatives supported by the project, this did not materialize.

106. In sum, although the corrective actions came with a delay, the successes during Phase 2
demonstrate the adaptability of the Bank team to address challenges in a practical and
performance-oriented manner and their openness to policy-relevant changes to implement a
complex and innovative operation. BNAPS fully disbursed and delivered more on a number of
programmatic activities relative to the commitments outlined in the PAD, thereby generating
additional benefits that were originally not foreseen. Thus, the proposed rating for the World
Bank supervision is “Moderately Satisfactory.”
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
107. The combined rating for the Bank, based on its performance on quality at entry and
implementation supervision is “Moderately Satisfactory.”
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
108. The GoB requested the BNAPS Project – a proposed concessional IBRD operation – in
anticipation that the financial and technical resources mobilized through the World Bank would
play a strategically significant role in supporting a more evidence-based response to the national
prevention program. The Government, particularly NACA, the MOH, and the MFDP have been
vital in shaping the content and design of BNAPS and the related processes to activate the loan.
Although the GoB in general was committed and supportive to combating HIV/AIDS, as a means
to improve health and economic outcomes, there were bottlenecks that contributed to the initial
delays and the challenges during implementation. These were related to broader political
processes (e.g., delayed Parliamentary approval) and structural issues (e.g., labor market context
and HR constraints that arose from the hiring freeze of civil servants). Notwithstanding these
shortcomings, BNAPS was moderately successfully delivered with important development
impact, which span beyond its project horizon. Full disbursement was possible thanks to the two

                                                33
closing date extensions, requested by the GoB, which demonstrated the Borrower’s commitment
and interest in the operation to harness its development potential.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
109. BNAPS had a complex implementation platform, with one primary implementing agency
(NACA); seven line ministries and the Tertiary Education Council under the public sector
component (Component 3); and 54 CSOs and private sector entities under Component 2. The
rating is a composite, which reflects the effectiveness of NACA as the coordinator and also the
dynamics with line ministries and the CSOs/PS.

110. The Government was open regarding the institutional limitations of NACA. This
proactive self-critical assessment laid the foundations to design Component 1 of BNAPS, which
focused on improving NACA’s management and coordination capacity. A core recommendation
and condition for the success of the project (provision of adequate HR to manage the project and
to build capacity in the agency beyond BNAPS) was not met in a timely manner because of a
combination of broader HR challenges beyond NACA – as discussed above – and HR planning,
which led to implementation delays. TA quality standards at times were not met. The twinning
arrangement, which was to attain longer term capacity building, did not materialize for the
reasons discussed in the section on design (Section 3.1). Beyond periodic short-staffing on FM,
M&E, procurement, and behavioral science, NACA management changed twice during the
project, which caused discontinuity in approaches and implementation.

111. Institutionally, NACA had an uneven relationship with line ministries, as noted in the
External Results Verification (ERV) report, which can be seen in lack of a standardized results
monitoring framework and irregular reporting. The slow takeoff was driven by inadequate
ownership (i.e., variability in the level of interest and commitment). Additionally, heterogeneity
in the technical capacity of focal points, and the rate of attrition of BNAPS-affiliated staff
contributed to differentials in outcomes. The intensity of implementation varied by component
and increased in the later years of implementation. Performance-based reallocations within and
across ministries aimed to contribute to optimizing resource use. However, the lack of consistent
reporting and metrics made reallocation processes difficult. Lastly, despite the ambition of
sustainability, BNAPS supported programs/positons that faced the risk of discontinuation, except
for a few notable success stories, such as the national rollout of the HPV Vaccine on the EPI
platform funded by the MFDP, or the prisons program that was scaled up and incorporated into
core work plan of the MoDJS, including its HR and budget requirements. Other line ministries
noted reassignment or loss of personnel. In sum, coordination, ownership, performance
heterogeneity, and sustainability challenges were noted. However, the nature of these challenges
suggests that NACA’s performance was intertwined with the broader public sector performance
context, and affected by economy or sector-level structural rigidities.

112. The civil society component was an important extension to build a platform for the long-
term and sustainable response to the epidemic. The CSOs showed agility in implementation and
were open to learn and benefit from operating on a PBF platform. NACA had a successful
learning curve with the CSOs and the performance-based financing approach to manage grants.
The management TA provided by NACA to CSOs was highly valued and served as an incubator
for CSOs. Under BNAPS, CSOs gained considerable training in technical aspects related to
designing HIV prevention interventions. There were shortcomings, however. While, in general,
it was noted that while BNAPS had a strong impact on CSOs, they noted that there was limited
involvement of umbrella organizations to more effectively manage the broad-based platform,


                                               34
ensure standards, and represent interests.52 Notwithstanding the sustainability challenges, which
were also noted in the public sector, the engagement with civil society was ground breaking,
including the scaled application of PBF, which introduced improved management and
strengthened accountability.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
113. Overall, the GoB demonstrated openness to innovation and strategic shifts and
implemented a complex operation which has long-term potentials, including through the
engagement with civil society and the private sector. The proposed performance rating for the
Borrower is “Moderately Satisfactory.”

6. Lessons Learned
114. The following lessons are drawn from the preparation and implementation of BNAPS.

115. The importance of intensive supervision in a country with limited prior WBG
operational engagement and where there is no local staff must be underscored. Following a
challenging early implementation period, the Project moved out of ‘problem’ status as a result of
the Team’s intensive implementation support strategy, key elements of which were: (i) just-in-
time/additional missions to support implementation, in combination with regular supervision
missions; (ii) frequent, problem-solving oriented engagement with GoB counterparts; and, (iii)
following the MTR, close joint tracking of implementation progress with counterparts, using the
improved Project management tools and External Results Verification to strengthen the
robustness and reliability of self-reported data.

116. Innovative financing approaches require close coordination with the Client and co-
financiers, they can involve a trade-off, and require focus on results. The BNAPS team
worked closely with the GoB and the EU to introduce the IBRD-buy-down innovation, agree on
a monitoring framework and triggers for disbursement, and in monitoring the targets. Hence,
beyond the financial benefits the buy-down also contributed to results monitoring. However, the
project also shown that coordination requires substantial time and effort, particularly when novel
instruments are introduced. When project preparation is urgent, project teams must assess the
trade-off between being innovative and being timely.

117. Operations of this scale and with a number of innovative interventions should
incorporate a robust evaluation agenda to better inform design, course correction, and
scale-up decisions in a timely and operationally relevant manner. As the economic analysis
illustrates, it was difficult to estimate effects and, particularly, efficiency, which are critical for
resource allocation decisions and policy formulation.

118. Slow progress in behavioral prevention questions the efficacy and targeting of BCC
intervention, and it may be an unexpected adverse side effect of Botswana’s exemplary
success in treatment. As sexual behavior is difficult to change, first, it is important to carefully
choose and target preventive interventions. Second, investing in structural approaches remain
critical to address the root causes of HIV transmission, in coordination with other line ministries,
to attain medium to long-run disease control and development targets. The Bank’s Botswana
portfolio is engaged in the social protection and education sectors. Targeted CCTs that reach


                                                            
52
     Umbrella organizations did not play a major role in BNAPS given the results from capacity assessment. 


                                                               35
vulnerable groups (e.g., gender-based targeting) and school-based interventions with proven
efficacy could further reinforce health-sector efforts.

119. In order to prioritize and concentrate allocations on cost-effective interventions for
HIV prevention, it is critical to collect data. Data scarcity or inadequate use of data
undermines strategic change and innovation. Given the multiplicity of interventions that may
not lead to expected changes in behavior required to arrest the spread of the HIV, as argued
above, more focus on interventions with proven effectiveness and cost-effectiveness would
ensure improved allocative efficiency and resource use and, therefore, contribute to the
sustainability agenda. The importance of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness criteria for
intervention rollout and resource allocation decisions underscores the relevance and role of
further data and evidence generation (economic evaluation) when testing alternative prevention
and service delivery modalities. For evaluation, a key condition is good M&E design that
provides data on a routine basis for rapid assessment and action.

120. Through the integration pilots, BNAPS illustrates that there is added value in
capitalizing on the shared challenges, drivers, and potential solutions across the different
disease categories (CDs and NCDs), with broader health-systems strengthening measures
and outcomes. The key lesson from the TB and HIV/AIDS and cervical cancer and HIV/AIDS
integration pilots is that given resource constraints and some shared determinants, there is scope
for an integrated approach, focusing on functions (prevention, treatment, and care) rather than on
disease categories. The experience with the integration of cervical cancer control within the
HIV/AIDS service delivery platform illustrates the opportunities and feasibility to integrate NCD
prevention and treatment into existing services and programs for CDs. There are not only many
links between these diseases, but shared underlying social conditions, interacting co-morbidities,
as well as common solutions such as vaccination, standardized syndromic protocols, and care
models. In resource-limited countries, leveraging existing HIV/AIDS platforms and investments
to expand services for other priority, and often unmet health needs, is doable and necessary to
maximize the utilization of existing resources and improve the effectiveness of service delivery.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

    (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

121. The Government of Botswana provided specific comments on the ICR draft which are
summarized in Annex 7. The comments that were received from the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning were addressed. Two out of the three comments received from the
Ministry of Health were also addressed (comments 1 and 3). The comment regarding the HAART
indicator is noted. However, this remained unchanged since this is how Indicator 5 appeared in
the Results Framework of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and traced and reported on
during the project cycle. The NACA endorsed the content of the report.

    (b) Co-financiers

122. The EU Delegation to Botswana reviewed the draft ICR and provided important
information for this ICR Report as well as valuable exchanges that enabled the World Bank team
to reflect the EU’s view, particularly with respect to the IBRD buy-down.

       years of experience in the use of media in HIV prevention and behavioral change through radio serial
       drama. They used TV drama to communicate HIV prevention messages and published teen

       potential to reach the entire country.

    2. DeeZone, South East (Abstinence, Condom, MCP & SMC). DeeZone developed docu-drama TV
       series. The comparative advantage of DeeZone was of the viewership of the entire country. Their

    3. Humana People to People, Selebi-Phikwe (Abstinence, Condom, MCP & SMC). Humana had
       extensive experience in community mobilization using the house to house campaigns. The same

    4. BBCA, Palapye (Abstinence, Condom, MCP & SMC). BBCA mobilized the private sector in
       Botswana to mainstream HIV/ AIDS in the work place. They targeted two important districts
       (Palapye and Francistown) which had seen rapid population expansion because of industrialization.

    5. African Methodist Episcopal Services Trust (AMEST), South East (Abstinence & MCP).
       AMEST mobilized communities to address MCP and targeted local schools in South East for
       abstinence. They have over the years developed and harnessed effective methodologies relevant for
       the local communities.

    6. Botswana Council of Churches (BCC), Palapye (Abstinence & MCP). BCC brought the faith
       based element into BNAPS. They had a very large membership of churches around the country
       including in BNAPS districts. They explored the same to reach their membership in Palapye with
       abstinence and MCP with over 50 churches reached.

    7. Tse Dikgolo, Kweneng East (Abstinence & MCP). Tse Dikgolo used theatre and follow-up
       reinforcement activities in Mankgodi. Their strength was Community Theater for behavior change.

    8. Botswana Baylor Children's Clinical Centre of Excellence, Goodhope (Abstinence, Condom &
       MCP). Teen Club targeted unique and sensitive sub-group-HIV positive adolescents with abstinence
       and MCP messages. The only group with a sustainable intervention for the vertical transmission of
       HIV among youth. Baylor also implemented the in- and out-reach program, with a focus on
       improving adherence in homes and enhancing the capacity of medical practitioners in hospitals on
       HIV.

    9.    Otse Home Based Care, South East (Abstinence & MCP). Otse HBC had experience in palliative
         care. They integrated HIV prevention to their program. The organization boasts of highly qualified
         and experienced staff, Peer Educators who were equally highly trained and experienced in
         community mobilization as well as a good working partnership with the local community built over
         the years.

    10. Stepping Stones International, Goodhope (Abstinence, Condom, MCP & SMC). SSI’s strength
        was life skills building amongst in-school youth who reached out to their peers. They used innovative
        strategies (‘aunties’ and ‘uncles’) who are not paid; potentially sustainable beyond BNAPS funding.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
121. Section 3.2 rated BNAPS with respect to efficacy, based on how it performed on the PDO
indicators. Beyond effectiveness, the development impact of the project depends on efficiency,
which requires an assessment whether the resources were used to invest in interventions with
positive economic returns, and whether the allocations were optimal. Efficiency is important
because of its positive association with sustainability.

122. Subject to data limitations, this Annex explores the efficiency dimension and summarizes
the key findings of the economic analysis related to the behavioral and biomedical interventions
supported by BNAPS, the integrated care delivery models tested, and the broader effects. As in
the preceding sections that discuss project performance, efficiency is assessed by phases, before
and after the PDO revision. The presented economic analysis covers BNAPS-specific
observations based on the available data and documents. Where data is not available/sufficient,
the assessment is guided by an updated review of the literature, which is required not only
because new evidence is available since appraisal, but primarily motivated by the fact that the
scope of BNAPS considerably changed, including: (i) its geographic scope (scale back); and (ii)
the thematic scope (vertical to diagonal tendency through the integration agenda).

123. To rate efficiency, the review is organized around the key outcomes of BNAPS, classified
into the following main groups (see Table A3-1):54,55 (1) behavioral interventions to prevent
HIV transmission (HIV education and communication, counselling) delivered through school-
based platforms, including the primary, vocational, and tertiary levels, as well as life skills, and
via mass media campaigns, communities, or phone; (2) biomedical interventions, with a focus
on HIV prevention through SMC; (3-4) biomedical interventions that ride on the integration
agenda (TB-HIV/AIDS care integration and cervical cancer (CC) and HIV/AIDS care
integration); and last, (5) broader effects on the health system, health policy, institutional change,
and sustainability.

124. Epidemiology. To contextualize the economic analysis, an overview of HIV
epidemiology before and after BNAPS is provided.56 With respect to final outcomes, a review
and analysis of BAIS data between 2004 and 2013 shows mixed results. Cohort specific
prevalence data from BAIS II (2004), BAIS III (2008), and BAIS IV (2012) suggests that survival
improved (especially among those age 35 and above) prior to 2008, before BNAPS (Figure A3-
1). BAIS III (2008) and BAIS IV (2013) data show that incidence marginally declined from 1.45
to 1.35 (0.1 over 5 years),57,58 which means that the epidemiological context for BNAPS was
largely a stabilized one, as a result of the intensive and effective treatment program from 2001.
The main focus when BNAPS started was on: (i) sustaining the positive momentum of containing
the epidemic; and (ii) finding innovative mechanisms to further reduce incidence in a cost-
effective manner. The question was not whether treatment is effective in increasing life

   Annex 2 provides a detailed summary of outcomes attributable to BNAPS, including delivered by CSOs.

   The analysis does not address the impact of inputs with system-wide implication due to attribution issues.
56
   ‘Before & after’ analysis, based on: BAIS III, 2008; BAIS IV, 2013; UNAIDS, 2015; NTBP, 2015; MOH, 2015.
57
   UNAIDS cross-country data (Figure A3-2) corroborates this, showing that the largest drop in incidence is prior to
2007. Comparing the change in HIV incidence in Botswana to other countries between 2012 and 2014, there is
insignificant reduction against Lesotho, Namibia, and Zambia and no change relative to South Africa and Zimbabwe.
58
   Because BAIS IV has not published age specific incidence estimates, there is no firm conclusions about incidence
reduction across the age groups to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies. Analysis of prevalence data of
BAIS from 2004 to 2013 by age-cohorts shows that prevention efforts for youth have been largely ineffective since
2004. Since then, all three of the youngest cohorts had doubled or tripled their HIV prevalence by 2013 (NACA,
2015). Cohorts in the 15-19 and 20-24 year old age groups surpassed the national HIV prevalence at 18.5% in 2013.

expectancy (reducing mortality) and averting new infections (i.e., treatment as prevention) but
whether there are more efficient alternatives to avert new cases (e.g., behavioral and combination
prevention), to contribute to attaining the ambitious target of ‘zero new infection’ (NSF II).

125. Policy Priorities and Resource Allocation. Considering resource allocations across
prevention and treatment, the stagnation in these final outcomes may not come as a surprise. The
Investment Case (NACA, 2015) highlights that for the entire period of NSFII (2009-2016),
prevention activities were allocated 10% of the total budget, 73% of which went solely to
PMTCT. While this share is well-justified given the high prevalence among pregnant women,
other preventive interventions receive a small proportion of the funds. Budget allocation toward
IEC campaigns accounted for approximately 4% of the total budget, and allocations toward HIV
counseling and testing were minimal for the entire period of NSFII.59 Given such under-resourced
prevention context, although the financial contribution from BNAPS was small as a share of the
total NSFII budget (6.5%),60 it represented a significant share of the resources that went toward

  BNAPS resources were $US50 million between 2009 and 2015, which is approximately 6.5% of the total NSFII
budget (2009 and 2016). This statistics assumes that the majority of BNAPS resources were used for prevention.

prevention (65%) (Table A3-2).61 Against this backdrop, despite its relative small weight,62
through some targeted BCC interventions and the biomedical prevention interventions, BNAPS
played a role in (i) contributing to stabilizing the epidemic; and (ii) catalyzing system-level
changes, which are required to enable further and more sustainable gains in this area. The
interventions that contributed to these outcomes are discussed below in depth.

    (1) Behavioral Interventions to Prevent HIV Transmission - Phase 1 & 2
126. In support of the Government’s objectives, as outlined in the NSF (2003-2009), the
BNAPS not only shifted the focus to prevention from the formerly treatment-centered national
response but placed a heavier emphasis on behavior change. In terms of the options for
prevention, whereas structural strategies seek to change the context that contributes to
vulnerability and risk, and biomedical interventions block infection or decrease infectiousness,
behavioral strategies attempt to motivate behavior change within individuals or social units by
use of a range of educational, communication, motivational, peer group, skill building, and
community64 normative approaches.

127. The extraordinary social and economic cost of the HIV/AIDS epidemic suggests that
prevention can be far cheaper than treatment, thus motivating continued search for innovative
prevention approaches that are more effective and cost-effectives. There is ample evidence that
prevention is cost-effective. However, cost-effectiveness is sensitive to the epidemiological (e.g.
generalized, vs. localized) and economic (e.g. low vs. high-income) context. For example, an
epidemiological model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of approaches to combat HIV in
developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia shows that reducing HIV
transmission could be done most efficiently through mass media campaigns, interventions for
sex workers and treatment of sexually transmitted infections where resources are most scarce
(Hogan et al., 2005).65 Further, prevention of mother to child transmission, voluntary counselling
and testing, and school based education would yield further health gains at higher budget levels
and would be regarded as cost effective or highly cost effective based on standard international
benchmarks.
                                                            
61
     A smaller share of BNAPS resources contributed to system and information management strengthening (e.g.,
making facilities IDCC compliant, IT support for See & Treat sites, facilitating access to IPMS and improve medical
information storage and retrieval. If the denominator includes systems strengthening (9% of NSFII), then BNAPS
resources account for 34.2% of the NSFII funds that were allocated to prevention and systems strengthening.
62
    Using target population estimates and assuming a 5 year project duration, annual BNAPS funding per beneficiary
was expected to be approximately US$6. To put this in context, the per capita health expenditure and government
health expenditure are, respectively, US$307 and US$214 (2008, at exchange rate).
63
    The budget figures presented in the table are drawn from the Investment Case paper (NACA, 2015)
64
     “Individuals cannot change their behavior in a vacuum, but are heavily influenced by their social networks and
group norms. Their perceptions of risk are ordered and nurtured by the peer group and social context within which
they operate. Behaviors have to be supported and reinforced by the value system of the society.” (MAP, 2007).
65
    This depends strongly on the nature of the epidemic, and how good the particular campaigns are.


                                                               56
128. Among the preventive interventions assessed in the paper with respect to cost-
effectiveness, BNAPS engaged in the following under the umbrella of behavior change
approaches: (i) school-based education; (ii) voluntary counseling and testing (VCT);66 and (iii)
mass media. Region-wide experience with effectiveness and cost-effectiveness suggests that
among the three interventions applied, the effectiveness in terms of DALYs averted is
comparable for mass media and VCT, however the former is significantly more cost-effective
with a much lower average cost-effectiveness ratio. However, results are sensitive to the specific
intervention design and, hence, country and project-specific investigations are critical to inform
operations and policies. Among all interventions presented, school-based education is the least
effective and has a relatively high price tag. However, evidence from 2011 by UNESCO and
UNAIDS suggests that sexuality education programs can be highly cost-effective, especially
when compulsory, adapted from existing models and integrated into the mainstream school
curriculum.

129. In contrast with the results from the region-wide modeling, Dupas (2009) uses a
randomized experiment to test whether information can change sexual behavior among teenagers
in Kenya. The paper is motivated by the debate over whether scalable school-based HIV/AIDS
education programs can be effective in limiting the spread of HIV/AIDS among youths, and over
what should be the content of these programs. Many sub-Saharan African countries have
incorporated HIV/AIDS education in their school curriculum, but the great majority of those
curricula are limited to risk avoidance information: they aim at completely eliminating pre-
marital sex, by promoting abstinence until marriage. They omit to provide risk reduction
information, for example that condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission. The study finds
that content of the curriculum and framing the message matters. Providing information on the
relative risk of HIV infection by partner's age led to a 28% decrease in teen pregnancy, an
objective proxy for the incidence of unprotected sex. Self-reported sexual behavior data suggests
substitution away from older (riskier) partners and towards protected sex with same-age partners.
In contrast, the national abstinence-only HIV education curriculum had no impact on teen
pregnancy. These results suggest that teenagers are responsive to risk information but their sexual
behavior is more elastic on the intensive than on the extensive margin. The implication of these
findings is to place more emphasis on risk education, which is more realistic then expecting
prolonged abstinence.

130. Based on the evidence summarized above, the conclusion for BNAPS is that mass media
and counselling interventions appear to be between low to medium efficacy and efficient, while
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of school-based BCC approaches depends on the content
and messaging. It must be noted that cost-effectiveness is a relative concept as it depends on the
level of government resources and income (GDP per capita) so if the intervention proves to be
effective relatively higher unit costs per case or life averted can be absorbed as these are justified
on the grounds of rate of return for public resources.

131. Although it is not possible to make a conclusive judgment on the impact and cost-
effectiveness of behavioral change approaches applied in BNAPS – due to lack of data on
intervention or program costs and on the observed efficacy in terms of cases averted – the PDO-
level outcomes on condom use and MCP suggest that there has been no improvement on these

                                                            
66
  In January 2004, the GoB launched a Routine HIV Testing (RHT) policy at all health facilities, following an
explicit opt-out principle. The goal of this approach was to “normalize” HIV/AIDS-related disease perceptions and
expand access to all available (and appropriate) services in a timely manner. Despite the opt-out testing, rates were
low at the baseline in 2008 (BAIS III) but improved by 2013 (BAIS IV) (see Table A10-8).


                                                               57
risky behaviors67 (particularly for the 15-19 age group) (see more on MCP in Box A3-1).
Knowledge of sexual modes of HIV transmission remains low, with less than half of the youth
target groups correctly identifying ways of prevention and little progress detected over time.68

132. Despite improved coverage in VCT during the timeline of BNAPS, further efforts are
required to attain a higher coverage rate and ensure linkage to care. The status of these indicators
motivates a “Negligible” rating for the efficiency of behavior change interventions for both
phases. Low efficacy rating means that the economic effects of these interventions have fallen
behind expectations (i.e., low value for money or low return on investment). This rating does not
mean that behavioral interventions are not good investments. It points to the importance of further
explorations in this area. First, testing innovative approaches to induce behavior change (e.g.,
CCT and lottery, as piloted in Tanzania and Kenya) is encouraged. Second, it is important to
better understand the role and effect of intervention by the public sector, CSOs, and the private
sector and obtain data that enables such assessment. The M&E framework of BNAPS was not
designed to enable evaluating the relative effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of interventions
through these channels/agents, or the extent of complementarity and supplementary between
them. As Component 3 absorbed approximately half of the resources, and CSOs had a big role to
play in behavioral strategies, lack of data on effectiveness and efficiency is unfortunate as this
prevents evidence-based program adjustments. The documentation obtained for this ICR reveals
that CSOs primarily engaged in BCC related to abstinence, condom use and MCP, and inducing
demand for SMC (Box A1-1, Table A1-1). However, it is not possible to isolate expenditures for
these interventions and the consequent outputs/outcomes. Future projects could incorporate a
component to collect data on effectiveness and costs to enable a robust economic analysis to
inform prioritization decisions.

    Box A3-1: The ‘lethal cocktail’ of HIV transmission – SMC, MCP, and gender aspects in Botswana
    SMC: BAIS IV estimated the National SMC rate by 2013 at 24.3%, well below the National target set
    at 80%. In that same year, the Ministry of Health launched a program targeting neonatal circumcision,
    and in early 2014 based on its experience and achievements, re-defined its targets expecting to achieve
    an overall SMC coverage of 61% by 2016. Special focus was directed at 10 – 29 year olds with targets
    set at 80% and 30-49 year old males with targets set at 40% and by June 2014 the SMC program had
    reached 65% of its proposed target for adolescent boys. During 2013 the National SMC program
    completed 46,793 circumcisions. By March 2015, a total of 150,136 males had been circumcised.
    BNAPS has contributed to these outcomes in SMC, particularly through the increased fund allocation
    to the MOH to enable service delivery, as well as to CSOs to generate demand for SMC. Continued
    emphasis on demand creation is essential to increase the ratio of men that benefit from SMC. Social
    norms on SMC can change very quickly For example, in Madagascar – which has a much more
    favorable context given its localized epidemic – there is a widely spread practice of SMC, with
    approximately 95% of males circumcised (World Bank, 2015).
    MCP: The lack of progress (and reversal) on this behavioral indicator urges exploring alternative and
    innovative mechanisms to influence sexual partnership practices. Approaches, such as conditional cash
    transfer (CCT) to reward safe sexual behavior (de Walque et al. 2012; de Walque, Dow, and Nathan,
    2014) and lotteries (Bjorkman Nyqvist, 2015) to alter risk preferences have now been piloted in



                                                            
67
   Risky behaviors may also be associated with ‘moral hazard,’ which can be triggered by free access to care (ART).
It can be assumed that with no-cost treatment, the economic incentive for changing risky behavior is low.  
68
   The BAIS II (2004) found that 93% of the respondents had heard of HIV/AIDS. Yet, the proportion of respondents
15-24 years who correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and reject major
misconceptions about HIV transmission/prevention increased from 36% in 2001 to 38% in 2004, against the GoB’s
target of 90% by 2005. See 2001-2013 trend in Figure A10-3. Several prevention targets in the NSF were not met.


                                                               58
    Tanzania and Lesotho,69 including follow-up rounds to assess medium-term effects and the
    heterogeneity of gender response over time. These innovative approaches differ from the more
    mainstream socio-behavioral intervention in a fundamental way. They apply hard, economic incentives
    vis-a-vis the softer incentives through behavioral communication and social norming, which take
    substantively longer time to induce lasting gains.70
    Gender: The gender dimension has been a critical but under-monitored and under-researched area
    within the documentation provided and reviewed for this ICR. The recent studies that explored the
    effectiveness of innovative interventions to induce behavior change – specifically to reduce MCP and
    increase safe condom use – found that while the interventions had lasting impact on men, who were
    observed to have adopted safer sexual behavior practices as a result of the pilot programs, the effect on
    women dissipated following the discontinuation of cash transfers. There is a clear economic argument
    behind the observed gender gradient. Women, who are economically less empowered, are more
    exposed to risky sexual behavior because of their economic dependency. In other words, there is a
    stronger price and income effect for women, which is associated with increased elasticity of risky sexual
    behavior in response to cash, the functional form of which is likely non-linear; meaning that poor and
    vulnerable women are exposed to higher risk probability. Targeted interventions to these vulnerable
    subgroups may be effective in reducing the gender gradient.

    (2) Biomedical Prevention of HIV Transmission through SMC – Phase 1 & 2
133. Cognizant of the slow project disbursement trajectory and concerned by the stickiness of
behavioral indicators, BNAPS increased the focus on some biomedical interventions known to
be effective in reducing HIV transmission without the need for continuous reminders or follow-
up to ensure compliance, as required in BCC or preventive treatment.

134. A series of papers on HIV prevention in The Lancet emphasize that highly active HIV
prevention inevitably must be ‘combination prevention’ (Coates, Richter, and Caceres, 2008).
Advances in biomedical HIV prevention, as in the case of safe male circumcision (SMC) or the
potential of antiretroviral therapies for prevention, provide substantial opportunities to re-
invigorate behavioral approaches to HIV prevention and challenge governments to advance
structural approaches so that these approaches can get to those who need them the most. All these
prevention approaches contribute to effective HIV prevention within communities, and thus
behavioral strategies need to be used in combination with biomedical and structural approaches
that are combined strategically to address epidemics.

135. In line with the ‘combination prevention’ method, BNAPS ramped up its prevention
efforts by adding increased emphasis on SMC, leading to a total of 150,136 males circumcised
by March 2015 (i.e., 39-% progress toward the target set by the end of the project). Although the
target was not attained, the coverage enabled by BNAPS is considerable; equivalent to
approximately 35% of the male population covered under BNAPS, and 18% of the total male
population.71 Although further efforts in demand generation are required to attain the coverage
target, the MOH has been strategic in its targeting – as described in Box A3-1 – and the improved
coordination72 with CSOs has also contributed to improved efficiency.

                                                            
69
   The economic foundation of these experiments rests in neoclassical economics, which predicts that incentives will
alter behavior in part via price effects. Conditioning a monetary value on safe sexual behavior increases the shadow
price of risky sex. Income effects also play a role, particularly with increasing value of cumulative repeated rewards,
which act as an income ‘substitute.’ The studies use objective, biomedical measures, such as the incidence of STIs,
not reported measures for this outcome, which have proved to suffer from reporting bias.
70
   Exploring the feasibility and desirability of adopting such approaches to the Botswana context is encouraged.  
71
   BAIS IV (2013) shows a 24.3% target population coverage of SMC; increased from 11% in 2008 (BAIS III).
72
   This indicator is promising given that the outcome was affected by initial coordination challenges. Improved
supply-demand coordination between the MOH and CSOs led to higher effectiveness and efficiency over time.


                                                               59
136. With regards to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, evidence from a randomized control
trial73 in South Africa concludes that in settings with high or moderate HIV prevalence among
the general population, adult SMC is likely to be a cost-effective HIV prevention strategy, even
when it has a low coverage. SMC generates large net savings after adjustment for averted HIV
medical costs (Kahn, Marseille, and Auvert, 2006). Based on the cost-effectiveness estimates
from Kahn et al. (2006), the effect of the SMC intervention in 2013 alone, when 46,793
circumcisions were carried out, could be around 14,412 HIV infections averted (HIA) over 20
years (80% CI 8,840 and 20,027). Imputing the cost of treatment averted74 for the HIA translates
into a savings of approximately $113.2 million (80% CI 69.5 million to 157.3 million) during the
20-year horizon.

137. These findings suggest that the increased emphasis on SMC under BNAPS was an
effective shift in the approach mix and led to improved outcomes in prevention. Given the slow
uptake of SMC during Phase 1, the efficiency of this intervention was “Negligible.” Following
improved effectiveness during Phase 2,75 the efficiency is rated as “Substantial,” particularly
taking into account long-term effects and secondary transmission to women.

    (3) Biomedical Intervention & Integration Agenda: TB-HIV/AIDS – Phase 1 & 2
138. Epidemiological Context. The GoB has a strong commitment towards tuberculosis (TB)
control. The Bank came on board with a five year plan on the realization that Botswana, despite
being an upper middle income economy, still grappled with high burden of TB, which remains a
leading cause of death among people living with HIV. 76 At appraisal, Botswana ranked sixth in
the world in terms of the number of the TB patients per capita. Historically, the notification trend
had increased dramatically from 202/100,000 population in 1989 to a peak of 623/100,000
population in 2002. The 536/100,000 population reported in 2008 formed the baseline data for
BNAPS. TB continues to be a major public health problem in the country with the 2009 Botswana
National TB Program (BNTP) Review showing a TB/HIV co-infection rate of 63%.

139. Costs and Benefits of TB and HIV/AIDS Integration in Botswana. From the list of
challenges stated by the 2009 BNTP Review document, BNAPS mainly supported hospital
infrastructure renovation, equipment purchase, training for various HR, and to facilitate
knowledge sharing (Table A2-11, Annex 2). The BNAPS TB/HIV final report (MOH, 2015)
assessed program performance with respect to expenditures and outcomes. Although the report


                                                            
73
   Cost-effectiveness was modeled for 1,000 SMCs done within a general adult male population. Intervention costs
included performing SMC and treatment of adverse events. HIV prevalence was estimated from published estimates
and incidence among susceptible subjects calculated assuming a steady-state epidemic. Effectiveness was defined
as the number of HIV infections averted (HIA); estimated by dynamically projecting over 20 years the reduction in
HIV incidence observed in the trial, including secondary transmission to women. Net savings were calculated with
adjustment for the averted lifetime duration cost of HIV treatment. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of input
uncertainty and program coverage. Results were discounted to the present at 3% per year. For Gauteng Province,
assuming full coverage of the MC intervention, with a 2005 adult male prevalence of 25.6%, 1,000 circumcisions
would avert an estimated 308 (80% CI 189–428) infections over 20 years.
74
   This is based on the value presented in the Investment Case (NACA, 2015), which estimates the treatment cost
averted to be around $7,852 for a 15-year period between 2015 and 2030. While this is not identical with the 20
years used for the calculations above, it can be used as a lower bound estimate. The report provides annual estimates
for treatment cost per person, which starts from $450 per capita in $US 2015 prices (2015) and reaches around $550
by 2030 (i.e., a 22% increase over 15 years).
75
   Improved MOH-CSO coordination for demand generation IEC addressed the earlier implementation bottlenecks. 
76
   The number one of cause of death is HIV (35%), followed by cancer (6%), and stroke (5%). TB ranks fourth on
the causes-of-death list, accounting for nearly 5% of all deaths. The Top 10 diseases account for 70% of total death.

notes that expenditure reporting by activity was difficult,77 it provides aggregated data by
programmatic categories (Table A2-11, Annex 2). Regarding outcomes, the report describes the
trends in TB and HIV/AIDS care management (Table A2-12, Annex 2). Selected key outcomes,
supported and measured by BNAPS, are highlighted below.
 People Receiving Treatment in Accordance with WHO-recommended DOTS: The hallmark of
  TB control is early case detection and treatment, promoted by directly observed treatment, short
  course (DOTS).78
 Improving Case Detection through Quality Assured Bacteriology: The BNAPS resources that
  were dedicated to laboratory staff training translated into improved case detection (from 69%
  to 75%) and treatment success rate (from 71% to 82%) between 2008 and 2012. 79
 Lab Efficiency – Reduced Sputum Turnaround Time due to Gene Xpert: To further support
  rapid and accurate diagnosis of TB, BNAPS procured 20 Gene Xpert machines80 and
  accessories. The machines shorten the time period between diagnosis and initiation of treatment
  for both TB and drug resistant TB as shown in Table A3-3.

140. Estimates of the Economic Returns on Investment in TB Diagnosis. UNAIDS reports
suggests that annual TB-related deaths in PLWs dropped by nearly 50% (from 1,800 to 930)
between 2008 and 2013 (Table A3-4). To illustrate the economic value of TB mortality averted
among PLWHs, we focus on the 170 lives saved between 2012 and 2013, when BNAPS
contributed significantly to improving TB case management through investing in HR, lab
equipment, and infrastructure.81 Imputing the average per capita GDP, the economic value of the
170 lives saved in one year is approximately US$1.21 million. Projecting the gains through 2020,
assuming an average growth rate of 4.3% and a discount rate of 3%, the total economic value of
the lives saved is approximately US$10.1 million. While this rudimentary estimation does not
take into account the mortality dynamics during the 8 years of the projection and it can also be
argued that not all of these lives saved during this period can be attributed to BNAPS, the
economic returns on the investment (US$2.1 million)82 are clear, even after adjusting the
assumptions for the number of lives saved and the discount rate parameters.83

    Due to irregular reporting by districts, partially because of ambiguous reporting lines in a decentralized
implementation platform, which may result in data by-passing the TB Program at the HQ of the MOH. Districts ran
trainings without the HQ as they had trained ToTs and accessed funds through GABS, the GoB’s budgeting system. 
78
   DOTS: a 6-month regimen of 4 first-line anti-TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazidnamide.
79
   This success is important for TB epidemiology and economically because multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is
becoming an increasing threat to health and development gains. 
80
   14 are placed in hospital laboratories in the country, 1 at the National Laboratory, and 5 in hard-to-reach areas.
81
   E.g., BNAPS invested in the training of lab technicians, financed the salary of 2 regional TB coordinators, procured
the GeneXpert, and the renovation of the Jubilee hospital’s TB ward (Table A2-11, Annex 2).
82
   Table A2-11, Annex 2 shows the funds for TB from BNAPS (US$2.1 million) by key investment line items.
83
   With a cumulative investment of $2.1 million to support TB diagnostics, if 170 lives were saved between 2012
and 2013 as a result of the program, this would mean that the return for every dollar invested is US$4.8. For a more
conservative estimate, using a 5% discount rate, the return for every dollar invested is US$4.5. To address potential
concerns regarding the attribution of mortality aversion due to the program, if only half of the lives are assumed to
be saved by the program (85), the economic return remains positive (US$2.4 at the 3% discount rate and US$2.2 at
the 5% discount rate). In sum, the investment value ranges between double and nearly five-fold of the original value.

141. The contribution of Gene Xpert to effectiveness and economic impact – in terms of
opportunity and treatment costs, and DALY – is significant. Before Gene Xpert (2013), there
were many patients treated as MDR-TB suspects. A significant share of patients diagnosed as
MDR-TB by the National TB Referral Lab died before treatment as a results of loss to follow up.
The numbers of MDR-TB patients who died before initiation of treatment were very high as
compared to at present. Much success has been recorded through BNAPS in this area as shown
in the outcomes in Figure A3-3 (see Table A2-12 in Annex 2).

142. Additional benefits from BNAPS-supported TB management:
 Infection Control: BNAPS funded Infection Control (IC) activities including the Health
  Facility Assessments that were done quarterly as part of the MSS.
 Community-Based TB Care (CTBC): Enrolment under CTBC to increase, from as low as 9%
  in 2009 to 69.5% in 2013, against a target of 75%. Table A3-5 shows the trends in CTBC
  uptake. The observed gains in scale-up are largely attributed to contributions from CSOs,
  through funding and technical support from Global Fund, BNAPS and ACHAP.

 Policy Change: During the period of BNAPS support, the Botswana National Policy on
  HIV/AIDS was reviewed. Among the many changes, TB was included realizing that TB could
  not be divorced from HIV and that TB was since recognized as a public health emergency,
  needing an intersectoral approach just like HIV. This national policy is formulated as a
  strategic intervention to guide the conduct of the employment relationship to promote mutual
  understanding of all, including government, employers and employees in managing
  HIV/AIDS and TB issues in organizations. Its application is intended to result in a safe,
  healthy and productive workforce, by fostering the elimination of discrimination, stigma,
  ignorance and prejudice in the workplace. The national policy is part of the country’s response
  to the HIV/ AIDS & TB epidemics, providing guidance to efforts to prevent the spread and
  manage the impact of HIV/AIDS and TB (see more on TB-HIV integration in Box A3-2).

    Box A3-2: Evidence on TB and HIV/AIDS Integration

    TB is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with HIV and about a quarter of HIV-related
    deaths are attributed to tuberculosis. A systematic review of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
    eight integrated strategies recommended by WHO that represent coordinated delivery of HIV and
    tuberculosis services finds the followings: “Evidence supports concurrent screening for tuberculosis
    and HIV, and provision of care84 during routine HIV care and at voluntary counselling and testing
    centers. Although integration of antiretroviral therapy into tuberculosis care has shown promise for
    improving health outcomes for patients, evidence is insufficient to make conclusive claims. Evidence
    is also insufficient on the accessibility of condoms at tuberculosis facilities, the benefits of risk
    reduction counselling in patients with tuberculosis, and the effectiveness of TB infection control in HIV
    healthcare settings. The vertical response to the tuberculosis and HIV epidemics is ineffective and
    inefficient. Implications for policy makers and funders include further investments in implementing
    integrated tuberculosis and HIV programs with known effectiveness, preferably in a way that
    strengthens health systems; evaluative research that identifies barriers to integration; and research on
    integrated strategies for which the effectiveness, efficiency, and affordability aspects are not well
    established (Uyei et al., 2011).”

143. In sum, apart from high efficacy,85,86 the estimates on economic returns indicate good
value for money, which merits a “Substantial” rating on efficiency for Phase 1 , during which
DOTS coverage started to increase, and a “High” rating for Phase 2, during which BNAPS-
supported activities intensified and the integration agenda became more pronounced. In addition

                                                            
84
   Treatment can be either co-trimoxazole during routine TB care or isoniazid.
85
   The review of activities and outcomes managed under the TB Program of the MOH indicate considerable impact
during BNAPS as shown in Table A2-12 in Annex 2.
86
   The NTBP Report notes that attribution of impacts to the BNAPS is not always feasible as the TB Program
benefited from resources and technical assistance from other DPs. Some of the achievements were collectively
brought about by DPs (e.g., the Global Fund, ACHAP, CDC Botswana, I-TECH, UPenn Botswana, KNCV, URC,
PRR, and WHO), though there is no doubt that BNAPS had been among the partners who provided more support.

     (4) Biomedical Intervention & Integration Agenda: Cervical Cancer-HIV – Phase 291
144. Cervical cancer — a preventable condition that usually results from a viral infection by
HPV that is generally sexually transmitted — is one of the leading causes of premature death and
ill health among women in Sub-Saharan Africa.92 This is due to minimal screening services,
resulting in a significant number of patients diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. A key
problem in most cases is the limited health-system capacity.

145. In Botswana the HIV/AIDS epidemic overstretched the capacity of the system. In
response to this, the MOH strategically shifted focus to the integration agenda, as in the case of
TB-HIV/AIDS care management. The Department of Public Health developed the National
Cervical Cancer Prevention Program (NCCPP) Comprehensive Strategy (2012-2016).  To
operationalize the NCCPP, the GoB, with the Bank and the George W. Bush Institute’s Pink
Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) initiative,93 rolled out a Cervical Cancer Control Program – with
key elements financed by BNAPS, including: (i) cervical screening (i.e., secondary prevention);
and (ii) HPV vaccination. These drew on the HIV diagnostic and treatment platforms established
across Botswana over the last decade. The results of investing in these interventions are
impressive.

146. Secondary Prevention: With support from BNAPS, “See and Treat” clinics are
operational in 5 health districts and planned to be expanded to 16 clinics in 8 new districts by the
end of 15. The results from a pilot program among HIV-positive women at a community-based
clinic in Gaborone indicate that the low-cost “see and treat” approach for the prevention of
cervical cancer is a feasible and efficient alternative, especially for reaching women living in

   In Eastern & Southern Africa, it is compounded by high prevalence of HIV. HIV+ women are 4-5 times more
likely to develop cervical cancer.

   PRRR mobilizes the coordinated participation of institutions such as US CDC, US PEPFAR, USAID, UNAIDS,
Susan G. Komen Foundation, the Gates Foundation, CARIS Foundation, pharmaceutical companies such as Merck,
GlaxoSmithKline, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Becton, Dickinson and Company, IBM, and QIAGEN.

distant and/or underserved regions. The approach is synergistic with other interventions
introduced by BNAPS, generating a compounded effect and, expectedly, reducing costs.
147. Demonstration Projects: The MOH launched the Introduction of the HPV Vaccine
Demonstration Project in March 2013. There were 2,488 eligible girls from 23 public and private
schools in Molepolole village, with a minimum enrolment age of 9 years and older (grades 4, 5
and 6). Of the target cohort, 1,967 (79%) girls have received all three doses. Informed by the
success of the trial, a phased national roll-out plan was proposed and the HPV Vaccine
Demonstration transitioned to EPI to allow for sustainability (Table A3-7). In February 2015, the
GoB launched the national rollout of HPV Vaccine with a target of 69,582, and attained coverage
of 68,304 girls/women (a 98.2% progress toward the target; Table A3-8). The effects of BNAPS,
in collaboration with PRRR, in support of the NCCPP objectives are significant. Beyond the
biomedical effects and the consequent economic effects,94 the program served as a model and
had a formidable catalytic role in promoting and operationalizing the integration agenda,
leveraging the support of the MFDP, expressed in the form of resource allocation to EPI, which
led to a national rollout of HPV. The efficiency rating for cervical cancer prevention and the
integrated care delivery model is “High,” and only applies to Phase 2 given its launch in 2012.

  In a model-based cost effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa, for Botswana Kim et al.
(2013) estimate 11 cases averted per 1,000 vaccination. For the pilot supported by BNAPS, this translates to averting
22 cases. Beyond BNAPS, supported by GoB funds, the model-based estimate for cases averted through the scale-
up that covered 68,304 girls is approximately 751 cases averted.


                                                                               65
    Box A3-3: Cost-Effectiveness of Cervical-Cancer Prevention

    There are a number of strategies available for cervical cancer prevention and the balance of vaccination,
    screening, and treatment needs to be according to country context. For Sub-Saharan African countries
    characterized by low income, high mortality and low treatment levels, increased coverage of treatment
    with or without screening would be cost-effective, as would one-off PAP or VIA screening at 40 years
    of age or vaccinations (at $0.60 per dose). The VIA method does not require laboratory facilities and
    can enable treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. Where resources are limited, cost-effectiveness could
    be improved with targeted screening and by directing vaccinations towards people infected with HIV,
    since HIV infection is associated with increased risk of cervical cancer.

    Given the present high cost of HPV vaccines, countries need to decide the best strategies for their
    context, based on the evidence, in order to allocate resources efficiently and equitably. While the GAVI
    Alliance has recently decided to support the introduction of HPV vaccines, and public-private
    partnerships exist to make breast and cervical screening as well as HPV vaccination more available and
    affordable in SSA, countries still need to consider the longer-term budgetary implications for
    sustainable programs, and ensure that effective treatment is available for detected lesions. Early
    detection and screening programs could achieve down-staging of the targeted cancers within five years,
    and could reduce mortality within ten years.
     
    Cost-Effectiveness of Cervical-Cancer Screening in Five Developing Countries
    In five developing countries, a cross-country analysis examined clinically effective and cost-effective
    strategies that enhanced the linkage between screening and treatment, through either a reduced number
    of visits or improved follow-up, and that relied on less laboratory infrastructure than did conventional
    cytologic methods. The screening of women with one-visit or two-visit visual inspection or HPV DNA
    testing at about 35 years of age would reduce the lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 25 to 36%. Two
    screenings in a lifetime would provide a relative increase in the lifetime reduction of risk of cancer of
    approximately 40%, although the incremental benefits of three screenings are much smaller. The
    lifetime costs associated with alternative screening approaches vary among countries, owing to
    differences in the costs associated with labor and nontradable goods and the relative proportion of direct
    medical, time, and transportation costs. For similar reasons, cost-effectiveness ratios vary as well. For
    example, the cost per year of life saved for screening twice in a lifetime with a one-visit visual-
    inspection strategy is $91 in India and $319 in Kenya; this same strategy with the use of HPV DNA
    testing costs $310 per year of life saved in Thailand, $453 in Peru, and $1,093 in South Africa. Despite
    considerable differences among absolute cost-effectiveness ratios, the policy implications for these
    countries are similar once their relative resources (e.g., per capita GDP) are considered.

    There is no universal criterion that defines a threshold cost-effectiveness ratio, above which an
    intervention would not be considered cost-effective. The study used guidelines specifically intended
    for international comparisons, as proposed by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which
    defines interventions with a cost-effectiveness ratio that is less than the per capita GDP as “very cost-
    effective.” Expressed in international dollars, the per capita GDP ranges from $1,005 in Kenya to
    $9,486 in South Africa, suggesting that screening for cervical cancer twice in a lifetime in Kenya and
    three times in South Africa, Peru, Thailand, and India would be considered very cost-effective. Source:

   (5) Broader Effects
148. The broader effects include policy and institutional change and HMIS.
 Catalyzing or Contributing to Policy & Institutional Change. During BNAPS, the MOH began
  designing an Integrated Health Sector Plan, which became a ten-year strategic plan to guide
  the country in tackling current priority problems, and preparing for future health needs. The
  MOH engaged in restructuring, merging the Departments of HIV/AIDS and of Public Health,
  thereby creating a more streamlined approach to planning, care, and evaluation. As discussed,
  the MOH also developed its integrated care strategies for TB-HIV/AIDS and the NCCPP.



                                                       66
 Harmonization of HMIS: Botswana has been making significant efforts in integrating its
  multiple, disparate, disease-focused, standalone health information systems. The MOH
  completed the Health Information Management System Strategic Plan in April 2012 that
  provides an ICT road map in line with the MOH-adopted e-Health Strategy (2015), to integrate
  the current standalone systems into the existing Integrated Patient Management System
  (IPMS). IPMS is a centralized, electronic medical record system focused on patient care and
  treatment in clinic, and hospital settings. It stores data on various health services, including
  ART, prevention of mother-to child transmission, laboratory, and pharmacy, and in the near
  future will support the clinical case-management of Safe Male Circumcision and the National
  Cervical Cancer Prevention Program. It is being implemented in 11 hospitals covering close
  to 75% of total MOH hospital beds, their labs, and satellite clinics and plans to expand to at
  least 30 hospitals across Botswana.
149. The economic impact of improved policies that respond to national priorities and
challenges requires no explanation. The economic impact of improved HMIS, through the
pathways of improved efficiency and quality of care management is also evident. These broader
changes that have system-wide bearing affect national level outcomes – both in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency – in a profound way. These broader implications underscore the
relevance and importance of BNAPS and justify a “Modest” rating for Phase 1, which provided
lessons and the context for project design revision, including system-level aspects, and a
“Substantial” rating for Phase 2, which prompted broader changes.95




                                                            
95
   This assessment takes into account that consolidating the broader effects will require sustained efforts and
investments from the GoB/DPs, and that the financial contribution of BNAPS to these effects was relatively modest.

    Annex 5. Implementing Agency Survey Results

148. The BNAPS ICR Survey was designed96 and collected through Survey Monkey. The
distribution list for the participants was provided by NACA. The survey was not intended to be
a representative97 survey with full coverage, given the time and budget limitations to implement
the ICR. The objective of the survey was to offer an anonymous platform and an opportunity to
share views. The survey covers 29 questions, including: (i) respondent characteristics (age,
gender, education, job title, years working on BNAPS); (ii) implementing agency characteristics
(public, CSO, private, central or district level, location of office, geographic coverage under
BNAPS, age of organization/entity); and, (iii) views on relevance, implementation, effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability (quantitative and open-ended responses). Data collection started on
July 30, 2015 and ran for 4 weeks. Given the low response rate (22% of 105 targeted individuals),
the survey is not representative. The key findings have been shared with the GoB to help drawing
lessons and inform interventions and policies. A brief summary is provided in Box A5-1 below.

    Box A5-1: Key Findings from the BNAPS ICR Survey
     Relevance: The majority of respondents considered increasing access to HIV prevention fully
      relevant. There is more variability regarding the relevance of capacity building for NACA.
     Implementation: 76.2% of respondents noted challenges occasionally and 19% frequently. The
      biggest bottlenecks included staffing and staff skills, procurement and other implementation aspects.
      Financial delays were considered very important by more than half of the respondents, followed by
      general project management and oversight issues. When asked about when these problems occurred,
      CSO respondents highlighted two years: 2013 “When we experienced delay of disbursements to our
      account which not only affected output but triggered exodus of staff.” and 2014 when respondents
      noted challenges with “end of project closure activities and outstanding activities.”
     Effectiveness: With respect to the question “How do you think your program performed under the
      BNAPS relative to the targets that your organization set? – ¾ of respondents expressed satisfaction.
      The remaining ¼ indicated falling below expectations in reaching targets.
     Efficiency: As to the question “What is your opinion of the efficiency of your program's performance
      (i.e. the amount of money spent to produce outcomes)? -- the majority of respondents expressed
      satisfaction. The total share is less than stated for effectiveness, indicating that the efficiency
      dimension was more challenging.
     Sustainability: In response to “What is your opinion about the continuation and sustainability of the
      program(s) supported by BNAPS following the closing of the project?” -- the majority of
      respondents expressed concern (“Close Down” – 28.6% and “Face Serious Challenges” – 28.6%).
      4.8% of the projects was reported to continue and 38% to partially continue (scale back).
     Overall Performance: Survey respondents have a largely favorable view of the BNAPS project
      (“Satisfactory” - 47.6% and “Moderately Satisfactory” – 42.9%).

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results




                                                            
96
   The survey was developed based on a Focus Group Discussion with CSOs organized by NACA during the ICR
mission (May, 2015). The CSOs expressed appreciation – both to NACA and the Bank – for the opportunity to share
their views. The ICR Team thanks NACA for availing the distribution list and reviewing the draft instrument, and
the representatives from each component who helped testing the instrument and provided valuable feedback.
97
   The lack of a scientific sampling strategy is important when interpreting the results. The survey can provide
insights for qualitative assessment but should not be quoted as a representative study on BNAPS’s performance.
Notwithstanding this limitation, driven by time and budget constraints, the survey offers entry points for discussion.  


                                                               69
Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The following comments were received on the draft ICR from the Government of Botswana:

Ministry of Finance and Development Planning

“We do not have any substantive comments. We suggest that under Basic Information, the
Borrower is the Government of Botswana represented by the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning. The other point is under Male circumcision (page x) - report does not
indicate the difficulties encountered. This should be a relatively easier target to achieve and is a
good preventive measure.”

Ministry of Health

“The BNAPS project was under the auspices of World Bank from 2008-2015, with the aim of
increasing coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of targeted and evidence based HIV/AIDS
interventions. The document captured the implementation status as it was but minor observations
were made as follows:

    1. Indicator 2- page ix, baseline column between the ages of 10-14years-its written –No
    activity (can we specify to ‘abstinence’ or ‘no sexual activity’).
    2. On page xi (indicator 4) it is better to mention “ART” rather than “HAART” to just comply
    with the terms used internationally. Besides, HAART does not appear among the documents.
    3. Page 55, table A3-1 under biomedical interventions-align statement that start with patient
    defaulter rate to Integrated Care –TB & HIV/AIDS not under SMC.

NACA

“We find the ICR very comprehensive and factually representative in many of the variables that
were indicated for assessment and, therefore, concur with the report and endorse its
recommendations, especially on the ratings.”

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The following comments were received on the draft ICR from the Delegation of the European
Union to Botswana and SADC:

“We have gone through the report, which is well written and reflects mostly that the project was
successful. As we had sorted out queries earlier, we have not much more to say at this stage other
than to thank you for the great cooperation and your hard work.”

   HIV prevalence is heterogeneous, with the highest prevalence recorded in Selebi-Phikwe and North East. The
literature notes the lack of age-and location-adjusted prevalence maps that could be used for targeting HIV
educational programs and efficient allocation of resources to higher risk groups (Kandale et al., 2012).

   No trend data are available. The ISRs and Aide Memoires suggest increased allocations toward better performing
ministries, with particular emphasis toward the end of the project when the integrated care agenda increased the
weight of MOH-managed and implemented interventions. The project monitoring tool was instrumental in
improving project management but it had limitations. For example, reporting for 2014-15 for Component 2 by
ministry is missing, making the assessment of resource allocations within the component difficult. Yet, it offers
insights into share of expenditures by ministries for the period of 2009-2013, and these financial records are more
detailed than what is available in standard financial statements.

Sources: BAIS II-IV for Panel A. MOH for Panel B. Note: The right vertical axis in Panel A and the grey bars shows
the percentage change (%) between the survey data points. The left axis is the scale for the level of knowledge
measured in terms of share of the target population (%). In Panel B the dashed line shows the cumulative outcome,
the solid line shows the annual uptake.

Notes for Panel A: The proportion of respondents 15-24 years who correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual
transmission of HIV and reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission/prevention increased from 36% in
2001 to 38% in 2004, an increase of 2 percentage points over 3 years, against the GoB’s target of 90% by 2005. For
the same cohort, the increase between 2004 (BAIS II) and 2008 (BAIS III) is 2 percentage points, from 38% to 40%.
Between 2008 (BAIS III) and 2013 (BAIS IV) the increase is 7.7 percentage points, from 40% to 47.7%. While the
progress was larger in this last round, in absolute terms it remains insufficient.
