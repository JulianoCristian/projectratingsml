 evidence-based HIV/AIDS interventions through (i) strengthening the National AIDS Coordinating Agency's institutional management and
 coordination capacity; and (ii) financing strategic and innovative HIV/AIDS-related prevention and mitigation activities. This project development
 objective will be measured by utilizing indicators addressing the longer-term planning, implementation, and effectiveness of national and
 decentralized coordination efforts.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 Yes

 Board Approved Revised Project Development Objective (If project is formally restructured)PHRPDODEL

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Implementation progress has improved consistently over the past 18 months, in part, due to the recruitment of key technical consultants to address
 identified fiduciary and technical gaps by the National AIDS Coordinating Agency (NACA). The next phase of the operation will intensify focus on the
 delivery of behavior change interventions, based on the National Strategic Framework and sector plans, specifically to reduce multiple concurrent
 partnerships, support advocacy and delivery of safe male circumcision, and delivery of interventions more strongly focused on the prevention needs of
 women 15-34 years. Following the processing of a 6-month extension in August 2014, the closing date for the BNAPS Project was revised to March 31,
 2015. The results of the recently released BAIS IV sero-survey indicates positive progress with respect to improvements in access to HIV testing
 services, knowledge levels, among other key areas.
