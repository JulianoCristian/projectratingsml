Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project development objective is to assist the Government of Botswana to increase the coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of targeted and
 evidence-based HIV/AIDS interventions through (i) strengthening the National AIDS Coordinating Agency's institutional management and
 coordination capacity; and (ii) financing strategic and innovative HIV/AIDS-related prevention and mitigation activities. This project development
 objective will be measured by utilizing indicators addressing the longer-term planning, implementation, and effectiveness of national and
 decentralized coordination efforts.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?
 Yes

 Board Approved Revised Project Development Objective (If project is formally restructured)PHRPDODEL
 The revised project development objective is to assist the Government of Botswana to increase access to prioritized prevention services that reduce
 the risk of HIV transmission.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Implementation progress has been strong over the past year, in part, due to the recruitment of key technical consultants to address identified fiduciary
 and technical gaps by the National AIDS Coordinating Agency (NACA). The final phase of the operation intensifed focus on the delivery of behavior
 change interventions, based on the National Strategic Framework and sector plans, specifically to reduce multiple concurrent partnerships, support
 advocacy and delivery of safe male circumcision, and delivery of interventions more focused on the prevention needs of women 15-34 years. Following
 the processing of a 6-month extension in August 2014, the closing date for the BNAPS Project was revised to March 31, 2015. The results of the
 recently released BAIS IV sero-survey indicates positive progress with respect to improvements in access to HIV testing services, knowledge levels,
 among other key areas.

         has been moved to be listed among the PDO indicators, as was its original categorization, as per the Project Appraisal Document.)
         Total safe male circumcision (SMC) procedures completed since program inception is 150,136 which translate to 38.9% of the 385,000
         program target, as reported by end-February 2015. A reported 1,776 of this SMC number are infants. There were 32,527 SMCs done by all
         sites for the year April 2014 to February 2015, against 50,000 annual target, which is 65% achievement.

         The number of people receiving DOTS treatment in December 2012 was 6,829. The strong referral program within the National TB
         Programme has enabled very high treatment initiation rates (100%). Treatment success rates during this same period are noted to have
         been 79% (2009 baseline), rising to 81.5% in December 2011, and 74.8% in December 2012.

         This core indicator provides a measure of the number of primary health clinics that were upgraded/renovated to enable them to be
         compliant to administer highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), as per the national ARV treatment guidelines. As a result of its strong
         ARV program coverage, Botswana has achieved and sustained nearly universal treatment coverage (over 90%) - despite recently
         expanding this no-cost program to cover to HIV+ individuals at earlier disease stages (as per WHO's revised ARV treatment
         initiation recommendations).
         (Note; This indicator measuring the "number of primary health clinics upgraded and HAART compliant" was included in the PAD's Results
         Framework. However, since the "core indicator" list was introduced in the Operations Portal subsequent to the project's Board approval,
         this indicator has been re-coded to indicate that it reflects a core indicator (as per the recommendation of AFTDE).

               Note: Calls for proposals were conducted three times to enrol qualified CSOs to participate in the project. In the first round in 2010, 16
               CSOs qualified and they worked mainly in 4 districts. At the second Call, in 2011, 26 qualified in total. The third/last call was done in 2012
               where 54 CSOs were selected to participate in 9 district and sub-districts. There were a total of 96 different organization grants made to 55
               CSOsover the duration of BNAPS. Given the capacity constraints among CSOs in Botswana, in its final two rounds of support, the BNAPS
               Project prioritized support to CSOs which had a track record for successful implementation and reporting, with a focus on CSOs committed
               to support the strengthening of smaller CSOs.
               To minimize disruption on service delivery, NACA develop a mechanism to award multi-year grants to CSOs which demonstrated a strong
               track record in implementing and achieving results. This mechanism enabled seamless transition during annual implementation cycles and
               enabled continued coverage of services in targeted communities. This approach reduced transaction costs both for NACA and CSOs and
               enabled CSOs to develop a long-term focus on their programmatic interventions.
