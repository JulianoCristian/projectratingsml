Project for Botswana were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. The lessons learned in this project\n            were as follows: (i) the importance of intensive supervision\n            in a country with limited prior World Bank Group (WBG)\n            operational engagement and where there is no local staff\n            must be underscored; (ii) innovative financing approaches\n            require close coordination with the Client and cofinanciers,\n            they can involve a trade-off, and require focus on results;\n            (iii) operations of this scale and with a number of\n            innovative interventions should incorporate a robust\n            evaluation agenda to better inform design, course\n            correction, and scale-up decisions in a timely and\n            operationally relevant manner; (iv) slow progress in\n            behavioral prevention questions the efficacy and targeting\n            of Behavioral Change Communication (BCC) intervention, and\n            it may be an unexpected adverse side effect of Botswana\u2019s\n            exemplary success in treatment; (v) in order to prioritize\n            and concentrate allocations on cost-effective interventions\n            for HIV prevention, it is critical to collect data. Data\n            scarcity or inadequate use of data undermines strategic\n            change and innovation; and (vi) through the integration\n            pilots, Botswana National HIV and AIDS Prevention Support\n            (BNAPS) illustrates that there is added value in\n            capitalizing on the shared challenges, drivers, and\n            potential solutions across the different disease categories,\n            with broader health-systems strengthening measures and outcomes."}, "docdt": "2016-04-28T03:44:03Z"}
