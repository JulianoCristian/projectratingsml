                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to assist the Government of Botswana to increase the coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of targeted and evidence-based HIV/
                         AIDS interventions through (i) strengthening the National AIDS Coordinating Agency's institutional management and coordination capacity; and (ii) financing strategic
                         and innovative HIV/AIDS-related prevention and mitigation activities. This project development objective will be measured by utilizing indicators addressing the longer-
                         term planning, implementation, and effectiveness of national and decentralized coordination efforts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress has improved substantially over the past 6 months, in part, due to the recruitment of key technical consultants to address identified fiduciary and technical
                         gaps by the National AIDS Coordinating Agency (NACA). It is anticipated that the next phase of the operation will intensify focus on the delivery of behavior change interventions,
