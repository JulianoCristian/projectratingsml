Food\n            Price Response Project for Nicaragua are to mitigate the\n            negative nutritional impact of the food price increase on\n            pre-primary and primary school children and to promote poor\n            rural households' food security by increasing\n            agricultural production. Nicaragua has been severely hit by\n            the increase in food prices. Food inflation is amongst the\n            highest in the region, reaching an annual inflation rate of\n            28.8 percent in October 2008 after reaching a peak of 34.2\n            percent in August 2008. The vast majority of households in\n            Nicaragua are net food consumers, even in rural areas. This,\n            combined with the large share of expenditures devoted to\n            food in poor households' expenditures suggests that the\n            impact of the crisis on poverty will be dire. Recent\n            estimates place the decrease in real consumption for poor\n            urban households at around 16 percent. In response to the\n            food crisis, the Government of Nicaragua has adopted a\n            two-pronged strategy that to a large extent is consistent\n            with the recommendations issued by the Bank for countries\n            facing a food prices crisis emergency. This strategy\n            combines actions to support the most vulnerable groups of\n            the population and actions aimed at expanding the supply of\n            agricultural goods."}, "docdt": "2009-01-08T00:00:00Z"}
