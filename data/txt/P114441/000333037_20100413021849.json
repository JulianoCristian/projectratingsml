This project is being restructured to increase\n            the scope of component one (school feeding) and decrease the\n            scope of component two (provision of seeds, fertilizer, and\n            training) in response to difficulties encountered in the\n            implementation of component two, the success of component\n            one, and the project's closing date of June 30, 2010.\n            To date, component one has financed the purchase of 115 days\n            of school feeding for 252,038 preschool and primary school\n            children, achieving the targets for this component.\n            Implementation of component two has lagged because the\n            droughts experienced since the third quarter of 2009 have\n            slowed the allocation of credits to small farmers and only\n            one sixth of the targeted farmers have benefited from the\n            integral package (seeds, fertilizers, technical, and\n            agricultural training). Given these results and the\n            limitations on performance under component two, US$1.7m is\n            being reallocated from component two to component one. Along\n            with the reallocation, the targets of the expected outcomes\n            indicators for the second year of the project will be\n            adjusted to reflect an increase in the number of school days\n            to finance with school feeding and to reduce all targets\n            related to component two."}, "docdt": "2010-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
