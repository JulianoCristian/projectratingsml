SUMMARY
This project is being restructured to increase the scope of component 1 (school feeding)
and decrease the scope of component 2 (provision of seeds, fertilizer and training) in
response to difficulties encountered in the implementation of component 2, the success of
component 1, and the project's closing date of June 30, 2010.

To date, component 1 has financed the purchase of 115 days of school feeding for
252,038 preschool and primary school children, achieving the targets for this component.
Implementation of component 2 has lagged because the droughts experienced since the
third quarter of 2009 have slowed the allocation of credits to small farmers and only one-
sixth of the targeted farmers have benefited from the integral package (seeds, fertilizers,
technical and agricultural training).

Given these results and the limitations on performance under component 2, US$1.7m is
being reallocated from component 2 to component 1. Along with the reallocation, the
targets of the expected outcomes indicators for the second year of the project will be
adjusted to reflect an increase in the number of school days to finance with school
feeding and to reduce all targets related to component 2.


PROJECT STATUS
The Project´s Development Objectives are to mitigate the negative nutritional impact of
the food price increase on pre-primary and primary school children and to promote poor
rural households´ food security by increasing agricultural production. The project became
effective on April 2009. About one-third of project funds have been disbursed to date and
another one-third has been committed.

After some start up delays, project implementation for component 1 took off in
September 2009. The project distributed school lunches for 100,504 preschool and
primary school children for the last 20 days of the 2009 school year and a second
distribution that consists of 95 days of school lunches for 252,038 preschool and primary
school children started in mid February 2010.

On the other hand and below the programmed annual targets, by November 2009 the
second component had benefited only about one-sixth of the targeted beneficiaries with
the distribution of an integral technological package that includes seeds, fertilizer, credit,
and technical assistance. "El Nino" phenomenon caused droughts that impacted
negatively the agricultural production of the Postrera planting season, affecting targeted

                                              5
areas of the project and basic grains such as maize, frijol and sorghum. Also, it has been
anticipated that serious affectations in the agricultural cycle will be observed for the
Apante planting season 2009-2010 (November-February). Risk aversion from small
farmers prevented them to take the credit and technological package because they did not
foresee a possibility to repay the credit given the drought conditions. This is the main
bottleneck that slowed the allocation of credits to small farmers reducing considerably the
targets for this component.


PROPOSED CHANGES
   ·   Outputs /results or indicators
       The Project Development Objective and the design of the project remain the
       same. Likewise, the expected outcomes and the targeting mechanism will be the
       same of the original design, but adjustments of the target values for the expected
       outcomes indicators will be introduced to reflect the changes in the scope of the
       project. The targets for component 2 are decreased and those of component 1 are
       increased. With this reallocation, the project will provide for 18 additional days of
       school lunches under component 1 and distribute a technological package (seeds,
       fertilizers, credit and agricultural training) to 9,266 small farmers for the Primera
       planting season. Annex 1 reflects the modifications.

   ·   Financing
       The restructuring consists of adjusting the costs of the project by reallocating
       US$1.7m from component 2 to component 1. The new total allocation is of
       US$6.0m for component 1 (US$0.3m from counterpart funds and US$5.7m from
       the grant) and US$1.3m for component 2. Component 1 will finance the new
       purchase of school lunches to preschool and primary school children in 52
       municipalities. Component 2 will continue financing the delivery of a
       technological package for small farmers. Annex 2 shows the cost changes and
       Annex 3 the proposed reallocations.
