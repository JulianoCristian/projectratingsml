"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Food Price\n            Response Project for Nicaragua were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory;\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: high level commitment, both by the\n            Bank and Government, is critical in preparing emergency\n            operations and increasing effectiveness. In the case of this\n            project, the multi-sector team composition was a strong\n            point. Based on this experience, the Government and the Bank\n            are in a better position to evaluate that an emergency\n            operation under Bank financing is more effective if it\n            finances a program that is already installed and reaches the\n            beneficiaries quickly. This Project had the opportunity to\n            inject resources into an existing program whose costs might\n            increase and whose ability to deliver services could decline\n            in a crisis. Another important lesson is that emergency\n            operations may provide an opportunity for crafting\n            longer-term responses to vulnerability. The project was used\n            as an opportunity to move forward the long-standing agenda\n            for developing emergency responses to food price crisis in a\n            country that constantly faces them and needs a comprehensive\n            long term response. Overall, sustained and continuous\n            fiduciary capacity building is needed for implementing\n            agencies in Nicaragua since they are critical to implement\n            emergency operations. The importance of monitoring and\n            evaluation should not be underestimated in emergency\n            operations. The Project had a strong focus and dedicated\n            institutional efforts and resources to use their own systems\n            to monitor the delivery of services on a timely basis."}, "docdt": "2011-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
