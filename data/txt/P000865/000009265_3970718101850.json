  at arresting and reversing the declining export production\n            and foreign exchange earnings by rehabilitating the\n            traditional export industries (cocoa, timber and gold\n            mining) through provision of spare parts, equipment and\n            materials and thus generating needed supply response to the\n            policy adjustment measures announced in the\n            Government's economic recovery program.  It also plans\n            to remove the immediate bottleneck to evacuation of export\n            commodities by improving the port facilities.  The project\n            will assist the Government in sustaining its economic\n            recovery program, and also in implementing policy and\n            institutional changes aimed at resuscitating the export sector."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
