It will strengthen\n            also the public debt monitoring, budgeting and forecasting\n            capacity and improve coordination between project needs and\n            public financing. It includes: (a) 11 years of\n            internationally recruited advisors/trainers (two advisors\n            for 3 years; two for 2 years; one for 1 year); (b) about 68\n            months of short-term consultants for training and analysis\n            and 6 months of assistance for project monitoring; (c) about\n            210 months of short-term consultants for project\n            identification, preparation and selection; (d) about 4\n            months of short-term consultants to parapublic enterprises;\n            and (e) about 18 months of overseas training. The benefits\n            expected from the project include: (a) improved screening of\n            development projects to increase their benefits; (b) the\n            establishment of a system that will improve the pipleline of\n            well prepared and directly productive projects; (c) better\n            utilization of domestic and external resources through\n            improved project implementation; (d) obtaining feedback from\n            expost evaluation to improve project design."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
