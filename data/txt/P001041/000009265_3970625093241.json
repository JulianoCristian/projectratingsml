{"cdata!": "The Livestock Sector Rehabilitation\n            Project, which will increase the productivity of the Guinean\n            cattle herd and thereby augment national meat and milk\n            production, will be implemented over five years and will\n            include three main components. They will involve (a) support\n            for the privatisation process of livestock service; (b)\n            strengthening of a reduced public livestock service; and (c)\n            provisions of about 19 staff-years of internationally\n            recruited specialists and thirty nine staff-months of\n            short-term consultants. The first component will be achieved\n            through: establishment of herdsmen's associations;\n            creation of an Input Supply Center for livestock inputs; and\n            provision of a small pilot credit component for the\n            establishment of private veterinarians, for setting up\n            animal production farms, for herdsmen's associations,\n            and for distribution of livestock inputs. The second\n            component will be accomplished through: upgrading of the\n            infrastructure of the central livestock department in\n            Conakry and 33 field offices with provision of equipment,\n            vehicles and basic materials; establishment of a training\n            center in Labe with a capacity for 40 students; provision of\n            fellowships for external training of high level staff, and\n            provision of equipment and vehicles for annual national\n            vaccination campaigns."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
