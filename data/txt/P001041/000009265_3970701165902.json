   Rehabilitation Project for Guinea was satisfactory. The\n            project achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, an appropriate macroeconomic framework is\n            essential to achieving success. Second, sound project\n            identification and preparation are helpful in recognizing\n            the major difficulties likely to be encountered during\n            implementation. Third, the frequency and regularity of\n            supervision missions and their composition of technical\n            specialists and representatives of co-financiers contributed\n            significantly to successful project implementation. Fourth,\n            a full and frank dialogue between the Bank and Government\n            was constructive and helpful in obtaining a successful\n            project outcome. Fifth, training can play a key role in\n            upgrading skills. Sixth, the mid-term review can be very\n            helpful in making midcourse changes during implementation to\n            reorient some project components. Finally, the timely\n            availability of counterpart funding will require particular\n            attention in the future."}, "docdt": "1996-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
