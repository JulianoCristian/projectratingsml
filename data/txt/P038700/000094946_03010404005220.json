These unsuccessful\n            ratings provide lessons in administering student loans, and\n            in providing equitable financing for higher education.\n            During project preparation, and appraisal, lessons suggest\n            the involvement of all stakeholders (including the private\n            sector), to uphold the public interest, and be subjected to\n            market discipline, in order to ensure a transparent\n            management, based on an analytical framework, and\n            assessments of socioeconomic profiles of students, setting\n            realistic targets. To this end, project design should ensure\n            diversified instruments for financial assistance, less\n            dependent on data, and the capacity of the implementing\n            agency, but more cost-effective. Lessons on project\n            implementation, supervision, and country dialogue, focus on\n            the effective provision of technical assistance, and the use\n            of more specific legal covenants linking the provision of\n            data on loan repayment, defaults, and arrears to a continued\n            disbursement, but which alerts the student loan bureau to\n            monitor these indicators."}, "docdt": "2002-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
