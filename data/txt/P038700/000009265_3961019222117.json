Specifically, the project\n            will: a) provide Jamaican students with adequate financing\n            options to pay for their share of higher education on an\n            ongoing basis; b) increase equitable access to tertiary\n            education and improve targeting of subloans; and c) increase\n            financial sustainability and administrative efficiency of\n            the Students' Loan Bureau (SLB) through a consolidated\n            student loan program. The project will support: a) the\n            restructuring of the SLB to focus on loan approach, improved\n            loan targeting and impact evaluation; b) the expansion of a\n            targeted student loan program administered by the commercial\n            banking system; c) the establishment of a grant-in-aid Fund\n            for students least able to pay; and d) the development and\n            implementation of a public awareness campaign to inform\n            students and their families of policy changes with respect\n            to cost recovery and financing options for tertiary\n            education, including the Grant-in-Aid program."}, "docdt": "1996-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
