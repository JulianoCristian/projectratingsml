and (b) improve environmental management in the\n            State, through development of a coherent State strategy for\n            local provision of water and sewerage services, investment\n            in priority basic sanitation infrastructure, and provision\n            of water and sewerage services, investment in priority basic\n            sanitation infrastructure, and provision of technical\n            assistance and training for municipal administrations in\n            environmental management.  In addition, the project aims to\n            begin mobilizing private resources for municipal service\n            provision, test cooperative regional service provision in\n            small, institutionally weaker municipalities and initiate\n            transfer of municipal management skills to the\n            less-developed North of the State. The project consists of\n            five components:  (a) an institutional development component\n            to upgrade municipal financial administration and improve\n            municipal management and environmental planning; (b) an\n            environmental infrastructure component to upgrade and\n            improve basic sanitation and related services, primarily\n            water, sewerage, drainage, solid waste, street paving and\n            lighting in the State's municipalities; (c) small pilot\n            programs to test private sector provision of municipal\n            services, and regional cooperative investments in rural\n            Northern municipalities; and (d) and (e) two studies\n            focusing on:  the development of a State-wide strategy for\n            local provision of water and sewerage services; and\n            medium-term options for municipal infrastructure finance."}, "docdt": "1993-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
