establish CVDB\n            as a development bank for municipalities and villages, and\n            provide a line of credit to finance eligible subprojects\n            over a two year period. It also includes a technical\n            assistance component to: (i) train CVDB staff; (ii)\n            undertake a study of the ways and means of increasing\n            productive projects in local communities; and (iii) provide\n            an advisor to assist CVDB's management. The project\n            would result in improved public services to meet basic needs\n            in water supply, health, and education and improved economic\n            infrastructure in villages and municipalities, thus reaching\n            some of the poorer segments of Jordan's population. The\n            main project risk is the complexity of coordination between\n            the large number of institutions and sectors involved.\n            Specific actions have been included in the project\n            implementation plan to minimize substantially this risk."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
