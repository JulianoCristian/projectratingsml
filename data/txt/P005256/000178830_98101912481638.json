It also includes a technical\n            assistance component to: (i) train CVDB staff; (ii)\n            undertake a study of the ways and means of increasing\n            productive projects in local communities; and (iii) provide\n            an advisor to assist CVDB's management. The project\n            would result in improved public services to meet basic needs\n            in water supply, health, and education and improved economic\n            infrastructure in villages and municipalities, thus reaching\n            some of the poorer segments of Jordan's population.
