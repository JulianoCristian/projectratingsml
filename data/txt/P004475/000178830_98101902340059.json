project seeks to support the\n            Government's development strategy for the fishery\n            sector by strengthening fishery technology and human\n            resources with particular emphasis on assistance to\n            small-scale fishermen. The project would assist in\n            establishing a national system of fishery training to supply\n            appropriately trained professional and technical manpower,\n            strengthen research, and improve the knowledge and skills of\n            fishermen. It would develop the University of the\n            Philippines in the Visayas, College of Fisheries as a center\n            of excellence for professional fishery training and\n            research, and would establish seven Regional Institutes of\n            Fishery Technology for technician-level training. These\n            institutions would train 30% of the professional and\n            technical manpower needed between 1979 and 1990 to help\n            develop the fishery sector. In addition, seven Regional\n            Centers for Fishermen Training would be established adjacent\n            to the Institutes. During the same period, these nonformal\n            fishery training centers would directly benefit about 10% of\n            the country's existing small-scale fishermen and all\n            the existing extension workers through in-service training courses."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
