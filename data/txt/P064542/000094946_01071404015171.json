enterprise reforms. The program contains four broad\n            components: 1) restructuring, and privatization of the\n            banking system, centered on the privatization of the three\n            large State banks, but including too, the resolution of all\n            troubled medium banks; 2) substantial strengthening of\n            banking regulation, and supervision; 3) full implementation\n            of a strategy to workout the large stock of classified\n            claims; and, 4) substantial improvements in the legal\n            framework, centered on the bankruptcy, and collateral\n            regimes, and, the laws dealing with corporate governance.\n            Reform actions, sought under the project, will improve the\n            stability, and efficiency of the banking system; promote\n            enterprise restructuring; and, attract foreign investment,\n            to ultimately contribute to employment, and output growth in\n            the longer-run. Nonetheless, there are risks involved to the\n            project, mostly due to the political situation: the broad\n            coalition could interrupt implementation of some project\n            components, if faced with adverse short-run effects of the\n            reforms, such as unemployment, or a very low price for the\n            bad assets. However, this risk seems to be modest, given the\n            advanced implementation stage of reforms."}, "docdt": "2001-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
