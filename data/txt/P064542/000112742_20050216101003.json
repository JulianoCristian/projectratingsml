        Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL) Project for the\n            Slovak Republic was highly satisfactory with highly likely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development impact\n            and satisfactory performances by both the Bank and the\n            Borrower.  The Slovak authorities remained strongly\n            committed to the banking and enterprise sector reforms\n            throughout the EFSAL implementation period.  Lessons learned\n            included: A) The loan was appropriately designed in\n            conjunction with the IMF SMP and as a multi-tranche\n            operation with a sufficiently long implementation period, in\n            line with the complexity and broad span of activities\n            envisaged under the operation. B) A key success factor was\n            Commitment to Reform by both the Slovak authorities and the\n            Bank. C) The project coherence with the Bank's Slovakia\n            AAA Program helped to define the pace and direction of the\n            reforms. In addition, these Bank activities deepened the\n            understanding and buy-in of the reforms needed, and helped\n            build institutional capacity to implement laws and\n            regulations. D) The project demonstrated that a challenging\n            and complex multi-sector adjustment loan can be successfully\n            implemented in a very short time period under the right\n            circumstances. Drawing on the lessons learned from the\n            EFSAL, the Bank could implement similar adjustment\n            operations/programs in other countries facing similar circumstances."}, "docdt": "2004-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
