"The Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan, in accordance with the Government's\n            enterprise and financial sector reform program, comprised\n            four components: a) restructuring and privatization of the\n            banking system, but also including resolution of all\n            troubled medium-sized banks; b) substantial strengthening of\n            banking regulation and supervision; c) implementation of a\n            strategy to resolve the large stock of problem loans taken\n            off the books of the state banks; and, d) improving the\n            legal framework, centered on the bankruptcy and collateral\n            regime, and laws dealing with corporate governance. While\n            rapid progress was made with implementation of the first two\n            components, selected reforms supporting implementation of\n            the last two components however, were noticeably slower to\n            materialize. Therefore, release of the second tranche\n            slipped from its original target date of early 2002, to well\n            into 2003. Nonetheless, the pace of reform implementation\n            accelerated noticeably during late 2002 and early 2003, also\n            due to Slovakia's pending EU accession in May 2004,\n            and, developments so far in 2003, and prospects for next\n            year are encouraging. However, important risks remain: on\n            the fiscal side, legislative changes relating to the\n            spending reforms still need Parliament approval, and,\n            outside the state budget, better control over municipalities\n            and the health sector is needed, to avoid further slippages.\n            Monetary policy continues to face a difficult balance\n            between reducing inflation, and containing speculative\n            capital inflows. Notwithstanding, progress against the\n            second tranche release, and its conditions specified in the\n            Loan Agreement have been met. In view of the overall\n            performance, and progress with the implementation of the\n            Program supported by the Loan, and in compliance with the\n            specific conditions of release as described in Schedule 3,\n            Section I of the Loan Agreement, the Bank has informed the\n            Borrower of the availability of the second tranche of EURO\n            70 million."}, "docdt": "2003-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
