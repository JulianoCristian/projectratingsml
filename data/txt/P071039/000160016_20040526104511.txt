Risks:                               Among the risks faced bythe credit are:

                                      0   The possibility o f the authorities either delaying the
                                          implementation o f some measures or even reversing their
                                          commitment to some parts ofthe Program. This could
                                          materialize ifthe authorities fail to convincingly lay out the
                                          expected benefits o f the Program anddefuse tensions arising
                                          from what could be perceived as a possible threat to vested
                                          interests (e.g., external audit strengthening, procurement
                                          reformor conflict o f interest legislation).

                                      0   Weak administrative capacity to implement andmonitor the
                                          Program.

                                      0   Macroeconomic risk arising from BH's still fi-agile position
                                          could materialize ifthe external environment deteriorates
                                          (lower foreign investment, persistentlysluggish external
                                          demand for BHexports, stronger than anticipated declines in
                                          donor aid). This macroeconomic risk is compoundedby fiscal
                                          risk related to the domestic debt overhang.

1.      This ProgramDocument describes a proposed Economic Management StructuralAdjustment
Credit (EMSAC) to Bosnia and Herzegovina(BH) inthe amount o f SDR 23.2 million (US$34.0 million
equivalent) to support the Government's structuralreformprogram. The Credit would be provided on
modifiedIDA terms o f 20 years maturity with 10 years grace period.

2.      ThisProgramDocument is fully consistent, and shouldbereadinconjunctionwith the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) o f the World Bank Group for Bosnia andHerzegovina, Report No. 20592 dated
July 12,2000, and the CAS Progress Report No. 24978, dated October 15,2002. The proposedEMSACis
also consistent with BH's Medium-Term Development StrategyRoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MTDS)
and supports a fiscal policy reformprogram for the transition from post-conflict aid-dependency to self-
sustained growth by: (i) reducing the excessburdeno f government inthe economy while increasing

complete, and the design and implementation o f reforms still has to overcome the complex political and
institutional situation, which arose from the DaytonPeace Agreement (DPA).3

4.       Betweenearly 2001 and late 2002, reform-oriented coalitions at the level o f State and Entitieswere
able to accelerate reforms and consolidate macroeconomic stability through sound fiscal and monetary
policies. Progress was also made instrengthening cooperation betweenthe two Entities,by strengthening
state-level institutions to enforce countrywide standards, and by harmonizinginter-Entitypolicies (e.g.,
reforms o f indirect taxation undertaken under PFSAC 2).4Inparticular, groundbreakingreforms were
achieved inthe defense sector, with the centralization of operational and administrative command and
control structures over all BHarmed forces at the level o f the State. However, the Governments failed to
make significant progress on some o f the most important structural reforms, such as strategic privatizations
or reformo f the social protection system. Elections inOctober 2002 saw the return o f the parties that had
been inpower for most of the post-war period. Since taking office, the Governments have reaffirmedthe
common overarchingobjective o f EUassociation and membership. Policy statements andreformplans
approved since then also signal a recognition that the path to EUaccession involves deepening reforms. A
feasibility study released by the European Commission inNovember 2003 concludes that opening of
negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) in2004 can be envisaged, on the
condition that BHmakes significant progress ina number o f areas identified by the Commission as
priorities for a ~ t i o n . ~

5.        Encouragingly, Entityand State government officials regularly discuss and coordinate the
formulation o freformpolicies. Among other factors, the MTDSFRSP process has proven to be an
effective vehicle to facilitate and institutionalize national policy dialogue and consensusbuildinga6The
reformprogram i s comprehensively presented inthe recently approved MTDS, which was officially
forwardedby the authorities to the World Bank inApril 2004 .




 The Dayton PeaceAgreement (DPA) provides for four levels o f Government. The State o f BH(the "State") is at the
     highest level, while the next level i s constituted by two Entities, the Federation o fBH(FBH),mainly inhabitedby
     the Bosniak (Muslim) and Croat ethnic groups, and the predominantly Serb Republika Srpska (RS). The FBHis a
      highly decentralized Entity, divided into 10 cantons and 80 municipalities. Incontrast, the RS is organized around
      a unitary concept o f government, and consists o f 62 municipalities. Since 2000, BHalso includes an autonomous
      territory, Brcko District. The DPA also establishes the Office o f the HighRepresentative (OHR) with a mandate
     to oversee the implementation o fthe peace accords, with executive powers on civilian matters, including
      legislative veto and impositionpowers, including the legal capacity to remove officials from office.

 See Implementation Completion Report o f PFSAC 2, Report No. P-73 18.

 These 16priority areas include: compliance withexisting conditionality and international obligations; more effective
      governance; more effective public administration; Europeanintegration; effective human rightsprovisions;
      effectivejudiciary; tackling crime, especially organized crime; managing asylum and migration; customs and
      taxation reform; budget legislation; budget practice; reliable statistics; consistent trade policy; integrated energy
      market; BHsingle economic space; and public broadcasting.

 More specifically, the Coordination Board for Economic Development and European Integration, which includes
      Prime Ministers andMinisters o f Finance from the State and two Entities, has met regularly since the new
      Governments have beenestablished, to discuss BH's development strategy (PRSP), as well as particular policy
      issues, such as indirect tax policyr e f o q labor market reforms, and domestic debt settlement.

B.        Recent Economic Developments

 6.       BHhasrecordedimpressive growthrates sincethe war (an average21percent inrealGDPgrowth
between 1996 and 2003 -see Table l), when compared to other post-conflict economies. Inthe
                                          even
immediate aftermath o f the conflict, growth was mainly spurred by intense reconstructionandrehabilitation
investmentinpublic infrastructure and private housing. Spending has beenpredominantly financed by large
 and sustained aid flows. Private transfers, which are estimated to have averaged 12percent o f GDP over the
 last five years, have also played an important role infueling domestic spending. More recently, while
remainingpositive (an estimated 3.5 percent in2002), growth has been slowing down, mirroringdeclining
official aid and stagnating manufacturing activity. The trend o f decreasing aid flows i s likely to continue, as
the strategic focus underpinning donor commitments shifts from reconstruction financing and support o f
refugee retum, to providingtechnical assistanceinsupport o f structural and administrativereforms.

7.        Money and credit. Due to the strict adherence to the currency board arrangement introducedin
  1997, inflationhas rapidly decelerated to single digit levels and has remainedbelow one percent in2002
and 2003. The inflation differential between the two Entities has also beenreduced. Dueto the introduction
of the euro and the associated reverse currency substitution it triggered,7 and to the successful restructuring
and modernization of the banking sector, non-government deposits grew significantly between2000 and
2002 (from 6.5 percent o f GDP to 9.5 percent), leadingto a credit boomin2002, especially credits to the
householdsector which more than doubled that year. Measures to tightencredit policy were taken in2003
inthe framework ofthe IMFStand-By Arrangement (SBA). These measuresappearto have achieved
deceleration incredit growth. Persistingindexationmechanisms, however, have allowed accrued andpaid
wage growth to exceed productivity, with an adverse impact on employment and corporate profitability in
bothEntities.

 8.       Fiscal outcomes. The post-conflict growth performancewas accompanied inthe initial phase by
 large fiscal and external deficits. Onthe fiscal side, donor-funded public investment programs inpart
causedthe imbalance. Inaddition, post-conflict recovery indomestic revenue collection also triggered
increases inrecurrent spending, especially on the public sector wage bill. Since 2000, fiscal stabilization
efforts have led, however, to an elimination of the budgetary deficit, which hadpeaked at over 9 percent o f
GDP in 1999 while the preliminary fiscal accounts posteda small surplus in2003 worth 0.4 percent o f
GDP (accruals, including grants). The reductionintotal spending from close to 70 percent o f GDP in 1999
to less than 50 percent in2003 (excluding municipal spending) was significant, even ifmost o f the
adjustment inexpenditure reflects the decline inexternally financed public investment. Similarly,
 accumulationo fnew arrears was curtailedto less than one percent o f GDP in2001, leadingthe way to a net
reduction inoutstanding payment arrears since 2002.

9.        External accounts. While fiscal imbalances have beenbrought under control, the external current
account deficit represents perhaps the single most important challenge faced by BH.Large import volumes
that accompanied the reconstruction periodwere only partiallycoveredby a subdued export performance.
While exports have grown faster than overall merchandise imports innominal (euro) terms since 2002, they
still account for only 10percent o f GDP. Merchandiseimports, representingabout a third o f GDP, have
more recently been spurred by the growth innon-reconstruction relatedinflows, whichhave accelerated
 sharply over the past three years. These types o f imports, believed to be largely consumer goods and
constructionmaterial (inaddition to oil products), surged in2002, fueled by the sizeable increase incredit

to households mentionedearlier. As a result, the current account deficit ballooned to close to 19percent o f
GDP in2002, and was mainly financedby aid flows (about halfthe gap), foreign direct investment and
private capital and a small draw down on reserves. In2003, the tightening o f credit policies appearsto have
restrained import growthleadingto a slight easing inthe current account deficit to about 17 percent o f
GDP.8Encouragingly, foreign direct investment increasinglyrepresents an alternative to aid financing o f
the balance o fpayments, signalingincreasedinternational investor interest inresponseto continued
macroeconomic stability. Net FDIinflows have postedconsecutive increases in2002 and 2003, reaching
over 4 percent o f GDP.

10.      Publicdebt. At the endof2003, BH's extemal debt is estimated to be sustainable. BHauthorities
were able to achieve successivereschedulingagreements, as well as the regularization and cancellationo f
old debts denominated innon-convertible currencies, while pursuingprudent externalborrowing policies.
As a result, extemal debt was brought down from 70 percent o fGDP in 1998to below 40 percent at end-
2003. Bank staff estimates the net present value o f total external debt at end 2003 to be equivalent to 25
percent o f GDP or 91 percent o f exports o f goods and services. As such, BHi s classified as a moderately
indebtedmiddle-income country. Virtually all BHexternal debt i s public debt, denominated mainly in
euros and U S dollars. The highlyconcessional terms o f donor assistanceprovided to BHhelped ensure a
relatively comfortable position withrespect to extemal debt servicing. The debt service profile deteriorated
in2002, asrepayments underIDAloans andthe IMFStand-By Arrangement have fallen due. As aresult,
the debt service-to-exports ratio reached 8.5 percent in2002, before easing slightly in2003. Inthe full
reform scenario described below, however, this external liquidity ratio i s expected to decreasebelow 5
percentby 2007. Inaddition, assuming the continuation of prudent external borrowing, the externaldebt-to-
GDP ratiowould declinebelow 30 percent over the projectedperiod.

11.      The public debt situation is complicated, however, by a large overhang o f domestic claims onBH's
governments. According to recent IMFestimates, potential domestic claims are in excesso f 200 percent o f
GDP. The majority ofthis potential debt relates to the break up o fformer SFRY andthe ensuingwar;
including claims against the government for the freeze of foreign exchange deposits immediately before the
war (equivalent to 18percent o f 2003 GDP) and a large amount o f war claims related to material losses as
well as non-material damages including death o frelatives and other non-material damages suffered by
veterans andvictims of the war (13 1percent o f GDP). Additional claims and contingent liabilities
originated after the conflict, such as unusedprivatizationvouchers that were issued to citizens and that have
not yet expired, as well as public spending arrears accumulated before 2002.

12.      As a result, State and EntityGovernments have recently committedto, within the framework o f the
IMFStand-By Arrangement, implementdomestic claims settlement plans, that wouldreduce the
outstandingburdeno f domestic claims to no more than 10percent o f 2003 GDP inNPV terms.
Quantitative frameworks for settling the claims have been established for bothEntities, including
combinations o f cashpayments, debt write-offs or securitization invery long-term bonds (20 to 50 years)
with extended grace periods andvirtually no coupon. Inparallel, State andEntityParliaments passed
moratoria on the court processing o fpending lawsuits related to war damages. While the moratoria are in
place and claims verification progresses, Entitylaws that would enshrine the Governments' settlement
strategy are being drafted and are expected to be adopted before the summer o f 2004. While these actions
are essential first steps inresolving this important issue, uncertainties aroundthe implementation o f the
settlement programremain, ranging from possible legal challenges to the debt write-offs to political

resistance delaying the passageo f the domestic claims settlement laws. Ifthe plan i s implemented as
currently envisaged, including the issuance of govemment bonds to settle part o f the claims, it would add
some 30percent o f GDP to the existing burden, so that total public debt (domestic and extemal) would
represent about 60 percent o f GDP at end 2004.

C.      Track Record in Structural and Institutional Reforms

13.     Since the end o f the war, progress instructural and institutional reforms has beenthe most strikmg
inthe financial sector andtrade policy, as well as inpublic finance. Anchored inthe currencyboard,
financial sector reforms have focused sequentially on the dismantling o f the payment bureaus and the
establishment of a modempayment system, the state divestiture from the banking sector andthe successful
entry of strategic investors, the consolidation o f the banking sector at low fiscal costs as well as the
establishment and gradual strengthening of the prudential and regulatory framework. Minimumcapital
requirements are being strictly enforced and the prerequisites for participation inthe recently established
deposit insurance system may lead to further consolidation inthe sector. The IDA Enterprise and Bank

Privatization Adjustment Credit (EBPAC) supported many o fthese reform^.^ Trade policy reforms have
been very pronounced with the negotiationofbilateral trade agreementsinthe Regionthat are compliant
with Stability Pact" principles andthe adoptionofthe most liberaltrade regime inthe Region." The
perceived lack o f success o f these trade reforms to translate into improved trade performance has, however,
raisedconcerns among some policy-makers about the desirability o f further liberalization, while
protectionist lobbies have called for more restrictive policies.

14.       Withrespect to public finance, the introductionof a modem treasury system at all levels o f
government (except municipalities) has contributedto improved spending discipline. Significant progress
was also achieved with respect to tax policy and administrationincluding countrywide harmonization, and
improved collection enforcement. Initial administrative reforms inthe area of public finance were
accomplished, mainly under the program supported by two Public Finance Structural Adjustment Credits
(PFSAC Iand II).    More recently, BHhas adopted a new legal framework for indirect tax and customs
administration, establishinga single, state-level indirect revenue administration that will manageunified
customs collection. Onthe expenditure side, significant reforms to the pension and health insurance
systems were carried out under PFSAC 11,but these are inneed o f further consolidation. Also, significant
spendingconsolidation and staff downsizinginnon-productivefunctions of government arebeing
implemented (see Letter o f Development Policy).

15.       Furtherreforms inthe public sector will focus onthe preparatorywork for the introduction of
Value Added Tax (VAT) in2005 or early 2006, a reformthat i s also widely perceivedto yieldpositive
externalities for the corporate sector, as it would improve the competition and governance environment. In
addition, revenue gains that would emerge from the introduction o f VAT should be used, at least inpart, to
reduce the overall tax and contribution burden.Onthe expenditure side, the pace and scope for further
rationalizationo f a costly multi-layer government structure, which still absorbs above 50 percent o f GDP
(including municipalities). Expenditure rationalization should also focus on maintaining control over the
wage bill inorder to free resources for operations andmaintenance as well as domestically financed public
investment. The proposed EMSAC will buildon the progress realized under PFSAC 11inthe areas o f
public expendituremanagement (see below). Inaddition, the Second Social Sector Adjustment Credit
(SOSAC II),    which will also be presented to the Board along with the proposedEMSAC, mainly aims at
supportingthe Government's program to reform the cashtransfer system and institutional arrangements for
socialprotection.

16.       The modest supply responseto the favorable trade regime (see para.13) indeed signals areas where
structuralreforms have been less successful, mainlyrelatedto enterprise reformand labor market reforms.
While an important massprivatization o f small-scale businesses was undertaken shortly after the war, it
resulted, as inother transition countries, indilutedownership and weak corporate governance structures.

The privatization of larger state-owned enterprises has lagged, however, with BHbeing an involuntary slow
starter becauseo f the conflict, and later losing ground due to lukewarmpolitical commitment.

17.       The business environment, while modestly improving inrecent years, remains characterized by
highbarriers to market entry for newbusinesses,proliferationofbureaucratic interferenceandvirtually no
formal market exit. The MTDScalls for an acceleration o f strategic privatizations, and improvements inthe
business and investment climate. Specific measures currently under preparation or initial implementation
include: reforms o f the business registration system, the establishment of a single registry for movable
pledges, and streamlining o fbusiness inspection. Importantly, harmonized bankruptcy legislation has been .
recently adopted inbothEntities.This package o freforms i s supportedby the IDA ongoing Business
Adjustment Credit (BAC)'*, inaddition to ongoing assistance to the strategic privatizationprogram.

18.       Finally, labor market rigidities have persisted, despite the important changes inlabor legislation
introducedin2000, which laidthe ground for substantially greater flexibility inlabor relations, including
the facilitation o f more varied and flexible forms o f employment, the simplification o fprocedures and
entitlements related to hiring and dismissal of workers, and the formal termination o f the "wait listing"
process inherited from former SFRY.Remainingrigidity inthe labor market i s driven by collective
agreementsor even firm-level policy, which retain outdated and costly management practiceswithrespect
to wage determination and labor re1ati0ns.l~As a result, wage inflationhas consistently surpassed
productivity, thereby affecting the country's competitiveness. The full impact o f the reforms, therefore,
remains to be observed inthe labor market.


D.        Current Macroeconomic Policy Framework

19.       As is outlined inthe MTDS, BH'smacroeconomic strategy aims at preservinga stable environment
that i s conducive to the implementation o f the structural reforms and which will promote private domestic
savings and investment. The authorities have made a commitment to maintain the currency boardand
pursue associated prudent monetary polices. The fiscal policy stance i s gearedat further consolidation o f
public spending to generate the public sector savings required. This strategy i s fully consistent with the
programthat receivedthe support of the mostrecent IMF Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), approved in
August 2002 and completed inFebruary2004. The macroeconomicperformance underthe SBA has been
satisfactory with respect to growth, inflation, the fiscal balance and reservesbuild-up.The current account
developments have not met expectations, however. Inaddition to observingthe program's quantitative and
structuralperformance criteria, important structural benchmarks were met, including the preparation o f the
domestic claims settlement plan, adherence to cash management rules of the pension funds, and the
strengthening o fbanlung supervisionrules.

20.       The BHauthorities have requested further IMF support and it i s envisaged that successful
completion o f the SBA will leadto an agreement on a successormedium-term program inthe course o f
2004. The programi s expected to focus on key macroeconomic challenges highlighted, includingthe
needed increase incorporate profitabilitythrough enterprise restructuring, and the establishment o f a
coherent fiscal architecture gearedtoward coordinatedpolicy formulation. The macroeconomic projections

E.      MacroeconomicProspects and External FinancingRequirement

21.     The medium-termmacroeconomic challenge faced by the BHauthorities i s to regainpre-war
output levels by the endof the decade, while moving from aid dependency to fiscal self-reliance. The
medium-term macroeconomic program envisaged under the SBA, reproducedbelow, i s generally consistent
with the one inthe MTDSand aims to reacharobust and sustainable growthpathwitha strong emphasis
on continued fiscal discipline to ensure policy consistency with the currency board arrangement. Underthis
scenario o f full implementationo freforms (and absence o f exogenous shocks), the share of investments in
GDP would remainhigh, although its naturewould shift from reconstructionto productive investment.
Growth, which would steadily accelerate toward 6 percent inreal terms until2007, would be mainly driven
by foreign direct investmentand stronger domestic investment, as well aspositive spillovers fromreal
exports growth. Inthe face o f steadily declining aid flows, BHwill have to achieve an adjustment o f its
external imbalance and establish creditworthiness inorder to attract commercial financing inthe medium
term. Exports would grow considerably faster than imports, as private consumption growth would remain
moderate, resulting ina marked improvement of the current account. Table 2 below highlights some o f the
key projections inthe full reformscenario. The scenario i s predicatedupon the acceleration of structural
reforms inthe corporate sector, which would boost domestic savings and investment.

22.      The MTDS also presents a low-case scenario, inwhich the implementation o f reforms i s slower or
yields a less favorable supply response.Real growth couldinthis case stagnate at around2 percent,
translating intorevenue losses and a more pronounced need for fiscal adjustment.

23.      Ifthe positivemacroeconomic scenariolaidout abovematerializes, BHwill still needsizeable,
althoughdiminishing,extemal inflows to support its balance o fpayments (see Table 3). For the period
2004-05, the total financing requirement would average about US$1.4 billion annually. Assuming a gradual
decline inproject-related financing, the increase of FDIinflows to 6 percent o f GDP by 2005, and
persistently highlevels o f remittances, a financing gap o f US$161 million would emerge for 2004-05, that
would be covered about two-thirds by IDA through its adjustment lending (the proposedEMSAC and
SOSAC 2, as well as the remaining tranche of the BAC), with the remainder financed through European
Commissionmacroeconomic assistance.

                          111.    THECOUNTRY'S     STRUCTURAL REFORM       PROGRAM


A.       TheMedium-TermDevelopmentStrategy/PRSP

24.      Inthe approved 2004-07 MTDS,the BHauthorities formulate three keyobjectivesofthe country's
development program:

         a   Create conditions for sustainable growth that would rapidly enable the country to reachand
             surpass its pre-war production capacity andreal income levels;

         a   Reduce poverty by some 20 percent;

         a   Accelerate EUintegration.

25.      Inorder to achieve these development objectives, the MTDSfurther identifies a set ofpolicy
priorities including(i)  buildingconsensus onthe reformprogram; (ii)   maintaining macroeconomic stability;


                                                      14

(iii)implementing the fiscal reformprogram; (iv) securing faster growth o f an export-oriented private
sector; (v) implementing public administrationreform; (vi) establishing sustainable systems of social
protection; (vii) implementing key sectoral reforms (education, energy, telecommunications and
amculture); and (viii)concludingthe Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU; and (viii)
achieving WTO member~hip.'~The MTDSemphasizes the key role to beplayedby fiscal consolidation and
public expenditure rationalizationto implement these policies. This also reflects the findings o f the Public
Expenditure and InstitutionalReview (PER) undertaken with the support o f the World Bank.'' Fiscal
reforms needto support the macroeconomic objectives as well as tackle issues related to efficiency, equity
and governance inpublic finance matters, bothwith respect to revenue mobilization and expenditure
policies.


B.      The Fiscal Policy Reform Program

26.     Inits sectionon fiscalreforms, the MTDSstates fromthe outset that afurtherreductioninthe
share o f public spending to GDP i s keyto achieving macroeconomic targets and financial sustainability.
The needed increase indomestic savings described above (para. 21), would be supportedby substantive
improvements incorporate sector profitability. However, this will take time to materialize at the desired
scale. Hence the need, inthe short term, to further raise, even ifmarginally, domestic public savings. The
corresponding medium-term target interms o f a primary deficit (excluding all grants and interest payments)
that would be compatible with sustainable levels of indebtedness i s estimated at around 2 percent o f GDP.
This can only be achieved at the price offurther rationalizationonthe expenditure side given(i) needto
                                                                                                    the
decreasethe prohibitive tax and contributions burden, and (ii)  additional expenditurepressure points which
could arise, even on a temporary basis, inrelation to possible downsizing costs inthe public sector, the
implementation o f the domestic claims settlement plan, the formulation o f a package o f social mitigation
measuresto accompany corporate restructuring, or further institutional strengthening of the central State in
the process o f European integration.

27.      Giventhat overall investment will need to remain robust (above 20 percent o f GDP), the decline in
externally financed public investment will have to be at least partly offset byhighercapital spending on
ownresources. Similarly, inorder for this investment (as well as past capital spending) to achieve the
expected economic rates o f return, expenditure on operations andmaintenance would also have to be
raised. Finally, even though tax reforms and improved tax administration i s expected to yield additional
revenues, these gains should, inthe mediumterm, be primarily invested inthe reduction o f the overall tax
burdenon the formal economy. Consequently, the bulk o f the expenditure adjustment will have to be bome
by areduction (relative to GDP) inother areas ofrecurrent spending, mainlythe wage bill.

28.      While it emphasizesthe needed reductiono f the share of public spending in GDP, the MTDS also
recognizes, however, that achieving this objective should not come at the expense o f the quality o f public
services delivered .Therefore, the proposedProgramaims at efficiency gains through the reallocation
among and within sectoral spending programs, the reassignment of intergovernmentalfiscal responsibilities
and the reinforcement o f the management and control over public monies. As described insection4 o f the
MTDS's chapter onmacroeconomic and fiscal framework, the authorities' mainpriorities with respect to
public expenditure reformcan be summarized as follows:        l6

         A. Rationalize public spendingby

                 0    constraining the public sector wage bill;

                 0    reducing spendinginnon-productive sectors;

                  0   reallocating savings to operations, maintenance andpublic investment;

                      reassigningexpenditure andrevenues across levels o f government with a view to
                      achieving greater efficiency and quality inpublic service delivery; and

                 0    achieving efficiency gains and greater equity inspending o f social services, such as
                      education.
         B. Further strengthening public expenditure management throughout the budget cycle by
                      improvingbudgetpreparation, and inparticular strengthening the linkages between the
                      budget andmedium-term policy objectives through the Medium-TermExpenditure
                      Framework (MTEF) process;



l6TheMTDSFiscalPolicyProgramalsoincludesessentialmeasuresrelatedtotax reforms, mainlycenteredonthe
     introduction o fthe VAT, and the reform o fthe admmistration ofcustoms and indirect taxation.




                                                       16

                   0     maintaining strict control over budget execution and improving reporting, including for
                         extra-budgetary funds; and

                         increasingtransparency, accountability and efficiency inpublic expenditure, primarily
                         through the establishment and implementation of a new legal and administrative
                         framework for public procurement.

29.      These priorities are aligned with the World Bank diagnosis as presentedinthe PEIR and lessons
learned from other countries. As can be seen from the observed expenditure patterns shown inTable 4,
some economic and functional categories o f expenditure stand out as prime candidates for expenditure
rationalization. Inparticular, wages and salaries absorb a large share o f total expenditure (about 33 percent
o f on-budget spending). This category lies significantly above what i s recordedincomparator countries o f
Central and Eastern Europe, whether measuredrelative to GDP or to total budget outlays. The MTDS is
also fully consistent with the PEIR with respect to the proposed rationalization o f spendingon public
administration, defense andpublic order and safety; the reallocationo f own-budget resources fkom wages
and salaries to operations andmaintenance, as well as to investments; and the policy and institutional
reforms inthe education sector to reduce fragmentation, and improve efficiency and equity.

30.      Cross-cutting reforms inintergovernmental fiscal relations will be closely linkedto the above
objective, inorder to further strengthen financial discipline and hardbudget constraints at the sub-entity
level, reduce horizontal and vertical imbalances and ultimately improve the delivery o f public services at
the locallevel. This wouldbe achieved by revising expenditure responsibilities inkey sectors (education,
health, social services), and, inparallel, reviewingtax revenue assignmentsand intergovernmentaltransfer
mechanisms. Finally, IDA experience inmany other countries suggests that strengthened expenditure
management and public governance can be powerfultools to enforce medium-term fiscal adjustment and
expenditure allocation reforms, inparticular with respect to budget preparationandthe determination o f a
medium-termresource and expenditure framework; financial accountability andtransparency interms o f
budgetexecution, control andaudit; and limitingconflicts or interest and opportunities for corruption
(especially public procurement).

31.      The Fiscal Policy Reform Programdrawn from the MTDSanticipates the support o f this proposed
Credit and i s describedinmore detail inthe Letter o f Development Policy (Annex 5) submittedby the
Borrower, as well as inthe attached policy matrix (Annex 6). A principal Program objective is to
rationalize spending inthe short termby imposing a constraining cap on the wage bill. Simultaneously, the
Programwill launch a process o f institutional and administrative reforms that aim at rationalizing
government inthe medium term through a redefinition o fresponsibilities acrossvarious levels. As a
particular sector priority, the Programfocuses on higher educationfinancing given (i)   the importance o f
education finance reforms to the overall development and growth strategy o f the country, given the
inefficiencies inspending especially at the secondary andtertiary level; and (ii) relatively advanced
                                                                                  the
policy formulation and dialogue onhigher educationfinance. Reformo f education financing would
contribute to the reduction o f poverty as the World Bank's Poverty Assessment (Bosnia and Herzegovina
Poverty Assessment, Report No. 25343-BM) found that poor households inBHhave lower levels of
educational attainment. Inparallel, this Programwill also include a series o f measuresto strengthen
expenditure management and governance over public resources. The various Programcomponents,
including those that would receive the support of the proposedCredit, are described inparagraphs 34 and
ff.

32.      Itshouldbenotedthat thisProgramis consistent withthe reforms of socialprotection systems,
which offer important opportunities for rationalization andreallocation o fpublic spending. The current
system mainly supports war veterans and their extended families who receive generous direct transfers and
further benefit from indirect subsidies (mainly tax andcustoms exemptions, coverage ofhealth fund
contributions, etc.). On the other hand, support to children indifficult circumstances and other target
groups for social welfare i s inadequate. Social protection reforms would receive the support o f the IDA
second Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC II),be presentedtogether with the proposedEMSAC.
                                                        to

33.      Finally, the reduction innon-productive spending, seeninthe MTDS as an important vehicle to
reduce the cost o f general government overall, is the focus o f assistanceprovidedby other government
partners with specific mandates intheir areas o f concern. With respect to military spending, a significant
effort o f downsizing has been undertaken since 1998, and has resultedina reduction o f forces by about
15,000 soldiers invarious rounds o fdemobilization through 2002. Another roundwas initiated in2004, in
the context o f BH's commitment to accede to NATO's Partnership for Peaceprogram. Similarly, analysis
of the intra-sectoralcomposition o f spending and existing inefficiencies inthe area o f public order and
safety i s also ongoing with the assistance o f the EuropeanUnionPolice MonitoringMission (EUPM).An
initial programof police force downsizing has already been initiated inthe Republika Srpska.
Consequently, these rationalization efforts to improve expenditure inthe defense and public order sectors
are not being supported by IDA assistance. The World Bank team, however, will remain associated inthe
policy dialogue on the correspondingseparateprograms as their implementationwill affect the overall
fiscal stance.

C.        The Fiscal Reformsto be Supportedby the ProposedCredit


First Program component:Rationalization of expenditureprograms and intergovernmentalf cal
arrangements


Sub-component 1:Public sector employment andpay reform

34.       Policy objectives. The policy target o fthis component i s to rein inthe public sector wage billto
serve objectives o f the dual macroeconomic stability and increased spending efficiency, while initiating
structuralreforms to modernize the wage determination system inharmony withmore general public
administration reform objectives. As such, the Programincludes short-term measureso f strict wage bill
control, as well as medium-termprospects for introducing a new wage determination system inthe public
sector and forging aheadwith more general public administration reform.

35.       Currentsituation andprogress to date under theProgram. The fragmented structure o fpublic
administration compounded by weak vertical coordination has led to inadequate staffing and duplication o f
functions. Patronage inappointments and the absenceo f an effective civil service training and development
systemhave also contributedto very unevenlevels ofprofessionalisminthe administration. Structural and
organizationalproblems, low civil service capacity, and the absence o f analytical information all adversely
affect the formulation and implementation o fpolicies. This assessment also reflects perceptions by the
general public, as confirmed inthe findings o f a survey among citizens, businessesand public officials
recently conducted by UNDP. "As noted above, the general government wage bill i s also financially
unsustainable. While the share o f government employees inBH's total population is not out o f line with
regional averages, the public sector wage bill i s unaffordable. Inthe Federation, public sector employees
make up about 20 percent of the formal sector workforce, and the wage billrepresents close to 30 percent
o f total spendingand 16percent of GDP. InCentral and Eastern Europe, by comparison, the average wage
billamounts to about 17percent o ftotal spending andonly 7percent ofGDP.

36.       Inresponseto this situation, the authoritieshave adopted in2003 abroadpolicyplatformfor public
administration reform(PAR), which on one hand lays out the steps to the formulation o f a comprehensive
PAR strategy (expected inthe Fall o f 2004), and on the other hand, includes a number o freform steps
leading up to the strategy. To informthe formulation of the PAR strategy, the authoritieshave launched,
with the support ofthe EU, a series o f functional reviews. Inaddition, among the initialpolicy steps already
taken, the State and Entitygovernments have prepared new civil service laws, which have been approved
bythe respective parliaments. The mainfeature ofthisnew legislationis the establishment o fprinciples o f
politicalindependence, transparency, professionalism, impartiality and effectiveness inthe civil service.
More specifically, these laws clearly define the scope of the civil service, mandate competitive recruitment,
and introducemerit-based promotion. Although the laws also regulatecivil service pay, they have, thus far ,
failed to introducereal reforms and merely confirmed the previously prevailing system. Only very recently
has a discussion on payreforminthe public sector begun(see para. 39 below).

37.       While functional reviews will provide guidance for a more fundamental review o f civil service
management and restructuring, the program also targets a more urgentmeasure to reduce the burdeno f the

wage billintotal spending, by formulating and enforcing caps over the wage bill at entity-level that could
result inachieving the desired reductionduringthe period 2004-05. To do so inrational fashion, the Entity
Ministries o f Finance have developed Budget Framework Papers(BFPs, equivalent to medium-term
expenditure frameworks) which propose a sustainable fiscal framework for the period2004-06. These BFPs
were presented and approved by the Entitygovernments inthe Fall of 2003. The next step envisaged was to
guide the annual budget preparationonthe basis o f the BFPs. Inthe FBH,the task was complicatedby the
fact that the measure would have an impact only ifcantonal authorities would comply with the BFP targets,
especially with respect to the wage bill.'* The EntityMinistryof Finance organized regular consultations
with cantonal counterparts. As aresult, the aggregatewage bill, computed from the Entityandcantonal
budgets, displayed an overall wage billreductiono f 3 percent with respect to the 2003 figure, and lies
within the target ofthe BFP(excluding one-off severancepayments accompanying downsizing plans). To
achieve this, the respective authorities useda variety o f tools, depending on their particular situation (e.g.,
pay structure freeze, downsizing incertain sectors and so on).

38.      Inthe RS, the BFP, whichwas approved inOctober 2003 and supportedbythe EMSACProgram,
foresaw areduction inthe Entitygovernment wage bill of about 4.5 percent. However, following
negotiationswith the trade unions, the Government decided to uniformly increase the wage rate o f all
employees o f budget institutions, so that the total payrollexpenses included inthe 2004 budget would post
a 4.4 percent increase. While the authorities recognizedthat this policy was not inline with the medium-
term orientation o f the BFP, they justified it on the basis of the substantial wage rate differential that
separates public sector remunerationinthe RS from that inthe FBiHor the State. This increase was also
not inline with the fiscal framework, and the RS Government hadto curtail other planned expenditure
items inorder to comply with the aggregate fiscal balance target under the SBA. Because o f the structural
implications o f this decision interms of the composition o f spending, this decision led IDA management to
refocus and re-dimension the proposedCredit as the appraisal was ending. The RS government, however,
decided to use the opportunity o f the increase to launcha more fundamental reform o f the wage
determination system which the Credit would support.

39.      The public sector pay system is characterized byarigidformula drivingthe formulation ofabase
wage which i s then supplemented by a host o f allowances. General administration employees, as other
categories of public sector personnel (teachers, judiciary staff, police, and so on), are also coveredby
collective agreementswhich further establish wage determinationrules. While the principles of the systems
are the same throughout the country, the parameters applied vary widely from one level o f government to
the other. At the level of the State, some o f the recently established agencies have developed their own
salary structure without reference to the current wage rates ingeneral administration. All inall, the wage
structure i s complex, disparate, and generally compressed, not lending itselfto reward performance or
managerial responsibility. Researchbythe World Bank has shownthat the level o f (paid) wages inthe
public administration i s higher than inmost other sectors (Labor Market in Postwar Bosnia and
Herzegovina,November 2002). Wider public administration and civil service reformmeasures will only
succeedifthe issue o f public sector pay i s addressed. The authorities inthe RShave recently recognized
the importance o f this issue and have initiated a reform o f the wage determination system by (i)    assigning
institutional responsibilities to assign the reform; (ii)
                                                        initiatingthe technical work to design a grading
systemthat will determine the pay structure; and (iii)  drafting a new law on salaries inthe public sector.

Nevertheless, to date a formal policy decisiononthe design o f anew wage structure has yet to be takenby
the RS authorities.

40.     Prioritiesfor 2004-2005 under theProgram. The authorities are committed to pursuethe reforms
inthis areaonthree tracks. First,theywill implementthe 2004budgetsas adoptedwithrespectto the wage
bill androll-over the BFP for 2005-07, with aparticular emphasis onwage billcontrol. The budgetsfor
2005 will be preparedby adhering to the guidelines o f the BFP. Second, the technical and legalwork on the
public sector pay reform that was launched inthe RSwill be completed and implementation will start in
2005. A similar reformwill be carried out at the level o f the State, while the FBHwill have launched the
reform, continuing the close partnership with cantonal authorities. More efficient use o f the available
technology to manage the payrollwill be introducedinthe RS and inmajor cantons (it already exists at the
level of the FBHEntity).Finally, other aspectsof civil service reformwill be pursuedthrough the
implementation o f the civil service law, inparticular by adheringto the transparent hiringrules o f the law,
as well as introducingperformance appraisal.

41.      Other measures included inthe Programto prepare medium-termreforms include (i)         the
establishment o f state and entity-wide public sector employment databases; (ii) completion o f the
                                                                                   the
vertical functional reviews inkey sectors (health, internal security, agriculture, refugee return and social
protection) with the support o f the European Union; and (iii) the completion and adoption o f the
comprehensive PAR strategy.

42.     EMSAC tranche-release conditions. The secondtranche-release conditions are spelled out in
SectionD(paragraph 83). Prior to the secondtranche, the authorities will have achieved:

         0   Effective budgetingand successful enforcement o f the wage bill caps for 2004 as evidenced
             from budget executionreports (Entities, cantons);

         0   Adoption o f 2005 budgets inline with the wage billtargets o f the MTDS and the BFPs
             (Entities, cantons);

         0   The State and RS governments have submitted to their respective Parliaments new legislation
             governing pay determination inthe public sector and introducing pay grade structures for civil
             servants and other categories of personnel employedbybudget institutions (RS, State).

Sub-component 2: Intergovernmentalfiscal relations

43.      Policy objective. This sub-component o f the programaims at reforming the intergovernmental
fiscal relationsby (i) further improving intergovernmentalpolicy coordination; (ii)    increasingbudgetary
discipline andaccountability across levels of government, throughout the system; (iii)    clarifyingand
rationalizing expenditure and revenue assignments; and (iv) improvingthe systems o f intergovernmental
transfers. The key expected outcomes are the improvement o f bothmacroeconomic policy coordination
and, inthe longer run, the delivery o fpublic services to citizens.

44.      Current situation andprogress to date under theProgram. The Constitution o fBH, as established
bythe DaytonPeaceAgreement (DPA), foresees a complex administrative structure of government where
key state functions (including security and fiscal powers) are performed by sub-national governments.
Under this framework, the two Entities, with distinct administrative structures, coexist: (see Footnote 3).
Most o f the taxation powers and decisions onpublic service delivery are retainedbythe Entities (at the
middle o f the government spectrum), while the operations o f the State (at the top) and o f municipalities (at




                                                      21

the bottom) are essentially financed by either vertical transfers or sharedtaxes. While not questioningthe
underpinnings o f the DPA, the PEIR and the companionreport on fiscal decentrali~ation'~       highlighta
number o fpendingissueswhich needto be tackled urgentlyinorder to overcome compounding fiscal
policy concerns. The latter, ultimately, impinge onboththe financial sustainability o f the system and on the
provision o fpublic services. The main current challenges to intergovernmental fiscal relations inBH
include (i) insufficient fiscal policy coordination across various levels of Government, due to the absence
of vertical andhorizontal cooperation among sub-national governments, which end up exposing the system
to unnecessary fiscal risks and economic instability; (ii) lack of hardbudget constraints at the sub-Entity
level, due to widespread off-budget operations, which have entailedlack o f fiscal transparency, and low
financial accountability; (iii) unfundedmandates, due to ill-defined expenditure assignments across levels
o f government, which have ledto inefficiencies by duplication and/or under-provision o f essential public
services; and (iv) vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances, due to a mismatchbetween expenditure
responsibilities and local revenue capacities, which, inthe absence of a well-defined compensatory transfer
mechanism, are increasingregional inequities and allocative inefficiencies.

45.      Progress to date has been concentrated mainly on improving fiscal policy coordination. Inthe
framework o f the indirect taxation reforms and the establishment o f a State-level Indirect Taxation
Authority, BHhas established a first formal institution for State-Entity coordination on taxation matters.
The ITA Governing Boardregularly gathers the Ministers of Finance from the State andboth Entities to
discuss and agree on the implementation o f the plannedmergero fthe customs administration, the conduct
of indirect tax policy and, most importantly, the introduction o f VAT, foreseen to be implemented by 2005-
06. Inthe FBH, as mentionedabove, regular fiscal policy coordinationmeetings with the cantons have been
held at the initiative o f the EntityMinistryo f Finance to discuss the BFP but also other fiscal policy issues.
Also recognizingthat policy formulation i s not adequately informedby the currently uncoordinated
statistical and macroeconomic planning services, the State government has submitteda draft Law on
Statistics to the Parliament, that will pave the way to a unifiedwork program for statistical institutes.

46.      Prioritiesfor 2004-05 under theProgram. This sub-component o f the Fiscal Program addresses
the four critical areas o freformof intergovernmental fiscal relations inBHwith various degrees o f
intensity. These are (a) further strengthening intergovernmental fiscal policy coordination; (b) increasing
budgetary discipline across levels o f governments; (c) rationalizing expenditure andrevenue assignments;
and (d) improvingthe intergovernmental transfers system.

47.      Intergovernmentalfiscal policy coordination i s to be addressedat various levels o f government.
First,inorder to complement the ITA Governing Board, the Programforeseesthe establishment of anew
joint institution for fiscal policy coordination gathering the Ministers o f Finance o f the State and Entities,
with a mandate to formulate nation-wide fiscal policy targets andagree onthe apportionment ofthe targets
betweenthe State and the Entities.The Statistical Law will be implementedwith the State statistical agency
playing a central coordinating role, while the Economic Policy and PlanningUnit(EPPU) will be
established to monitor and report on the implementation o f the MTDS.Second, the coordination between
the fiscal authorities at the Entityand cantonal levels will be strengthened, notably for the preparation o f
the 2005-07BFP and the ensuing 2005 budgets.

48.      Budgetaly discipline across levels of Governmentwill be strengthened by (i) adoptionby the
                                                                                           the
Entities of fiscally sustainable borrowing ceilings that will pave the way to the adoption o f public debt
laws, currently being drafted with the technical assistanceo f the U S Treasury); and (ii)   the submissiono f a


"Creatinganefficientdecentralizedfiscalsystem,June2003.




                                                       22

draft "Fiscal Responsibilities Law" that will set basic principles o f budgetary management andwill
attribute fiscal responsibilities, including sanctions, for budget managers and authorities, across all levels of
government. The adoption o f a FiscalResponsibility Law i s critical to BH, since it will provide the legal
basis for a meaningful implementation of the established budgetary guidelines andregulations.

49.      Rationalization of expenditure and revenue assignmentswill builduponprevious IDA reviews and
will aimat identifyingareas o foverlapping or inadequate assignment o fresponsibilities betweenthe State
and the Entities, and withineach Entity(vis-a-vis Cantons and municipalities). Costs (including budget
reallocation, and incremental expenditures of new institutions) for potential reassigned responsibilities will
be estimated. Also, a review o f sub-entitytax revenue allocation mechanisms will be undertaken, with a
view to reformingthe system inorder to reflect the new assignmentso fresponsibilities. The introductiono f
the VAT, inthe course o f 2005, will facilitate the reform. A programmatic, sector-by-sector approach is
called for, as the analytical work for suchreassignments is still ongoing (through the functional reviews
mentioned above, and the work undertaken inthe health sector with the help o f the IDA Social Insurance
Technical Assistance Project    - SITAP). Specifically  inthe areaoftertiary education, the reassignmentof
responsibility inthe Federation from the cantonal to the Entitylevel i s already part of the Program (see sub-
component 3 hereafter), and rapidprogress inthis area ofreformwill serve as a test for subsequent
reallocationof spending responsibilities inother areas, suchas primary health care, social assistance,
housing, infrastructures, utilityservices etc.

50.      Intergovernmental transfer systems will be reviewed and reformed towards greater transparency
that includes a coherent structure o fnon-conditional general, and conditional specific purpose (earmarked)
grants. Discretionaryintergovernmentalgrants will be abolished with all transfers being explicit rules-
based and, as far as possible, immune to bureaucratic andpolitical influences. These will be initiated by an
effort to supplement the tax-sharing and grants systems with compensatory transfer mechanisms that aim at
mitigatingregional disparities. Inregardto the Entitytransfers to the State, the agreed formula will be
established inthe framework of an ITArevenue allocation law for customs and indirect tax revenues.


Sub-component 3: Higher Educationfinance

5 1.     Policy objectives. The policy objective o freforms inhigher education finance i s to achieve greater
efficiency through rationalizationo f expenditure assignments and reformo f the university system.

52.      Current situation andprogress to date. Education spending inBHis characterized by the
consumptionof excessive resources with respect to output (intemal inefficiency), an inadequate
contribution to the economy and to livingstandards generally (allocative inefficiency), and inequity in
spending at the higher levels. Given the sector's essential importance for long-term growth andpoverty
reduction, the authorities plan to reform education financing through increasingintemalefficiency, with
any gains realizedto be reinvested inexpenditure restructuringthat would boost the effectiveness and
equityo fthe system. Ofparticular importance inthe context o fBH's proposedeconomic transition i s the
poor efficiency at the tertiary and secondary levels.

53.      While most primary graduates proceedto secondary school, more than forty percent (the largest
single group) enroll inthree-year vocational programs. These vocational programshave highunitcosts,
show poor results interms o f impact (employment and living standards), have very little general academic
content compared to other Europeancountries, and thereby preclude access to higher education. Inthe
Federation, where spending i s particularly high, education i s now a cantonal responsibility andthere i s no
inter-cantonal pooling o f costs, resulting inwide disparities inspending per student. As inother sectors,




                                                         23

relatively too much is spent on wages and salaries, with insufficient allocations for recurrent operations and
maintenance spending and for important non-salary inputs such as teaching material.

54.        The tertiary system consists o f seven universities all with full programs, represented by a fairly
loose affiliation o f faculties each of which has independent legal status and receives direct public funding
from the cantons inthe Federationand from the EntityinRS." This model leads to unnecessary duplication
of services, wasted resources, constrained interdisciplinary developments and severely restricted student
choice andmobility. The absenceo f universal fees, as well as teaching and examination practices inherited
from the former SFRY, also result inhighattrition (completion i s estimated at 30 percent at most) and
lengthy completion duration (e.g., at the University o f Sarajevo only 3 percent o f students complete on
time). The result is very highcostsper graduate.Inaddition, tertiary education spending lacks transparent
financial management, with respect to budget preparation, execution and auditing.

55.        Extensive discussions with all stakeholders have focused on developing a new legislative
framework. This calls for the consolidation o f faculties into universities, the transfer o f financing authority
for higher education at least at the level of the Entityand the introduction o f uniform financing and quality
standards for the whole of BH.The first step inthis process, the preparationby the State Government o f a
HigherEducationFrameworkLaw (HEFL) andits submission to the State Parliament, was achieved prior
to the Negotiations o f the proposedCredit. The legislative approval o f the HEFLproves difficult and i s still
ongoing. Inthe FBH, the technical work hasbeen completedto amend the Law on the Allocation o f Public
Revenues, that will allow for the transfer o f expenditure responsibilities to be funded from the existingtax
base.      Finally, following the example o f Tuzla University, the EntityMinistries o f Financehave developed
draft regulations governingthe inclusion of Universities' ownrevenues into the treasury system, a measure
which, once implemented, will allow for enhancedtransparency over the use o fpublic resources while
ensuring that the Universities have exclusive access over the revenues they generate.

56.        Prioritiesfor 2004-05 under the Program. Many o f the technical issuesrelatedto general
education will be further definedinan upcomingprogram o f general education supported by the European

programo f the new CAS, and would support the introduction o fper-student fundingingeneral education
and for the broadreform o f secondary education, inparticular to increase: secondary enrollments, the
proportion o f students attendinggeneral and technical schools rather than vocational schools, and the
general academic content o f bothtechnical and vocational schools. Over time these reforms should also
increase access to highereducation, especially for those from the poorest backgrounds. Inparallel, the
MTDS targets a sharp reduction inthe number o f occupational programs taught invocational schools with
a view to provide more flexibility and greater relevance to the needs of the labor market.

Second Program Component:Improve the management of public expenditureand thegovernance over
public resources


Sub-component I:Budgetpreparation

58.      Policy objective. Further strengthen medium-term budgetaryprogrammingthrough the regular
preparationo f Budget Framework Papers (ie., medium-term expenditure frameworks) that will improve
annual budgetingas well as enhance fiscal policy coordination.

59.       Current situation andprogress to date under theProgram. Budget preparation suffers from
weaknessesbothinterms of medium-termplanning and annual budgeting. With the support o f technical
assistanceprovided under PFSAC II,        bothEntities engaged in 1999-2000 inthe formulation o f BFPs. The
process was not, however, sustainedbecauseo f domestic capacity shortages. Budget preparation at the sub-
entity level suffers form chronic non-compliancewith the foreseen budgetary calendar. At the State level,
there i s still no legal framework to guide budget preparation inthe form o f an organic budget law.

60.       As described earlier, in2003, the Entitieshavere-launchedthe medium-termprogramming process
bypreparingand then adoptingcomprehensive BFPs for the period2004-06. The BFPs were also usedto
feed into the MTDS. The papers are fully consistent with the macroeconomic framework agreed under the
SBA, provide a comprehensive analysis ofpast spending pattems inbothEntities (including sub-entity
govemment and extra-budgetary funds) and outline priorities for expenditure policies, indicating the related
expenditure envelopes for functional and economic spending categories. Inthe FBH, the collection and
analysis o f sub-entitydata was particularly cumbersome, but given the regular consultation established with
cantons, cooperation has developed positively and the data collection i s expected to be facilitated for the
update o f the BFPs. InbothEntities, cooperationwith line ministries, where budgetingcapacity is generally
weak, will needto be strengthened. At the State level, drafting o f an organic budget law (currently entitled
as the "State Finance Law") has started. The law would cover the current gap with respect to regulating

budgetpreparation, but it would also supercede and improve the rules governingbudget execution that are
currently included inthe State Treasury Law.

61.      Prioritiesfor 2004-05 under the Program. As an entry point to address the dual challenge o f
expenditure consolidation and rationalization, the EMSAC-supported Program targets the strengthening of
the formulation o f fiscal policypriorities and the related strategic budgeting. Inorder to overcome
challenges to the sustainability o f the process, the Government i s implementing a technical assistance
programwith the support o f DFIDto strengthen the budget departments inthe Ministries o f Finance. As a
result the program supported by the Credittargets the institutionalizationo f the BFPprocess as well as its
linkwiththe annualbudgetpreparationsystematthe entityandcantonal levels. The BFPprocesswould
also be gradually introducedat the State-level in2005. The linkages betweenthe BFP and the annual
budgethas to be further reinforced, mainlythroughjoint presentation o fthe Budget (for adoption) and the
BFPs (for information) to the respective legislatures. Importantly, the State needs to adopt a State Finance
Law inorder to fill a critical void given the increasedresponsibilities that are being assignedto central
government.

62.      EMSACtranche-release conditions. The specific measuresthat are retainedfor the release o fthe
Credit's second tranche include:

         0   Enactment of an organic budget law ("State Finance Law") by the State Parliament;

         0   Preparationand enactment o f BFPs for 2005-07 and adoption of Entityand cantonal budgets
             for 2005 that are consistent with the BFPs;


Sub-component2: Budget execution, reporting and accountability

63.      Policy objective. The authorities intend to capitalize the progress realized with the introduction o f
the Treasury system inorder to enforce discipline inbudget execution, avoid any accumulation o fpayment
arrears and improve macroeconomic management through the preparationo fregular, timely and
comprehensive budget executionreports.

64.      Current situation andprogress to date under the Program. The introduction o f a single treasury
ledger and a single treasury account inbothEntities and at the State-level has greatly enhanced the
fiduciary framework for government financial management. Recording o f every transactionina secure
information system, modernization o f the accounting framework, automated internal controls,
reconciliation o f accounts balances with that o f thirdparties (banks), andreal time reporting capacity are
amongthe mainbenefits derivedfrom the treasury system. In2004, the treasury system was successfully
expanded to cover all ten cantons inthe FBH.Despite the increased spending discipline brought about by
the treasury system and its automated safeguards, internal control and audit functions are not clearly
defined, as has beenhighlightedinseveral reports o f the Supreme Audit Institutions. Fiscalreporting,
although much improved, remains fragmented and consolidated government accounts are not prepared.

65.      Supported by PFSAC 2, the first wave o f measurestargeting the introduction o f an external audit
function inBHhas achievednot only the effective operational establishment o f the Supreme Audit
Institutions (SAIs), but also gradual progress inthe SAIs' capacity to issue audit reports o f increasing
quality, with the technical assistanceprovided by the SwedishNational Auditor's Office. As the SAIs
established their credibility, a number o f issues have arisen however, pointing to remaining weaknessesin
the legal framework governing the SAIs, such as interference inwork programs, lack o f clarity and
consistency intheir mandates, unpredictability o f budget allocations and cash installments, and discretion
inthe appointment andremoval ofsenior SA1staff. A seriesofcomprehensive amendments to the SAI

Laws have beenpreparedby a drafting team and submitted to an advisory group for review. Also, the initial
experience with Parliaments' capacity to formally consider and discuss audit reports, and of governments to
take corrective actions, has also not been conclusive to date, and measuresto strengthen the impact o f the
audit are included inthe program supported by the proposed EMSAC.

66.      Priorities for 2004-05 under the Program. The Programforesees the continued implementation of
the treasury system, especially for cantons inthe FBH,where the systemhas only beenrecently introduced
and sustainability has yet to be tested. Ina follow-up phase, the program includes the further expansion of
the system inkey municipalities ineachEntity.Internalbudgetary controls will be strengthened, including
the adoption o f internal financial and administrativecontrol standards for all spending units that would
govern accounting and recording of transactions, enforcement o fprocurement regulation, separation o f
duties intransaction processing and approval, physicalcontrol onthe access to assets or the monitoring o f
commitments. The Programforesees initiating the reformat the State level, and later replicating the new
systemas relevant to Entityand sub-Entityadministration. To initiate the process, an internal audit law
would be prepared and adopted, while a review o f existing control systems will be completed. Inan
immediate follow-up to the Law, internal audit plans would be developed and submittedto the Ministry of
Finance for clearance   .Inparallel, internal audit functions will also be created, either withinthe spending
unitor within the responsibleMinistryofFinance, depending onthe sizeofthe concerned agency. The
respective role o f the spending agencies and o f a central unit (e.g., the Ministryo f Finance and Treasury) in
the internal audit function remains to be clarified as the Law is finalized.

67.      Withrespect to budgetreporting, and consideringthe expansion of the treasury system, all the
infrastructurewill be inplace to allow for the adoption and implementation o f a fiscal reporting mechanism
from the cantonal to the Entity-level (inthe Federation), and inturn from the Entities (and Brcko District)
to the State level. Responsibilities for the preparationo f consolidated fiscal accounts will be assigned.
Reportingrequirements for extra-budgetary funds will also be strengthened, inorder to feed into the
consolidated accounts.

68.      Withrespect to the external audit function, as a first step, the SAI laws will be amendedto achieve
goals o f greater harmonizationwithin the country, enhanced independence, clarity o f mandates and
responsibilities o f counterparts (Parliaments, Governments, etc.). The scope o f the SAIs mandate (e.g.,
status o f Brcko District, authority over cantonal budget execution or extra-budgetary funds) will be better
defined, andthe nature of oversight over the SAIs themselves needs to be clarified inline with international
(INTOSAI) standards. Subsequently, related legislation and regulation will be amended to fully ensure
formal parliamentary involvement as well as oblige governments or audited institutions to respond to
management letters with a plan o f corrective actions.

69.      EMSACtranche-release conditions. The specific measuresthat are retained for the release o fthe
Credit's second tranche include:

Sub-component 3: Transparencyand integrity in the management ofpublic resources

70.      Policy objective. Reduce the scope o f corruption and influence peddlingthrough the adoption and
enforcement o f improved legislation onpublic procurementand conflict of interest.

71.       Current situation andprogress to date. Several surveys undertakenby the IDA and others to feed
the preparation o f an anti-corruption strategy, provide evidence of extensive state capture and
administrative corruption which, among other adverse effects, increase the cost o f government andtaint the
decision-making process on matters directly or indirectly related to public resources. Inthe most recent
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS-2), undertaken inthe summer o f 2002,
firms were asked how problematic each o f 21 different factors were, fi-om access to finance and
macroeconomic instability, to corruption and organized crime. Inabsolute terms, the ratings providedby
firms inBosnia and Herzegovina were among the five worst inECA." The BEEPS-2 also confirmed that
the intermingling o f economic and political interests remains at the heart o fthe problem. FirmsinBosnia
were muchmore likely than inany other country inECA to make unofficialpayments in order to influence
the content o f new legislation, rules, and decrees. Both the National Anti-corruption Action Plan, adopted
inthe Springof2002, andthe anticorruption chapter inthe MTDS, whichhasreplacedthe earlier strategy
as the Government's primary strategy document relatedto fighting corruption, highlightthe importance of
regulation o f conflict of interest.23Among the priority areas that were highlighted by the BEEPS-2, public
procurement emerged as an area needingurgent attention. FirmsinBosnia andHerzegovina were more
likelythan firms inother ECA countries to report that bribes are usedto obtain government contracts. The
Bank's Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) corroborates these findings by identifyingthe
many loopholes inthe legislationand procedures governing public procurement, as a major potential and
effective source o f corruption.

72.      Most o f the legislative activities foreseen inthe 2002 Anti-Corruption Action Plan have been
mostly completed. These include the enactment o f Laws on civil service at all three levels, Criminal Laws
at all levels (introducing Money Laundering as a criminal offense, therefore creating mechanisms for its
effective prevention), accompaniedby the CriminalProcedure Laws, as well as Laws on Civil and
Executive Procedure. A Law on Conflict of Interest is inplace at the State level and implementation o f the
Law has begun. Untilthe Entities enact their own laws, the State Law on Conflict o f Interest applies, and it
i s currently being actively implementedby the Election Commission o f Bosnia and Herzegovina (ECBH).
Interms ofthe institutional component of the Anticorruption Action Plan, Courts andProsecutors Offices
at the State level were established. The ITAreformmentionedabove i s also providingan adequate
fi-amework for a more effective fight against tax evasion. As mentioned above, Supreme Audit Institutions
are operational, and their work has proven to be essential ensuringthe proper functioning o f budget
beneficiaries at all levels. Also, importantly, recognizingthat public procurement is a major source o f
mismanagement o f public resources,both interms o f governance and efficiency, a draft State Law on
Public Procurement has receivedEntityendorsement and has been submittedby the Council o f Ministers to
the State Parliament. The Law i s fully harmonized with the relevant directive o f the EuropeanUnion while
meeting the efficiency and transparency recommendations set forth inthe Bank's CPAR.



22 Ina separateanalysis, inwhich each of the problems were ranked vis-a-vis other problems ineach country, even
      stronger results were found regarding corruption as a problemfor Bosnian fm.Inother words, evenrelative to
      the other problems that Bosnian fmface, corruptionis among the most severe.

23 It should be noted that both the NationalAction Planand the PRSP document drew heavily on the results ofBosnia
      and Herzegovina -Diagnostic Surveysof Corruption, undertakenwith the support o f the World Bank.




                                                          28

73.      Priorities for 2004-05 under the Program. Public procurement reformthat is envisaged inthe
program includes the introduction o fnew procurement laws at the State and Entitylevels, strengthened
procedures and administrative control (see above), the adoption o f standardized biddingdocuments, the
establishment o f adherence to transparency requirements, and the definition of appeal procedures. The
policy dialogue on these measureswill be conducted inclose association with the EuropeanCommission
which i s providingtechnical assistance inthis area.

74.      Buildingonrecent steps taken bythe ECBHto implementthe Conflict ofInterestLaw, such as the
preparationo f detailed instructionsto accompany disclosure forms, as well as procedures to guide the
implementation o f the Law, the Programwould seek to raise the credibility and legitimacy o f conflict of
interest regulation inBH.This would be achieved by: supportingthe enforcement o f existinglegislation
which calls for (i) adequate fundingo f the ECBH, entrusted inthe law as the repository o f declarations and
chief enforcer o f the law; (ii)
                               preparations for training and workshops inadvance o f the 2004 municipal
elections; (iii)requiringall coveredministries and government bodies to forward copies ofthe declarations
providedby firms participating instateprocurements to the election commission for public posting. These
measures will increase the transparency o f interests o f firms participating inpublic procurement o f goods
and services, and facilitate the identification o f firms that violate disclosure requirements andmay be
subject to sanctions under the Conflict of Interest Law.

75.      EMSAC tranche-release conditions. The specific measuresthat areretained for the release o fthe

                                       IV.      THEPROPOSED        CREDIT


A.       Rationale for Bank Involvement

76.      The IDA strategy inBHwas discussed last bythe BoardinOctober, 2002, on the occasion o f the
presentation o f a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report.24The CAS Progress Report outlines
Bank support to the completionby the BHauthorities o f their Medium-TermDevelopment StrategyPRSP.
The MTDS,which was officially sent to the World Bank and the IMFon April 5,2004, will inturn guide
the preparationofthe nextfullCAS. The CAS Progress Report adheres to the same strategic objectives that
guidedthe implementation o f the FY00-02full CAS, namely (i)          strengthening institutions and governance;
(ii)fostering private sector growth; and (iii) buildingsocial sustainability. Inorder to support and sustain
reforms inthese three areas the CAS progress report proposes to rely on three distinct adjustment
operations, inaddition to the investment and technical assistancecredits. The proposedCredit will support
the CAS'Sfirst strategic pillar (institutional refom, governance), through the implementation o f a public
expenditure reform programthat would leadto fiscal self-reliance through expenditure rationalization (in


24 ReportNo. 24978.




                                                        29

terms o f a reduction inthe share o f public expenditure relative to GDP) and restructuring (interms o f
increased efficiency and equity).

77.     Link with lendingporlfolio. Inits base case, the CAS Progress Report proposed two new
adjustment operations through FY04, i.e., the proposed EMSACand SOSAC II. commitment o f these
                                                                                  Full
two SACSi sjustified byprogress inthe reforms to rationalize public expenditure (strategic CAS objective)
and overhaul social protection systems (first and third objective respectively). Further progress on the
second objective (private sector growth) will condition the remaining disbursement under an ongoing
adjustment operation (the Business Environment Adjustment Credit, BAC). The EMSACwould also aim at
dynamic consistency inIDA support as it would buildupon the numerous achievements realized under the
predecessor PFSAC11, either by expandingthe reformagendato areas that hadnot beenthe focus o f the
previous operation (e.g., education spending) or by supportingthe authorities inconsolidating and
sustaining the measures introduced under PFSAC 11(e.g., budget management, further strengtheningo f
governance over public resources, reformof intergovernmental fiscal relations, consolidation o fpension
and health financing reforms). As highlightedabove, the Credit would benefit from institutional capacity
buildingundertakenunder ongoingBankprojects (e.g., the EducationDevelopmentProject), while inturn
providing policy leverage for these operations. Finally, the EMSACwould lay the grounds for
programmatic support inthe next CAS, as several o f the Programareas underpinningthe Credit, such as
reforms to civil service management or intergovernmental fiscal arrangements, will require support over a
prolongedperiod.

78.     Synergies with economic and sector work. As demonstrated above, the Credit also largely draws
upon the findings o f analytical work completed under the last CAS, including the P E R and its companion
reports, including the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the Anti-Comption report and a fiscal decentralizationreport. The
EMSAC design is also influencedbythe analysis undertaken inthe recently completed Poverty
Assessment.


B.      Benefits and Risks

The CAS progress report appropriately classifies the EMSAC as highreward andhighrisk.The expected
benefits from the operation are:
    Greater public spending efficiency, where macro-fiscal stability would increasingly be ensuredby good
    management o fresources.
    The targeted reduction inthe weight of public expenditure will accommodate the authorities' medium-
    term macroeconomic program andprovideroom for a reduction inthe tax and contributions burdenon
    the formal sector.
    Wage containment inthe general government sector would also lead to stricter incomes policy inthe
    public enterprise sector and the formal economy ingeneral, thereby fostering BH's competitive
    position.
    Itis expected that efficiency gains wouldnot only be internalbutwould spill-over by facilitating a
    welfare-enhancing allocation o f resources, most notably inthe education sector.

    Clarified intergovernmentalrevenue and expenditure assignments would pave the way for adequately
    funded public service delivery.
    Increasedtransparency and accountability ingovernment transactions would foster efficiency but also
    improve the overall policy environment and sendpositive signals to stimulate private sector investment.



                                                      30

79.     Among the risks faced by the credit are the possibility of authorities either delayingthe
implementationo f some measuresor evenreversingtheir commitment to some parts o f the Program. This
could materialize ifthe authorities fail to convincingly explainthe expected benefits o f the Program and
defuse tensions arising from what couldbeperceivedas deflationary policies (e.g., adjustment inthe public
payroll) or a possible threat to vested interests (e.g., extemal audit strengthening, procurementreform or
conflict o f interest legislation). The MTDS process, which has relied on wide consultation, has already
raisedgeneral awareness o f the reformprogram and builtinitial consensus around it. Additional mitigation
strategies include IDAproposed interventionsinsupport of labor redeployment (inthe form o f the
proposed Second Employment Support Project). The slower than anticipatedprocess o f approval o f the
Higher Education Framework Law, demonstratesthe depth o fpolitical reluctance o f certain groups, even in
the presence o fbroader public support for the reform. Even ifoverall politicalcommitment i s affirmed,
overt or hiddenresistance by interest groups may arise against some o f the reforms advocated under the
EMSAC.Weak administrative capacity to implement andmonitor the programwill mostly be addressedby
the technical assistance providedby the Bank and other partners. Another riskmay arise from BH's still
fragile macroeconomic position, and threats to its stability that would emerge ifthe foreign environment
deteriorates (lower foreign investment, persistently sluggishextemal demand for BHexports, stronger than
anticipateddeclines inaid). This macroeconomic riski s compounded by fiscal riskrelatedto the
unresolveddomestic debt overhang. Continuedprudent macroeconomic policies that would receive the
support o f a successor IMFprogram and the orderly implementation o f the domestic claims settlement plan
would minimizemacroeconomic and fiscal risks.


C.      Coordinationwith the IMF

80.     The EMSAChas benefitedthroughout its preparation from close collaborationwith the IMF.The
last SBA program, worth 94.2 million SDR, was approved by the IMFBoard inAugust 2002 and
completedinFebruary 2004 fully disbursed. Performance under the programhas been satisfactory as
described inpara. 22 above. Uponthe authorities' request, it i s envisaged that the Fundwould provide
further support to BH's medium-termmacroeconomic program through a successorprogramto be
negotiatedinthe second half of 2004. The Program supported by the proposed credit i s expected to be fully
consistent and coordinatedwith the structuralreforms to be supported by the IMF. Second tranche release
will only be possibleifthe macroeconomic program i s on track as evidenced bya successfully completed
review o fthe successor IMFprogram.

81.     Collaboration with other donors, most importantly the EC, has also been actively pursued, both in
terms o f technical assistanceto support the Program's implementation as well as the coordination o f
structuralbenchmarks with the European Unionmacro-financial assistance.


D.      Negotiations and Board Conditions and Tranche Triggers

82.     The overall program to be supported by the proposedCredit will be outlined inthe Letter o f
Development Policy (Annex 5) and is summarized inthe attached Policy ReformMatrix (Annex 6). The
conditions that have been met prior to Negotiations and that remain to be completedbefore second tranche
release are outlinedbelow. Inaddition to the specific Conditions, the State andboth Entitiesmust maintain

37 Satisfactory BFPs for 2005-2007 would meet the same requirements as those outlined infootnote 27 for the 2004-

forum gathering the head of the executives at the State and Entitylevel. As aparticular feature of this
credit, the FederationMinistryof Finance will be responsible for overall coordinationwith the cantons for
those measureswhere action at the cantonal level i s foreseen inthe Program.

84.      Technical oversight ofparticular credit components will be assuredbyvarious existing
coordination groups or project steering boards. Most of the measuresproposedare supported by ongoing or
approved technical assistanceprojects. A chart o f administrative implementation and monitoring
responsibilities as well as technical assistance will be provided as an Annex to the final Program
Document.


F.       Financial Arrangements

85.      The Credit would be disbursedintwo tranches of SDR 6.8 million (US$ 10million equivalent) and
SDR 16.4 million (US$24 million equivalent) to a deposit account o f the State at the Central Bank o f
Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH). Disbursement would be made inEuros equivalent to the SDR amount of
the above tranches. The equivalent inConvertible Marks (KM) o f the entire amount o f all disbursements
will be transferred from the State DepositAccount to the budgetary accounts o fthe Entities inthe CBBH
and then transferred to the Treasury Account of the Entities inthe correspondingcommercial banks. The
first tranche (US$ 10million equivalent) would be disbursedupon Credit effectiveness. The second tranche
(US$24 millionequivalent) will be released uponreview by IDA that (i) macroeconomic program i s on
                                                                             the
track as evidenced by the successful first year review of the IMF-supportedprogram; (ii)    the overall
adjustment program is progressing satisfactorily; and (iii)  the specific tranche-release conditions have been
met as described inSectionDabove. Fromthe secondtranche proceeds, the Entitieshave agreedthat they
will transfer the equivalent o fUS$4million to the State Budget throughthe normal transfer mechanism.
Proceeds of the Credit will be used for approved uses only. Disbursements will not be linked to specific
purchases, thus evidence will not beneeded to support disbursements, nor will procurementrequirements
be necessary. Ifafter the Credit proceeds are deposited inthe Central Bank account, the proceeds are used
for ineligible purposes as defined inthe Credit Agreement, IDA will require the borrower to either (a)
returnthat amount to the Deposit Account for use for eligible purposes; or (b) refundthe amount directly to
IDA.The Borrower will comply with standardreportingrequirements ofadjustment credits. The
Association will exercise its right to receive audit reports on the Deposit Account after each disbursement.

86.      Interms offinancial monitoring, the Bankhasguidelinesonfinancial management requirements in
adjustment operations which are to be appliedto the proposed Credit. The government will maintain
accounts and records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that credit disbursements were in
accordance with provisions o f the Credit Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintainedina
form acceptableto the Association. The external auditor will conduct an annual audit o f the Deposit
Account openedby the government inthe Central Bankto exclusively hold the Credit proceeds. The terms
of reference o f the audit shouldbe acceptable to the Association. The audit will examine and report on the
disbursementsfrom the Deposit Account untilsuch time that all the Credit proceedshave been fully
utilized. Such audits will be submitted to the Association as soon as they are completed. The Association
may require a more extensive audit o f such records by independent auditors. The Bankwill complement its
increased emphasis on borrower public financial management inits analytic work and lending program
with stronger reportingand auditing arrangements over the disbursementsof adjustment loanproceeds.
These controls are not intendedto restrict or prescribe the uses to which adjustment loanproceeds funds
may be appliedby borrowers. They are rather intendedto provide assurancethat Bank funds have arrived at
their intendeddestination, havebeenusedinthe first instance for their intendedpurpose ofproviding
balance ofpayments and fiscal support, and will be subject to Borrower processes for managingpublic
resources which are known to and canbe reviewedbyboththe Bank and the Fund.

G.      PovertyImplications

87.     A recently completed poverty assessmentbythe Associationprovidesthe most comprehensive
analysis o f householdlivingstandards since the end of the war. According to survey data collected in2001,
about 20 percent of BH's population i s livingbelow a consumptionthreshold of about US$900 per year.
While these findings mightconclude that the post-conflictrecovery effort was relatively successful in
mitigating pervasive poverty, further analysis highlightsthe vulnerability o f a large share of the population.
Inadditionto the people livingbelow the povertyline, another 30 percent ofthepopulationis estimatedto
be near poor. Nearly 70 percent are poor inat least one dimension o f poverty.

88.     While it i s not directly targeted at poverty reductionactivities, the proposed Credit supports the
Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, and the measures underpinning the program are expected
to correct for inefficiencies and inequity inpublic spending.


H.      EnvironmentalImpact

89.     The proposedCredit will have no direct impact onthe environment. For the purposes of
Operational Policy 4.01, it has been rated Category C,and therefore does not require an environmental
assessment.

                           LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

This Letter o fDevelopmentPolicy summarizes the main features o four fiscal reformprogram,
 which is an integral part o f the Medium-Term Development StrategyRoverty Reduction
 Strategy Paper (MTDS) that our Governments recently approved. Our programrelies onthe
 continuedstability of a sound macroeconomic framework for the next four years. The recently
 approved final review o f our Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the InternationalMonetary
 Fundhasconcludedthat our trackrecordinterms ofmacroeconomic stability hasbeenvery
 satisfactory andthat the proposedframework of macroeconomic policies i s adequate. The
 Programdescribed inthis Letter is also fully consistent with the recommendations o f the SBA
review with respect to fiscal policy. To support the implementation o f our fiscal reform
program, we, the Governments o f Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation o f Bosnia and
 Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, request financial assistancefrom the International
 development Association under the proposedEconomic Management Structural Adjustment
 Credit (EMSAC).

I. MacroeconomicFramework:

Followinga devastating conflict andthe signature o f the DaytonPeace Agreement inDecember
1995, BHhas made progress inestablishingitself as a modem andviable state, among others
pursuingintegrationon dual tracks: (i)   internally, through increased harmonization o frelatively
autonomous sub-national entities while strengtheningthe coordinating functions o f the BH's
commoninstitutions (the central state); and (ii)  externally, by actively engaging into the
Stabilizationand Association Process (SAP) with the EuropeanUnion (EU), as well as pursuing
other avenues of international integration (Council o f Europe membership, WTO accession, etc.).
While the objectives o fpost-conflict reconstructionare perceived as havingbeen achieved to a
large extent, many challenges relating to economic transition are yet to be fully addressed, in
order for BHto regain sustained growth inthe economy andreduce unemployment andpoverty.
Our agenda for macroeconomic management and structuralreforms is detailed inthe MTDSthat
the State and EntityGovemments have recently approved.

BHhasposted impressive growthrates since the war (an average21percent inrealGDP growth
between 1996 and 2003) andper capita GDP has doubled since the end o f the war, but is still
estimated to be only at two-thirds o f its pre-war level. Immediately following the conflict, growth
was mainly spurredby intense reconstruction and rehabilitation investment inpublic

infrastructure andprivate housing. Activity has beenpredominantly financedby large and
sustained aid flows. Private transfers, which are estimated to have averaged 13 percent o f GDP
over the last five years, have also played an important role infuelingdomestic spending. Recent
growth has remainedpositive, buthas been falling, mirroringdeclining official aid and
stagnating manufacturing activity. The trend o f decreasing aid flows i s likely to continue.

BHhasmanagedto achieve solidgrowthwithout compromisingmacroeconomic stability.
Prudentfiscal management, and strict adherenceto a currencyboard arrangement have beenthe
mainpillars o f the Government's macroeconomic policy, supported bytwo IMF Standby
Arrangements, the second o f which we successfully completed inFebruary 2004. Anchored in
the currency board arrangement, monetary policy hasbeen successful inrapidly stabilizing
inflation, bringingit even below average EUlevels inrecent years. Regarding fiscal policies, we
have been able over the past few years to increase our revenue collection performance, while
alleviating the heavy burdeno f public spending inthe economy. However, despite the fiscal
adjustment and the decline inreconstructionaid, BH's trade and current account imbalances
remain at unsustainable levels. While we will continue to implement prudent macroeconomic
policies, restoring the country's competitiveness and reducing the current account deficit will
imperatively require further progress instructuralreforms.

To date, progress with respect to structural and institutional reforms has beenachieved mainly in
the areas o fpublic finance, the financial sector, and foreign trade policy. Withrespect to public
finance, the introduction o f modem treasury systems at all levels of government short o f
municipalities has contributed to improved spending discipline. Significant progress was also
achieved intax policy and administration (including countrywide harmonization and improved
collection enforcement), and we have initiated deep institutional reforms to prepare the
introduction o f VAT. We have also increasingly resortedto policy co-ordination mechanisms
between the State and the Entitiesinformulating our policies. For instance, this cooperation has
greatly facilitated the preparation o fharmonizedplans to reduce the large overhang o f domestic
claims on our governments. Similarly, State and Entityauthorities have worked closely together
to adopt fundamentalreforms insuch areas as defense. However, there remains significant scope
to further rationalize a costly multi-layer government structure, which still absorbs above half o f
GDP, with a particular focus on controlling the wage bill inorder to free resources for operations
and maintenance and domestically financedpublic investment, as well as redirecting our social
protection programs to those who need it the most.

Financial sector reform successes have included the early replacement o f payment bureaus with a
modempayment system, the privatization andrestructuring o f most banks at low fiscal cost, the
entry o f new strategic investors inthe banking sector, and the establishment and gradual
strengthening o f the prudential and regulatory framework. Finally, our trade policy reforms have
ledto the adoptiono fthe most liberaltrade regime inSouth-Eastem Europeandwe have signed
bilateral free trade agreements with nine countries inthe Region. However, we remain concerned
that this favorable trade environment has not yet materialized inincreasedprivate sector growth
and investment or inemployment creation. As we have emphasized inour MTDSthis signals the
needto accelerate reforms inother areas, inparticular the business environment, enterprise
restructuring andthe labor market, where our progress to date has been slower.

While legal frameworks for foreign investment and privatization have been established,
enforcement has been hampered byweak implementation capacity. Privatization o f small and
medium scale enterprises was accomplished, buthas resulted indilutedownership and weak
corporate governance. Most o f the large companies that could attract strategic investors are still


                                                  44

state-owned. The business environment has improved, but obstacles to enterprise creation and
bureaucratic hasslesto companies needto be further eliminated. Corporate governance rules
need to be changed inorder to provide the right incentives and obligations to company owners
and managers. Finally, BHhas only very recently adopted modem bankruptcy legislation so that
many loss-making corporations can only now undergo restructuring or liquidation, and free space
for fresh investment and employment growth.

Inthis context, our strategic macroeconomic objective is to preserve a stable environmentthat is
conducive to the implementation of the structuralreforms aimed at promoting private domestic
savings and investment. We will continue to implement the currency board and the associated
prudent monetary polices, while our fiscal stance will generatethe necessarypublic sector
savings. We will aim at further reducing the share of public spending to GDP, by continuing to
rationalize programs innon-productive sectors, while reallocatingexpenditures to productive
investments inhuman andphysical capital as well as targeted social transfers. We will also
strictly adhere to the implementation o f the domestic debt settlement plan inorder to eliminate
contingent risks on our budgets, and free the necessaryfiscal space to accompany potential short-
term social costs o f the needed structuralreforms. These structuralreforms will focus on
accelerated enterprise restructuring, including through privatization andbankruptcy, and on labor
market reforms, which will both contribute to improved competitiveness and the generation o f
productivejobs.

11.      Objectivesof the Fiscal ReformProgram

The MTDS outlines a programo f fiscal refoms (second chapter, section four) as a key
ingredient o fthe policy package that will achieve the macroeconomic objectives described
above. Our macroeconomic framework foresees a continued reductiono f the share o f public
expenditure inGDP, albeit at a lower rate than the one we have experienced since 1998. The
reason for this i s that the past expenditure consolidation has mainlyreflectedthe reduction in
post-conflict public reconstructionprograms that have been financed with the help o f external
partners. Future consolidation will mainly focus onrecurrent spending, which can only be
rationalized gradually. We wishto achieve this adjustment without jeopardizing the delivery o f
public services. Quite on the contrary, our Programi s also geared towards an improvement o f the
quality o f spending.We have identified a number o f measuresthat shouldyield efficiency gains,
through: (i) the reallocationo f spendingbetween, and within sectoral programs; (ii) the
reassignment o fresponsibilities and revenues across the multiplelevels o fBH's administrative
structure; and (iii) the strengtheninginthe management and control o f the use o f public monies.
Our programalso targets a reinforcement and modernizationo fthe tax administration, which
would eventually allow us to reduce tax and contribution rates and improve the governance
environment for our businesses. It shouldbe further highlighted from the outset that the content
and sequencing o f the measuresproposed inthis program are fully consistent with the related
priority for reforms identifiedinthe EuropeanCommission's report on the preparedness o fBHto
negotiate a Stabilization andAssociation Agreement with the European Union.




More specifically, on the revenue side, we will pursue the reforms we have initiated with the
adoption o fnew legislation establishinga single, State-level Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) that
will beresponsible for nation-wide customs administration, as well as the preparationand
implementationo f a Value Added Tax (VAT) to replacethe current sales tax.




                                                  45

Onthe public expenditure side, we will focus on the followingpriorities:

         Accelerate the implementation o f civil service and public sector employment reforms,
         while bringingthe weighto four aggregatepublic sector wage billto sustainable levels;

         Further rationalize and reduce spending innon-productive sectors, such as defense and
         law and order;

         Reallocate savings to non-wage operations spending, maintenance and public
         investment;

         Strengthen fiscal policy coordination among the various levels o f Government;

         Reassign expenditure responsibilities across levels o f government on a gradual, sector-
         by-sector basis, andreviewrevenue assignments inparallel to ensure adequate funding,
         especially for programs that are delivered at the locallevel;

         Improve efficiency and equity inspending onkey social services, such as education;

         Further improve medium-termfinancial planning and annual budget formulation;

         Maintain strict control over budget execution and improve fiscal reporting, including for
         extra-budgetary funds;
         Enhance transparency and accountability over the use o fpublic finds through new public
         procurementrules, strengthened external audit or the enforcement o f the conflict o f
         interest legislation.
The remainder o fthis Letter will detail the measureswe envisage for the reformo fpublic
expenditure policies, as they are the focus o f the proposedEconomic Management Structural
Adjustment Credit.

                1. PUBLICSECTOREMPLOYMENT AND PAYREFORM

Contextandprogress to date. We have over the past few years initiated a major reformo f the
civil service and the public administration. This has ledus to adopt harmonizedCivil Service
Laws at the State and Entitylevels. Three Civil Service Agencies (CSAs) have been established,
two o f which are well engaged into the implementationo f the Law, namely at the level o f the
State of BH(hereafter the "State") and the Republika Srpska (RS), where newhiringrules are
enforcedand civil service databases are being established. The appointment o f the Federation o f
BH(FBH) CSA Director was also completed, after some delay. More generally, we have also
formulated a platformfor public administration reforms ("public administrationreform
pledges"), that we presented to the PeaceImplementationCouncil in2003. While all o f these
reforms will take time to yield the desired results interms o f a performance-driven civil service,
we are confronted with a persistentlyhighgovernment wage billthat crowds out other important
items o f public spending. The share o f the wage bill inGDP or intotal public spending i s higher
than inmany neighboring countries. At the same time, the structure o fremuneration for
government employees is not satisfactory, as wages are highly compressed andthe wage
determination system does not lend itself to reward performance. Another complicating factor
relates to the wide disparity o f wage rates inthe public sector throughout the country. The
establishment of new institutions at the State level for instance, has led, inthe past to episodes o f



                                                  46

public sector wage inflationthat we needto bringunder control. Inaddition, we recognize that
government "rightsizing" i s needednow, to generatethe fiscal space needednot only for non-
wage expenditure, but also for institutional requirements that will emerge as we progress inour
integrationwiththe European Union.

Inorder to addressthesecomplex problems, we have first determined aggregatewagebilltargets
for bothEntities inthe framework of the Budget FrameworkPapers (BFPs, or Medium-Term
Expenditure Frameworks, MTEFs)that bothEntitygovernments have adopted inthe Fallo f
2003. Inthe FBH,the BFP has guidedthe preparation o fbudgets at the Entityand Cantonal
levels, and, although the BFP i s not yet more than a guidingtool, we are satisfiedto observe that
the approved budgets for the Entity and the Cantons post a wage bill adjustment commensurate
with the target of the BFP.Inthe RS, the approved budget has departed from the BFP with
respect to the wage bill, as we felt that the important wage differential betweenthis Entity and
the FBHor the State justified a moderate increase inthe wages o f the employees of budget
institutions. While recognizingthat this one-off measurewas not fully inline with the overall
policy orientation described inthe MTDS, we are ensuringthat the increase does notjeopardize
the fiscal targets o f our macroeconomic framework. We have, inaddition, usedthe opportunity
of this plannedincrease to initiate an important structuralreform of wage determination for RS
public sector wages. A working group has been appointed to prepare fundamental pay grade
reformfor civil servants, administrative support personnel and other special categories o f
personnel employed bybudget institutions (such as teaching staff, judiciary staff, etc.). The
working group has also begunpreparing draft legislationto modernize the wage determination
system ingovernment, andmake it consistent with the hiringandperformance appraisal rules
that have beenintroducedinthe RS Civil Service Law.

Another important aspect of constraining the fiscal cost o f the wage billrelates to the reduction
ofexcessemployment inthe public sector. Inline with our sectoral policy targets for Defense or
Interior Security, we have adopted downsizing plans inboth Entities, includingfiscally
affordable severance compensation. These measures are fully coordinatedwith international
partners active inthese sectors, such as NATO inthe framework o f the Partnership for Peace
program, or the European UnionPolice Monitoringmission. Further downsizing and staff
rationalization efforts will continue to be grounded inpublic administration reforms. Inthis
context, the RS Governmenthas completed a comprehensive review o f the rule books for internal
organization o f each o f its budget institutions. The rule books have all been cleared by the RS
MinistryofFinanceand, once adoptedbyGovernment, they will dictaterationalizationplans in
the RSgeneral administration. Inparallel, we have launchedimportant functional reviews with
the support o f the EuropeanUnion, that will allow us to calibrate "rightsizing" plans.

Priority reforms for 2004-2005. We will pursue the reforms inthis area on three tracks. First, we
will implement our 2004 budgets as adopted with respect to the wage billand continue prudent
fiscal planning for the next years. Second, we will implement public sector pay reform, initially
inthe RSand at the level of the State. We will also establish tools for improvedpayroll
management.And finally, we will pursue civil service reform through the implementation o f the
civil service law. Inparticular, we will:

         0    Strictly adhere to the wage bill allocations inthe 2004 adopted budgets. As it i s
             possible that we will rebalance our budgets inthe course o f the year, we will not
             increase the wage bill on that occasion. Any increase inwage rates will be
             compensatedby an accordingreduction instaff. Our budget execution reports will
             document that this objective has been met. The FBHMinistry o f Finance will



                                                   47

  coordinate budget rebalancing, ifany, at the cantonal level, and will report on budget
  execution at that level at the end of the year.

0 Inthe updateofour EntityBudgetFrameworkPapers(BFPs) for 2005-2007, we will
  further constrain the total payroll expenses, andprovide according instructions to the
  preparationo f the 2005 budgets. Selected increasesinwage rates that would be
  drivenbythe pay scalereform, willbe compensatedbydecreases inother wage
  levels or by a reductioninstaffing levels. The budgets for 2005 that we will present
  to our legislatures will be inline with the BFPs, inparticular with respect to the
  wage bill.

0 Downsizing efforts inthe general administration will be aligned with the more
  general public administration reforms. Inthe RS for instance, we will undertake the
  rightsizing o fgovernment inline with the approved rule books for the internal
  organization o f eachbudget institution. Inthe FBH, the CSA will launch the revision
  o f the rule books on intemal organization at the Entitylevel, and issue guidelines for
  a parallel revision inthe Cantons. The revision will also closely follow the
  recommendations o f the functional reviews that we will have completed with the
  support o f the European Union.

0 We will adopt new laws on salaries regulating the remunerationo f the employees o f
  budget institutions inthe RS andat the level ofthe State.We will do so by adopting
  modempay scalesthat will introduce a base wage covering large part o f the total
  remuneration. Allowances will only be retained on a selective basis. The pay scale
  will be derived from thejob categories identified inour civil service laws. For
  employees that do not have civil servant status, we will identifyjob categories and
  either integrate them inthe general administration pay scale or adopt special scales
  to fit special categories o fpersonnel. We will coordinate closely among levels o f
  government to implement this reform, with the aim to achieve better harmonization
  o f salary determinationrules and salary levels. Wage increase will be mainly driven
  byperformanceinline with the performanceappraisal systemthat will be
  establishedbythe RS CSA.

0 At the level ofthe State, we will address the unsustainable increase inthe total wage
  billandthe disparate arrangements goveming wage determination, bothrelatedto
  the establishment o f new institutions that introduce their ownpay scales and wage
  determinationrules. Our pay scale will be applicable to all line agencies. For those
  agencies with status of independence (such as the Supreme Audit Institutions or the
  Judiciary bodies) pay scales will be fully harmonizedwith those o f regular
  institutions.

0 IntheFBH,wewilllaunchthepayscalereformsincoordinationwiththeactivities
  ongoing inthe RS and at the State level. We will closely coordinate with cantonal
  authorities inthis endeavor, and adopt ajoint action planto introduce harmonized
  wage determination mechanisms.

0 With respect to payrollmanagement, we will establish public employment databases
  and selectively introduce a payroll application inour treasury systems. Inthe FBH,
  the cantons of Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica-Doboj will have introduced the payroll
  application in2005, as will the RS.

B.       Reform of intergovernmentalfiscal relations

Contextandprogress to date. The administrative complexity that derives from our
constitutional arrangements poses a number o f challenges to policy formulation and
implementation, particularly inthe fiscal area. These challenges include the needto establish
functioning coordination mechanisms between the two Entities and the State, and within the
FBH.Policy formulation is alsonot adequately informed, as ow statistical andmacroeconomic
planning services are still uncoordinated. An additional problem lies inthe mismatchbetween
responsibilities and financing, which leaves important public services under-funded, especially at
the local level. Also, giventhe tax assignment structure, we have been facing difficulties inthe
FBHo fimportantchangesinobserved revenue allocationswhile the expenditure responsibilities
remainedthe same. We also observe large discrepancies between regionswithrespect to average
public spending per citizen, and we lack the formal mechanisms to correct them. Our grants
betweenlevels of Government are too muchbased on ad hoc decisions and sometimes
constrained by the lack o f cash, which make budgetpreparationand execution difficult,
especially at the municipal level. We recognize that reforms inthe area o f intergovernmental
fiscal relations i s very much inits early stage, andthis Programwill launch a certain numbero f
initiatives that will needto be built up into policy actions inthe mediumterm. To date, our
efforts have focused on improving policy coordination, especially inthe context of the reform o f
indirect taxation, with the adoption o fthe ITA law, and the establishment o f the ITA Governing
Board that formally gathers, among others, the Ministers o f Finance from the State and both
Entities. Inthe FBH, the Ministryo f Finance has organized regular meetings with the cantonal
counterparts to discuss the 2004-2006BFP, tax reforms and other relevant matters. We are also
aware o f the needto strengthen the role o fmunicipalities as they are the main interface between
our govemments and our citizens. To that end, we have prepared draft laws on local self-
govemment inbothEntities, which comply with standards set forthbythe Council o f Europe.
Finally, we have been successful inensuring that our prudent macroeconomic and fiscal
strategies are also implemented at the sub-Entitylevel, by enforcing strict borrowingrules inthe
framework o f the Stand-By Arrangement.

Priority reforms for 2004-2005. We will continue our initial efforts to strengthen policy
coordination, while launching a review o f expenditure and revenue assignments inboth Entities.
We will also gradually establish transfer mechanisms betweenlevels o f Governmentbased on
transparent rules. Finally, we will continue to closely monitor borrowing at the local level while
allowing for selected financing o f sound localdevelopment programs within fiscally sustainable
targets. Our program includesthe following measures:

         0   We will establish ajoint institution for fiscal policy coordination (e.g., a "National
             Fiscal Council"), gatheringthe Ministers o f Finance o f the State and Entities, with a
             mandate to formulate nation-wide fiscal policy targets and agree on the
             apportionment o f the target betweenthe State andthe two Entities.

         0   We will pursue the ITA reforms, inparticular by adopting a revenue allocation
             mechanism and regulating the transfers from the Entities to the State;

         0   We will adopt the Statistical Law at the State level, appoint a Director of State
             Statistical Agency and establish the Statistical Council, inorder to prepare
             harmonizedwork plans for the statistical agencies andproduce reliable, country-
             wide statistics.




                                                  49

              We will also establish an Economic Policy and PlanningUnitreporting to the
              Chairman of the Council o fMinisters at the State level. This Unitwill coordinate
              macroeconomicplanning and monitor the implementation o f our MTDS.

              IntheFBH,wewillinstitutionalizethefiscalcoordinationmechanismbetweenthe
              Entityandcantonal Ministries ofFinance.
              We will enforce strict borrowingrules within each Entityin2004, and adopt new
              Public Debt Laws at the level o f the State and the Entitiesthat will regulate
              borrowing for all levels of government accordingto strict sustainability criteria,
              withinaggregateborrowingtargets.

              We will also prepare and adopt a framework law on FiscalResponsibilities that will
              define principles o f fiscal management and accountability across levels o f
              governments;

              Inthe Federation, we willreviewour revenue sharing arrangementsinlightoftax
              and customs policy reforms, as well as reassignment o f expenditure responsibilities
              (e.g., such as higher education, see below).


C.       Higher education financing reforms

Context andprogress to date. As i s highlighted inour MTDS, the level o f spending on education
i s highcomparedto the outcomes the system achieves. The inefficiencies are particularly striking
inthe vocational training andhighereducation systems, where unitcostsarehighandcompletion
rates low. Inefficiencies inthe higher education system are directly linkedto the excessive
fragmentation o f the system, with respect to the organization o f universities andto the public
fundingmechanism. With the exceptionofTuzla University,highereducationinstitutions are
organized around individual faculties which have legal and financial autonomy. Inthe FBH,the
financing for higher education i s organized by cantons, which is another source o f inefficiency.
Higher Education institutions are only loosely accountable for the quality o f their services or for
their financial management, whichremainsnon-transparent. We realize that BH's growth
potential i s closely related to the performance o f its higher education system. Similarly, as
secondary level enrollment will gradually shift from vocational trainingprograms to more
general secondary education, the higher education system will need to generate efficiency gains
and free the resources that will be neededto accommodate for increasednumbers o f students. We
firmly believe that this policy will also have an impact onpoverty as more childrenwill have
access to improvedpost-primary education.

We have achieved several important initial steps for the reform o f highereducation. First, the
State Government has approved a Higher Education Framework Law (HEFL) that mandates the
consolidation o f faculties into universities, introduces Entity-level financing for Universities, as
well as uniform financing and quality standards for the whole o f BH.However, the legislative
process i s still ongoing. Second, inthe FBH, we have preparedthe draft amendments to the Law
on the Allocation o f Public Revenuesthat will allow for the transfer o f expenditure
responsibilities to be funded from the existingtax base. Third, all universities are included inthe
Treasury System, with respect to the part o f their revenues receivedfrom the budgets, inline
with the existingregulations governing the Treasury System. Finally, we have also, following the
example o f Tuzla University, developed draft regulations governingthe inclusion o f
Universities' own revenues into the treasury system, a measure which, once implemented, will




                                                   50

allow for enhanced transparency over the use o fpublic resourceswhile ensuring that the
Universities have exclusive access over the revenues they generate.

Priority reforms for 2004-2005. Our program focuses on completing the needed changes inthe
legal framework governingHigherEducationInstitutions, as well as starting the implementation
of the Laws. Specifically, we will:

        0   Enact the State level HEFL,as well as prepare and enact Entity-level Higher
            Education Laws that are fully consistent with the HEFL;

        0   We will establishthe institutions foreseen inthe HEFL, includingthe State-level
            Certification for Information, recognition and Quality Assessment (CIRQA) and the
            HigherEducationFinancingCouncil, as well as the Entity-level Higher Education
            FundingBodies. We will provide adequatefundingfor these institutions inour 2005
            budgets;

        0   The 2005 Entitybudgetwill also include adequate funding for transfers to the higher
            education institutions;

        0   We will introducethe new higher educationfundingmechanisms, on the basis o f
            agreedper student funding formulas;

        0   Inthe FBH,we willhave submitted to Parliamentthe amendmentsto the Lawon
            Allocation o f Public Revenues, that will allow for the transfer o f expenditure
            responsibilities for higher education to be funded from the existing tax base. These
            amendments will be submitted for adoption before the end of 2004 so that the
            according revenues can be included inthe Entitybudget for 2005.

        0   We will initiate the legal and organizational consolidation of faculties into
            universities with a view to complete it by 2006;

        0   We will fully include the four faculties with the greatestnumberso f students fkom
            the Universities o f Sarajevo, Banja Luka, and Mostar inthe treasury system o f the
            relevant Entity,including for their own revenues accordingto the agreed rule books,
            for the start of the academic year 2005-2006. The Universityo f Tuzla will be fully
            integratedinthe Federation treasury system as well. Fromthe same date, all other
            universities or faculties will be integratedinthe Treasury system o f the Entity for the
            portiono f their revenues derivingfrom the Entitybudget, with a view o f full
            integration, including their own revenues, by 2006.

        0   Inorder to accessbudgetfinancing in2005, universities andfaculties will have
            submitted financial reports for the year 2003 and submittedto the Entity
            governments a budget for 2005 includingprojections for own revenues. Universities
            will also submit auditedfinancial accounts for the year 2004 beforethe start o f the
            2005-2006 academic year.

        0   We will prepare the introduction o f a policy on student fees requiring universities to
            collect an affordable and mandatory fee, with exemptions for a small number o f
            students on the grounds o f academic merit or financial hardship.

                                  BUDGET     PLANNING REFORMS



Context andprogress to date. While we have focused our efforts with respect to fiscal
management inrecent years on improving discipline inbudget execution, budget preparation still
suffers from weaknesses inmedium-term planning, as well as annual budgeting. Inspite of the
existence o fbudget preparation calendars, the prolonged consultationand approval processes
often delay the final enactment o f the budgets well into the new fiscal year. At the level o f the
State, we still needto finalize and submit to Parliamenta draft Finance Law (budget system law)
that will regulate the budgetpreparationprocess. We have, however, revived the medium-term
planningprocess, after a first, non-sustained attempt in2000. Inpreparationo f our MTDS, we
have preparedthe above mentioned Budget FrameworkPapers(BFPs) inboth Entities. The BFPs
were extensively discussedwith line ministries. Inthe FBH, as reported above, we have also
consultedwith the cantons duringthe preparationo f the BFP.At the State level, we have
preparedan advanced draft o f the new Finance Law that establishes a calendar for the
preparation and adoption of the budget. The Finance Law also requires the preparationo f a
medium-term financial planto guide the preparationof the annual budget.The existing Entity
Budget System Laws have beenrecognizedto be adequate. They will needhowever, to be
harmonizedwith the new State Law indue course. Recognizingthe importance o f the Budget
Departments inour Ministries o f Finance, we have taken initial measuresto strengthen them in
the FBH, as well as at the level o f the State.


Priority reforms for 2004-2005. Inorder to further strengthen budget preparation, we will:

         0   Adopt the new State-level Finance Law and prepare a medium-term financial plan
             for 20005-2007 at the levelo f the State; we will submit our 2005 budget to the State
             Parliamentwith the harmonized financial planannexed to it.

E.       Budget execution, reporting and accountability reforms

Context andprogressto date.We have made important progress inthe last couple of years with
respect to public sector accounting and payment reform. Inparticular, we have introduced the
single treasury account and the single treasury ledger at the levels of State, the Entities and all
cantons. The treasury system i s supported at all levels by modem database applications which
allow for real-time recordingand accounting. The systemhas also introduced a certain number o f
automated controls that have allowed for improved spending discipline. We have also improved
our budget reporting with respect to frequency and content. However, beyond the controls built-
inthe treasury system, internalcontrol andinternalaudit is oftenweak or non-existent, leadingto
insufficient protection of the assets our institutions manage, as has beenrepeatedly highlighted
bythe reports of our SupremeAudit Institutions. Also, we still needto enhance our capacity to
produce consolidated fiscal reportsbothat the level o f the State or the Entities (especially inthe
FBH).

Our Supreme Audit Institutions(SAIs), since their establishment in2000, have made
considerable progress inthe implementation o f their mandates. They produce reports on a timely
and regularbasis, and the content of their report is improving every year. There are, however,
loopholes inthe legislation goveming SAIs which affect their independence with respect to their
work program, the reporting lines they are subjected to, the coverage o f their mandates, their
timely access to budgetary resources and so on. Evenmore importantly, the considerationo f SAI
reports inthe respectiveParliaments and the follow-up by spendingagenciesremains inadequate.
Budgetreporting and auditing of extra-budgetary funds is also not as comprehensive as it should
be, consideringthe large amount ofpublic funds that these institutions manage.

Priority reforms for 2004-2005. We will focus our effort to maintain the adequate operation
treasury system, while establishing the legal and institutional foundations for internal control and
internal audit. The legal framework and impact of extemal audit will also be reinforced. More
specifically, we will:
             Continue to implement the treasury system at the level o f the State, the Entities as
             well as inall cantons. Inthe FBH, the Ministryo f Finance will monitor adequate
             implementation o f the systemthroughout the Entity.

             Prepare intemal audit laws inbothEntities and at the level o f the State.

             Mandate selectedbudget institutions that will prepare intemal audit plans.

             Publish consolidated budgetexecution reports for 20004 at the level o f the State and
             the FBH;
             Adopt the amendments to the laws on the Supreme Audit Institutions at the State and
             Entitylevel, whichwill enhancethe independence o fthe SAIs, clarify the coverage
             of their mandates, harmonize reporting deadlines with the budget laws, and
             harmonize the legislation as neededbetween the State and the Entities.

             We will encourage State and EntityParliamentsto establish Public Auditing
             Committees to ensure adequatereportingbetween the SAIs and the Parliaments. We
             will further assist as necessarythe Parliamentsto develop the rule books for the
             Public Auditing Committees, so that they establish a formal communication channel
             between the Committees and the corresponding Offices o f the Prosecutor.

         0   The State and the two Entitieswill include as part o f their final 2004 Budget
             Execution Report a report on the corrective actions taken inresponse to the findings
              andrecommendations included inthe last two publishedS A I audit reports.

         0    Similarly, budget execution reports from extra-budgetary funds (RS andFBH
             Pension funds, RS Health Fund, FBHHealth Solidarity Fund, RS andFBH
              Employment Funds) will include a summary o f corrective actions taken inresponse
             to the findingsandrecommendations o f the SAI audit reports.

                                              AND



Context andprogress to date.In2001we requested the World Bank's assistance in
identifyingpressing corruptionactivities. Followingthe report preparedby the Bank, inFebruary
2002 we adopted a comprehensive Anti-Corruption Action Plan. The planenvisaged actions that
needed to be taken on three mainfronts: legislative, institutional and educational. Inaddition to
that some other activities, such as communicationand cooperationwith civil society andmedia,
have been included inthe plan.

Two years later, the legislative activities have beenmostly completed. These include adoption o f
Laws on civil service at all three levels, Criminal Laws at all levels (introducing Money
Laundering as a criminal offense, therefore creating mechanisms for its effective prevention),
accompanied bythe Criminal Procedure Laws, as well as Laws on Civil and Executive
Procedure. A Law on Conflict of Interest i s inplace at the State level and implementation o f the
law has begun. Untilthe entities adopt their own laws, the State Law on Conflict o f Interest
applies, and it i s currently being actively implemented bythe ElectionCommission o f Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

Interms ofthe institutional component ofour Anticorruption ActionPlan, we have established
Courts and Prosecutors Offices at the State level. We have also formally established the Indirect
Tax Administration and appointed its Director, creating an enabling framework for a more
efficient and effective Indirect Tax collection ina unifiedway, therefore limitingpossibilities for
tax evasion. As mentioned above, Supreme Audit Institutions are operational, and their work has
proven to be essential inensuring proper functioning o fbudget beneficiaries at all levels.
Recognizingthat public procurement is a major source o fmismanagement o f public resources,
both interms o f governance and efficiency, we have prepareda draft State Law on Public
Procurement, which has received Entityendorsement and has been submittedbythe Council o f
Ministers to the State Parliament.

Priority reforms for 2004-2005. We recognizethat there i s a lot more to be done inorder to
minimize corruption inall areas highlighted by the World Bank's anti-corruption report, and we
have reflected our further commitmentsinthe MTDS. It includes a comprehensive set o f
activities to fight corruption, including those from the Action Plan, but also the newly established
ones. We remain committed to curb corruption, and inlight of that, pledge to take the following
actions:

         0   Adopt the Public Procurement Law at the State level, inline with the requirements
             for the EUaccession and the acquis communautaire. Inaddition, through adoption
             and implementationof by-laws, standard biddingdocuments and other implementing



                                                  54

  regulations (consistent with the Law). All conflictingregulation at the Entityor
  lower level will have been repealed.

0 We will have established the Public Procurement Agency and the Public
  Procurement ReviewBody and foreseen adequate financing for their operations in
  the 2005 State budget.

0 We will initiate and maintainregular publication o f all public biddingopportunities
  and the results o f the awards of the contracts, inaccordance with the provisions o f
  the Law on Public Procurement. We will also beginthe submission to the
  appropriate legislature o f annual reports on public procurement.

0 Ensureappropriate implementationofthe Conflict ofInterest Law, inorder to reduce
  corruption and influence peddling. Inthe initial implementationperiod, we have
  noticed some weaknesses o f the Law, and have prepared a set o f amendments to
  improve the Law, which have recently been adopted. Untilthe EntityLaws are
  adopted, the implementation of the Law rests with the State-level Election
  Commission. Inlight o f that, we will provide adequate resources to the Election
  Commission to ensure appropriate implementation o f the Law. As we believe that
  the law will be most effective ifits provisions are widely known, and as 2004 i s an
  electionyear, we will launch an awarenesscampaign aimed specifically at local
  officials and the media.

0 We will also harmonizeprocurement-related sections of the Conflict o f InterestLaw
  with the draft Public Procurement Law, bothto facilitate monitoring of compliance
  and to ease the burdenonbiddingenterprises. We will further facilitate monitoring
  of compliance with the public procurement provisions found inthe Conflict o f
  Interest Law by requiring that the declarations called for under Article 13 o f the Law
  be forwarded from the procuringbody to the Electoral Commission o f BH.
