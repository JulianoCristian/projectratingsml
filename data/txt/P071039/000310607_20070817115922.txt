F. Results Framework Analysis


Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)


The objective of the EMSAC was to support a fiscal policy reform program for the transition
from post-conflict aid-dependency to self-sustained growth which aimed at: (i) reducing the
excess burden of government in the economy while increasing expenditure efficiency; and (ii)
improving financial and budgetary management in the public sector.

The expected benefits from the operation as identified in the Program Document were to be:
    · Increased public spending efficiency contributing to macro-fiscal stability by good
      management of public resources.
    · A reduction in the weight of public expenditure needed to accommodate the medium-term
      macro-economic program in providing room for a reduction in the tax and social
      contributions burden on the formal sector.
    · Containment of wages in the general government sector, leading to a slowdown in overall
      wage inflation in the public enterprise sector and the formal economy in general, thereby
      fostering Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BH) competitive position.
    · Improved allocative efficiency of spending, particularly in the education sector.
    · Clarification of intergovernmental revenue and expenditure assignments leading to
      improved funding for local public service delivery.
    · Increase transparency and -accountability in government transactions to foster efficiency
      and improve the overall policy environment, thereby encouraging private sector investment.

                General govt deficit:     Lower fiscal deficit.                 General govt surplus:
                1.3% of GDP                                                     3 % of GDP

Comments        Mostly achieved. Inflation in 2006 includes a large one-off effect of VAT introduction.
                Year-on-year inflation in the first few months of 2007 was 2.5 percent.
Indicator 2 :   General government spending
Value           52.4% of officially-                                            48% of officially
                estimated GDP in 2003     Less than 50% of GDP                  estimated GDP
Date achieved   12/31/2003                12/31/2006                            12/31/2006
                However, the better than expected performance in 2006 has been followed by some
Comments        expenditure creep since late 2006 and early 2007.

Indicator 3 :   Government spending efficiency
                2003:                     Further reduce the                     Wage bill: 12.2 % of
                Wage bill: 13.7% of GDPwage bill relative to                     GDP.

Comments        Temporary wage bill cap was effective, but sustainability is threatened by the lack of
                progress on restructuring wage system.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC) for Bosnia and Herzegovina was
prepared during 2003-04 at a time when adjusting to slowing donor aid flows and the need to reduce and
better manage public spending were seen as critical for establishing the foundations for private-sector led
growth. The Credit focused on improving the policies and tools to better manage public expenditures and
aimed to provide some leverage for further harmonization of reforms between the constituent political
structures in the country. At the same time, there were several indicators of increasing cooperation
between the various levels of government in the complex constitutional structure of BH.1

Following a devastating conflict during 1992-95 and the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, BH had made
progress in establishing itself as a modern state, including through strengthening internal harmonization
among the various sub-national entities and increasing external integration with its European neighbors.
Important state level institutions such as a national central bank and a currency board were put in place.
Between 2001-02, the governments at the level of the State (BH) and its constituent Entities ­ Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) and the Republika Srpska (RS) ­ were able to complete two IMF
Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) and consolidate macroeconomic stability. A series of successful World
Bank adjustment credits2 had contributed to reforming and privatizing the banking sector, establishing a
very open trade regime, creating a modern treasury system at most levels of government, and
harmonizing tax policy and administration and initiating reforms in public finance. Of course, a large
structural reform agenda remained and collaboration between the various government structures
mandated by the Dayton Peace Agreement continued to be difficult.

Following elections in 2002, the governments oversaw the completion/preparation in 2003 of a national
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ­ the Mid-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) ­ through extensive
consultations across entities, ethnic groups, the private sector and other stakeholders. The prospect of
increasing collaboration among the Entities and the State on structural reforms was encouraging.
Preparation by the European Union in 2003 of a feasibility study for the future Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA) seemed to provide a focal point for strengthening national cooperation.
As such, there was a conscious decision by development partners to move away from a reliance on the
powers of the OHR to impose needed reforms and to encourage the process of political give and take
among the internal stakeholders.

The key macroeconomic challenges facing the country at that time were: (i) slowing growth as
reconstruction activities waned; (ii) the need to strengthen international competitiveness; (iii) the prospect
of sharply declining aid flows and ballooning domestic claims risked the re-emergence of fiscal
imbalances; (iv) bloated and inefficient government; and (v) a persistently large current account deficit




1 Under the constitutional framework resulting from the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina
comprises two Entities: (i) the Republika Srpska (RS) a centralized entity accounting for about one-third of the
population; (ii) the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) which is highly devolved with ten autonomous
cantons, each with its own Parliament and government, including Ministry of Finance; and the autonomous Brcko
district. There is a national level State government which has limited but growing powers, in response to the
demands of the EU Stabilization and Association process. On behalf of the main international parties to Dayton, a
High Representative (OHR) oversees the political aspects of the Dayton Peace agreement with sweeping powers to
pass or veto laws, ban political parties, and remove individuals from elected office and the civil service. These
powers were extensively used up to 2006 when a scaling back of the OHR structure was initiated. The schedule for
withdrawal of the OHR was later extended.

Credits, and the first Social Sector Adjustment Credit.

fuelled in part by rapid credit growth. Dealing with the latter two issues was seen as essential to
maintaining the critical currency board arrangement.

Growth in 2003 had slowed to 3.5 percent compared to an average of 5 percent during 2000-02. The two-
pronged approach of stimulating private sector investment through structural reform of the business
environment and alignment with Europe, and containing the public sector through expenditure reform was
seen as the medium term solution. The Bank's Public Expenditure Review in 2002 identified the
relatively large size of the public apparatus and resulting inefficiencies in public spending as a key
impediment to re-invigorating growth. It also pointed to rising spending pressures ­ namely from
institution building at the State level required as part of the Peace Process and for EU association, and the
pending resolution of outstanding war-related claims ­ as key risks that expenditures might in fact rise
higher.      These messages were well received throughout BH and reflected heavily in the MTDS
discussions and documents.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

In support of this public expenditure reform agenda, the Bank prepared the EMSAC to focus mainly on
containment of the public sector wage bill, while building the tools to raise the efficiency and
accountability of public spending across the main levels of government. The latter included reforming
wage-setting mechanisms and strengthening budget processes, treasury system and expenditure reporting,
internal and external audit and public procurement. There were largely in line with the fiscal policy
reform agenda outlined in the MTDS.

A much broader reform agenda for the EMSAC aiming to also rationalize expenditures at the sector level
was trimmed down taking into account both capacity weaknesses and ownership issues. From the
sectoral agenda, only the higher education finance reform remained for support under the EMSAC as a
test case for collaboration among the Entities to address the structural/institutional causes of inefficient
and ineffective sectoral spending.

At the same time, the authorities and the Bank were preparing a parallel policy-based lending
operations--the second Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC II) focusing on reform of very large
and poorly targeted veterans' benefits, pension and social assistance programs. Further, the Business
Adjustment Credit focusing on completing reform of the financial sector and starting reform of the
business environment was already under implementation. BH was viewed as not yet ready for the more
common multisectoral and programmatic Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs).                   Under the
EMSAC the majority of the reform areas were also supported by ongoing donor-financed and often
donor-led technical assistance (see below Section 2.2)

Throughout the preparation of the EMSAC, concerns were raised about the depth of commitment across
the various authorities ­ governments at the State and Entity levels, and in the Federation at the Canton
level. Several developments, however, encouraged the team and management to press on. First, the
completion of the consultative PRSP, followed by widely supported efforts to advance integration with
the EU, suggested that there was new, broad-based support for a national, rather than separate ethnic
agendas. Second, earlier progress had been made in a few seemingly difficult reform areas such as
banking privatization and trade liberalization, in part spurred by an alignment of international support.
There was also the prospect of a follow-on IMF program, more or less aligned with the EMSAC that was
expected to add leverage to the fiscal policy agenda. Third, some reform actions were formulated to
reflect individual action (and, as such, different levels of readiness) at the Entity level even while pushing
for some forward movement on coordination between the constituent governments. The most obvious
were the omission of a trigger on the FY04 wage bill in RS and of a public salary law in the FBH. Finally,
the 2003 elections appeared to return the same reform-oriented coalitions that had a track record for



                                                       2

reform. In fact, some hardening of ethnic positions had resulted but this was not apparent until very late
in the preparation process.

Finally, it is important to note that during the last year of preparation, the operations ­ EMSAC and
SOSAC II ­ were processed under some urgency aimed at capturing expiring IDA allocations in FY04.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the EMSAC was to support a fiscal policy reform program for the transition from post-
conflict aid-dependency to self-sustained growth which aimed at: (i) reducing the excess burden of
government in the economy while increasing expenditure efficiency; and (ii) improving financial and
budgetary management in the public sector.

The expected benefits from the operation as identified in the Program Document were to be:

    · Increased public spending efficiency contributing to macro-fiscal stability by good management
        of public resources.

    · A reduction in the weight of public expenditure needed to accommodate the medium-term macro-
        economic program in providing room for a reduction in the tax and social contributions burden on
        the formal sector.

    · Containment of wages in the general government sector, leading to a slowdown in overall wage
        inflation in the public enterprise sector and the formal economy in general, thereby fostering
        BH's competitive position.

    · Improved allocative efficiency of spending, particularly in the education sector.

    · Clarification of intergovernmental revenue and expenditure assignments leading to improved
        funding for local public service delivery.

    · Increase transparency and -accountability in government transactions to foster efficiency and
        improve the overall policy environment, thereby encouraging private sector investment.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

There were no formal changes in the program development objective or key indicators during the
implementation of the program.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The first component of the Credit aiming to "reduce the excess burden of government in the economy
while increasing expenditure efficiency" had three sub-component areas of reform:

    · The first sub-component on public sector employment and pay reform aimed at reigning in the
        public sector wage bill, while initiating structural reforms to modernize the wage determination
        system in harmony with a more general public administration reform program

    · The second sub-component aimed at reforming inter-governmental fiscal relations by: (i) further
        improving intergovernmental policy coordination; (ii) increasing budgetary discipline and


                                                     3

         accountability across levels of government; (iii) clarifying and rationalizing expenditure and
         revenue assignments; and (iv) improving the systems of intergovernmental transfers.

    · The third sub-component focused on reforms in higher education finance through rationalization
         of expenditure assignments and reform of the university system.

The second program component on "improving financial and budgetary management in the public sector"
also had three sub-components:

    · The first sub-component aimed at further strengthening medium-term budgetary programming
         through the regular preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks to improve annual
         budgeting and enhance fiscal policy coordination.

    · The second sub-component on budget execution, reporting and accountability aimed to capitalize
         on the progress made with introduction of the Treasury system to enforce discipline in budget
         execution, non-accumulation of payment arrears and preparation of regular, timely and
         comprehensive budget execution reports. It also supported the strengthening of internal and
         external audit.

    · The final sub-component aimed at increasing transparency and integrity in the management of
         public resources and to reduce corruption through the adoption and enforcement of improved
         legislation on public procurement and conflict of interest.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

During the program, there were several shifts in the commitments required on higher education reform.
The first shift during the tail end of preparation was that the Government was required only to submit a
law to Parliament in the first tranche rather than have a law passed. After that, however, policy shifts
were made to require harmonized financing arrangements at the State rather than Entity level. Earlier
conditions related to consolidating faculties into universities and placing the universities on the Treasury
system were retained. When the revised proposal faced insurmountable opposition, it was dropped in
favor of strengthening governance of higher education institutions in line with the Europe-wide Bologna
process. 3 This was done because, in the view of the Bank and other key players in the development
community, the earlier issue faced intractable political opposition because of ethnic interests. However,
this shift ultimately met with the same internal political divisions about how functions (on licensing and
accreditation) should be distributed between the State and the Entities (see Section 2.2 for a full
discussion). Because the second tranche never came up for disbursement and was eventually cancelled,
this last policy shift was never presented for Board approval, either as a waiver or amendment.

1.6 Other significant changes

The closing date of the Credit was extended from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 to allow
additional time for the Government to complete three outstanding conditions related to reform of higher




3The Bologna Declaration mandates a series of reforms to improve the quality of European higher education. Key
priorities include harmonization of the degree structure, implementation of a credit-based course system, recognition
of degrees and study periods, and improvements in quality assurance.

education and public sector salary structures and the strengthening of internal audit in the public sector.
In December 2006, the Credit was allowed to lapse and the second tranche of SDR 16.4 million (US$24
million equivalent) was cancelled.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

After just under two years following the release of the first tranche, the Credit was allowed to close
without disbursement of the second tranche owing to non-fulfillment of triggers relating to internal audit,
public pay structure reform and higher education reform. The closing date of the Credit had already been
extended in an effort to allow for political compromises to be reached on internal audit and higher
education, and to allow for technical work to proceed jointly on internal audit and individually at the State
and Entity levels on the public pay structure. Although good progress was being made on internal audit,
the last minute derailment of a difficult compromise on higher education, delays in advancing structural
reforms overall (associated with the election in late 2006) and a slow but perceptible reversal in fiscal
policy evidenced by creeping expenditures, led the team and management to let the Credit to lapse.

With respect to the other triggers and several of the benchmarks, good progress had been made both
through the actions supported by the Credit and from subsequent follow-through by the authorities in a
number of areas.      These include measurable reduction in spending, broad expenditure control and
reallocation, revenue assignments, budget reform, public procurement and external audit. A good start
has been made on national fiscal coordination but there have been delays in completing the
institutionalization of this activity and renewed effort is needed. Moreover, macroeconomic performance
has been strong.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

The most important factor affecting implementation was the development context. At the time of the
Credit, there had been a conscious retreat by development partners from relying on the interventionist
powers of the OHR under the Dayton Peace Agreement to impose reform. BH was seen to be ready to
reach internal political consensus and drive its own reform implementation. This optimism may have led
to an overload of the reform agenda with politically difficult reforms by several donors, including the
Bank. This risk was recognized and documented during preparation, but the mitigating factors, ex-post,
were overstated.     What eventually emerged was varying levels of ownership and cooperation between
and within the Entities, and later a dramatic slowdown in reform efforts as the macroeconomic situation
improved and the short run economic imperatives for reform subsided.

In terms of the EMSAC, this slowdown manifested itself in little or no progress on reform of the salary
structure and higher education.         In higher education reform, the authorities were unable to secure
Parliamentary approval of a harmonized financing arrangement. The reform initially focused on the
consolidation of the myriad (and very powerful) higher education faculties into universities to allow for
better spending efficiency, and to mandate Entity-level financing of higher education to allow for more
equity in spending. The first attempt to pass an agreed law, prior to Board approval, was derailed in part
because one group sought State-, rather than Entity-level control of higher education financing. In late
2004, another version was drafted shifting financial responsibility to the State level but was never
submitted to the House of Peoples (State parliament) by the Council of Ministers.

Following the reconfirmation of Bologna Process in May 2005 and at the insistence of the wider donor
community, a high level retreat between the government and the World Bank was held in October 2005.
At this retreat, it was agreed that the Higher Education Law could focus on implementing the Bologna
reforms, consolidation of faculties, and moving university budgets onto the treasury ­ in effect leaving the
resolution of financing responsibilities that had been the EMSAC's main agenda, for a later stage. It is
important to note that implementing the above mentioned reforms, even without financing, would have
gone a long way toward meeting the Credit's development objectives in the area of education. However,
a similar disagreement over State- versus Entity-level powers, this time over accreditation of education
institutions also derailed this new effort. A parliamentary committee refused to send the draft law to the
Parliament for vote in September 2006, just prior to the October 1 presidential and parliamentary



                                                           7

elections. In mid-June 2007, the lower house of the state parliament has passed the HE law. There are
risks that the law will not be passed by the upper house, however, reflecting the same tensions that
derailed the draft law before.

There are several differences which may help to account for whether the authorities managed to agree on
other coordinated reforms. First, the consistency of the message from development partners, especially
the EU, seems to have been critical. With the reform of indirect revenue, the key partners were on the
same page throughout the preparation. On public procurement reform, the Bank and the EU came to an
early compromise over some of the key issues. However, in higher education, the Bank together with
OSCE and Council of Europe were the early partners and support was focused on improving spending
efficiency.   At some point, the passage of a higher education law became a part of the broader
harmonization agenda and triggered the direction of the OHR, OSCE and other partners. The focus on
building institutions at the state-level may have derailed the spending efficiency objective and with it the
possibility of other less controversial (read: more flexible) actions toward that goal.

Another difference which may help to account for whether the authorities were able to agree on
coordinated reforms relates to the alignment of vested interests with reform actions. For example, the
private sector saw key benefits from the state-level procurement law which would now allow non-resident
firms to bid for contracts in other entities. In contrast, on higher education, there was opposition both at
the political level and within the sector; and external pressures from other stakeholders (such as students
or business) proved difficult to effectively mobilize.

With regard to those reforms which were expected to proceed on a parallel rather than coordinated basis,
namely reforms of the pay structure, internal and external audit, it has been suggested that having
conditions applicable to one Entity and not the other ­ as with the pay reform ­ may have contributed to
some weakening of commitment all around. On the other hand, toward the closing of the credit, there
was some indication that the FBH would have supported splitting the second tranche and a disbursement
to the RS on account of its fulfillment of some of the parallel conditions. Even so, given the political
history and the almost unanimous support among external partners for strengthening the single economic
and political space, it would have been near impossible for the Bank to have structured the Credit in a
way that might have been seen to waver on harmonization across the Entities.

The delivery of effective technical assistance also affected reform implementation. Those areas such as
public procurement, external audit, reform of the budget process with dedicated technical assistance
programs proceeded relatively well. Those without dedicated or with waning technical assistance were
more problematic. The best example is internal audit where the unexpected delay of the USAID-
supported technical assistance project left the authorities with little formal guidance in this area, although
some progress was being made independently in RS. As the delays worsened, the Bank stepped in with
technical assistance which resulted in a flurry of activity, basic agreement among the Entities and the
State, and the significant likelihood that the laws will be passed shortly. A number of reform areas were
originally supposed to be coordinated and receive assistance under the broad Public Administration
Reform donor-coordination umbrella. However, this approach was too diffuse to support the critical path
needed for most of the EMSAC reforms.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Implementation of the Credit was to be overseen by the Coordination Board for Economic Reform and
European Integration, a loose forum of the heads of executives at the State and Entity level. It is
important to note, however, that the State level government had/still has limited powers in regard to
compelling action at the Entity levels.        A chart of administrative implementation and monitoring
responsibilities was to be provided as an Annex to Program Document, but does not appear to have been



                                                       8

completed.      Nonetheless, reform efforts were monitored effectively by the Bank team through the
periodic supervision missions and the management of the credit from the field.

No performance monitoring indicators were required (for adjustment/development policy operations) at
the time of Board approval in early 2004. However, the program document does specify in some detail
how each of the program conditions would be evaluated including in several areas with quantitative
indicators. By the time of the second supervision report in mid 2005, the team had assembled a focused
set of relevant indicators in the Project Status Report mainly on macroeconomic performance, spending
levels and some measures of efficiency (to be reported semiannually although most are measured only
annually). The remainder was process indicators that basically tracked the implementation of triggers and
benchmarks.

The measurement issue of nominal figures versus ratios to GDP is worth noting in BH. GDP estimates
continue to suffer from some serious deficiencies, not least of which is the lack of rigorous adjustment for
informal activity. This issue has implications for how overall spending levels, the wage bill, self-financed
public investment, and operations and maintenance4 are targeted. In retrospect, how the indicators were
specified has made a difference for judging the intention and execution of the reform effort.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The expected follow-on series of DPLs which were to continue expenditure restructuring did not
materialize. However, technical assistance and investment financing are being provided in the education
sector, though no longer focused on the EMSAC higher education agenda given the lack of progress there.
The Bank also will continue to provide technical assistance on the critical issues of fiscal policy and
coordination and public pay reform and on the macroeconomic framework, especially in the absence of an
IMF program. Ongoing technical assistance by other donors include extensive support to the budget
reform processes at the State, Entity and cantonal levels of government from UK DfID, to the State
Procurement Agency and Procurement Review Board from the European Commission, and to the
Supreme Audit Institutions from the Swedish National Audit Office. The Indirect Tax Authority (ITA)
and the Directorate for Economic Planning (formerly the Economic Policy and Planning Unit) is
supported through an EC-financed technical project, and the latter also by UK DfID.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The broad objectives of the Credit were appropriate given the diagnosis of the constraints to growth (and
poverty reduction) as largely requiring a scaling back of government spending and improvement in
spending efficiency, particularly in the face of declining aid flows and other macroeconomic risks,
including to the currency board arrangement.         This diagnosis was echoed in the Government's own
Medium-Term Strategy Paper and appeared to resonate with the development community operating in
BH. Moreover, in the Bank's view, it was becoming critical for the country to get a handle on public
expenditures ahead of the growing State-building agenda which has been accelerated by the prospect of
EU integration.




4The latter was never measured owing to budget classification issues which will require continued technical
assistance to resolve.




                                                        9

The overall design was also technically appropriate, focusing on two expenditure policy issues: the
crosscutting issue of the wage bill and salary structure; a sectoral issue (higher education), and on a
limited (in terms of conditions) number of critical public expenditure management tools and institutions ­
fiscal coordination, budget preparation and execution, internal audit, procurement and external audit. It
has been suggested that the scope of the credit was overly broad. However, the reforms focus entirely on
public expenditure policy and management, with very limited sectoral actions.

Two design shortcomings do warrant mention. The first shortcoming, in hindsight, was the choice of
higher education as the sectoral focus. This choice was justified at the time, in part because of the
potential synergies with the ongoing Education Restructuring Project that would benefit from the
additional leverage on policy reforms and the apparent readiness for implementation.                    It also was
recognized that this was a high risk-high return option, even though the limited potential fiscal impact
was small. But there was a serious misjudgment by the Bank about the depth of ownership and the
complexity of political economy surrounding this reform. The several setbacks experienced during
preparation were clear indications that perhaps readiness for implementation was overestimated, but these
were not well heeded. Finally, the approach of requiring a harmonized law appears to have played into
the state-building agenda to the detriment of the spending efficiency goals.

The second design shortcoming was that the scope of the non-core benchmarks was perhaps a bit too
broad both for government capacity and Bank supervision.                The benchmarks on reassignment of
expenditures across sub-Entity structure may have been premature, while the benchmarks on the public
debt and civil service laws directed only a marginal amount of attention on issues which remain critical
and should have either been a primary focus of the Credit, or not included at all.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The Credit had two major objectives ­ (i) improving the efficiency of spending and (ii) strengthening
public expenditure management and governance ­ the outcomes of which are rated unsatisfactory and
moderately satisfactory, respectively.

The expected benefits from the EMSAC operation were to be:

· Increased public spending efficiency.          This was partly achieved in that expenditures on locally
    financed investments, of key concern in BH, rose from 2.5 to 4.2 percent of GDP during 2003-05, and
    as a share of general government expenditure from 4.2 to 8.3 percent over the same period. However,
    spending on goods and services fell from 11.1 percent of GDP to 9.7 percent, while transfers rose
    from 14.1 percent of GDP to 15.4 percent over the same period. Among these, veterans' benefits
    which were to have been rationalized under the sister SOSAC II credit were increased substantially.

· A reduction in the weight of public expenditure.                    General government expenditures fell
    substantially from 52.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to 48 percent in 2006.5 Meanwhile, the overall
    budget balance improved from a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 3 percent in 2006.
    However, given the introduction of the VAT at a higher-than-neutral rate, increased revenues have
    allowed for expenditure creep in the latter half of 2006 and going into 2007.

· Containment of wages in the general government sector and a slowdown in overall wage inflation.
    The general government wage bill fell from 13.7 percent of GDP in 2003 to 12.2 percent in 2006,
    mainly on account of a temporary wage bill cap imposed by the EMSAC and accelerated military



5The macroeconomic data for 2006 are likely to be further revised from the time of the writing of this report.


                                                       10

    demobilization. The differential between CPI inflation and the growth rate of gross wages has fallen
    from 8 percent in 2006 to 3.3 percent in 2005, as the latter fell from 8.6 percent to 7.5 percent over
    the same period. Unit labor costs saw a steady decline in 2004 and 2005, but have begun to increase
    faster than in neighboring countries during early 2006.

· Improved allocative efficiency of spending, particularly in the education sector.          Little progress
    was made in improving efficiency of education spending. In fact, wages as a share of overall
    education spending increased from 77.8 percent in 2004 to 80.6 percent in 2005, and though the
    student/teacher ratio in higher education did improve from 8.7 to 9.5, this was not a direct impact of
    the EMSAC.

· Clarification of intergovernmental revenue and expenditure assignments leading to improved
    funding for local public service delivery. Cantonal and extra-budgetary revenues have increased
    from 33 percent of FBH GDP in 2003 to 34.9 percent in 2005. In RS, funding for extra-budgetary
    funds has increased from 13.4 percent of RS GDP to 14.1 percent over the same period.

· Increase transparency and accountability in government transactions to foster efficiency and
    encourage private sector investment. There has been good progress in improving reporting and
    accountability on government spending. Meanwhile, private investment has increased from 9.3
    percent of GDP in 2003 to a projected 10.9 percent in 2006.

A detailed examination of the achievement of individual objectives associated with the conditions and
benchmarks supported by the Credit follows.

Component 1: Rationalization of Expenditure and Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangements

1. Maintain stable macroeconomic environment and adopt strategic policy framework

A stable macroeconomic environment was achieved. Real GDP growth remained around 5.5 percent
over 2004-06. Inflation rose to about 7.5 percent on average in 2006 due mainly to the introduction of the
VAT at a higher than neutral rate and hikes in administered prices. It subsequently fell in early 2007 to
2 percent and is set to remain at that level for the 2007 as a whole and in future years. The current
account deficit narrowed from 20.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to 10 percent by 2006. A good portion of
this improvement is due to the VAT introduction which encouraged formal reporting of formerly grey
transactions. Work by the IMF and the Bank suggests that the deficit in fact averages between 6 and
9 percent of GDP adjusted more fully for the size of the gray economy. The latter is still high, but
certainly much lower than earlier projected, an evidence of the poor quality of data. It is the consensus of
the Fund and Bank staff that the current account deficit will widen moderately in 2007 (to about
13.5 percent of officially estimated GDP), before declining thereafter as a result of robust export growth.
Spending restraint, and the jump in revenues thanks to the VAT introduction from the start of 2006,
boosted the fiscal surplus to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2006 from 0.8 percent in 2005. Spending pressures
already emerging in 2007 suggest fiscal easing is likely in 2007, resulting in a balanced budget, with
further considerable risks for fiscal easing over the medium term.

Following the completion of the IMF stand-by arrangement (SBA) in early 2004, the authorities were
unable to reach agreement on a successor financing arrangement with the IMF. Nevertheless, better than
expected macroeconomic performance has also alleviated the need for such financing, although the
discipline of an IMF program would have been useful at this time in light of emerging spending pressures
and the still informal nature of fiscal coordination in the country.




                                                      11

The adoption of a strategic policy framework was also achieved, but its impact on cooperation and
coordination has been limited. After extensive discussions with stakeholders across the country and, for
the first time, a coordination board in which the three constituent governments met regularly, the State
and Entity governments adopted a Medium-Term Development Strategy in early 2004. This effort
represented a major development in a post-conflict country patched together by a delicate balance of
fiercely independent political structures. It also raised expectations regarding the potential for future
coordination among the State and Entity governments and sub-entity governments around economic
policy reforms. The MTDS also pointed to the EU Stabilization and Association process as a key anchor
for policy reform, supporting the idea that the emergence of nation-wide goal of accession might
moderate ethno-religious rivalries. The key priorities of the MTDS were to better enable private sector
growth by reforming the public sector, simplifying investment climate, accelerating privatization,
reforming the financial sector, improving infrastructure and integrating the informal economy.         The
implied fiscal policy reform program of the MTDS did call for a moderate reduction in the overall level of
public expenditure, a continued effort to raise domestic public savings, expenditure reorientation away
from wages and military spending toward investment and maintenance, and improvements in public
procurement and revenue collection.

The MTDS was updated in 2006 in a consultative process led by the Economic Policy and Planning Unit.
The result is a streamlined document with clearer and more specific targets. However, to date not all the
governments have adopted the documents and some of the objectives may have been scaled back in order
to achieve consensus among the political and ethnic groups.

2. Public administration and civil service reform

The objective of bringing general government wage bill to sustainable levels was not achieved. The
overall result was represented by a reduction in the general government wage bill from 13.7 percent of
GDP in 2003 to 12.2 percent in 2006 which did allow for some important expenditure rationalization (see
pg 10 above for full details). However, the sustainability is questionable given that these reductions were
effected by a temporary wage bill cap supported by the EMSAC and may simply represent a
postponement of wage pressures that remain ready to emerge. At the State level there have been no
adjustments to salary levels since 2001. Meanwhile, little progress has been made in the complementary
downsizing efforts, other than with the Ministry of Refugees and the police in the RS. In addition, the
repeated efforts to decompress the public sector salary structure in the RS and State governments and the
recent decision by the RS government to increase salaries of police officers, teachers and some other


                                                        12

categories of public employees, have raised expectations of imminent salary increases. Finally, revenue
windfalls and the new prospect of Entity and sub-entity level borrowing powers suggest that Bosnia-
Herzegovina still faces an important challenge to turn the corner on this wage bill issue.

The objective of reforming the wage determination system was not achieved. Neither the State nor the
RS government was able to reform the wage structure for civil servants, nor other employment categories.
The key goals were decompression, consolidation of allowances and harmonization of pay systems across
ministries and agencies. Lack of progress on downsizing the public labor force, except for the RS police
and Ministry of Refugees and general demobilization, combined with a few across-the-board wage
increases to have kept the likely fiscal cost of needed decompression high.

A first and commendable effort in mid-2004 by the RS Ministry of Finance to draft a new wage structure
covering all budgetary users eventually passed to the Ministry of Local Self-Governance where it
languished.    At the State level, efforts to harmonize wage systems across institutions continues be to
complicated by ongoing state-building activities and myriad recommendations from development partners
on the salary levels in the individual institutions that they are helping to set up or strengthen. A recent
move by the OHR to raise judge and prosecutor salaries is the latest example.                       Consolidation of
allowances into the base wage, especially at the state level, is also complicated by the different income
tax laws and obligations of the two entities and the cantons.6 Finally uncertainty about the pace of state-
building7 has made estimating the future costs of any new wage structure difficult. Nevertheless, a draft
structure was prepared by the State government in 2006 which addressed all of the key reform goals,
some as part of a phased reform process. However, the election delayed any further internal dialogue
among ministries and agencies.

Although there is continued strong awareness of the need for the new Laws on Salary both in the RS and
at the state level, future progress will need in-depth technical support, improved donor coordination and
the political will to resist wage pressures at the lower end of the salary scale.            The sequencing of pay
reform and downsizing activities will have to be carefully considered. The progress on consolidating
police and defense personnel and unifying the wage structure should be carefully examined to learn
lessons.

The objective of modernizing the wage bill management systems was not achieved.                              One basic
difficulty for pay reform was the lack of progress on developing public employee databases.                    This has
made it difficult to accurately estimate the fiscal implications of any pay reform. In the RS, a decree in
2005 mandated the one-time registration of employees and submission of data to the treasury. However,
in the absence of a Law on Salaries this has not been maintained. As a result, in its recent attempt to
formulate a new wage structure, the Ministry of Finance had to reassemble employee data from scratch.
The Treasury has routine information on wage payments but these were not linked with the Civil Service
Agency database, which only covers the approximately 4000 civil servants, out of approximately 33,000
public servants. In the FBH, the CSA (which covers only the Federation and not cantonal civil servants)
also has no database despite an offer from the MOF for an HRMIS treasury module. At the state level,
there is a central register which is also not linked to the treasury system.




6A state employee needs to pay different taxes and contributions depending on whether she resides in the FBH or in
the RS.
7As well the relatively high salaries paid by donors to local consultants performing activities later to be incorporated
in the State government have further complicated the formulation of a fiscally affordable but appropriately
remunerative wage structure.

The objective of accelerating the implementation of public administration reform (PAR) was achieved.
The Credit supported, through various benchmarks, the preparation of country-wide PAR strategy,
enactment of Civil Service Laws, promulgation of rulebooks, functional reviews, and the introduction of
performance appraisal for civil servants. Public administrative reform has been broadly supported by a
consortium of development partners. The State and Entity Civil Service Agencies have been steadily
involved in each of the areas mentioned above with varying degrees of progress. A joint platform for
public administration reform is expected to be signed soon. All the Civil Service Laws have been
enacted, various functional reviews and rulebooks prepared. However, there appears to be a disconnect
between the PAR activities and the broader goal of reducing public employment, e.g. some rulebooks
have created processes which call for more, rather than fewer, personnel. In addition, the prospect for
continued progress on other administrative changes, including performance appraisal, is reported to
depend heavily on the anticipated salary reforms.

3. Intergovernmental fiscal relations

The objective of improving intergovernmental fiscal and economic policy coordination was largely
achieved.     The Credit aimed to support, through various benchmarks, the establishment of the Indirect
Tax Authority (ITA), the National Fiscal Council (NFC), the Economic Policy and Planning Unit
(EPPU), and the strengthening of the state Statistical Agency, including the enactment of various laws. In
addition, the Credit also aimed to support a first effort of State and Entity budget compliance with the
NFC's fiscal balance targets for 2005 and the establishment of institutions for fiscal policy coordination
between the Federation and Cantonal authorities in FBH.

The establishment of the ITA, introduction of the VAT and unification of indirect revenues has been a
major achievement for BH (however not directly associated with this Credit). It has also created, as
expected, an imperative for fiscal coordination between the State, Entities and sub-entity governments, at
a minimum in terms of the distribution of revenues.            The National Fiscal Council was formally
established in September 20058 but enactment of the draft law (agreed in June 2006) has been delayed
because of the 2006 elections and the pending appointment of the new FBH Minister of Finance. In the
interim, the ITA Governing Board supported by a monthly meeting of deputy ministers of finance has
taken up the long process of learning to coordinate ­ on macro and fiscal projections, fiscal targets and
revenue allocations. This progress on fiscal coordination, although tenuous, represents a major step
forward in such a complex political environment. It is bolstered by strong commitment at the technical
level and by the growing capacity at the fledgling EPPU (now called the Directorate of Economic
Planning, DEP) and the Macroeconomics Unit of the ITA. Setbacks are to be expected along this process.
Notably, the issue of balancing expenditure pressures in 2007 is an immediate challenge, especially if
VAT revenue growth moderates as projected, and the opportunity for public borrowing emerges.
Continued advocacy for sound fiscal decisions across the donor community will be critical.

To support the technical underpinnings of macroeconomic policy, the Framework Law on Statistics was
enacted and the Director and Deputies for the State Statistical Agency and Statistical Council were
appointed in 2004. Some recent developments include the completion of a household budget survey that
will serve as the basis for revising price indices and facilitating the compilation of GDP by the
expenditure approach. In 2005, the central bank reported consolidated government financial statistics to
the IMF Statistics Department for the first time. Trade and balance of payments statistics have improved
with the introduction of the ASYCUDA and classifications systems in the customs. However, BH will
need to accelerate progress on strengthening its statistical information base.

The objective of improving budgetary discipline, efficiency and accountability at the sub-entity level
was partially achieved, but new risks have emerged related to government borrowing powers. The
Credit supported, through various benchmarks, the preparation of a Framework Law on Fiscal
Responsibilities and the enactment of laws on public borrowing which were to include formal procedures
for debt settlements by the State and Entity Parliaments. The framework law was not prepared, but laws
on public borrowing have been passed, and some progress has been made in both the RS and FBH on the
framework for handling war-related restitution and other claims.

A State level law on public borrowing was passed in 2005, but without the representation from the RS.
One of the problematic issues centered on the basis for computing borrowing capacity and limits. In the
RS, public debt contracting is currently regulated in the law on the budgetary system but a draft law on
debt and guarantees is being discussed in Parliament. These laws (similar for the Federation and both
Entities) allows for short term debt up to 5 percent of operating revenues of the previous fiscal year and a
limit of 18 percent of operating revenues of the previous fiscal year for the long term debt service. While
these limits are thought to be modest, they still raise the risk to both the macroeconomic program and the
currency board arrangement, particularly in light of the informal nature of fiscal coordination. Of concern
also is the growing issue of sub-national borrowing. The RS has already started allowing local borrowing
to take place, and a local borrowing framework was legislated in the Federation in early 2007.9

Regarding outstanding debts, a State law approved in April 2006 the process for settling some KM
1.9 billion in claims for frozen foreign currency deposits with a combination of cash payments and
medium term bonds. Similarly the RS and FBH passed separate laws to settle claims for war damages
estimated at about 1 billion in total also with long term bonds. Under plausible assumptions, these claims
would increase government debt by about 20 percent of 2005 GDP and debt service would increase by
about 1 percent of GDP. The net present value of domestic claims would be well below face value. The
size of restitution clams remains unclear but the authorities have indicated that they intended to maximize
restitution-in-kind and cap monetary compensation at KM 3 billion. As such the impact of restitution
payments is still unclear.

The issue of public borrowing at the State, Entity and sub-entity levels is a matter of serious concern.
Faced with declining aid flows and stronger macroeconomic fundamentals, the possibility of Entity and
sub-Entity borrowing is growing. While critical for long term development, this debt accumulation needs
to be carefully managed and coordinated. As the expenditure pressures described above mount, the
absence of a fully-institutionalized and empowered fiscal coordination body will be major sources of risk.

The objective of rationalizing expenditure and revenue assignments across levels of government has
been partially achieved. The Credit aimed to support this objective through benchmarks on the passage
of new Laws on Local Self-Government at the Entity levels to lay the framework for the examination and
eventual reassignment of functions and responsibilities in line with revenues. The Local Self-Governance
Laws were passed in both Entities and there is an ongoing reform effort supported by the USAID and the
SIDA to support both their implementation and capacity building at the local level.

The objective of rationalizing the system of intergovernmental transfers has been largely achieved. In
general this reform has been accelerated by the introduction of the nationwide VAT and indirect tax
collection and the ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal coordination both at the national and sub-national
levels. The model for allocating the unified indirect revenues across Entities is now based on relevant

percent for the next two years, then rise to 10 percent.

criteria such as population, geographical area and the number of elementary and secondary schools and
students. In 2006, a new formula for allocating VAT revenues and other indirect taxes from the RS to
municipalities was introduced with some adjustments being phased in over six years10. In June 2006, the
FBH passed a new law to govern the allocation of the Federation's share of the indirect taxes to cantons,
municipalities and individual jurisdictions. These new formulas will also be phased in over six years. As
a result, all sub-entity governments now have a stable, predictable, and transparent revenue stream that is
expected to reduce the disparities of per capita spending over time.


4. Efficiency of spending on education through higher education reforms

The objective of centralizing higher education financing level was not achieved. After several attempts
derailed by lack of consensus on the State/Entity level financing and later on State/Entity level
accreditation, no law on higher education has been enacted. Very little consolidation of faculties has been
achieved to date, with the exception of Tuzla and Zenica universities.

The objective of integrating universities into the treasury system to improve budget management was
partially achieved. In the RS, the two universities and various faculties were reporting revenues to the
MOF since 2004. In the 2006 budget law, all university own-revenues were reported to the single
treasury account. After strong resistance by the universities in FBH, only Sarajevo and Tuzla (the two
largest) have joined the treasury system. The remaining university and faculty salaries are paid through
the local treasury system at the Cantonal level, but there is still no legal framework for
universities/faculties on reporting own revenues.          The resistance to this measure remains very strong
based on the concern that the government subsidies will be reduced, and reflecting the increase in
transparency and accountability that it would bring.
       Second Credit Component: Improvement of Public Sector Management and Governance
Component 2: Improvement of Public Sector Management and Governance

1. Improvement of budget management

The objective to strengthen the legal framework for budget management was achieved. The Credit
aimed to support this objective through conditions on the passage or amendment of State and Entity
organic budget laws. In general, however, this operation was instrumental in maintaining the momentum
on improving the budgeting processes across the country, in conjunction with a large program of technical
assistance financed by the DfID. As a result, budgeting practices have largely moved away from being
based on historical expenditure levels toward actual planning based on priorities and programs.

The State level organic budget law was enacted as part of the Law on State Finances significantly
strengthening the process of budget preparation. There are now current discussions on (i) plans to separate
the budget law into separate legislation; (ii) the need to legislate the formal adoption of the State
government Budget Framework Paper (BFP) by the Council of Ministers to strengthen national fiscal
coordination; and (iii) the formalization of the "10-step" approach to budgeting that is being introduced in




10Indirect taxes are allocated 73.5 percent to RS, 23 percent for municipalities and 3.5 percent to the Road Fund.
Among municipalities, allocations are based 75 percent on population, 5 percent on geographic area, 15 percent on
high school enrollments, and 5 percent on primary school enrollments with special coefficients for smaller
municipalities. In addition, adjustments are made for municipalities own history of revenue performance for the
first six years.

practice. The FBH law was amended in April 2006 to replace old canton level laws but has created some
additional difficulties in terms of the budget process. Amendments are currently being prepared to
address these. However these are serious issues related to fiscal coordination within the Federation that
need to be addressed. The RS organic budget law, which was originally of very good quality, is now
being amended to harmonize it with the 10-step approach.

The objective to further implement and strengthen the MTEF process was achieved. The Credit aimed
at supporting this objective through conditions on the preparation of Budget Framework Papers and
consistency of annual budgets with these papers at the Entity level. BFPs are now routinely prepared at
the State, Entity and cantonal levels. Recent progress has focused on introducing expenditure ceilings for
each budget user, requiring more comprehensive documentation to improve transparency of budget
requests, and piloting program budgeting. In the FBH, cantonal authorities now prepare mini-BFPs as
required by the FBH organic budget law but with a great deal of assistance from the technical partners.
All the BFPs for 2007-09 were adopted by the respective Parliaments.

In general, the impact of this Credit has been to maintain the momentum of budget reforms, spur
important institutional changes, and support a higher level of discipline in the budget process for 2005
and 2006. Going forward, there is a strong risk of fiscal slippage given the perceived windfalls from
VAT, emerging budget pressures, new borrowing capacities, and incomplete fiscal coordination
architecture. The delays in finalizing 2007 budgets, a number of which are indicated to already be out of
compliance with agreed BFPs is a worrying sign.         Nevertheless, there is an encouraging level of
awareness and commitment at the technical level on the need to maintain fiscal restraint in part through
the discipline of the budget process. The Credit's support for strengthening the legal framework and
further institutionalization of the budget processes has already provided some useful tools for
counterbalancing political pressures.

2. Strengthen budget execution, reporting and accountability

The objective to strengthen control over budget execution was partially achieved. The Credit aimed to
support this objective through benchmarks on the maintenance and expansion of the treasury systems.
The State, RS, and FBH governments continue to maintain their treasury systems. With respect to lower
levels of government, in the FBH, each Canton has an independent treasury system which is not linked to
the Federation system, although Federation MOF maintains the central server for all cantonal and the
Federation treasuries. In the FBH, 40 of the 80 of municipalities are using the treasury-compatible FMS
systems while waiting for formal adoption of legal changes that will mandate full treasury systems at the
municipal level. The previous FBH government did initiate changes to the law on treasury that would
require municipalities to move onto a treasury system within two years. The RS has been introducing the
treasury system in municipalities in stages since 2004. At the time of this report, 13 municipalities out of
69 were included, however authorities report a rapid increase in the number of municipalities requesting
inclusion over the last year.

The objective of introducing stronger internal audit mechanism was partially achieved. The Credit was
intended to support the enactment of internal audit laws at the state and entity levels, the designation of
internal audit bodies and preparation of audit plans.      Although good progress has been made on
formulating harmonized audit laws, this reform is not yet completed, owing in part to delays by the state
and entity governments in appointing internal audit coordinators until May 2006 and in part to delays in
technical assistance both from the Bank and external partners. However, during 2006, after the internal
audit coordinators were appointed, strong efforts by both the Bank and the governments through an
intergovernmental working group have yielded very good progress. This is an area where an element of
intergovernmental competition has been instrumental. Building on earlier progress, the RS law was
submitted to Parliament at end March 2007. Those authorities have designated MOF as the main unit and


                                                   17

have begun to identify audit priority risks for attention. The draft laws at the state level and in the RS
have been agreed by their respective governments and are to be passed in the coming months. Progress in
the FBH has been slower, in part due to the need for coordination among cantonal authorities.

Once the laws have been passed, there remains work to be done on harmonization of methodologies. The
association of auditors that exists in FBH and issues certificates also needs to be incorporated into the
institutional framework. However, it is likely that the current momentum will be maintained because of
the key importance of properly functioning internal audit and control mechanisms in the EU integration
agenda and for the use of the EC's Instruments for Pre-Accession Assistance.

The objective to provide regular, timely (and consolidated) budget execution reports was partially
achieved. The State and the Entities now regularly and routinely publish budget execution reports.
However, the classifications and chart of accounts across the governments are not yet fully harmonized,
and government finances cannot yet be consolidated in a satisfactory manner that would allow for robust
international comparison. Only the RS follows a modified GFS 2001 standard for budget classification.
In FBH, which follows a modified GFS 1998 standard for the Federation level budget, consolidation
across cantons and municipalities is complicated by the very limited powers of the Federation MOF to
impose standards, and the simplified government and budgeting structures at the canton level. At the
cantonal level, however GFS 2001-type economic classifications are common. Nevertheless, the Central
Bank is now attempting to produce consolidated government financial statistics for external reporting and
this is expected to create some momentum for improvement. A key suggestion for moving forward is to
develop reporting systems that can electronically link GFS codes with the accounting systems used by the
treasury systems.

The objective to further strengthen Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) and ensure follow-up to audits
has been achieved. The Credit supported this objective through conditions on amendments to individual
State and Entity external audit laws to increase SAIs' independence, clarify their mandate and coverage,
and harmonize legislation. The Credit also supported the strengthening of the interaction and reporting to
Parliaments on issues raised by the SAI reports. Given the large number of amendments necessary, all
three governments opted to prepare new Laws which were enacted in October 2005 (RS) and early 2006
(FBH and the State).11 There appears to be a growing level of diligence in responding to audit report
findings in Parliament. Even though dedicated Public Accounts Committees (PACs) have not yet been
established, in all the State and Entity parliaments there are other committees who deal directly with audit
results under systematic procedures. In the FBH, the SAI submits the government's responses that it has
received together with the current report to Parliament where they are discussed by the Economic and
Finance Committee. In the upcoming 2006 budget execution report is it expected that the authorities will
finally include their own addendum on SAI recommendations and follow-up actions. In the RS, the
authorities report the declining number of negative findings in audit reports as evidence of improved
accountability of the government on public spending issues.

A recent independent evaluation of the technical assistance from the Swedish National Audit Office
suggests that the SAIs have "put them firmly on the governance map", public awareness is strong, and
there has been some impact on fiscal discipline. The new phase of technical assistance focuses on
achieving functional PACs, and strengthening coordination between the SAIs.

The objective to strengthen reporting and accountability of extra-budgetary funds (EBFs) was
achieved. The Credit aimed at supporting this objective through benchmarks on the budgeting, reporting



11The key outstanding legal problem is related to the fact that none of the constitutions of the BH make mention of
the audit task or institutions.


                                                        18

and external audit of specific extra-budgetary social funds at the Entity level. Although these funds
remain outside the budget process, their financial plans and reports are annexed to the annual budget and
quarterly execution reports presented to government and discussed in the respective Parliaments. There
are plans underfoot to apply the same rules to road funds which are currently off-budget. These funds are
included in the audit plans of the SAIs and the accountability for remedial actions appears to receive the
same treatment as budgeted expenditure described above.

3. Enhance transparency and integrity in public funds management

The objective to reform public procurement has been achieved. The enactment of a State level law and
promulgation of harmonized regulations on public procurement is one of the major successes of this
operation. This achievement demonstrates that when there is adequate political will and a confluence of
broader private interests, such coordinating is possible in BH. Although there were some of the usual
political rivalries, the broader goal of unifying the market space across entities to enable private firms to
bid on public contracts in entities in which they are not resident, overcame this. In addition, the
substantial technical assistance provided by the European Commission greatly facilitated progress in this
area.

The State law governs public procurement processes across all levels of government. All the by-laws
were adopted in 2005 and a list of contracting authorities obliged to follow the processes was issued. A
State Procurement Agency and a Procurement Review Body (appeal mechanism) have been established
and are fully staffed and operational. Trainers have been trained, and a rulebook on accreditation and
registration issued. The SPA has been providing extensive assistance to a wide range of procuring bodies
from primary schools to Entity and State ministries. It continues to publish guidance on various steps
such as on drafting minutes of bid opening meetings and on direct contracting. The SPA maintains a
website on which bids and results are published.

Regarding the promulgation of the standard bidding documents specified by the EMSAC, very good
progress has been made but two actions remain incomplete. The large number of standard bidding
documents has been prepared but awaits clearance by the SPA Board. Draft contracts, which are not the
primary responsibility of the SPA nor a primary focus of the Law, have been delayed pending resolution
of issues related to the Entity level Laws on Obligatory Relations which govern contracting in general. A
revised State law remains in Parliament since September 2006. The key challenges going forward are to
maintain the education and guidance to contracting units and implementation of monitoring plans in
conjunction with internal audit units and the Supreme Audit Offices.

The objective to prevent conflict of interest and influence peddling through strengthening
implementation of conflict of interest legislation was not achieved. The Credit aimed to support the
provision of adequate funding for the Election Commission to implement the Conflict of Interest Law,
preparation of implementing regulations, compliance with reporting on "related" public purchases, and a
public awareness program for the 2004 municipal elections. However, very little has been achieved with
the exception of adequate budgets for the ECBH to implement the Conflict of Interest Law in the 2004
and 2005. It is not clear whether the accompanying regulations have been implemented in the Entities or
whether the appropriate lists of public purchases covered by the Law have been in fact published.

Nevertheless, the 2005 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) indicates a
decline in the share of firms that perceive bribery to influence the content of new laws and regulations as
common fell from 11 to 6 percent, and to obtain government contracts from 22 to 14 percent. The
BEEPS also reports a reduction in the share of responding firms that report corruption as a problem for
doing business (from 58 percent in 2002 to 47 percent in 2005) and in the share of firms saying that
unofficial payments are frequent (from 22 to 19 percent over the same period).

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall outcome of the EMSAC is rated moderately unsatisfactory on the basis of the following
analysis. The Credit had two major objectives ­ (i) improving the efficiency of spending and (ii)
strengthening public expenditure management and governance ­ the outcomes of which are rated
unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory, respectively.

The outcome on efficiency of spending is rated unsatisfactory primarily because the issue of the wage bill
and higher education financing, the main foci of the credit, remain largely unresolved, although
macroeconomic performance was good, the strategic policy framework is in place and being strengthened,

On the other hand, the outcome on public expenditure management and governance is moderately
satisfactory, notwithstanding the failure to pass laws on internal audit. Strong progress was made in a
number of areas including budgeting, public procurement, and internal and external audit. In addition, the
intended building blocks to improved public expenditure management are in place and look to be
sustainable.

With respect to the internal efficiency of the Credit and its implementation, this is rated moderately
unsatisfactory mainly because of the failure to disburse the second tranche despite progress on some
triggers and a large number of the benchmarks and the multiple extensions of the closing date. However,
the rating is moderated by several considerations. First, the financing needs of BH had in fact diminished
substantially and lessened the case for adding to external debt. Second, the costs to both the Bank (in
supervision) and government (in commitment fees) of further extending the closing date to await the
formation of new governments and restarting of the political dialogue on higher education would have
been high. Finally, at least one of the conditions for which the extension was provided has seen good
progress which is likely to come to fruition on its own.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The program did not have any direct impact on poverty, gender inequities and imbalances, and social
development. However, it is expected that implementation of the revised system for intergovernmental
transfers will help to reduce disparities in per capita spending and, ultimately, incomes at the local level.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Credit was instrumental in helping establish the legal framework for key institutions and functions in
the area of public expenditure management and for maintaining the momentum on a number of reform
programs to strengthen governance.       Key laws passed include the organic budget laws, the framework
Law on Public Procurement, laws on the Supreme Audit Institutions, on the Indirect Tax Authority, on
Local Self Governance, on Allocation of Public Revenues. Other key laws prepared include those on
Internal Audit and on the National Fiscal Council. The EMSAC also supported the establishment of the
Indirect Tax Authority, the State Procurement Authority and Procurement Review Body and
strengthening of the Supreme Audit Institutions, the State Statistical Agency, among others.

The majority of the reform areas have also benefited from ongoing technical assistance provided by other
development partners, e.g. in budget preparation (the DfID), external audit (the Swedish National Audit
Office), public procurement (EC), and local government (the USAID/SIDA). Within this context, it is


                                                       20

important to note that although the public administrative reform is supported by a broad consortium of
donors, the attention to employment rationalization seems to have been somewhat orphaned in terms of
technical assistance and advocacy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

One unintended outcome that can be reasonably associated, but not attributed, to the EMSAC relates to
the creation of fiscal risk of a new and immediate character in BH. The extended period of wage restraint
created by the EMSAC's wage bill cap ­ in the absence of salary reform ­ has added to expenditure
pressures, on top of those coming from State-building agenda. Given the strong performance of the
economy and the VAT (associated in part with the choice by the authorities, supported by the IMF, to set
the VAT rate at a higher-than-neutral rate), the recent talk of decompression has raised expectations of
public employees and others that salary reform would be an opportunity to provide for "overdue" wage
increases.   However, growth in revenues is expected to slow significantly in the coming year. The
situation is further complicated by new borrowing powers at the Entity and sub-entity levels. The
management of these fiscal risks, without the discipline of an IMF- or Bank-supported program, will be
the test of the public expenditure management framework and fiscal coordination mechanisms that the
EMSAC has helped to build.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

   Rating: Substantial

The risks to the development outcome are rated as substantial for a number of reasons. The risk to most
of the institutional reforms is modest. They are on a good footing especially at the technical level and
continue to benefit from substantial ongoing technical assistance. However, the expenditure policy risks
described above in Section 3.4(c) posed by the rising expenditure pressures, the unfinished wage and
employment agenda, and the difficult political compromises ahead are far from modest.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The key issue in Bank performance during preparation relates to the assessment of the political feasibility
and risks. The diagnostics of the operation were technically sound and the proposed measures were
appropriate, but the political environment was much more complex than assessed. The country was
entering into relatively untested waters in terms of implementing reforms, without external directives. At
the same time, the Bank was channeling the bulk of its assistance through three adjustment credits each
requiring politically difficult compromises at all levels of government. Although the risks were identified
in the program documentation, the mitigating factors ­ including the assessment of the Bank's (and the
donor community's) leverage in the absence of more interventionist approach of the OHR, the inferences
about emerging national goals taken from the PRSP preparation and the possibility of EU integration,
were overstated.

Good quality sector work, including the Public Expenditure Review (2003), Country Procurement
Assessment Report (2002), Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2003), an anti-corruption
report (2001) and a fiscal decentralization study (2002) provided a sound analytical base for this operation.
The diagnosis of the public expenditure policy and management as critical to macroeconomic stability


                                                     21

and growth were appropriate. The reform program was aligned sufficiently with the Government's
strategy.
In terms of processing, the preparation team duly followed the advice provided at the Concept Review
meeting to reduced the scope and sharpen the focus of the operation and a variety of sectoral reforms
were dropped.      Conditionality was reduced to two key expenditure policy issues (wages and higher
education) and five key expenditure management areas (budget preparation, treasury, internal audit,
external audit and procurement). As a stand-alone operation, this scope is relatively limited with only two
politically difficult reform actions, notwithstanding the multiplicity of actors.

It should be recorded here that the EMSAC also made an important contribution to the modality of
Bank's lending in BH. For the first time, the Entities agreed on having a portion of the second tranche
disbursed directly to the State government.        Although the second tranche was cancelled and this
disbursement never effected, this practice has now been introduced into several investment operations.
These and other compromises agreed during preparation may have contributed to the assessment that the
political winds had shifted toward cooperation in BH.

By appraisal, however, concerns about the depth of political ownership had reemerged, particularly with
respect to wage reforms (and the veterans' benefit reforms in the accompanying SOSAC II). The team
was requested to identify measures that would test this commitment sooner rather than later in the
preparation. At the same time, the processing schedule was constrained by a closing window on the
country's access to exceptional IDA financing. Nevertheless, eight months elapsed between appraisal and
board presentation, as the Bank allowed for the authorities to complete the agreed actions.

Towards the end of preparation, two key trade-offs had to be made in terms of timing and reform progress.
The first relates to the decision by the RS to raise public wages and the wage bill in the 2004 budget,
albeit within a conservative fiscal program agreed with the IMF. The RS authorities argued that this was
needed to close the gap in pay levels with the Federation. In hindsight, the decision by the Bank to
postpone the wage bill cap in the RS to the second tranche and to backload the financing to RS did not
affect the outcomes of the operation in this area.

The second trade-off related to a setback in the passage of the higher education law, which was postponed
(during negotiations) to the second tranche. This turned out to be an important signal for things to come.
Had the Bank made a more accurate assessment of the very intractable political opposition to this measure,
a reformulation and/or substitution with some other (feasible) sectoral expenditure policy reform would
have been appropriate. On the other hand, the country management's judgment was that with time the
authorities should have been able to come to a compromise, particularly with the coordinated donor
support that had been galvanized behind the original formulation and additional support expected from an
investment project under preparation.

There are two ways of viewing the misjudgment regarding political feasibility of the EMSAC operation.
The first is that the risks were, indeed, commensurate with the potentially high rewards of improved
cooperation on expenditure policies. The alternate view taken by this report is that, given the fairly new
modus operandi (a reluctance to use external powers to impose reform in BH) and the signals already
received on higher education and in the preparation of SOSAC II, the combination of these two
operations was fairly unrealistic and reflected some over-optimism on the part of the Bank.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory.         Routine missions and supervision reports were
undertaken and adequately informed and updated management on the reform progress. Technical and



                                                     22

policy support was provided to the authorities, in general, in a timely manner. Once the implementation
difficulties had emerged, the level and intensity of supervision and management attention was increased
appropriately.

A number of key decisions warrant discussion. First, the move away from higher education finance
toward general reform of higher education (Bologna Process) did deviate somewhat from the stated
objectives of the operation although it was still in line with the "test-balloon" approach to expenditure
policy reform. In the end, this consumed an enormous amount of staff time toward a reform that would
have very little direct impact on spending efficiency. The effort was in part justified because of the
synergies with the upcoming education project and the cooperation with other international agencies. But
ultimately no significant progress was achieved in this area. Second, earlier attention to the shortfall in
technical assistance for internal audit reforms may have resulted in earlier progress and the fulfillment of
this condition prior to closing. In the end, a commendable effort by the Bank team managed to bring the
state and entities together created a momentum for reform. Finally, it is unlikely whether additional
technical support on the wage structure issue would have yielded more progress.

The decision to extend the Credit in late 2005 to allow more time for political consensus was appropriate,
given that it appeared some compromise on higher education was emerging and progress on the other
reform areas was not at a total standstill. However, the decision to allow the Credit to lapse in December
2006 was also appropriate in light of the lack of additional progress to date and the declining need for
external financing.

The final supervision rating for the potential achievement of the development objective was moderately
satisfactory (although the project was correctly identified as problematic by the moderately unsatisfactory
rating for implementation progress). This yields a disconnect with this Implementation Completion
Report, but reflects the ongoing progress on internal audit as well as renewed attempts by the RS and
State governments to formulate a new salary structure at the time of closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall rating for Bank performance is moderately satisfactory notwithstanding some decisions that,
with hindsight, should have been made differently on the overall risk-return balance . For the most part,
these decisions were based on a reasonable assessment of the potential benefits and risks at the time, and
mirrored those of the other development partners.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Given the unique constitutional structure of BH, the rating for "Government Performance" is ascribed to
the totality of the governing structures laying special emphasis on the value of political cooperation and
compromise.

Treated as a single unit, the Government's performance on the EMSAC operation is deemed moderately
unsatisfactory. On the positive side, an improved level of coordination was achieved (and partially
achieved) on a variety of reforms, including budget processes, public procurement, external audit and,
more recently, internal audit. Remarkable progress was made on indirect taxes, but this was not a focus
of, and generally preceded, the EMSAC. It is important to note that those areas with better coordination



                                                    23

all benefited from well-established technical assistance programs and donor support that helped to
strengthen cooperation among the parties.

On the negative side, the experience under the EMSAC is that the Government ­ as a group ­ has not
risen to the challenge of improved cooperation (across political and ethnic interests) in the absence of the
external directives that had been the earlier norm. As a test case for this cooperation, the higher education
reform has been a critical failure to date, despite strong external pressure and the lure of greater EU
integration. The persistent delays in formalizing the National Fiscal Council have also signaled a re-
emergence of partisan and ethnic divisions that have affected the broader reform effort across BH. Other
development partners, notably the IMF and the EC, have seen a sea-change in pace and depth of the
structural reforms they have been supporting, e.g. in the degree of fiscal adjustment and in corporate
restructuring and bankruptcy.

Finally, the rating of the overall Government's performance is negatively affected by the lack of progress
on salary reform, across the board. Although good efforts were made by the Ministries of Finance in the
RS and at the state level, the lack of commitment or ownership across the wider government and at the
political level has meant that very little has been achieved on this key expenditure policy issues that was a
main focus of this operation.

 (b) Implementing Agency Performance
    Rating: Moderately satisfactory

This section examines the performance of the State and the two Entity governments ­ chiefly the
Ministries of Finance ­ in implementing their respective slices of the reform program (Annex 2 includes
the full policy matrix divided by responsibility). Overall, the RS and State Ministries of Finance were
able to make better progress in most of the program areas than in the Federation, where political issues
and the decentralized structures make reform generally more complex.

The RS government made early progress on formulating a new salary structure whose implementation
was later interrupted by a change in government. On internal audit, earlier RS reforms were the later
starting point for country-wide discussions, and some of the changes envisaged in the higher education
financing reform have already been implemented in the RS. In the other less problematic areas, the RS
government has been able to move forward on implementation more quickly and has sustained a number
of these efforts despite political changes. As such, the performance is deemed moderately satisfactory,
again discounting heavily the failure to have actual results on the salary structure. The State government
had similar experiences and is similarly rated as moderately satisfactory.           In the Federation, the
decentralized structure and limited powers of the Federation Ministry of Finance continues to complicate
reform. However, this was adversely affected by a re-emergence of hard line positions among the Canton
governments to ceding power to the Entity government.            As such, the FBH performance is rated
unsatisfactory.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

In general, the World Bank needs to sharpen its political economy skills in BH in response to the
greater complexity of the country. First, the preparation of a country-owned PRSP while an important
milestone, may have been overvalued as a signal of the country's real appetite for politically difficult
reforms. Second, although there was internal understanding and commitment at the technical level for
key reforms, this did not translate into agreement by the crucial constituents across the political spectrum.


                                                      24

This experience has revealed that coordinated external support and internal (but only technical
commitment) are no substitute for local ownership by both political representatives and other stakeholders.
In this case, the Bank needs to do a better job of assessing local ownership of specific reforms, either by
broader dialogue, better tests of ownership and more promptly heeding negative signals when they appear.

Within this broader context, every individual reform area should benefit from a reform-specific
political-economy analysis that is taken into account when designing the policy actions. The second
lesson from the higher education reform effort was that even though the growing political coordination on
a variety of issues suggested a broad movement toward cooperation in BH, there were still highly
sensitive reform areas that warranted a less uniform approach. In a complex political and cultural
environment as BH, an in-depth political analysis of each policy action is warranted, should not be
neglected, and should inform the design of each policy measure.

Donor coordination, although critical in a fragmented political environment like BH, can sometimes
lead to an entrenchment of policy positions that, while popular, are not feasible. It is questionable
whether a state-level higher education law was the optimal measure toward expenditure reform in that
sector. However, the passage of a law was an appealing proposition that fit squarely within the state-
building agenda ascribed to by most of the development partners in BH. Once most of these partners
were lined behind the reform action of a new state level law, it became almost impossible to refocus on
the question of how to make progress on the original objective of spending reform. In this environment,
it may be appropriate for the Bank to carve out some technical areas where it can deliver assistance within
a fairly limited group of like-minded development partners.

Establishing state-level institutions as a means to create a single economic and political space is
important, but should not be the only, or always the primary, development objective in BH. Clearly the
political imperative in post-conflict BH is the gradual consolidation of the state. And this consolidation is
critical for EU integration and the opportunities it offers for economic growth and poverty reduction.
However, the path to both these goals may not always lie along the shortest road to consolidating
functions at the State level. In some cases, parallel efforts to reform functions and responsibilities prior to
consolidation may be both technically sound and more politically feasible. These considerations should
not be lost in the design of the Bank's operations in BH.

The sequencing of the multiple reforms needed to achieve rationalization of the government wage bill
is critical. In the case of this operation, all of the requisite reforms ­ wage restraint, reform of the salary
structure, administrative reform and employment rationalization (including severance payments and
redeployment assistance) were considered during preparation. The unevenness in treatment in the Credit
was justified in terms of readiness on the part of government as if these reforms could be treated
independently. However, the focus on the first two areas and the neglect of the latter two may have, in
fact, created fiscal risks that could jeopardize the gains already achieved and set back the reform effort.

The balance between holding firm on a difficult reform by taking remedies (like cancellation) and
demonstrating flexibility in order to make progress (with the risk that yet more flexibility will be
needed) is always difficult. The resolution of this balance cannot be determined once and for all, but the
Bank and the Borrower need to address this dilemma explicitly in their decision-making.
