(EMSAC) for Bosnia-Herzegovina supports a\n            fiscal policy reform program for the transition from\n            post-conflict aid-dependency to self-sustained growth.  The\n            two project components support (1) reducing the excess\n            burden of government in the economy while increasing\n            expenditure efficiency, and (2) improving financial and\n            budgetary management in the public sector.   Expected\n            benefits are to: enhance public spending efficiency and\n            ensure macro-fiscal stability by good management of public\n            resources; accommodate the medium-term macro-economic\n            program and provide room for a reduction in the tax and\n            contributions; contain wages in the general government\n            sector; improve allocative efficiency of spending; clarify\n            intergovernmental revenue and expenditure assignments; and\n            increase transparency and accountability in government\n            transactions. Among the risks faced by the credit are: The\n            possibility of the authorities either delaying the\n            implementation of some measures or even reversing their\n            commitment to some parts of the Program; weak administrative\n            capacity to implement and monitor the Program; and\n            macroeconomic risk arising from the country's still\n            fragile position. The credit is to be released in two tranches."}, "docdt": "2004-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
