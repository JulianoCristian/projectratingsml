   as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            1) in general, the World Bank needs to sharpen its political\n            economy skills in BH in response to the greater complexity\n            of the country; 2) within this broader context, every\n            individual reform area should benefit from a reform-specific\n            political-economy analysis that is taken into account when\n            designing the policy actions; 3) donor coordination,\n            although critical in a fragmented political environment like\n            BH, can sometimes lead to an entrenchment of policy\n            positions that, while popular, are not feasible; and 4) the\n            sequencing of the multiple reforms needed to achieve\n            rationalization of the government wage bill is critical."}, "docdt": "2007-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
