the Rural\n            Poverty and Natural Resources Project are to: (1) apply, on\n            a pilot basis, methodologies that will channel financial\n            resources to rural communities to help them promote\n            sustainable productive systems, and thereby reduce rural\n            poverty, the degradation of natural resources, and\n            migration; and (2) promote the sustainable use and\n            conservation of selected priority biodiversity areas.\n            Special emphasis will be placed on gender and indigenous\n            aspects. Specific operational goals include: creating\n            capacity at the local level to organize, self-diagnose\n            problems, plan activities, seek out and negotiate\n            assistance, and act to resolve priority quality of life\n            issues; (2) establishing a demand-driven financing mechanism\n            operating in high poverty areas and providing matching\n            grants to communities; and (3) promoting long-term\n            conservation and sustainable use of Panama's\n            biodiversity resources. To meet these objectives, the\n            project will finance three components: (a) sustainable rural\n            development, promoting community training, organization,\n            planning, and investment; (b) biodiversity conservation,\n            financing research and planning and environmental impact\n            assessment and monitoring, capacity building for\n            participants and institutional strengthening in\n            environmental impact assessment processes; and (c)\n            activities contributing to biodiversity conservation and\n            sustainable use; and (c) coordination of the two components\n            by a unit also financed to provide technical assistance and\n            studies related to rural development and natural resources management."}, "docdt": "1997-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
