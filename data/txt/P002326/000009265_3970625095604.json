Senegal in optimizing its use of energy resources by\n            eliminating price distortions and by adopting conservation\n            measures. It would also assist in reducing the cost of\n            generation; improving system reliability and reducing losses\n            through upgrading of transmission and distribution networks,\n            particularly in the Dakar area. The project would\n            furthermore promote strengthening of the institutional\n            arrangements in the sector through a program of managerial\n            and financial rehabilitation. The proposed project would\n            consist of: (a) a 40 MW diesel plant with related\n            engineering services and completion of the rehabilitation of\n            the existing Cap des Biches steam plant; and (b)\n            construction of about 50 km of 220 kV and l8 km of 90 kV\n            transmission lines and associated 90 MV substations,\n            together with rehabilitation of existing 90 kV lines and\n            substations. It would additionally promote (c)\n            rehabilitation of distribution systems, mainly in Dakar; (d)\n            technical assistance to implement a rehabilitation program\n            and training at the Societe Nationale d'Electricite\n            (SENELEC); (e) an industrial energy conservation program;\n            and (f) studies related to petroleum supply, household\n            energy and the operation of the National Energy Fund."}, "docdt": "1986-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
