It seeks to help in alleviating the impact\n            of the current economic adjustment process on the population\n            of the capital city by providing temporary employment\n            opportunities through public works needed to arrest the\n            deterioration of municipal services and urban\n            infrastructure.  Other major objectives of the project\n            include:  a) strengthening municipal financial and\n            investment planning; b) raising revenues through better tax\n            administration and updating the cadastre; c) a more rational\n            management of human resources and improvements in operations\n            and maintenance.  To this end, the project consists of:  (a)\n            low cost urban transport improvements; (b) labor intensive\n            urban upgrading works in low income areas; (c) civil works\n            to prevent and control landslides; (d) civil works and\n            equipment to improve solid waste collection and disposal,\n            and sanitation works; (e) equipment needed to modernize\n            municipal administration; and (f) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1987-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
