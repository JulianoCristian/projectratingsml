Some lessons learned included: clear\n            and quantifiable project objectives and goals, as well as\n            separate cost accounting, must be established from the\n            beginning to allow proper project implementation e x-post\n            evaluation. Technological changes intended to improve\n            financial management system must be designed in accordance\n            with the existing culture, need managerial commitment and\n            political support, and should provide for continuous\n            training.
