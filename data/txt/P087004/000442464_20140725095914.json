        Project for Cabo Verde were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project readiness is essential for smooth implementation.\n            Deficient engineering design in civil works often leads to\n            major cost overruns. For isolated small islands, it is\n            necessary to explore first the soundness of using the\n            locally available construction materials in order to have\n            better efficiency. Whenever possible, combining development\n            lending operations with sector specific projects creates\n            useful synergies. There is a need to support the\n            decision-making process for the development and\n            rehabilitation of low-volume rural roads with customized\n            economic evaluation tool."}, "docdt": "2014-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
