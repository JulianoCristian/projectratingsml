I. Introduction

1.    This Project Paper (PP) seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an
Additional Financing (AF) in an amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 6.4 million
(US$10.00 million equivalent) to the Republic of Cape Verde for the Road Sector Support
Project ­ P087004 and P110773 (Credit 4060-CV and Credit 4488-CV).

2.     The proposed AF would help finance the costs associated with scaled-up activities to
enhance the impact of a well-performing project. It would support the project development
objective (PDO) through support of the institutional reforms in the road sector; and improved
mobility of targeted populations on the island of Santiago which would enhance their access to
social and economic opportunities. The project consists of the following components:

   ·   Component 1: Institutional Support. Carrying out a program of activities to strengthen the
       Road Institute (Instituto de Estradas, IE) and the Road Fund (Fundo Rodoviario, FR)
       capacity to better perform their respective roles in the management and monitoring of the
       road sector of Cape Verde; and provision of support to the Program Coordination office
       (PCO) to coordinate and monitor the project; and

   ·   Component 2: Road Infrastructure. Carrying out a program of activities to: (i) rehabilitate
       about 6 km of the Praia - Cidade Velha road, (ii) rehabilitate about 14 km of rural roads
       on the island of Santiago using labor based maintenance techniques, and (iii) design and
       supervise the works.

3.     Although the PDO remains the same, it is reworded under the AF to better focus the
objectives of the project. The monitoring indicators have also been revised to reflect the scaled
up activities. The Closing Date of the project is being extended by two years up to June 30,
2013, to allow for completion of the activities financed under the proposed AF, bringing the
total extension of the original Closing Date to two years and ten months.

II. Background and Rationale for Additional Financing in the amount of US$10 million

Background

4.       Cape Verde is an archipelago of ten islands with a strong track record of political
stability and middle income country status as of 2007. The country achieved an impressive
annual, average growth rate of more than seven percent between 2003 and 2007 due mainly to
strong economic management. Despite a robust and effective policy response to the global
economic shocks of 2008 and 2009, gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropped to 6.2
percent in 2008 and 3.6 percent in 2009. In the medium term, however, Cape Verde's
macroeconomic prospects remain favorable so long as the crisis in the Euro zone does not
intensify and persist beyond current projections.

5.      National economic integration and social inclusion continue to be central issues to the
development of Cape Verde. Despite recent overall progress poverty remains prevalent in some
islands and rural areas, especially on the island of Santiago. The share of the population in
                                                1
    absolute poverty decreased from 37 percent in 2001 to 27 percent in 2007. However, progress in
    reducing poverty has been slower in rural areas where 72 percent of the poor live. The islands
    with the largest rural and isolated populations (Santiago, Santo Antão, and Fogo) still
    experience the highest rates of poverty and food insecurity.

    6.     Reducing the geographical gap and improving accessibility by means of an affordable
    and dependable transportation network connecting the rural areas to markets and urban centers,
    along with the improvement of inter-island transport, is crucial to Cape Verdean growth and
    national integration strategic objectives. The Transport Sector Strategy, 2008-2020, spells out
    the government's vision for the development of the sector in support of social activities and
    economic growth, and equal access for the spatially dispersed population. In the road sector,
    these objectives are to be achieved through a balanced approach to completing the rehabilitation
    of the core road network and increasing access for rural populations, accompanied by
    consolidation of institutional capacity for planning, implementation and management of road
    investments and maintenance.

    7.      The initial total cost of the Road Sector Support Project (RSSP) was estimated at
    US$17.48 million of which USD$15 million was funded by the International Development
    Association (IDA) 1. The original project (Cr. 4060-CV) was approved by the Board on May 19,
    2005, and became effective in August 2005. The total project costs increased to US$24.89
    million and an additional financing (Cr. 4488-CV) in the amount of US$5.0 million was granted
    in May 2008 to cover the cost overruns of the originally appraised activities. The first AF
    became effective on September 15, 2008, and the total IDA credit amount revised to US$20
    million after the first additional financing. The reworded objective of the RSSP is to assist the
    borrower to increase the mobility of the population in targeted areas and improve the planning
    and financing of the road sector. Increased mobility of populations in target areas captures better
    access to social and economic opportunities while improved planning and financing of the
    sector reflects better sector management. The results framework has also been simplified for
    increased clarity and to include the core indicators (changes detailed in Annex 1). The RSSP
    supports two components: (i) institutional support, including support for the Program
    Coordination Office (PCO), and (ii) road infrastructure. The RSSP was scheduled to initially
    close on August 31, 2010, but the closing date has been extended by 10 months to June 30,
    2011. The extension was requested to allow: (i) finalization and early implementation of a few
    policy measures, and (ii) processing of the proposed additional finance.

    8.     Progress on implementation and towards achievement of development objectives has
    been satisfactory over the last year and is noted in the archived ISRs. All civil works activities
    have been satisfactorily completed and project funds are almost fully disbursed. There has also
    been steady progress in advancing the institutional reforms in the road sector seen in a
    functioning road fund, generating approximately ECV 300 million annually, major
    improvements in the capacity of the National Engineering Laboratory (LEC) to fulfill its
    mandate, update of the legal mandate of the General Inspectorate of Public and Private Works
    (IGOPP) and improved capacity in MITT units to support Ministerial planning and decision
    making. Professional staffing at IE has been increased, allowing consolidation of road sector
    responsibility at IE. The performance based maintenance contracts piloted under the original
1
  The original IDA project financed one slice of the Government's Road Sector Support Program and parallel
funding for the program was provided by the Millenium Challenge Account.

project have been expanded by IE, with the FR providing the funding. The timely availability of
funds for road maintenance through the FR, and the consolidation of sector responsibilities at IE
are creating a sustainable institutional structure for the planning and management of the road
network. Although there were initial delays in the implementation of the institutional
strengthening and reform component, the government is committed to completing the reforms
and further strengthening sector institutions. Stakeholders in the sector, including MITT, IE and
the FR fully support the project and activities proposed under the AF. So far the RSSP has met
all relevant World Bank disbursement, procurement and fiduciary obligations as well as
complied with all relevant, legal covenants and safeguards requirements.

Rationale

9.      The Bank Group's program for Cape Verde for the period 2009-12 is spelled out in the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) presented to the Board in April 2009. The Strategy provides
a framework for the Bank Group's selective support for implementation of the Second Growth
and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSPII) priorities in support of Cape Verde's
economic transformation. The Bank Strategy is articulated around three objectives: (i)
promoting good governance and public sector capacity, (ii) improving competitiveness and the
investment climate for private sector-led growth, and (iii) strengthening human capital and
social cohesion. The project is an integral part of the CPS and focuses on pillars (ii) and (iii)
above. The relevance and alignment of strategic priorities with national priorities has recently
been reaffirmed in the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), January 2011.

10.    The Bank has played a key role in supporting the Government's Road Sector Support
Program through the RSSP. The RSSP is assisting with sector reforms and capacity building in
contrast to other donor funding that is exclusively for physical investments. Involvement by the
Bank thus remains essential to furthering and entrenching reforms in the transport sector.
Notwithstanding the challenges in concentrating the road asset planning, investment and
maintenance functions in the IE, the Bank has been successful in promoting significant
enhancements in the management of the road network. Now completing the consolidation of the
reforms in the road subsector by building stronger capacity, which is crucial, both to ensure the
sustainability of the achievements but also to motivate reform efforts in the other transport
subsectors with the aim of modernizing their management.

11.     The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 has depressed tourism receipts and sharply
reduced foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI was 40 percent lower in the first half of 2009 than
in the same period in 2008 and contributed to the sharp decline in the growth rate of real GDP
to 3.6 percent. There has also been a decline, albeit small, in the first half of 2010, in
remittances from the Euro zone due to adverse employment and wage impacts. Though bilateral
budgets have been maintained so far, the continuing economic weakness of key European
trading partners, Portugal and Spain, could affect donor assistance as European countries
implement austerity budgets. The government's swift countercyclical fiscal response to the
financial crisis combined tax cuts and increased public investments to stem a deeper slump in
economic activity. These measures have contributed to the gradual recovery beginning in late
2009.



                                               3
12.     Provision of the proposed AF is necessary to assist in consolidation of the ongoing
sector reforms and implementation of the proposed works which are also expected to buttress
the economic recovery process.

13.     A follow-on project to the current RSSP was initially sought by the government of Cape
Verde. The proposed activities are, however, an extension of the activities in the original
project. An AF instrument was therefore considered better suited, than a stand- alone project, to
scale up the development impacts of the ongoing Road Sector Support Project.

Benefits and Risks

14.     The activities to be funded under the proposed AF are subject to a limited range of risks
that can be fairly straightforwardly mitigated. There is substantial continuity of the reform
agenda under the AF with an extension of areas covered by the proposed investments. The main
risks relate to capacity in IE that may impact delivery time and quality. The weighted risk
profile of the proposed AF activities can be considered low. See Annex 2 (Operational Risk
Assessment Framework) for details.

Financial Terms and Conditions for the Additional Financing

15.   Terms of lending do not differ from the original credit. There is no co-financing involved
from other donors. The additional financing would be an IDA Credit repayable in 35 years,
including a grace period of 10 years.

III. Proposed Changes

16.     The Project Development Objective is reworded to better focus the objective of the
project. The reworded objective is to increase the mobility of the population in the targeted
areas and improve the planning and financing of the road sector. The proposed AF would
support the project development objective through support of the institutional reforms in the
road sector, and investment support for primary and rural roads.

Proposed AF Activities

17. Component 1: Institutional Support (about US$1.20 million): This component supports
implementation of a program of activities to strengthen IE and the Road Fund's capacity to
better perform their respective roles in the management and monitoring of the road sector of
Cape Verde. The strengthening proposed under the AF will have a focus on investment and
maintenance planning, contract management and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Support
will also be provided to the PCO to coordinate and monitor the project.

Component 2: Road Infrastructure (about US$10.18 million): Carrying out a program of
activities to: (i) rehabilitate a portion of the Praia- Cidade Velha road leading to Cidade Velha (6
km), (ii) rehabilitate about 14 km of rural roads: Ribeira Principal (4 km) and Ribeira de São Miguel
(10 km) on the island of Santiago using labor based techniques; and (iii) design and supervision
of the works.

Institutional Implementation Arrangements

    19.     The institutional arrangements for the implementation of the proposed AF are essentially
    the same as what is being used to implement the original RSSP. The project will continue to be
    directly managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Telecommunication (MITT)
    through the PCO. The Road Institute will be responsible for procurement of road rehabilitation
    as well as selection of consultants for works supervision. Studies and bidding documents are
    being prepared by consultants that have already been recruited under the RSSP. The existing
    PCO in charge of the implementation of the RSSP will manage the funds of the additional
    financing and will prepare the annual financial statements of the projects.

Additional project monitoring indicators and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
arrangements

    20.    The current M&E framework has been revised and updated to take into account the
    additional kilometers of inter-urban and rural roads to be rehabilitated under the proposed AF.
    Furthermore, some indicators that are no longer relevant for the proposed AF have been
    dropped from the updated M&E framework. Two outcome indicators have been added: (i) the
    Rural Access Index of the Project Impact Area, and (ii) the number of female, project
    beneficiaries. A few of the project outcome indicators have been reworded as well to better
    capture the logic and results of the proposed intervention. There are no changes to the financial
    management, procurement and implementation arrangements.

Closing Date

    21.    The current project closing date is June 30, 2011, and the proposed revised closing date
    is June 30, 2013. The expected contract duration of the Praia - Cidade-Velha contract is 12

2011, and works expected to be completed by mid 2012. However, possible inadvertent delays
and the defect liability period of one year make it advisable to extend the project closing date by
two years.

IV. Appraisal Summary

Proposed Activities

22. The activities that are expected to be funded under the proposed AF fall within the same
components (Institutional Support and Road Infrastructure) as those funded under the original
project. The AF will finance under Component 1 (Institutional support) assistance for IE and the
Road Fund, and under Component 2 (Road infrastructure) (i) rehabilitation of about 6 km of the
Praia- Cidade Velha road leading to Cidade Velha, (ii) rehabilitation of about 14 km of rural roads
on the island of Santiago using labour base techniques and related design and supervision. Project
preparation is well advanced with detailed designs and bid documents for the Cidade Velha road
expected to be finalized well before the second AF is effective.

23. The institutional support for the project is focused on the IE and the FR. The activities are
related to capacity building and operating cost funding and will be implemented through
procurement of training plans and direct funding of operating costs.

Economic Analysis

24.     Praia- Cidade Velha ­ The rehabilitation of the Praia­Cidade Velha road includes a 6
km long stretch from Praia to the Sao Felipe Fortress (300 meters before the town's entrance).
The road carries tourist traffic to the historic town of Cidade Velha, a UNESCO World Heritage
Site and traffic destined for the settlements beyond Cidade Velha. Feasibility analysis was
completed for 2 sections of 3.2 km and 2.8 km, with annual traffic in the range of 1,300 to 1,500
vehicles per day. The investment's main benefits are due to improved travel time and savings in
road user costs associated with a better speed and a reduction in vehicle operating costs
resulting from improved riding quality. The investment has a positive Net Present Value (NPV)
estimated to be around US$1.8 million, using a discount rate of 12 percent and an overall
economic rate of return estimated at 19.2 percent. These estimates are considered conservative
as generated traffic is not included in the analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the worst case (20
percent higher costs and 20 percent lower benefits) shows the investment remains viable with an
economic return of 12.6 percent though the NPV's are substantially lower. The proposed
rehabilitation will improve the realization of long term benefits associated with preservation of
the road asset.

25.     In addition to time and cost savings to existing (and generated) traffic, any increase in
tourism will benefit the micro economy and women. There is a higher concentration of the poor
in Cidade Velha with 39 percent of the local population living in poverty as compared to the
national average of 26.6 percent (2007 estimate). Though the national population is almost
equally divided between men and women, 56 percent of the poor are women. Further,
infrastructure access indicators for the region also suggest a low income population: access to
drinking water 65 percent, national average 90 percent; 60 percent of area population does not
                                                6
have a WC, national average 35 percent, access to tap water 8 percent, national average 47
percent.

26.     Rural roads Two rural roads are included for rehabilitation in the proposed AF. Both
Ribeira Principal (4 km) and Ribeira de São Miguel (10 km) are in the north of the island of
Santiago, in mountainous terrain. For these roads the main objective is to ensure basic access by
isolated populations to social, administrative and market opportunities. The two roads connect
some isolated but relatively populated rural settlements and important agricultural production
areas to the core road network. Currently agricultural production in this area is mostly on
subsistence basis, largely as reliable transport of products to markets is not available. The roads
at present are tracks, average 3 meters wide, with sections either of cobblestone or earth. The
proposed rehabilitation will make the road links passable year round through spot improvements
and improve the standard of service provided. It will contribute to the economic development of
the rural areas through decreased transport costs for agricultural inputs and outputs, and a much
improved access to health, education and social centers. The economic analysis methodology
for the proposed AF rural road rehabilitation will follow a cost effectiveness approach, as is
standard for rural roads, exactly as in the original RSSP.

Financial Management

27.    The PCO will handle the additional activities. The financial management arrangements
for the additional financing will be based on the existing arrangements in place under the
ongoing IDA project. The overall performance of the Road Sector Support Project in financial
management is Satisfactory. Staffing has remained adequate and proper books of accounts and
supporting documents have been kept in respect of all expenditures. During the last three years
the auditors' opinions on the annual financial statements of the PCO and the IE were submitted
on time and were unqualified. The interim un-audited financial reports for the on-going project
have also been submitted on time and the quality of the reports is satisfactory.

28.     The overall risk for the additional financing is rated Low. It is considered that the
financial management satisfies the Bank's minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.02, and
therefore is adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely financial
management information on the status of the project required by the World Bank.

Procurement

29.     There are no changes being proposed to the procurement arrangements of the original
credit under the RSSP. There are few procurement issues as there are two activities being
funded under the works and services categories. The main outstanding items are the civil works
and supervision contracts for the Praia-Cidade Velha road and the feeder roads rehabilitation.
The procurement plan shown in Annex 4 will be updated annually or as required to reflect the
actual project implementation.

30.    Procurement activities will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and Non-consulting Services under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in
January 2011, and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in January
                                               7
2011. "Guidelines on preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants", dated October 15, 2006, and updated January 2011,
shall apply to the project.

Procurement Capacity

31.     The institutional arrangements for the implementation of the proposed AF are essentially
the same as those being used to implement the RSSP. The project will continue to be directly
managed by the MITT through the PCO. The IE will be responsible for procurement of road
rehabilitation as well as selection of consultants for works supervision. Studies and bidding
documents are being prepared by Consultants that have been recruited under the RSSP.

32.     The IE is staffed by six engineers including the President of IE. The team has both the
technical expertise and the experience necessary to carry out the procurement activities. In
addition two of them have benefitted from regional training on procurement of works and
selection of consultants.

33.     In 2005, the PCO developed a Project Operational Manual including procurement
arrangements. The PCO also has a satisfactory archive system based on its extensive experience
in project management. The Project Operational Manual has been updated to include the
responsibility of IE and the involvement of the new Procurement Unit (portugese acronym
UGA) of MITT as well as the responsibilities linked to the construction of the roads under
Component 2. UGA's mandate is to oversee and provides clearance (control) on all
procurement transactions within the ministry. Further, annual procurement audits will be
conducted by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARAP) ­ both these measures will
further enhance transparency of procurement transactions and reduce the risk of fraud and
corruption in the country.

34.     The key issue and risk concerning procurement implementation under the project is need
for a better follow up of procurement monitoring progress. This is being addressed by building
in a follow-up mechanism: the project will report on the implementation of the agreed
procurement plan in the quarterly financial management report.

35.    The overall project risk for procurement is moderate.

Safeguard Aspects

36.     The negative environmental and social impacts of the rehabilitation of the 6 km main
road to Cidade Velha are very minor and no land acquisition would occur as the rehabilitation
would only concern the existing roads and right of way is not affected, consequently no
compensation is anticipated. OP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources) is being triggered for this
second AF; the Environmental Study, which includes an Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) for the road to Cidade Velha provides mitigation measures to ensure
that the civil works carefully avoid existing cultural assets, such as an old cobblestone road and
historical church. Guidelines for "chance finds" procedure will be integrated into the contracts
for construction and road maintenance consultants. These include development of a cultural
property management plan if physical cultural resources are found, in accordance with the
government of Cape Verde policies and guidelines. The environmental assessment category for
                                               8
the proposed second AF remains "B" ­ partial assessment, the same as the RSSP and the
existing AF.

37.     Regarding the rehabilitation of the 14 km rural roads, a preliminary review has been
completed and does not indicate any need for involuntary resettlement or land acquisition.
Should there be any need for additional resettlement, the ARAP will be updated as and when
necessary, once the alignment of the proposed rehabilitation is finalized. The Environmental
Study cited in the paragraph above includes an assessment of the environmental impacts and
mitigation measures for the rural roads. The environmental aspects are expected to be minimal,
while the social impacts are expected to be positive. ESMPs for the rural road works will be
prepared as and when necessary and disclosed in-country, at the PCO and in all municipalities
where works are planned. The proposed second AF triggers OP4.01 for Environmental
Assessment due to Safeguards performance which was reviewed and found satisfactory. In
addition to the Environmental Study, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA),
an ESMP and an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) were prepared for the original
project and approved by the Bank; these documents were disclosed on February 9, 2005. The
Environmental Study for the road to Cidade Velha and the rural roads was disclosed on
November 11, 2010; it was updated and re-disclosed on March 3, 2011.
