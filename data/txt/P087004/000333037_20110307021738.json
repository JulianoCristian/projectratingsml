The project\u0092s development\n            objective is to increase mobility of people in the targeted\n            areas and improve the planning and financing of the Road\n            Sector. The project will contribute to the higher level\n            poverty reduction objectives of promoting economic growth\n            and improving living conditions. This is being done by\n            supporting improved management of the roads and\n            infrastructure sectors and reducing the vulnerability of\n            road networks, thus facilitating physical access by the poor\n            to market opportunities and social services. The\n            environmental impacts are expected to be minimal. The social\n            impacts are expected to be positive. The environmental\n            impacts of the upgrading of the rural roads to a stone-paved\n            road are also estimated to be limited. The social impacts\n            will be very positive and contribute to reducing poverty in\n            the area by improving access to markets by local farmers.\n            The negative impacts will occur mainly during the\n            construction period of the road, in particular on the\n            resources of the soil (modification of physical\n            characteristics), on the water resources (pollution of\n            surface and underground waters) and on the atmosphere (dust,\n            smoke, noise). The impacts during the operational period\n            will be very limited and only related to the increment of\n            the road traffic. The project spells out the mitigation\n            measures which will be taken to minimize the impacts, which\n            include a list of the good practices to adopt for the\n            mitigation of the impacts and the control of the environment\n            quality after construction."}, "docdt": "2010-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
