the borrower's road sector management through\n            institutional reform of the road sector and improved\n            functioning of related civil works markets; and the better\n            access to social and economic opportunities due to improved\n            mobility for affected populations. The Additional financing\n            (AF) will help finance the costs associated with scaled-up\n            activities to enhance the impact of a well-performing\n            project. It will support the project development objective\n            (PDO) through support of the institutional reforms in the\n            road sector; and improved mobility of targeted populations\n            on the island of Santiago which will enhance their access to\n            social and economic opportunities. The current project\n            closing date is June 30, 2011, and the revised closing date\n            is June 30, 2013. The contracts are expected to be awarded\n            before mid 2011, and works expected to be completed by mid\n            2012. However, possible inadvertent delays and the defect\n            liability period of one year make it advisable to extend the\n            project closing date by two years."}, "docdt": "2011-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
