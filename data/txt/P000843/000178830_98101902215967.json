The main developments would include: land\n            clearing, fencing, watering facilities, improved pastures\n            and the purchase of breeding cattle; (b) the improvement of\n            some 50 privately-owned herds, ranging from 10 to 400 head\n            each in the areas surrounding the ranches. The owners would\n            be provided with technical advice and finance for improved\n            breeding stock, and where necessary for spray races, fencing\n            materials, land clearing and pasture improvement; (c) the\n            overseas training of Ghanaian ranch managers; (d) the\n            identification of further ranch sites and the preparation of\n            a second stage project."}, "docdt": "1974-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
