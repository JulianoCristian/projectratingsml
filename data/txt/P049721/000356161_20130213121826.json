Project for Kazakhstan were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: project\n            complexity should be geared to the capacity of the\n            implementing agency and enabling environment. Complex\n            projects with activities in different subsectors are\n            difficult to coordinate and prone to slow implementation.\n            The size of successful activities was too small for a\n            country like Kazakhstan. In retrospect, the larger\n            Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS) pool could have had a greater\n            influence on sector development. The size of the grants was\n            based on experience with similar programs in countries like\n            Albania, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, but even small and medium\n            enterprises in Kazakhstan have very different financial\n            needs. A thorough needs assessment should be done before\n            investments are committed to physical infrastructure\n            (lab-related activities under the project). This would have\n            allowed precise justification for purchases of lab equipment\n            and National Reference Laboratory (NRL) construction.\n            Significant budget co-financing poses operational challenges\n            that require attention."}, "docdt": "2013-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
