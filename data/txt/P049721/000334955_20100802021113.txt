                                      Extension of Closing Date

              KAZAKHSTAN AGRICULTURAL COMPETITIVENESS PROJECT

                                       Restructuring Memo


1.    The closing date for Kazakhstan Agricultural Competitiveness Project, 4774 KZ,
P049721 will be extended from July 30, 2010 until June 30, 2012.

2.      The project is effective since September 18, 2006. The project includes an innovative and
successful competitive grants scheme benefiting farmers, small agro industries and research
institutes, as well as harmonization of regulations and standards of quality of commodities,
modernization of oblast laboratories and construction of a National Reference Laboratory for an
integrated food safety system. Starting from the beginning of 2009 the project showed good
results almost in all components. Implementation progress rating and development objective
rating are moderately satisfactory. Financial monitoring, audit reports are satisfactory to the
Bank. Original project development objectives continue to be achievable at the end of the project
implementation.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to complete financing of the grants which were
already approved and still disbursing from loan funds (Part C 2(iii) of the project) and to
complete design of a new building for laboratory in Part A.2 of the Project Description (Schedule
2 of the Loan Agreement) (National Reference Laboratory). In first three rounds, 356 sub-
projects have been approved and started implementation; while in the fourth round an additional
221 sub-projects have been approved and will start disbursing after extension of the closing date.
In addition, the contract for designing the National Reference Laboratory is in the final phase of
negotiation. Although the request is to extend the project until June 30, 2013 the team feels that
at the moment extending until June 30, 2012 is fully sufficient to complete design/construction
of the Laboratory, conduct a tender to select contractor for construction of the laboratory and
financing of the grant subprojects. The Ministry of Agriculture remains committed to complete
construction in spite of the delays and procurement difficulties, and has expressed interest in
initiating a dialogue with the Bank on a possible follow-up operation.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
