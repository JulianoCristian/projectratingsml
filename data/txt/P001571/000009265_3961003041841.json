grass-roots\n            level which can provide financial services on a sustainable\n            basis to its members, and over time develop banking and\n            borrowing relationships with formal institutions. The\n            project includes:  (a) establishment of Savings and Loan\n            Associations (SLAs) in which all forms of savings, including\n            savings in kind, will be tested; (b) support for project\n            management, monitoring and evaluation, by the Mutual Savings\n            and Loan Development Association, which has been established\n            as a non-government association; and (c) services to develop\n            off-farm activities through basic and entrepreneurship\n            training in rural areas.  The project will not provide any\n            monies for SLA lending."}, "docdt": "1993-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
