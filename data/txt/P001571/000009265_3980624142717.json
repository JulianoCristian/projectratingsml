Project in Madagascar. It aimed at promoting a durable\n            savings and loan movement at the grass-roots level which\n            would provide sound financial services to its members, and\n            over time link up with formal institutions. It was also\n            intended to address the legal and regulatory issues involved\n            in the development of the savings and loan movement.\n            Overall, the Bank performed satisfactorily throughout the\n            project cycle. The performance of the Borrower was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (a)\n            significant human and material resources are required to\n            build solid and healthy institutions; (b) until the savings\n            culture is completely internalized, deposit mobilization\n            rather than external lines of credit should be persistently\n            and consistently maintained as basis for sustainable\n            capability to lend; (c) to balance cost and progress toward\n            self-sustainability, it is evident that the Savings and Loan\n            Association (SLA) networks must also move into urban areas\n            where population density is higher and savings are more\n            important; (d) where the need is identified and warranted,\n            financing should be provided to assist SLA networks set up\n            appropriate Management Information System (MIS) and\n            accounting systems; (e) funds should be earmarked for\n            mandatory external operational and financial audit of the\n            SLA networks once they reach a given level of assets; (f)\n            setting real positive interest rates on loans provides SLAs\n            with sufficient margins for cost recovery and put them on\n            the path to self-sustainability; and (g) government should\n            establish a mechanism to coordinate activities of competing\n            rural finance schemes."}, "docdt": "1998-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
