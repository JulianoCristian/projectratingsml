during the consultation meeting:
31     Welcome remarks from Mayor M.D. Enrico R Elumba;
B -2



3.2   Introduction of Participants;
3.3    Explanation of the purpose of the consultation meeting;
3.4    Brief description of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program
(NRIMP) in Tagalog and Ilongo;
3.5    Brief explanation of the project and the basic principle of the Resettlement Policy,
which was discussed in details as follows:
3.5.1  The La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is a World Bank-assisted NRIMP
Project, and as such, requires the preparation of a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) prior to implementation;
3.5.2  The Resettlement Policy is initially applicable only to road projects under
the NRIMP, and that PAPs must not expect the same guidelines,
especially in terms of compensation, to be applied to under road projects
of the Department,
3.5.3  The RAP would include three main areas of concern namely: (i) the
identification of adverse environmental impacts as well as the
recommendation of mitigating measures to abate such impacts; (ii) the
socio-economic survey of PAPs; and (iii) the determination of
compensation and entitlements of the PAPs.
3.5.4  The identification of the project-affected structures was still preliminary
since the detailed engineering design for the road section was still on-
going - and that tagging and census would be maximized to include all
possible PAPS. Furthermore, it was explained and clarified that the initial
count of affected structures may still be reduced once detailed design is
completed. This will be related to the PAPs through the 2nd Negros
Occidental DEO;
3.5.5  Following the International Bank for Rural Development (IBRD)
guidelines, the standard road-width is 12.7 meters. This consists of a
6.7-meter travel way, and a 1.5-meter shoulder and 1.5-meter side ditch
in both directions. However, the road width may vary depending on the
terrain, i.e. rolling to mountainous sections would necessitate wider right-
of-way (ROW) mainly due to cut and fill requirements;
3.5.6  The existing ROW for the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is set at 20
meters, except for some sections within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park
(MKNP,), which are narrower by about 5 meters;
3.5.7  There would be a CUT-OFF DATE for the identification of affected
structures, after which, any additional or new construction will not be
entitled to compensation. The cut-off date was set at the last day of the
conduct of the of socio-economic survey;
3.5.8  Structure with stickers bearing the tag number and the letter "S" refer to
structures that would severely affected, whereas, those with the letter
"M", refer to structures with marginal disturbances such as damages to
fences, extensions that are not vital to the stability and integrity of the
main structure, cutting of fruit trees, and the likes;
3.5.9  For fixed assets that would be demolished, PAPs would be compensated
100% prior to demolition. Compensation would be based on replacement
cost (i e. current price of materials and labor cost if structures were to be
reconstructed/rebuilt), without deductions for salvaged materials.
However, it was pointed out that PAPs must vacate their compensated
properties seven (7) days after full payment was received, whether the
project will be implemented immediately or not. This is also stated in the
contract that the PAPs will sign,
B-3



3.5.10 Compensation for the land would be based on the fair market value to be
set by an Independent Land Appraiser (ILA); and
3.5.11 Payment procedure to PAPs would be very transparent, since they would
be asked to sign documentation papers with the signature of the
concerned Brgy. Captain affixed on it;
4.0    Open Forum
Issues, Concerns, and Questions Raised:
r That there are projects which were not implemented due to lack of cooperation of the
people;
- That the Consultants should assists the LGUs in explaining the project to affected
residents;
> That past experiences regarding non-payment of compensation to landowners,
Responses and Clarifications:
>  All PAPs will be justly and fairly paid and that a Municipal-based Assessment Team
would be formed to ensure proper compensation to all concerned;
>  Emphasis that the resettlement policies for the proposed Upgrading of the La
Castellana-Canlaon City Road Section is strictly for World Bank-assisted projects
only;
5.0    Other Matters
Identification of Landowners in the vicinity of the first three bridges in Robles
)P The lands adjacent to the Taborda Bridge is owned by a certain Mr. Angel Vargas,
with Lot No. 862-A;
>  The lands adjacent to Antulan Bridge is owned by a certain Mr. Ildefonso Coscuela,
with Lot No. 863-A;
>  The lands adjacent to the 1t approach of the lnduruyan Bridge is owned by a certain
Conchita Coscuela, with Lot No. 855-B11; and
>  The lands adjacent to the last approach of the lnduruyan Bridge is owned by a certain

concemed Brgy. Captain affixed on it;
4.0    Open Forum
Issues and Concems Raised
That compensation to affected houses would not be on a "flat rate" basis, meaning
structures would be compensated at the same amount; instead, structures should be
paid based on actual dimension and type of materials used for the house;
If houses within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park (MKNP) will be paid even if the PAPs
do not own the land,
>  If tax declaration (TD) can be used as proof of land ownership;
PAPs should be notified in advance prior to interview,
>  If fruit bearing trees would be compensated;
>  If farmlands are planted to sugarcane what would be the compensation;
If land titles are not yet released, can the Certificate of Land Ownership Agreement
(CLOA) be used as a proof ownership of land; and
0 Brgy. Capt. Willy Barison suggested to the CLOA holders to secure individual taxes
so that the DPWH will have basis for payment;
Responses and Clarifications
>  Compensation of fixed assets would be at replacement cost, i.e. the cost to
reconstruct a new structure of the same size using the same type of materials;
>  For PAPs within the MKNP, if they don't own the land, compensation would be only
be in terms of affected structures and improvements;
>  Tax declaration is an acceptable proof of land ownership. TD holders are eligible for
land compensation;
>  PCMs are conducted in the affected areas to inform and educate the PAPs about the
proposed project and allow them to ventilate their apprehensions, suggestions and
issues and concerns regarding the said project. Surveys will not be undertaken
without the conduct of PCM to prevent confusion and misinterpretation;
>  Fruit bearing trees and crops to be damaged will be included in the payment for
improvements The price would be based on the Municipal Assessor's valuation;
>  The LGU of La Castellana has identified areas for urban expansion in Bgry. Robles
and Cabacungan, which are possible relocation sites. However, some portions of
these areas are still subject for approval by the DAR for conversion from agricultural
to residential areas,
>  If the impact is severe, and the PAP is a landowner, he would be compensated for
the land based on the ILA appraisal plus financial assistance, and given sufficient
time to harvest their crops. If the PAP is an agricultural lessee, he is entitled to a
disturbance compensation equivalent to five (5) times the average of his gross
harvest in the last five (5) years, but not less P15, 000.00;
> CLOA will also be honoured as a proof of land ownership;

3.2    Welcome remarks from Brgy Captain Ruben Deles;
3.3   Introduction of Participants;
B-13



3.4    Brief description of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program
(NRIMP) in Tagalog and llongo;
3.5    Brief explanation of the project and the basic principle of the Resettlement Policy,
which was discussed in details in Tagalog and Ilongo as follows:
3.5.1  The La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is a World Bank-assisted NRIMP
Project, and as such, requires the preparation of a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) prior to implementation;
3.5.2  The Resettlement Policy is initially applicable only to road projects under
the NRIMP, and that PAPs must not expect the same guidelines,
especially in terms of compensation, to be applied to under road projects
of the Department,
3.5.3  The RAP would include three main areas of concern namely (i) the
identification of adverse environmental impacts as well as the
recommendation of mitigating measures to abate such impacts; (ii) the
socio-economic survey of PAPs; and (iii) the determination of
compensation and entitlements of the PAPs
3.5.4  The identification of the project-affected structures was still preliminary
since the detailed engineering design for the road section was still on-
going --- and that tagging and census would be maximized to include all
possible PAPS Furthermore, it was explained and clarified that the initial
count of affected structures may still be reduced once detailed design is
completed  This will be related to the PAPs through the 2nd Negros
Occidental DEO;
3.5.5  Following the International Bank for Rural Development (IBRD)
guidelines, the standard road width is 12.7 meters. This consists of a
6 7-meter travel way, and a 1.5-meter shoulder and 1.5-meter side ditch
in both directions. However, the road width may vary depending on the
terrain, i.e. rolling to mountainous sections would necessitate wider right-
of-way (ROW), mainly due to cut and fill requirements;
3.5.6  The existing ROW for the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is set at 20
meters, except for some sections within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park
(MKNP), which are narrower by about 5 meters;
3.5.7  There would be a CUT-OFF DATE for the identification of affected
structures, after which, any additional or new construction will not be
entitled to compensation. The cut-off date was set at the last day of the
conduct of the of socio-economic survey;
3.5.8  Structure with stickers bearing the tag number and the letter "S" refer to
structures that would severely affected, whereas, those with the letter
"M", refer to structures with marginal disturbances such as damages to
fences, extensions that are not vital to the stability and integrity of the
main structure, cutting of fruit trees, and the likes;
3.5.9  For fixed assets that would be demolished, PAPs would be compensated
100% prior to demolition. Compensation would be based on replacement
cost (i.e. current price of materials and labor cost if structures were to be
reconstructed/rebuilt), without deductions for salvaged materials.
However, it was pointed out that PAPs must vacate their compensated
properties seven (7) days after full payment was received, whether the
project will be implemented immediately or not This is also stated in the
contract that the PAPs will sign;
3.5.10 Compensation for the land would be based on the fair market value to be
set by an Independent Land Appraiser (ILA), and
B - 14



3.5.11 Payment procedure to PAPs would be very transparent, since they would
be asked to sign documentation papers with the signature of the
concemed Brgy. Captain affixed on it;
4.0    Open Forum
Issues, Concerns, and Questions Raised:
>  If the cost for the demolition of structures is included in the compensation package;
If fruit bearing trees would be compensated, and who would be responsible for the
tree cutting;
o If fruit trees damaged during project implementation be compensated;
)' How about PAPs who do not have lands to rebuild their houses;
>  If affected families would be relocated and how their structures be demolished;
>  If only a portion of the structure would be affected/damaged will the compensation still
be in full amount;
>  The relocation site at Brgy. Robles is yet to be approved by the Department of
Agrarian Reform (DAR);
>  If the PAPs will be relocated, will they pay the lands at the relocation site;
>  PAPs should be notified in advance prior to survey;
>  Compensation package for those PAPs who own the structures but do not own the
land;
>  If houses within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park (MKNP) will be paid even if the PAPs
do not own the land,
>  If the govemment would pay the properties based on actual assessment;
Responses and Clarifications:
>  If the PAP will be responsible for the demolition of his structure, demolition cost would
be included in the computation of compensation; otherwise, the cost for demolition
would be deducted from the compensation package;
>  Fruit bearing trees and crops to be damaged will be included in the payment for
improvements. The price would be based on the Municipal Assessor's valuation;
>  The LGU of La Castellana has identified areas for urban expansion in Bgry. Robles
and Cabacungan, which are possible relocation sites. However, some portions of
these areas are still subject for approval by the DAR for conversion from agricultural
to residential areas;
>  For PAPs who own structures made of light to wooden materials, the Consultant
advised them to demolish their own houses. In this way, they can carefully dislodged
the structure and recover reusable materials. Concrete and semi-concrete structure
owners have the option to either demolished the structures themselves or let the
DPWH to do job. However, if they choose the Department to do the demolition
works, the cost would be deducted from the compensation package of the structure
owners;
>  Payment for structures will be at replacement cost (i.e. current price of materials and
labor cost if structures were to be reconstructed/rebuilt) depending on the materials
used. If the structure is made of light or wooden materials, compensation would be
paid in full; but if only a portion of a semi-concrete or concrete structure would be
B-15



affected and the remaining part of the structure is still viable, then, only the affected
portion would be compensated;
>  In accordance with the R.A. 7279, relocatees at government-provided relocation sites
must pay for the land they will occupy at an affordable amortization rate, which will
later be titled to them;
>  PCMs are conducted in the affected areas to inform and educate the PAPs about the
proposed project and allow them to ventilate their apprehensions, suggestions and
issues and concerns regarding the said project. Surveys will not be undertaken
without the conduct of PCM to prevent confusion and misinterpretation;
If the PAPs own the structures but do not own the lands, compensation would be only
be in terms of affected structures and improvements;
For PAPs within the MKNP, if they don't own the land, compensation would be only
be in terms of affected structures and improvements;
For the lands to be acquired, the government would pay at the rate specified by the
ILA. For structures, payment would be based on replacement cost. Compensation
for improvements would be based on the Municipal Assessor's latest schedule of
payment for improvements.

See the attached Attendance Sheets
2.0    Scope and Objectives of the Meeting
The Public Consultation Meeting (PCM) was conducted to:
2.1    Present the proposed Upgrading of the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road Section

concems, suggestions, and apprehensions regarding the project; and
2.4    Encourage the PAPs to actively participate in the conduct of the RAP, especially
during the survey
3.0    Flow of the Meeting
The meeting was started at around 8:30 A.M. The following is a sequence of the
activities during the meeting at Cabagna-an:
3.1   Invocation
3.2    Introduction of Participants,
B -21



3.3    Brief description of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program
(NRIMP);
3.4    Brief explanation of the project and the basic principle of the Resettlement Policy,
which was discussed in details as follows:
3.4.1  The La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is a World Bank-assisted NRIMP
Project, and as such, requires the preparation of a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) prior to implementation;
3.4.2  The Resettlement Policy is initially applicable only to road projects under
the NRIMP, and that PAPs must not expect the same guidelines,
especially in terms of compensation, to be applied to under road projects
of the Department;
3.4.3  The RAP would include three main areas of concern namely. (i) the
identification of adverse environmental impacts as well as the
recommendation of mitigating measures to abate such impacts; (ii) the
socio-economic survey of PAPs; and (iii) the determination of
compensation and entitlements of the PAPs
3.4.4  The identification of the project-affected structures was still preliminary
since the detailed engineering design for the road section was still on-
going - and that tagging and census would be maximized to include all
possible PAPS. Furthermore, it was explained and clarified that the initial
count of affected structures may still be reduced once detailed design is
completed. This will be related to the PAPs through the 2r'd Negros
Occidental DEO;
3.4.5  Following the International Bank for Rural Development (IBRD)
guidelines, the standard road width is 12.7 meters. This consists of a
6.7-meter travel way, and a 1.5-meter shoulder and 1.5-meter side ditch
in both directions. However, the road width may vary depending on the
terrain, i.e. rolling to mountainous sections would necessitate wider right-
of-way (ROW), mainly due to cut and fill requirements;
3.4.6  The existing ROW for the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is set at 20
meters, except for some sections within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park
(MKNP), which are narrower by about 5 meters;
3.4.7  There would be a CUT-OFF DATE for the identification of affected
structures, after which, any additional or new construction will not be
entitled to compensation. The cut-off date was set at the last day of the
conduct of the of socio-economic survey;
3.4.8  Structure with stickers bearing the tag number and the letter "S" refer to
structures that would severely affected, whereas, those with the letter
"M", refer to structures with marginal disturbances such as damages to
fences, extensions that are not vital to the stability and integrity of the
main structure, cutting of fruit trees, and the likes;
3.4.9  For fixed assets that would be demolished, PAPs woulcd be compensated
100% prior to demolition. Compensation would be based on replacement
cost (i.e. current price of materials and labor cost if structures were to be
reconstructed/rebuilt), without deductions for salvaged materials.
However, it was pointed out that PAPs must vacate their compensated
properties seven (7) days after full payment was received, whether the
project will be implemented immediately or not This is also stated in the
contract that the PAPs will sign,
3.4.10 Compensation for the land would be based on the fair market value to be
set by an Independent Land Appraiser (ILA); and

3.4.11 Payment procedure to PAPs would be very transparent, since they would
be asked to sign documentation papers with the signature of the
concemed Brgy. Captain affixed on it;
4.0   Open Forum
Issues, Concems, and Questions Raised
If houses are located along cliffs that would necessitate cut and fill where would PAPs
be relocated, considering they don't own any land;
Measurement of the road from the centerline, and how much of the lands would be
taken;
If the government would pay the properties based on actual assessment;
If what would be the compensation package for those PAPs who own the structures
but do not own the land;
>  If what would be the basis of payment for fruit trees to be cut and crops to be
damaged; and
>  If the houses are within a hacienda, will the DPWH initiate the negotiation with the
owner of the hacienda
Responses and Clarifications
>  The LGU of La Castellana has identified areas for urban expansion in Bgry. Robles
and Cabacungan, which are possible relocation sites. However, some portions of
these areas are still subject for approval by the DAR for conversion from agricultural
to residential areas;
>  Land takes will be dependent on the terrain of the road sections. Since the
construction limit in La Castellana is 20 meters, PAPs should expect the limit to reach
10 meters from the centerline;
>  For the lands to be acquired, the govemment would pay at the rate specified by the
ILA. For structures, payment would be based on replacement cost. Compensation
for improvements would be based on the Municipal Assessor's latest schedule of
payment for improvements
>  For PAPs who own the structures but do not own the lands, compensation would be
only be in terms of affected structures and improvements;
>  Fruit bearing trees and crops to be damaged will be included in the payment for
improvements. The price would be based on the Municipal Assessor's valuation;
>  The Department will negotiate only with the hacienda owner and the hacienda owner
will be the one to deal with the PAPs within his property

1.1    Brgy. Officials of Mansalanao;
1.2   Affected residents of Mansalanao,
1.3    Representatives of the DPWH Central Office (EIA-PO) and 2"d Negros Occidental
District Engineering Office (DEO);
1.4    A representative of Katahira and Engineers Intemational (KEI)
See the attached Attendance Sheets
2.0    Scope and Objectives of the Meeting
The Public Consultation Meeting (PCM) was conducted to:
2.1    Present the proposed Upgrading of the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road Section
Project under the World Bank-assisted National Roads Improvement and
Management Program (NRIMP);
2.2    Explain the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) needed for the said project and its
policies;
2.3    Provide a venue for the project affected persons (PAPs) to ventilate their issues,
concems, suggestions, and apprehensions regarding the project; and
2.4    Encourage the PAPs to actively participate in the conduct of the RAP, especially
during the survey
3.0    Flow of the Meeting
The meeting started at around 1:15 P.M The following is a sequence of the activities
during the meeting at Mansalanao
3.1    Invocation
3.2   Introduction of Participants,
B -31



3.3    Brief description of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program
(NRIMP) in llongo;
3.4    Brief explanation of the project and the basic principle of the Resettlement Policy
in llongo courtesy of Engr. Lea Delfinado, Chief, Planning Section of the 2 'd
Negros Occidental District Engineering Office. The said policy was discussed in
details as follows:
3.4.1  The La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is a World Bank-assisted NRIMP
Project, and as such, requires the preparation of a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) prior to implementation;
3.4.2  The Resettlement Policy is initially applicable only to road projects under
the NRIMP, and that PAPs must not expect the same guidelines,
especially in terms of compensation, to be applied to under road projects
of the Department;
3.4.3  The RAP would include three main areas of concern namely (i) the
identification of adverse environmental impacts as well as the
recommendation of mitigating measures to abate such impacts; (ii) the
soclo-economic survey of PAPs; and (iii) the determination of
compensation and entitlements of the PAPs
3.4.4  The identification of the project-affected structures was still preliminary
since the detailed engineering design for the road section was still on-
going - and that tagging and census would be maximized to include all
possible PAPS. Furthermore, it was explained and clarified that the initial
count of affected structures may still be reduced once detailed design is
completed. This will be related to the PAPs through the 2"d Negros
Occidental DEO;
3.4.5  Following the International Bank for Rural Development (IBRD)
guidelines, the standard road width is 12.7 meters. This consists of a
6.7-meter travel way, and a 1.5-meter shoulder and 1.5-meter side ditch
in both directions. However, the road width may vary depending on the
terrain, i.e. rolling to mountainous sections would necessitate wider right-
of-way (ROW), mainly due to cut and fill requirements;
3.4.6  The existing ROW for the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is set at 20
meters, except for some sections within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park
(MKNP), which are narrower by about 5 meters;
3.4.7  There would be a CUT-OFF DATE for the identification of affected
structures, after which, any additional or new construction will not be
entitled to compensation. The cut-off date was set at the last day of the
conduct of the of socio-economic survey;
3.4.8  Structure with stickers bearing the tag number and the letter "S" refer to
structures that would severely affected, whereas, those with the letter
"M", refer to structures with marginal disturbances such as damages to
fences, extensions that are not vital to the stability and integrity of the
main structure, cutting of fruit trees, and the likes;
3.4.9  For fixed assets that would be demolished, PAPs would be compensated
100% prior to demolition. Compensation would be based on replacement
cost (i.e. current price of materials and labor cost if structures were to be
reconstructed/rebuilt), without deductions for salvaged materials
However, it was pointed out that PAPs must vacate their compensated
properties seven (7) days after full payment was received, whether the
project will be implemented immediately or not. This is also stated in the
contract that the PAPs will sign;
3.4.10 Compensation for the land would be based on the fair market value to be
set by an Independent Land Appraiser (ILA); and
B -32



3.4.11 Payment procedure to PAPs would be very transparent, since they would
be asked to sign documentation papers with the signature of the
concemed Brgy. Captain affixed on it;
4.0   Open Forum
Issues, Concems, and Questions Raised
> If fruit trees to be cut and crops to be damaged would be compensated and what
would be the basis of payment;
> If the existing bridge would be included in the rehabilitation; and
>o If what is the existing ROW
Responses and Clarifications
> Fruit bearing trees and crops to be damaged will be included in the payment for
improvements. The price would be based on the Municipal Assessor's valuation;
> All the bridges along the road section will be rehabilitated; and
> The existing ROW in La Castellana is 20 meters

4.0    Open Forum
Issues, Concerns, and Questions Raised
> If what is the system of compensation to crops, especially to sugarcane,
P If the government would pay the structures, particularly the houses based on actual
cost of construction;
P If who would be the representative of the barangay during the survey;
P If there would be a relocation site for the PAPs and where;
> If where the road alignment would pass;
> If the relocation cost can be converted into cash;
Responses and Clarifications
> Fruit bearing trees and crops to be damaged will be included in the payment for
improvements. The price would be based on the Municipal Assessor's valuation;
>  For the lands to be acquired, the govemment would pay at the rate specified by the
ILA. For structures, payment would be based on replacement cost. Compensation
for improvements would be based on the Municipal Assessor's latest schedule of
payment for improvements;
>  The barangay's representative during validation would depend on the Municipal RAP
Implementation Committee (MRIC) that will be formed;
>  The LGU of La Castellana has identified areas for urban expansion in Bgry. Robles
and Cabacungan, which are possible relocation sites. However, some portions of
these areas are still subject for approval by the DAR for conversion from agricultural
to residential areas;
>  The alignment will follow the existing road, except for some sections where re-
alignments and new bridges are necessary like in the first three bridges in Robles;
> A new Taborda Bridge will have to constructed because the existing is a private
bridge

B -43



3.4    Brief description of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program
(NRIMP);
3.5    Brief explanation of the project and the basic principle of the Resettlement Policy
in llongo courtesy of Engr. Lea Delfinado, Chief, Planning Section of the 2"d
Negros Occidental District Engineering Office. The said policy was discussed in
details as follows
3.5.1  The La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is a World Bank-assisted NRIMP
Project, and as such, requires the preparation of a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) prior to implementation;
3.5.2  The Resettlement Policy is initially applicable only to road projects under
the NRIMP, and that PAPs must not expect the same guidelines,
especially in terms of compensation, to be applied to under road projects
of the Department;
3.5.3  The RAP would include three main areas of concem namely (i) the
identification of adverse environmental impacts as well as the
recommendation of mitigating measures to abate such impacts, (ii) the
socio-economic survey of PAPs; and (iii) the determination of
compensation and entitlements of the PAPs
3.5.4  The identification of the project-affected structures was still preliminary
since the detailed engineering design for the road section was still on-
going --- and that tagging and census would be maximized to include all
possible PAPS. Furthermore, it was explained and clarified that the initial
count of affected structures may still be reduced once detailed design is
completed. This will be related to the PAPs through the 2nd Negros
Occidental DEO;
3.5.5  Following the International Bank for Rural Development (IBRD)
guidelines, the standard road width is 12.7 meters. This consists of a
6.7-meter travel way, and a 1.5-meter shoulder and 1.5-meter side ditch
in both directions. However, the road width may vary depending on the
terrain, i.e. rolling to mountainous sections would necessitate wider right-
of-way (ROW), mainly due to cut and fill requirements;
3.5.6  The existing ROW for the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is set at 20
meters, except for some sections within the Mt. Kanlaon Nationai ParK
(MKNP), which are narrower by about 5 meters;
3.5.7  There would be a CUT-OFF DATE for the identification of affected
structures, after which, any additional or new construction will not be
entitled to compensation. The cut-off date was set at the last day of the
conduct of the of socio-economic survey;
3.5.8  Structure with stickers bearing the tag number and the letter "S" refer to
structures that would severely affected, whereas, those with the letter
"M", refer to structures with marginal disturbances such as damages to
fences, extensions that are not vital to the stability and integrity of the
main structure, cutting of fruit trees, and the likes;
3.5 9  For fixed assets that would be demolished, PAPs would be compensated
100% prior to demolition. Compensation would be based on replacement
cost (i e. current price of materials and labor cost if structures were to be
reconstructed/rebuilt), without deductions for salvaged materials.
However, it was pointed out that PAPs must vacate their compensated
properties seven (7) days after full payment was received, whether the
project will be implemented immediately or not This is also stated in the
contract that the PAPs will sign;
3.5.10 Compensation for the land would be based on the fair market value to be
set by an Independent Land Appraiser (ILA); and

3.5.11 Payment procedure to PAPs would be very transparent, since they would
be asked to sign documentation papers with the signature of the
concemed Brgy. Captain affixed on it;
4.0    Open Forum
Issues, Concems, and Questions Raised
>  If what is the width of the proposed road;
>  If what is the system of compensation to sugarcane plantation;
> If houses along cut sections would be affected;
I If only those houses with stickers/tags would be affected; and
P If how much the compensation would be for big concrete houses
Responses and Clarifications
>  The total width of the road is 12. 7 meters - that includes a 1.5-meter shoulder and
side ditches on both sides;
Sk If the impact is severe, and the PAP is a landowner, he would be compensated for
the land based on the ILA appraisal plus financial assistance, and given sufficient
time to harvest their crops If the PAP is an agricultural lessee, he is entitled to a
disturbance compensation equivalent to five (5) times the average of his gross
harvest in the last five (5) years, but not less P15, 000.00;
>  Structures along cut and fill sections would be affected depending on the location and
the ROW needed for such sections;
>  Payment for structures will be at replacement cost (i.e. current price of materials and
labor cost if structures were to be reconstructed/rebuilt) depending on the materials
used. If the structure is made of light or wooden materials, compensation would be
paid in full; but if only a portion of a semi-concrete or concrete structure would be
affected and the remaining part of the structure is still viable, then, only the affected
portion would be compensated

especially in terms of compensation, to be applied to under road projects
of the Department,
3.4.3  The RAP would include three main areas of concern namely: (i) the
identification of adverse environmental impacts as well as the
recommendation of mitigating measures to abate such impacts; (ii) the
socio-economic survey of PAPs; and (iii) the determination of
compensation and entitlements of the PAPs.
3.4.4  The identification of the project-affected structures was still preliminary
since the detailed engineering design for the road section was still on-
going - and that tagging and census would be maximized to include all
possible PAPS. Furthermore, it was explained and clarified that the initial
count of affected structures may still be reduced once detailed design is
completed. This will be related to the PAPs through the 2nd Negros
Occidental DEO;
3.4.5  Following the International Bank for Rural Development (IBRD)
guidelines, the standard road width is 12.7 meters. This consists of a
6.7-meter travel way, and a 1.5-meter shoulder and 1.5-meter side ditch
in both directions. However, the road width may vary depending on the
terrain, i.e. rolling to mountainous sections would necessitate wider right-
of-way (ROW), mainly due to cut and fill requirements;
3.4.6  The existing ROW for the La Castellana-Canlaon City Road is set at 20
meters, except for some sections within the Mt. Kanlaon National Park
(MKNP), which are narrower by about 5 meters;
3.4.7  There would be a CUT-OFF DATE for the identification of affected
structures, after which, any additional or new construction will not be
entitled to compensation. The cut-off date was set at the last day of the
conduct of the of socio-economic survey;
3.4.8  Structure with stickers bearing the tag number and the letter "S" refer to
structures that would severely affected, whereas, those with the letter
"M", refer to structures with marginal disturbances such as damages to
fences, extensions that are not vital to the stability and integrity of the
main structure, cutting of fruit trees, and the likes;
3.4.9  For fixed assets that would be demolished, PAPs would be compensated
100% prior to demolition. Compensation would be based on replacement
cost (i.e. current price of materials and labor cost if structures were to be
reconstructed/rebuilt), without deductions for salvaged materials
However, it was pointed out that PAPs must vacate their compensated
properties seven (7) days after full payment was received, whether the
project will be implemented immediately or not This is also stated in the
contract that the PAPs will sign;
3.4.10 Compensation for the land would be based on the fair market value to be
set by an Independent Land Appraiser (ILA); and
3.4.11 Payment procedure to PAPs would be very transparent, since they would
be asked to sign documentation papers with the signature of the
concerned Brgy. Captain affixed on it;

4.0    Open Forum
Issues, Concems, and Questions Raised
>  That the 7-day period given to them to vacate their properties after full payment is not
adequate to rebuild a new house, especially the concrete and semi-concrete
structures;
>  If how the Department would deal with water interruptions, in any case the water lines
are damaged during construction;
Responses and Clarifications
> In the design, this matter had been considered. However, in areas where water
supply interruptions would be experienced, advance notice would be given to
residents. Water services would be restored to normal immediately after completion
of the construction works.
