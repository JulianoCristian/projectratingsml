acquisition of land and other assets, and\n            resettlement will be minimized; 2) only those project\n            affected people (PAPs) are eligible for compensation for\n            lost assets; 3) replacement of residential, or agricultural\n            lands will be allocated as close as possible to land lost,\n            as acceptable to the PAPs; 4) PAPs losing all of their fixed\n            assets, or partial losses, but where the remaining assets\n            are determined by concerned authorities as not viable for\n            continued use, will be entitled to full compensation at\n            replacement costs; 5) in the case of PAPs' affected\n            partial loss of land or structures, and where the remaining\n            assets are viable for continued use, compensation for\n            affected assets will be paid in cash; and, 6) the following\n            modes of compensation are to be observed: a) compensation\n            will be equivalent to the amount of materials, and labor to\n            re-construct a similar structure for houses, or other fixed\n            structures, but with deductions for salvaged materials; b)\n            compensation at replacement costs for the loss of other\n            fixed assets will be provided; and, c) compensation for land\n            losses, will be provided with land of equivalent productive\n            value at a location acceptable to the PAP, or if land is\n            unavailable, payable in cash, at market values."}, "docdt": "2002-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
