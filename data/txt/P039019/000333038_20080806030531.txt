F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The purpose of National Roads Improvement and Management Program (NRIMP) is to ensure the preservation
of an improved national roads system (NRS) in an environmentally, socially and financially sustainable manner.

NRIMP will include three phases: design (NRIMP-1), initiation (NRIMP-2) and operation (NRIMP-3).

NRIMP-1 will: (a) prepare detailed designs and phased implementation plan for new organizational structures
including an independent organization such as a road maintenance authority (RMA) or equivalent for the
national road system (NRS), allowing them to be managed in a commercial fashion; (b) establish a sustainable
financing mechanism, such as a road fund or equivalent, dedicated to preserving the national roads, to be funded
from road user charges and based on actual level of maintenance needs and road usage; (c) undertake the
development and establishment of key business processes and system renewals within the Department of
Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and proposed RMA; and (d) upgrade and maintain sections of the NRS at
good standards.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

No formal revisions.

1  There is some ambiguity in the PAD about the number of km to be upgraded under NRIMP-1. The project description in the
   main text clearly specifies 528 km for NRIMP-1 out of 2,200 km for the whole program. The Loan Agreement says 530 km.
   A table in Annex 2 of the PAD (Project Description) shows 532 km. The Project Design Summary in Annex 1 gives as an
   output for road upgrading of "at least 280 km" to be achieved by 2003. This output target has been used in the PSRs and
   ISRs to measure project progress.        Finally, table A.01 of Annex 6 of the PAD (Procurement and Disbursement
   Arrangements) shows financing for a number of road upgrading being rolled over into NRIMP-2. According to this table and
   the corresponding cost estimates, a total of about 330 km should be built under NRIMP-1. The reduced output target
   probably stems from the fact that the appraisal team had high hopes to accomplish all triggers for Phase 2 by the end of 2003,
   at which time the civil work contracts would still be ongoing.

1.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

After the economic crisis that hit the region in 1997, the Philippine Government projected a
steady recovery that would eventually result in an annual GDP growth of four to five percent
by the year 2002. To support this target, the Bank's May 1999 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) had the overall objective to "restore stronger growth with more poverty reduction and
greater equity." The CAS proposed as main activities a combination of lending, policy advice
and technical assistance over the medium-term plan period (1999-2004) to help the country:

    a) Address the effects of the crisis and promote economic recovery;
    b) Enhance human development and social services for the poor;
    c) Accelerate environmentally sustainable rural development;
    d) Promote sustainable urban development and combat urban poverty;
    e) Develop infrastructure, particularly in the provinces;
    f) Enable expansion of the private sector; and
    g) Improve governance and transparency and fight corruption.

The National Road Improvement and Management Program (NRIMP) includes three of the
above activities (a, e, f, and g) by commercializing the road sector and upgrading/maintaining
the National Roads System (NRS).

The CAS also stated that transport bottlenecks persist, despite Government support through
the Highway Maintenance Project (HMP) and that the highway network, while adequate in
size, is of poor quality and inadequately maintained. The main issues affecting the road sector
at the time of appraisal can be summarized as follows:

    External Pressure. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) could not
    follow its mandate to focus on national roads as it was frequently being asked to carry out
    activities on local roads. A long overdue reclassification of the NRS was being resisted
    by Congress as it would reduce funding for some of the (local) roads. Resettlement plans
    were often hampered and some inefficient contractors and consultants were being
    protected.

    Institutional Weakness. DPWH skill level had declined noticeably as some of the young
    bright professionals had moved to the private sector.         The agency lacked modern
    analytical and information tools, which would have allowed the resources to be managed
    efficiently. As overall planning was inadequate, transport services were poorly integrated.

    Insufficient Funding. Due to the regional financial crises, the Government budget was
    reduced by 25 percent in FY98. The DPWH budget was mainly used for recurrent cost
    and counterpart funds for foreign-assisted projects.        The backlog for preventive
    maintenance was increasing as budgets had covered only about 30 percent of needs.




                                                1

    Legal Problems. The Government had difficulties in acquiring land for the right-of-way
    for infrastructure as procedures for resettling both squatters and legal residents were
    extremely cumbersome. Also, under the legal system, which gave contractors the right to
    place injunctions, it was difficult to cancel contracts of non-performing contractors and
    impossible to collect performance bonds.

    Technical Obstacles. Local consulting and contracting firms that work in the road sector
    did not have a good performance record, mainly because: (a) procurement activities were
    managed poorly, especially pre-qualification; (b) licensing was lax, as a result of which
    inefficient firms were allowed to operate; (c) unit costs were kept artificially low and
    contractors could not perform adequately; (d) payments were delayed; and (e) quality
    control, supervision, contract enforcement and financial management were ineffectual.

    Environment.      Although substantial progress had been made in managing the
    environment, the regulations were not fully enforced, especially for locally funded
    projects, impeding sustainable development.

Government, through DPWH, had prepared a Long-Term Development Plan (1997-2026) and
a Medium-Term Development Plan (1999-2004), during which the Government's role would
be limited to investing only in core infrastructure, establishing regulations and halting
monopoly practices. It would also promote sustainability, commercialization, private sector
investment in operations and infrastructure, competition in the transport markets, and
responsiveness to users. The Medium-Term Development Plan aimed to:

    · ensure that the national roads are maintained;
    · upgrade to all-weather standards the national arterial road network (on 6,000-8,000
        km);
    · commercialize the road sector (creating a Road Authority and Highway Fund);
    · separate policy making and regulation from operations through institutional reforms;
        and
    · complete the transfer of responsibility for provincial/local roads to local authorities.

As the following Project Development Objectives show, NRIMP, through its three phases, is
trying to support the Government's objectives and to address most of the above sector issues.
An Operations Evaluation Department Country Assistance Review, carried out in 1998
concluded that the Bank, with its considerable experience, should remain active in the
Philippines transport sector because the sector has strategic importance, and needs public
investment and institutional support.        Furthermore, as the Bank had participated in
formulating the transport sector strategy, it was well prepared to help implement it.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The purpose of National Roads Improvement and Management Project (NRIMP) is to ensure
the preservation of an improved national roads system (NRS) in an environmentally, socially
and financially sustainable manner. NRIMP will include three phases: design (NRIMP-1),



                                                2

initiation (NRIMP-2) and operation (NRIMP-3). NRIMP-1 will (a) prepare detailed designs
and phased implementation plan for new organizational structures including an independent
organization such as a road maintenance authority (RMA) or equivalent for the national road
system (NRS), allowing them to be managed in a commercial fashion; (b) establish a
sustainable financing mechanism, such as a road fund or equivalent, dedicated to preserving
the national roads, to be funded from road user charges and based on actual level of
maintenance needs and road usage; (c) undertake the development and establishment of key
business processes and system renewals           within the Department of Public Works and
Highways (DPWH) and proposed RMA; and (d) upgrade and maintain sections of the NRS at
good standards.

Key performance indicators for Phase one of the NRIMP as set out in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) are as follows:

    (a) Organizational improvements

        Policy, planning and service roles with respect to managing the NRS will be defined
        and assigned to appropriate new or improved organizations, including a road
        maintenance authority (RMA), which will be established under NRIMP-2 and -3.

    (b) Business improvements

        Planning road investments. By mid-2002, the economic value of the assessed part of
        the investment program will have a net present value (NPV) that is greater than 1.2 per
        unit cost.
        Managing finances. The time needed to pay contractors is reduced from six months to
        two months by 2003.
        Procuring works. By 2003, the time needed to procure foreign-assisted works will be
        reduced from 300 days to 225.
        Training staff. By 2003, central office personnel and one staff person from each
        region and district should be able to prepare training programs.
        Introducing information technology. By 2003, a satisfactory system supported by IT
        help desks is operating smoothly.
        Improving communications. By mid-2003, data within and between central, regional
        and pilot districts is transmitted in five minutes (instead of five days).
        Institutionalizing environmental and social concerns. People affected by the project
        will be compensated according to land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation
        policy satisfactory to the Bank. Also, measures to improve the environment are
        routinely carried out by contractors working on road maintenance and upgrading.

        There were also a number of performance triggers before moving to phase two of the
        Program:

    1) A sustainable financing mechanism is designed and established, such as a road fund or
        equivalent, dedicated to preserving the NRS; it will be funded by road user charges
        and based on the actual level of maintenance needs and road use.



                                                  3

   2) Legislation satisfactory to the Bank will be submitted to Congress that would
       (a) introduce a fuel levy as an added source of revenue to maintain the national roads
       and introduce adjustment mechanisms which will ensure full cost recovery from road
       users within five years; (b) establish an independent body, including representatives of
       road users, that would have spending authority and accountability, to strengthen the
       administration of the maintenance funds; and (c) establish improved and/or new
       organizational structures, including an independent body such as a road maintenance
       authority, to commercialize the management of national roads and separate policy and
       planning functions in government from service delivery that would be largely
       privatized. These structures would be introduced according to a staged transition plan.
   3) A financial management system applied to DPWH key operations at the central,
       regional and district levels will be designed and operating.
   4) The DPWH EIA-PO will be converted into a permanent office for environmental and
       social services.
   5) 60 percent of the NRIMP-1 loan will be disbursed, according to the loan requirements.

       The key indicators for the overall program are as follows:

implementation were substantially different as the tables under "F. Results Framework
Analysis" show. In this respect a formal change in the PDO during implementation should
have been considered.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

Main beneficiaries of NRIMP will be the whole population: (i) road users will reduce the
time and money they spend on transport; (ii) better roads will increase access to social
services, reduce the cost of products and facilitate commercialization; (iii) efficiency gains
(pursued with DPWH) and the new road fund should remove pressure on the budget and
contribute to reducing general taxes; and (iv) better technology should increase DPWH staff
satisfaction and credibility. There were no revisions to this "primary target group" throughout
project implementation.

Other financing agencies (ADB, JBIC and JICA), who were kept informed on project
progress, are now adopting an approach to road maintenance financing that is similar to the
one proposed under NRIMP, relying on the business processes and integrity framework
established under the program.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

The project included the following components:

A.      Civil Works

    a) Road Upgrading: about 528 km of national roads would be rehabilitated or upgraded,
        using international competitive bidding (ICB) at a cost of US$120.0 million. A total
        of nine contracts were to be awarded;2
    b) Preventive Maintenance:        about 900 km of the NRS would receive preventive
        maintenance in the form of asphalt concrete overlays at a cost of US$112.3 million.
        Procurement would be made under local competitive bidding; and
    c) Long-Term Performance-Based Maintenance (LTPBM): Two contracts for 231 km
        would be let under ICB to test this form of maintenance in the Philippines. Costs were
        estimated at US$9.9 million. If successful, this would be replicated in phases two and
        three.

B.      Institutional Strengthening

    a) Business Improvement Implementation Projects (BIIPs): A total of 43 BIIPs were
        designed in order to improve DPWH business practices through a major business
        process re-engineering effort that would focus on customer needs, improved efficiency
        and effectiveness and the use of information technology. In the Program's first phase,
        16 BIIPs with the highest priority would be carried out. Costs were estimated at
        US$37 million for the first phase.
    b) Policy and Institutional Reforms: the key elements of this component for phase one of
        the program would be to: (i) create a road fund from user charges to maintain the
        national roads; (ii) create a Road Board, which would relate revenues to maintenance



2   See footnote 1.


                                               5

       needs and involve road users to oversee the NRS management and funding; and
       (iii) design and review an independent organization such as a road maintenance
       authority (RMA), taking into account DPWH's regional structure, decentralization,
       scope of networks and other infrastructure obligations and leaving DPWH with policy
       making functions only.
    c) Support to Commercialization: A Road Maintenance Authority, once created under
       phase two of the program would approach road rehabilitation and maintenance on a
       purely commercial basis, involving private local contractors and consultants ­ which
       NRIMP would assist to develop ­ to the greatest extent. Components Bb and Bc were
       estimated at US$1.5 million.

1.6    Revised Components

None of the above project components was revised during project implementation. The mid-
term review of July 2002 highlighted the delays in project implementation, but it did not
propose any change in project size or composition. However, by the time the Loan was
closed, there was some change in scope for the civil works and the institutional reform
components.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

Road Upgrading: While the PAD and the Loan Agreement show 528 km and 530 km
respectively to be upgraded under NRIMP-1, this component is programmatic and table A.01
of the PAD's Annex 6 shows that although the above length of road will be procured under
NRIMP-1, completion will be rolled over into NRIMP-2. According to this table, the money
available for road upgrading would finance about 330 km, including roll-over from the
previous HMP project and excluding Phase two. The remainder (about 200 km) would be
financed under NRIMP-2. The actual length of road upgrading completed at Loan closing
was greater, at about 382 km. Of the eight original road sections to be procured, six were
completed 100 percent (337 km), one (including three road sub-sections) was partially
completed (45 km out of 142 km) with two of the three road sub-sections for the remaining
97 km being considered to be rolled over into NRIMP-2. However during the lengthy
preparation of NRIMP-2 it was decided by the Government to use local financing for the
above two NRIMP-2 road sub-sections.            After the Bank had declared three successive
biddings for the remaining two sub-sections as being failures (suspicion of contractors
colluding to artificially inflate prices ), the Government decided to take the two subsections
out of NRIMP-2 and to consider using local financing for upgrading these two road
subsections.

Preventive Maintenance: The total length of roads to which preventive maintenance was
applied, was reduced from 900 km to 721 km. As the Bank would reimburse the Government
only, once a technical audit was completed for the preventive maintenance work done by the
contractor, DPWH decided during the 2002-2004 financial crisis to suspend the Preventive
Maintenance Program (PMP) once it had reached the full Peso value of the original project
design, despite Bank encouragement to use the allocated contingencies and the foreign
exchange savings. Later, when the crisis subsided, DPWH continued with a preventive



                                                 6

maintenance program, financed by its own resources, without claiming reimbursement,
demonstrating that the PMP program under the project had achieved the desired development
impact of putting in place a self-sustaining preventive maintenance approach.

LTPBM: A total of 254 km were maintained instead of the 231 km envisaged at appraisal.

Institutional Strengthening: Even though a Road Fund and a Road Board were created, little
disbursement was made against this component (US$57,000). Consultants, who were to look
into the feasibility of a Road Maintenance Authority, were financed by New Zealand Aid, but
the wide-ranging and substantial recommendations contained in their report for implementing
the reform agenda were not consistently followed up. A consultant, who was to strengthen
the local construction and consulting industry, was hired. The consultant has completed the
services and a final report was submitted to the Bank which includes a recommendation for a
Development Plan to strengthen the capabilities of the road consulting and contracting sectors
in the delivery of their services to improve the road network and to become more competitive
in the local and international markets.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strategic Relevance and Approach:                The project's objectives and its design are fully
consistent with the objectives of the 1999 CAS. The selection of an Adaptable Program Loan
for this operation was judicious. It afforded the Bank and the Government a long-term view
of the development needs of the national road system and the needed institutional reforms.
The program's first phase includes the right project components to eventually meet these
needs. While lessons from previous projects had been taken into account, some of the same
mishaps occurred:        slow procurement, slow disbursement and uneven progress on the
institutional side. The Government was fully involved in the preparation of this project and
adopted all of its objectives, but repeated changes in Government resulted in the loss of the
project's champions. Other than some sub-components of the Road Information Management
Support System (RIMSS) financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the program had
no co-financing, despite its size. The question arises as to why there was no more effort by
the Government and by the Bank to enlist other donors for the program/project. Such broader
collaboration with ADB and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) could have
helped to push the policy and institutional change agenda in a more systematic and structured
manner.3

Technical, Financial and Economic Aspects: The program's civil works components, (about
85 percent of total project cost), were conventional highway construction works, and did not
present major problems, even though some of the road upgrading is in difficult terrain.




3   It now appears that ADB, JBIC and JICA use NRIMP as a guide for their own financing of the highway
    sector, although without the benefits of a common approach to promote policy and institutional change.


                                                      7

The Business Improvements Implementation Projects (BIIPs) are state of the art computerized
systems and the capacity of DPWH to implement and later on to use these systems effectively
was not sufficiently assessed in the PAD. No alternative, simpler options were considered.

A conventional highway cost-benefit analysis was applied to the road upgrading and
maintenance components. For the BIIPs a combination of "break-even point" and benefit cost
ratio methods was used. These elements cover a total of 96 percent of project cost. The
project's conditions of effectiveness and other credit covenants were realistic and fitting for
achieving the project's objectives.

The project's financing plan was consistent with the Philippines economic outlook at the time
of appraisal.

Poverty, Gender and Social Development: While the project was not particularly focused on
poverty and gender issues, the land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation policies
proposed by the Government and applied under the project were exemplary and were later on
adopted by other donors.      In addition, Government has developed a policy for "Public
Participation and Consultation" to ensure those affected are consulted effectively.

Environmental Aspects: The project is contributing to institutionalizing concern for social
and environmental issues in the highway sector by strengthening the Environment and Social
unit within the DPWH and by promoting a closer relationship between the DPWH and the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources.             The two departments signed a
Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), which defines the roles, procedures and criteria to be
evaluated and the screening process to be applied for the highway sector. This MoA satisfies
the World Bank guidelines. In addition, all civil works contracts contained clauses that define
the environmental requirements to be met during road construction.

Fiduciary Aspects:    An operational financial management system for project operations
satisfactory to the Bank was a condition of loan effectiveness. The procurement arrangements
set out in the PAD were detailed and followed Bank guidelines. To strengthen DPWH's
procurement capacity the project included under the BIIPs several modules, which have had a
direct impact on the quality of procurement processing.

Policy and Institutional Aspects: The PAD contained a well formulated implementation plan
that clearly defined the role of each of the Bureaus and services within DPWH for project
implementation. Government's commitment to the project was unambiguously expressed in
the Letter of Development Program, signed by DPWH and by the Department of Finance. It
is not clear, however, if, at the time, this letter had the broad political support of the
Government.

Implementation Arrangements: In hindsight, the time frame (of less than four years) for
achieving both the implementation of civil works, and the institutional changes was very
optimistic, even though the first year's program was ready for implementation, with tender
documents available from the Highway Management Project (HMP). This HMP project,
which was similar in size and content took eight and a half years to implement and should



                                               8

have served as an example. The time frame may have been seen in the context of the whole
program, with some of the project components slipping over into the next phases, but the need
for three project extensions proves the point. Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation
were satisfactory and both, outcome and output indicators were well covered in the PAD,
together with their respective baseline.

Risk Assessment: Risks were clearly defined and risk ratings were candid. Some of the risks
identified as High or Substantial (Road Right of Way, Budget allocations, procurement) have
materialized. Mitigating measures were well designed and well meaning, although the reality
proved them to be not sufficiently effective to prevent the risks from occurring.

2.2     Implementation

Civil Works

Road Upgrading: Although detailed engineering for the project roads had been carried out
under the earlier Highway Management Project and some of the civil works were carried over
into NRIMP-1, project start-up was slow and by the time of the original Project closing date
(6/2004), only 50 percent of the loan was disbursed. The lack of progress in the project's road
upgrading component is mainly due to a slow procurement process and the mis-procurement
of several contracts for which the Bank asked the Government to repeat the bidding process.
Three contracts were re-bid three times and when the Bank was still not satisfied with the
bidding results, the Government decided to remove the three contracts from NRIMP, and to
repackage and consider financing the contracts from its own resources. This repackaging led
to an incomplete upgrading.      A rollover of contracts into NRIMP-2 would have been
opportune with the new Anti Corruption and Governance measures in place. In addition, two
sections of the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road are only 40 percent and five percent completed
respectively, and their financing was considered for NRIMP-2. However due to the lengthy
preparation process of NRIMP-2, the Government decided to use local financing instead. For
the total length of roads (532 km) to be constructed under the program (NRIMP-1/2), a
13 percent cost overrun is estimated (see Annex 2.c), mainly caused by the roads that are now
being financed by the Government. While NRIMP-1 provided finance for only about 330 km,
a total of 382 km were upgraded, and were mainly financed from foreign exchange savings
and the reduced output of preventive maintenance.

Preventive Maintenance: Implementation of the Preventive Maintenance Program was in line
with appraisal expectations, even though there were a number of difficulties, in particular with
respect to the payment of contractors. The Bank would reimburse the Government for
payments made, only after the works had undergone an independent technical audit. During
the 2002-2004 fiscal crises the Government had to stop the program, but resumed it later on,
financing it from its own resources. Costs for the achieved road length (721 km) are about
15 percent less than estimated, but the road length treated is also about 23 percent less than
estimated at appraisal (900 km).

LTPBM: After start-up problems (the prequalification documents had to be adjusted and the
contractor prequalification process had to be repeated) implementation was completed by
November 2005 with per km costs more than double the appraisal estimates.


                                                9

Cost of Civil Works: Both DPWH and the Bank have been criticized in particular by the
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) for the cost overruns incurred during
implementation of the project's civil works. Some of the criticism is justified, e.g. the number
and size of variation orders, mainly caused by the excessive delays in the bidding process,
during which the condition of the roads continued to deteriorate and therefore needed an
adjustment in the detailed engineering. Other variation orders were necessary to repair
damage done by inclement weather (typhoons Igme, Horurot on Halsema Highway) for which
DPWH cannot be held accountable. Foreign Currency Adjustments are likewise outside the
purview of DPWH. Also, the ABC (Approved Budget for Contract) does not include the cost
of consultancy services to supervise construction and should not be added to the civil works
contract to show cost overruns. Actually, as compared to the appraisal estimates, including
contingencies, the project shows no total cost overruns at loan closing, with the qualification,
however, that preventive maintenance was performed on 180 km less, counterbalanced by an
increase of about 52 km for road upgrading and 23 km for LTPBM. (see Annex 1, Project
Cost).

Institutional Strengthening

Business Improvement Implementation Projects (BIIPs):           The completion ratio for the
16 BIIPs included in NRIMP-1 is close to 80 percent. The more important business areas
such as Planning, Financial Management and Information Management are completed, are
operational and are being used. What is still needed is a full integration of the different
modules.      Also, the application of some of the other support systems has to be
institutionalized and put into operation before their impact can be realized. There is still quite
some work to be done under NRIMP-2 and NRIMP-3 to implement the applications in all
regional and a majority of district offices of DPWH, including the expansion of the
communications networks and computerization, to bring the Road Information and
Management Support Systems to full fruition. Total costs are about seven percent higher than
appraisal estimates.

Policy and Institutional Reform: Early on in the project (February 2001), the Road Fund was
enacted. An executive Director to the Road Board was appointed in December 2003, but in
October 2004 replaced by an appointee of the President. With the three private sector
representatives nominated by the Secretaries of Department of Transport and DPWH and
needing approval by the President, the Road Board is clearly not independent. The Road
Board is subject to political pressures, resulting for example in the use of the Road Fund to
finance employment generation programs, which were significantly more expensive than
competitive procurement of the required services by contract. Two major TAs which would
have improved performance of the Road Board and advanced the organizational reform were
delayed and finally not procured, due to World Bank concerns over distortion and possible
collusion in the bidding process, which were not resolved by DPWH.

The Road Fund's revenues from motor vehicle user charges were supposed to be in addition
to the regular budget resources allocated for road maintenance, however due to budgetary
constraints no regular budget funds were released.          Therefore, expenditures for road
maintenance over the last years were only about 40 percent of actual needs.



                                               10

Little progress has been made in the creation of a Road Management Authority (RMA),4
which, although fully designed was never introduced for legislation. Two reform areas that
were not undertaken in Phase 1 include the institution of a fuel levy and the introduction of
legislation to establish a RMA that would manage the road system on a corporate basis. Both
were considered politically inopportune, largely as an issue of timing. The development of
some fuel-based revenue (which is the most efficient and progressive form of cost recovery-
based road user change because it increases with increasing travel and use or `consumption'
of the network assets and energy resources) is again under consideration and will be
supported under NRIMP-2.              The RMA preparation was completed satisfactorily and
establishment of an RMA is included in the official Medium Term Philippine Development
Plan (MTPDP) ­ however broader concerns are emerging on the performance of government-
owned corporations and on the suitability of this model in the current governance
environment.

As an alternative to the RMA, DPWH prepared a Rationalization Plan together with a draft
executive order for "Rationalizing the Department of Public Works and Highways, and for
other Purposes." Once enacted, this could be considered as a first small step in the direction
of an independent RMA. Little use was made of the funds (US$1.5 million) allocated to this
category.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

At the time the Project Appraisal Document was written, results frameworks and M&E were
at an early stage of development in Bank projects. Nevertheless, the PAD in its Project
Design Summary (Annex 1) included a useful list of project objectives (program purpose) and
key performance indicators, providing output and outcome-oriented information for
management decision-making and program improvement purposes.                       The Project Status
Reports (PSRs) use some 32 outcome and output indicators to report progress against stated
targets, albeit in a rather mechanistic way. With the arrival of the ISR in 2005, the table of
agreed outcome indicators was simplified, using a total of 3 PDO indicators and five
intermediate outcome indicators and presented in a more meaningful format (see F. Results
Framework Analysis).          The table of key indicators (PAD-Table 1), which would have
measured progress for the overall program, was unfortunately not used during project
implementation and never mentioned again, probably because of difficulties in quantifying
the outcome.




4   During project implementation the name of the Road Maintenance Authority was changed to Road
    Management Authority. It should be mentioned that some progress was made in two consultancies ­ first on
    institutional and organizational options, and the second (funded in the end by NZAID) in detailing the
    preferred option and holding consultations to help finalize and implement it.




                                                       11

Quarterly progress reports prepared by DPWH were thorough, comprehensive and on time,
using project management techniques to track progress of various civil works and IT activities.
Each component included a statement of target outcome and output indicators (where
relevant) and a description of progress towards deliverables, implementation of management
improvement systems and recommendations for improving each component.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Bank's proactive approach in handling corruption issues in the procurement process is
commendable (scrutinizing carefully all contract awards, rejecting award of contract three
times on three bids where there was suspicion of contractor collusion, and preparing a note on
governance issues in the Philippines). The project's financial management aspects have a
somewhat uneven past with ratings going from satisfactory to unsatisfactory and back, mainly
due to staffing problems causing accounting errors and delayed submission of audit reports.
The final supervision report (ISR-15) gives financial management a moderately satisfactory
rating. However, during the NRIMP-2 processing, the Financial management systems in the
Department are still being rated as High risk. Therefore NRIMP-1 did not address fully the
FM weaknesses in the Department. With respect to legal aspects, the Government has adhered
well to the project conditionality, with the exception of the maintenance budget, which by this
time was supposed to cover at least 60 percent of routine, periodic and preventive
maintenance. For 2006 only about 40 percent were covered. For 2007 the Government has
added PhP4 billion from the regular budget to the PhP7 billion available in the Road Fund,
bringing the total maintenance budget to about 60 percent of maintenance needs.             The
Environment and Social Unit within DPWH is working well and has received a satisfactory
rating throughout project implementation.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The second phase of the National Road Improvement and Management Program builds
further on the achievements and mitigates the shortcomings of its first phase. NRIMP-2
continues to finance road upgrading, preventive maintenance and long-term performance
based maintenance, and gives sustained attention to institutional and capacity development.
While civil works, with a total cost of US$519 million, make the bulk of the project, the
US$54 million the project proposes to spend on institutional and capacity development will be
particularly useful to consolidate the achievements of the BIIPs.           It will do so by
institutionalizing and implementing in regional and district offices the planning tools and
financial management applications designed and piloted under NRIMP-1. Phase 2 will also
help in upgrading and modernizing the corporate structure of DPWH through (i) the
restructuring of corporate processes; (ii) the development of multi-stakeholder partnerships of
road users and non-governmental organizations for oversight of the road sector; (iii) a pilot
trial of options for commercializing the current operations of district engineering offices; and
(iv) the support to strengthen the fiduciary integrity of project implementation. Finally,
further efforts will be made to strengthen the Road Board, updating its mandate, to review
road cost recovery and to revisit options for restructuring the management and delivery of

A positive outcome of NRIMP-1 implementation; and the preparation of NRIMP-2 is the
cooperation of the NGO Bantay Lansangan (BL ­ Road Watch) and DPWH, who are now
working together to produce a Philippine Road Sector (PRS) Report Card. The structure,
format, and specific indicators to be used for the Road Sector Report Card will be developed
jointly by BL and DPWH. They will also closely monitor and evaluate the process and
outputs of the consultancy in producing the Report Card thereby shedding light on gaps and
inconsistencies in the Department's data, where needed. This could be an important step
towards making DPWH a transparent, user responsive, and efficient public sector agency.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The main objective of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program is "to
ensure the preservation of an improved national roads system in an environmentally, socially
and financially sustainable manner." This objective is still highly relevant to the current
country and Bank assistance strategy. With a four to six percent annual traffic growth,
congestion of major arteries, widespread poor condition of roads and bridges, and the lack of
a sustainable road safety strategy, the need for an improved national road system remains
unabated.     Inadequate infrastructure, especially roads, is perceived as one of the major
constraints to investment and subsequently to economic growth, as indicated in the Bank's
2005 infrastructure policy study for the Philippines. As an archipelago, transport is critical to
the national economy of the Philippines. The country's transport system is based on roads
and inter-island shipping ­ the two modes account for almost all freight and passenger traffic.

Giving DPWH the tools (BIIPs) to become a more cost effective and efficient agency in
fulfilling its mandate also continues to be of the utmost importance.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project provided the framework for the "preservation of an improved national road
system" through road upgrading, preventive maintenance and long-term performance based
maintenance. While this was done in an "environmentally and socially sustainable manner,"
the financial sustainability was off the target at the end of the project as, with the exception of
2007 when additional budget resources were made available, maintenance funds covered only
40 percent of maintenance needs. If one goes back to the PAD's original key performance
indicators, the following picture arises:

 Management Effectiveness
   Performance standards for key NRS management systems (the                    40%                30%
   Business Improvement Implementation Projects, BIIPs) will be
   achieved at least by:

   Finances needed to maintain the NRS will be obtained through a               60%                40%
   sustainable mechanism, such as a road fund, raised through user
   charges, by at least:
 Physical Conditions
   NRS average road roughness (the International Roughness Index                 3%                 2%
   will be used as a measure of client satisfaction) is reduced by:
 Environmental and Social Conditions
   These issues will be integrated in all phases (preparation,
   implementation and operations) of road upgrading and maintenance             50%                40%

   functions will be:

Management effectiveness: This indicator does not address the institutional reforms but only
the Business Improvement Implementation Projects. Cost and time overruns were systemic in
NRIMP-1 and have to reduced through improved procurement and contract management.
Also within the NRIMP-1 implementation serious weaknesses in procurement and financial
management/internal control were identified. Addressing these weaknesses will be the core of
the reform program under NRIMP-2.

Financial Sustainability: With the budget situation having improved over the last year, there
is a reasonably good chance that this target will be met in 2008. However decisions over the
utilization of funds are still being questioned due to the lack of independence of the Road
Board. Satisfactory utilization of funds is critical to establishing confidence in Road Fund
Mechanism and Sector Reform, which was not achieved in NRIMP-1.

Physical Conditions: While there has been some improvement of the physical condition of
the national road network, other road sections may have deteriorated because of the lack of
maintenance caused by the budget shortfall.

Environmental and Social Conditions: Not enough training has taken place to increase the
capacity of regional EIA staff to deal with environmental and social issues in all phases of
road upgrading and maintenance. By now the Environmental and Social Service Office
(ESSO) has 19 staff at headquarters and 16 regional staff, and it is expected that once the
rationalization plan of DPWH gives this office the appropriate importance and status, it will
be possible for ESSO (or Environmental, Social and Right-of-Way Office [ESRO], as it will
be called after the DPWH rationalization) to meet this target and those of the following phases.




5   These are by no means precise figures, but give a rather subjective judgment on present achievements.

3.3     Efficiency

The combined and weighted economic rate of return for civil works completed under
NRIMP-1 is in the order of 47 percent. If all project roads, completed, under construction or
not even started are taken into account, with estimates for the final cost, the ERR is closer to
40 percent.

The following table shows the breakdown for the different project components, using post
construction evaluations made by DPWH and NEDA and comparing them to the appraisal
estimates:

                                                                       Weighted ERR (%)
Component                                                Appraisal            DPWH          NEDA
                                             Year           2000               2005          2006
Road Upgrading As appraised (532 km)                         23.2              25.8          23.4
                       Actual (392 km)                       25.3              27.8          26.5
Preventive Maintenance                                       >126               >80
LTPBM                                                        >12                >15

All three evaluations for the road upgrading were based on conventional cost-benefit analysis
that quantifies benefits mainly from savings in vehicle operating and road maintenance cost.
The results are very close to the appraisal estimate. Any increase in construction costs was
more than compensated for by higher than estimated traffic growth. Variations in the rate of
return among the different evaluations mainly stem from a difference in final cost estimates.
For the preventive maintenance the evaluation was established through a simplified way of
calculating the rate of return for a specified surface treatment using the number of vehicles per
day (2006 traffic counts) as the main parameter. The rate of return for the LTPBM was also
based on a conventional cost benefit analysis. A more detailed breakdown for the road
upgrading is given in Annex 3.

For the Business Improvement Implementation Project it is too early to carry out an economic
evaluation, using a combination of break-even points and benefit-cost ratio as proposed in the
PAD, because many of the modules are not yet fully operational and used according to their
purpose. This is in itself a major shortcoming, however, the fact that the actual cost came in
close to the appraisal estimates makes the assumptions made at appraisal still valid, provided
the BIIPs are being fully used within DPWH.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Despite a three-year extension of the loan closing date, the project did not fully achieve all
project development objectives. However, it exceeded two of the three physical targets it had



6   For preventive maintenance and the LTPBM, the Project Appraisal Document only sets the minimum
    threshold traffic for which an economic rate of return of >12 percent can be achieved.

set itself for the end of NRIMP-1. Successfully completed project elements yielded a high
rate of return, but the lack of progress made on the policy and institutional front and the slow
pace of implementation of physical works lead to the moderately satisfactory rating. The
project's main merit is that it laid a solid foundation for the remaining NRIM Program to
further improve the Philippines' national road network, its sector policy and its sector
institutions. However the major shortcoming and lessons of phase 1 need to be addressed
effectively and need to combined with a strong commitment from the Government: (i) Cost
and time overruns need to be reduced through improved procurement and contract
management, (ii) Confidence in Road Fund Mechanism and Sector reform needs to be built
through demonstrated satisfactory utilization of funds and corresponding reforms at the
organizational level in order to be sustainable, (iii) Modernization of technical and business
processes requires corresponding reforms at the organizational level in order to be sustainable
(iv). Restructuring at the sector level requires broad-based, strong client ownership, and
(v) Corruption is heavily influenced by both internal and external environments, and thus
remedial measures need to be comprehensive and targets must be realistic.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project was not designed explicitly to cover poverty impact, gender aspects or social
development. However, because of its wide target population, the project's outcome will
benefit the poor by reducing time and money they spend on transport, by lowering the cost of
products and by providing better access to social services.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project's RIMSS and the various business processes have many elements that will have a
significant impact on the longer-term capacity of DPWH. Some of the areas of improvement
are:

    · Procurement;
    · Financial Management;
    · Communications and Staff Quality;
    · Standardization of Contract Documents;
    · Efficiency of Maintenance Operations;
    · Planning Procedures;
    · Pavement and Bridge Management; and
    · Improved Quality and Extended Pavement Life.

The RIMSS and the various business processes are a complex undertaking and DPWH has
been overwhelmed by the different modules and new systems, leading the Secretary of
DPWH to comment that "we are literally biting more than we can chew." It will be a steep
learning process for DPWH staff, but once mastered, the benefits and impact will be
substantial. This is clearly demonstrated by the modules for Financial Management and
Planning, which are already being fully used. The continued attention to the BIIP under


                                              16

NRIMP-2 will help to consolidate and institutionalize the achievements made so far. However,
the modernization of technical and business processes will require corresponding reforms at
the organizational level (e.g., rationalization of DPWH) in order to be sustainable. The
sustainability of the introduced business systems and applications is at this point still
questionable .

The proposed rationalization of DPWH ­ if carried through ­ could have a positive impact on
institutional development, in particular, if it is seen as a first step towards an autonomous
Road Management Authority.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not applicable.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There was no stakeholder workshop or beneficiary survey, but an interview with the
Presidents of the Trucker and Jeepneys Associations revealed, that they and most of their
members did not think that the national road network has much improved over the last seven
years, which is not surprising as it would be rather difficult to feel a two or three percent
reduction in road roughness. They appreciate the efforts made under the project, but felt that
in the meantime other roads had deteriorated because of lack of maintenance, caused by the
lack of funds available.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
        Rating: High

The risk to development outcome for the first phase of this program can be rated as High.

First, the government's chronic under-spending for road maintenance has the potential to
undercut the gains made through the upgrading of the national road network. In particular
roads, such as the Halsema Highway, which are in difficult and unstable terrain, might rapidly
deteriorate if they do not receive continual attention. The lack of preventive maintenance
would also lead to an increase in road roughness in the network. However the budgets for FY
07 and 08 include substantial increases in allocations in Road Maintenance. It is becoming
clear that the Government has become aware of the importance of maintaining the roads on a
continuous basis.

Second, the systems and programs installed for the BIIPs might become obsolete if staff
training and system maintenance are scaled back and full institutionalization does not
materialize.

The continuous dialogue between the Bank and Government through this Adaptable Program
Loan on all matters pertaining to road maintenance and road maintenance financing and the
uninterrupted involvement of Bank and Government in the BIIPs could mitigate the above




                                               17

risks and reduce them from a High to a Substantial level, which would be consistent with the
risk assessment made for NRIMP-2.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As described under 2.1, the Bank did a fair job in designing the program. However it can be
said that the Bank should have been more aware during the design phase that the program was
overoptimistic with respect to the scope of achievable policy and institutional changes and the
timeframe to implement them. However, at the time of appraisal the conditions seemed to be
right to bring about rapid change.       The Government's Letter of Development Program
confirmed the goals of the project and an enthusiastic project champion appeared to guarantee
a rapid project implementation.       When the champion moved on, the pace of project
implementation slowed down to the speed of its predecessor, the Highway Management
Project, which took eight years to completion.

The choice of an Adaptable Program Loan for this operation was judicious, giving the Bank
and the Government the possibility to adapt project execution to changing conditions, while
retaining their engagement and the longer term goals of the program.

(b)     Quality of Supervision
        Rating: Satisfactory

A full Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA) was carried out by QAG in October of 2002
(QSA5), shortly after the project's mid-term review. It concluded that the Bank's supervision
activities were overall satisfactory (2). If an assessment were carried out today it would come
to a similar conclusion except for the lack of progress in policy and institutional development.

The October 2002 QSA had already pointed out that: "If there continues to be slow progress
in the reform of road management and if problems in the operation as envisaged of the Road
Fund continue, it will be necessary to eventually convey a strong message that the Bank's
ability to continue to provide support to the sector is being placed in jeopardy." In the
meantime progress in the reform of road management continued to be slow and problems in
the operation of the Road Fund to persist. Government's diminished commitment to policy
reform at the political level has caused the Bank to design a more incremental approach in
NRIMP-2, keeping the creation of an independent Road Management Authority and the
introduction of a fuel levy as a long-term objective. The question arises, whether the Bank
could have exerted more pressure at high government levels during the early stages of the
project, when there was still some receptivity for policy and institutional change. The
supervision process can be questioned for not responding adequately to the emerging situation.
A more pro-active supervision could have made a difference and could have drawn high level
attention to this major shortcoming.



                                                18

Staff continuity, skill mix and involvement of the country office were exemplary. The main
team members have been with the project since its inception, the supervision staff covered all
project aspects (perhaps with the exception of transport economics) and three part-time
resident staff supported project supervision. There was thorough supervision of the project
with sensible intervals between the missions, with clear Aide memoirs and management
letters, which highlight the key issues and actions to be taken.

The supervision team deserves to be commended for the attention paid to procurement matters.
In 2003, the Bank's supervision identified signs of bid-rigging in the procurement of two road
contracts and rejected award of the contracts. Two further rounds of bidding in 2004 and 2006
revealed similar signs, and were also rejected and referred to the Department of Institutional
Integrity (INT) in 2003. INT concluded an investigation in 2007 and found that a cartel of
contractors had engaged in corrupt and collusive practices in all three rounds of bidding,
undermining competition in road construction and inflating prices by up to 30 percent. These
findings were disclosed to the Government in November 2007. The INT findings were crucial
in designing mitigating measures for Phase 2.

The relationship with the Borrower was excellent on the working level, but could have been
better with the leadership of DPWH, the Road Board7 and the political level of Government.
The 2002 QSA had already recommended that key issues should be elevated to the level of
the Country Director. In addition, the supervision reports should have been shared with
higher levels in Governments and having not done so effectively proved to be a missed
opportunity.      The Bank budget for this complex project was on the low side (on average
about US$80,000), but the supervision team used the available resources well and was able to
stay within budget most of the years.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The moderately satisfactory rating is mainly based on the premise that the Bank was too
optimistic in setting the time-frame for the implementation of civil works and policy and
institutional changes. Furthermore, it did not follow through on the proposed trigger targets
for NRIMP-1, which was confirmed by the Government in its Letter of Development Program,
and it did not exert sufficient pressure to bring about policy and institutional changes. It is
somewhat reassuring that both, the Government and the Bank still have the creation of the
Road Management Authority and the introduction of a fuel levy on the policy agenda, albeit
as a long-term objective.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a)      Government Performance
         Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory




7   Lately, the relationship with DPWH leadership and the Road Board has significantly improved.


                                                    19

The Government did not adhere to the proposals it had set out in its Letter of Development
Program in particular with respect to the policy and institutional aspects. On the budgetary
front, the Government did not consistently release the necessary funds to DPWH, delaying
payments to contractors for up to 12 months. (It has to be acknowledged though, that the
Government went through a fiscal crisis during project implementation, making it difficult to
provide the necessary counterpart funds). The politically motivated personnel changes that
occurred at the top level of DPWH were detrimental to project implementation, as was
political interference at the central and provincial level which delayed procurement decisions
and project execution.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The targets for civil works proposed for NRIMP-1 were partly achieved, in particular with
respect to timeliness. Reasons for partial achievement were the excessive delays between the
start of the procurement process (procurement notice) and the award of contract, often taking
more than two years. These delays in turn caused project cost overruns, as the condition of
the project roads had further deteriorated and the detailed engineering was no longer up to
date and valid. For consultancies, excessive delays were caused by the introduction of a pre-
clearance process, which doubled the time for approvals. Also, the two TAs crucial to the
support of the Policy and Institutional reform were never selected (the Bank rejected the
evaluations due to evidence of collusion and distortion which were not resolved),
compounding the drop in dialog and progress on the crucial reform objectives.

Financial management had to be rated unsatisfactory for some time during project
implementation, mainly due to weak internal controls that affected accountability, weak
support for the proper performance of the Internal Audit function, and the delayed submission
of financial statements for audit which resulted in delayed audit reports. In addition to slow
processing of payments to contractors, there was slow submission of reimbursement requests
to the Bank. The rating for financial management returned to moderately satisfactory at the
end of the project, once DPWH had improved its performance. Although the audit report of
2006 has indicated that the Financial Management systems and Internal Audit function of
DPWH remain weak and vulnerable, in phase 2 of NRIMP the leadership of DPWH is
committed to correct the deficiencies and address the weaknesses in Financial Management
and the Internal Audit function in the next phase of NRIMP; which has led to the Moderately
Satisfactory rating.

The handling of the project's social and environmental aspects has been satisfactory
throughout project implementation.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

More weight was given to the Government performance, resulting in the Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating. The failure of the Government to adhere to the proposals in its Letter of




                                               20

Development Program, in particular with respect to the policy and institutional reforms, is a
significant shortcoming and leads to the less favorable overall rating.

6.     Lessons Learned

  i.   Cost and time overruns need to be reduced through improved procurement and
       contract management: In the project's civil works components there were significant
       internal delays in the procurement process and completion which resulted in frequent
       quantity, time and cost increases. The pre-qualification process for major civil works
       should be tightened to prevent substandard contractors from being selected. While
       contract administration has improved lately, the application of penalties remains
       uneven. Payment processing improved but untimely release of funds resulted in
       payment delays to some contractors, and poor cash flow contributed to delays in
       execution of works. A lengthy approval process for variation orders and supplemental
       agreements, which was intended to tighten control over cost increases, contributed to
       the delays. The more checks and balances that are introduced, the greater the chance
       for irregularities and diffusion of accountability.
  ii.  The Public's Acceptance of Road User Charges and confidence in the Road Fund must
       be earned by the satisfactory utilization of Funds applied in a consistent and
       transparent manner:       Political influence and entitlement in the allocation and
       utilization of funds is detrimental to the public's perception of the Fund's usefulness.
       Utilization must adhere to the core principles and thus costly employment generation
       programs have no place in Road Fund financing. Distribution of funds for road
       maintenance should be on strictly technical criteria, to be worked out between DPWH
       and the Road Board with appropriate review and oversight.
 iii.  Modernization of technical and business processes requires corresponding reforms at
       the organizational level in order to be sustainable:         While the development of
       improved planning, financial management and other processes was successful under
       the project, the new tools are not yet fully understood and utilized across the agency.
       The substantial operation and maintenance costs of information technology are also
       emerging. The Department has undertaken several strategic reassessment exercises
       across the agency to identify the areas of disconnect between the new business
       processes and the existing corporate culture. The findings point to the need for a
       corporate audit, to reexamine the core functions, the organization, capacity and
       staffing, given the new business systems and processes in place.
 iv.   Policy change and restructuring at the sector level requires broad-based, strong client
       ownership at all levels of Government: Despite the early support of top management,
       who set the original reform agenda, the subsequent leadership lacked effective
       champions of reform and the original targets of the proposed policy and institutional
       changes were put on hold. These targets (fuel levy and Road Management Authority)
       are still valid, and both the Bank and the Government should continue to aim at their
       attainment.
  v.   Governance issues and corruption are heavily influenced by both internal and external
       environments, so remedial measures need to be comprehensive and targets realistic:
       Corruption is a major issue in the sector, ranking as one of the worst in the country.
       Experience under the project shows that, while many improvements had been made in



                                               21

      procurement processes internally and through project controls, vulnerabilities
      remained in the evaluation and approval processes.           External pressures limited
      competition in the industry and resulted in prevalent over-pricing. Resistance to
      reforms and weak decision-making were often found to be linked with external and
      political influences. Financial audit findings pointed to numerous internal control
      weaknesses.     Design of a successor Project has to face this wide range of
      vulnerabilities and strike a workable balance between seeking sustainable systemic
      change and a narrower ring-fencing of the project.
vi.   Project design needs to minimize opportunities/incentives for collusion/corruption: It
      may be useful to institute ad hoc technical audits by internationally accredited
      consultants, who would verify quantities, sub-base and base compaction ratios and
      their thickness, as well as the thickness and quality of pavements for selected projects.

B.1 Improve Planning Capacity
  B.1.1 Establish Network Planning                    Program established, covering about 70% of investments.
  and Multi-Year Programming                          Although the contract (C01) is completed, DPWH is still
  (MYPS)                                    90        working to fully institutionalize the MYPS for Multi-Year
                                                      Programming and Scheduling. In the meantime DPWH is
                                                      using the Pavement Management System (PMS/HDM4) for
                                                      planning purposes.
  B.1.2 Establish System to collect                   The Road and Bridge Information System (Contract C02a for
  Road and Bridge Information                         RBIA and C02b/c for specialized data collection) have been
                                                      implemented and the regular data collection is still being
                                                      institutionalized in the DPWH. The system still has to be

                                            90        optimized and "fully institutionalized for updates" and part of
                                                      this (software performance improvements) is contingent upon
                                                      the DPWH finalizing the software maintenance agreement
                                                      with the software supplier. Specialized surveys and
                                                      operational expenses for in-house data collection for road and
                                                      bridges are included in NRIMP-2.
  B.1.3 Improve Traffic information                   The Traffic Information and Analysis System was
  Collection and Analysis System                      implemented (Contract C01) and traffic counting devices

                                            90        were purchased and installed (Contract C02c/d).
                                                      Institutionalization of the traffic counts and application are
                                                      on-going. Assistance with funds for data collection is planned
                                                      for NRIMP-2.
B.2 Improve Building Process
   B.2.1 Develop Project and                          Cancelled. Originally part of the C03 project with AASHTO
   Contract Management System                0        but subsequently deleted from scope during a contract
                                                      amendment related to an extension of time.
   B.2.2 Strengthen Environmental                     To further reduce RAP implementation and compensation
   and Social Management                              approval from 24 months to 12 months. System piloted in
   Capacity and Improve Land                          Region III and the NCR. Furthermore, a Social and
   Acquisition Process                                Environmental Management System (SEMS) manual was

                                           100        prepared, as well as the Land Acquisition and Resettlement
                                                      Action Plan (LAPRAP) procedures manual. All Regions
                                                      were trained. A new Infrastructure Right of Way (IROW)
                                                      procedures manual was also prepared. (Part of Contact C05).
                                                      A computerized application for IROW was developed (part of
                                                      C04 contract and MIS).




11 While in many cases the software and the systems have been installed and are functional, this does not mean
   that the modules are fully operational and used by DPWH staff. For many modules additional training and
   institutionalization is needed during the implementation of the remainder of the program (NRIMP-2 and
   NRIMP-3).

B.3 Improve Financial Management
    B.3.1 Develop and Establish            e-NGAS developed by Commission on Audit (COA) with
    Financial Management System            DPWH taking the lead. So far implemented in Central Office
                                           and Regional Offices. All modules are not yet developed and
                                      90   should be implemented as COA completes them, e.g. Project
                                           Monitoring Module. Implementation of e-Budget has also
                                           started in the Central Office. Anticipated to be continued in
                                           NRIMP-2.
    B.3.2 Streamline Contractor and        Needs institutionalization

B.5 Improve Information Management
    B.5.1 Establish Automated              CO, all ROs & 53 of about 170 District Engineering Offices
    Information System                80   are connected through a wide area network intranet.
    B.5.2 Provide Information              Most core business processes are supported, but there are still
    Technology Equipment              80   some gaps, as for example, construction and design and
                                           internal audit were not covered.
    B.5.3 Establish Information            The IT department has about 135 staff. However about 70
    Technology Support System         80   percent of staff is not up to the job, because of new
                                           technology. Department needs full complement of competent
                                           staff.
B.6 Improve Procurement Management
    B.6.1 Streamline Contract              Needs further work under NRIMP-2. An update to the
    Preparation and Complete               contract preparation system prepared under HMP was
    Standardization of Procurement         included in Contract C03 AASHTO. The Department,
    Documents                              through GPPB, has a Department Specific Procurement
                                      70   Manual for Civil Works, which has been harmonized between
                                           WB, ADB, and JICA. Originally, this was to include Civil
                                           Works, Supplies/Materials, and Consultants. However, there
                                           was a failed bid before negotiating a sole source with
                                           AASHTO, which only included Civil Works.
    B.6.2 Enhance Bidding and              Contract awards for ICB and Consultancies still take 16
    Award Process                          months on average. For NCB 8 months. EO Program target

                                      80   would be 10 months for ICB, 6 months for consultancies, and
                                           4 months for NCB. Same as B.6.1. This was to cover
                                           everything, but then there was a failed bid and C03 scope only
                                           included Civil Works.

All three economic evaluations (Appraisal, DPWH and NEDA) for the road upgrading used the
computer program developed by DPWH (ECOVAL), taking into account: (i) estimated or actual
final completion cost; (ii) latest traffic data; (iii) latest vehicle operating cost; (iv) travel time
savings and (v) maintenance savings. Variations in the rate of return between the different
evaluations mainly stem from a difference in final cost estimates.

The economic evaluation for the preventive maintenance program used two steps to calculate the
rate of return:

   1. Evaluation sheets established the proposed thickness of the overlay by using a simplified
        roughness calculation and visual inspection of the road section proposed for maintenance.
        Where the existing road had an Asphalt Concrete surface, sample deflection surveys were
        made; and
   2. Thereafter, the Internal Rate of Return for a specified surface treatment (cost) for a road
        or road section was calculated on the basis of tables, using the number of vehicles per day
        as the parameter (vehicle operating cost savings).

These calculations are contained in:       DPWH-BOM, Preventive Maintenance Projects, and
Economic Evaluation/Justification CY 2000-2003 Programs.

For the Long-Term Performance Based Maintenance a conventional Benefit/Cost analysis was
carried out using the benefits from vehicle operating cost savings over a six-year period at a
discount rate of 15 percent. Details of the calculation are contained in an Excel Spreadsheet:

2007.

Over-all Project Assessment provided by the Secretary of DPWH

In the Road Upgrading component of NRIMP, Phase 1, 90 percent of the planned 528 km of
national roads has been upgraded rehabilitated. The cancellation of the three (3) contract
packages from the program and the segments, previously done by Regional and District Offices
and considered as exemptions, contributed to the significant slow down in the accomplishment of
NRIMP-1. Nonetheless, the cancelled projects are being implemented using local funds in the
Department's thrust to improve the road network and increase its performance.

The Government through the Department of Public Works and Highways set forth the much
needed efforts to deliver the goals and objectives of NRIMP-1. Apparently, program targets
could only be attained substantially, given the constraints that had to contend with social,
environmental, financial and political issues and concerns during the regular and extended period
of the NRIMP-1.

Socially, numerous issues with the project affected persons identified during the detailed
engineering and during the implementation period, impede the progress of the construction
works.

Environmentally, the multifaceted nature of some of the project locations considering the
topographical, geological and geotechnical features slowed down the timely completion of the
projects and seriously affected the financial condition of the Government, which at one time or
another had met funding/budgetary difficulties.

Financially, numerous projects incurred cost overruns, from the original cost submitted to the
National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) up to the project completion. Also, there
were interest claims, price escalations and foreign currency adjustments filed with the
Department.

Politically, the untimely completion of the road projects and the unavoidable supplemental
project costs as consequences from typhoon damages, unfavorable weather conditions, design
modifications and as staked quantities and allegations of misdemeanor of contractors drew
attention of politicians to carry out investigation.

In general, the tremendous cost that resulted from delay in project completion is attributable to
the administrations' lack of strength in managing the program, as evidenced by feebleness in
dealing with social, environmental, financial and political issues. Nevertheless, the Government
and the Department were able to realize and learn lessons, and eventually delivered the
requirements of the first phase of the program to proceed to the second phase of the NRIMP.

It could be noted that the DPWH has made significant progress and contribution in the
implementation of the infrastructure development of the Government with around 382 km of
existing unpaved and deteriorated road sections rehabilitated and improved, while around
721 km of existing paved roads have been maintained in good condition. Policy and institutional
reforms have been initiated and likewise, the Department made a great progress with most of the


                                                  36

required business improvement, implementation technologies have been acquired and support
equipment and hardware have been installed and some systems are now fully operational.

The implementation of the Program had incurred cost overruns. This means that some items
have been overlooked during project design, preparation and implementation, which would
suggest some inefficiency in cost projection and utilization.

In terms of the project's extent of compliance with the Project Appraisal Document, the level of
achievement of the expected physical outcome could be assessed as having been satisfactorily
met as evidenced by the program base indicators. This gained the acceptance of the World Bank
for the program to proceed to the next level, though compliance with the PAD was attained only
because NRlMP Phase I implementation was extended by more than two (2) years, giving
enough time and opportunity for the DPWH to catch up on its accomplishment and deliver the
requirements of the program.

The Government is continuously pursuing reforms that would improve its management and
governance, however, this effort is rather constrained by political issues, funding limitations and
misappropriations, traditional bureaucratic practices and protocols. The aggressive participation
of cause oriented groups such as "The Civil Society" and other non-government organizations
with similar aspiration have been noted and would greatly help in sustaining the initial reforms
that have been established. The Department has initiated the implementation of social impact
assessment but would further require technical assistance to strengthen capacity of the concerned
staff. It was observed that more training would be needed, since not all of the Department's staff
has formal educational background on the matter.

The overall impact would include changes in the transportation environment along the project
areas with good paved roads. Travel time has been greatly reduced while traffic convenience
and safety have been enhanced. Economically, the huge investment provided by the government
for the implementation of the program has benefited the construction and consulting industry as
well as the information and telecommunication industries in the country and has sustained the
livelihood and revenue generating capacity of the workers both in the public and private sectors
during the more than five (5) years of the program's first phase implementation. Adverse social
impacts have been mitigated through proper compensation of project affected families and/or
persons. Traffic hazards to both motorists and pedestrians were minimized with the installation
of adequate traffic safety devices.

The impact on real estate or "real estate play" could not be appreciated in the early stages of the
project completion since the process is initiated in the local administrative level or unless the real
estate market would dictate otherwise. Furthermore, since some sections of the road projects
traverse mountainous areas, which lands could not be developed commercially and land value
would hardly appreciate, the impact would be insignificant.

The benefits could be sustained through proper monitoring and maintenance of the physical
conditions within the project road right of way. In some road projects, it was observed that
illegal dwellers have occupied the road right of way after the completion of the road project.
