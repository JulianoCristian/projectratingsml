NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaguit-Claver Road
Resettlement Action Plan: Bacuag-Qigaquit-Claver Road
Executive Summary
1.    Development interventions such as physical infrastructures undoubtedly result
into significant positive impacts to the community and the residents both in
terms of economic and social activities. However, it is equally true that any
development intervention results in some negative externalities. In the case of
road infrastructure projects, the obvious negative consequence would be in terms
of the social costs associated with environmental damage and human dislocation.
The department has promulgated the social policy framework and specific
guidelines for the implementation of projects under NRIMP. The framework and
specific guidelines are operationalized in the Policy Framework for Land
Acquisition Resettlement and Rehabilitation (LARR) in general, and in the
principles outlined for the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), in particular. The
said framework is anchored on the philosophy that the adverse impact of NRIMP
should be avoided, minimized  and/or mitigated to ensure that the Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) will not be worse off, if not, benefit from the project.
Implicit in the framework are elements of just disturbance compensation based on
fair market value and replacement cost, participatory process through local
consultations, and internal/external monitoring to ensure proper and effective
implementation of the projects. In order to operationalize the policies and
principles outlines earlier, it is necessary to conduct rigorous and systematic
assessment  of the project areas based on acceptable standards in research
methods and analysis.
2.    In general, the objective of the RAP is to assess the extent of disturbance that
NRIMP project will cause to local settlers and to provide the structure for RAP
including the logistical requirements for implementation. Specifically, the
objectives of RAP include: to set up a process to allow for public consultations
with PAPs on the NRIMP projects; to determine the number and geographically
locate the PAPs and assess the extent of disturbance; to estimate, based on
current market value and replacement cost, the disturbance compensation; to
provide the operational mechanisms for timely -RAP implementation including
total budgetary allocations; and to formulate the terms of reference for internal
and external monitoring of RAP implementation.
RAP preparation and implementation was designed as a collaborative effort
among three key institutions, DPWH, the LGUs, and the consulting firm. To
ensure  smooth implementation   and effective coordination among these
institutions, a series of orientation and public consultations were organized.
The basic inputs for RAP preparation include primary and secondary data.
Secondary data about the overall social and economic situation obtaining in the
communities along the  project sites  were generated through municipal



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaguit-Claver Road                                    ii
documents. Further, secondary data were also generated pertaining to assessed
values of  land improvement including structures and productive crops.
Secondary data pertaining to the technical description of the project design were
used  in the linear acquisition and mapping.  The determination of  the
compensation matrix  for each of the affected households and the total
compensation package was fairly straight forward. Valuation of structures
affected by the Project were based on the concept of Replacement Cost. Values
were determined based on the estimated quantity of materials needed to put up a
structure similar to the one that will be demolished due to the Project and
monetized using the current prices of materials as per records of the District
Engineer's Office. Similarly, valuation of agricultural and other biological land
improvements were based on the assessed value provided for by the District
Engineer's Office. In special cases where additional entitlements were required,
valuation schemes based on the principles outlined in the LARR Policy were
adopted. The mechanical routine of generating summary of actual values were
accomplished by simple algorithmic instructions for the computers using standard
application software.  The cost component of RAP implementation was
determined by employing simple budget planning.
4.    To ensure that the implementation of RAP will be done smoothly, it was
embodied in the policy framework of NRIMP to undergo a series of public
consultation. The public consultation was done at two levels. i.e. at the
municipal level and at the barangay level.
5.    The Bacuag-Claver Provincial Boundary Road segment under NRIMP I is part of
the long- term development of the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road. However, for
Phase I of NRIMP, the Surigao Norte Contract Package is only one of the three
which includes Marihatag-Barobo-San Francisco Road in Surigao del Sur and
Mati-Manay in Davao Oriental.
The Bacuag-Claver Provincial Boundary road improvement section comprises of
two sections which apparently stretches across the three municipalities for a total
road length of about 44.5 kilometers.
The other segment which starts from the town of Claver up to the provincial
boundary is generally a gravel road. Only about 2.7 kilometers of road is paved
with concrete and the remaining stretch of roughly 26 kilometers is paved with
gravel characterized as either in very bad or bad condition.
6.    The total number of affected structures is 159.  However, some affected
structures did not have any valid responses with respect to the type of
respondents (60). This is because some are public infrastructures and public
utilities where it is not possible to identify a specific respondent for such type of
structures. In some cases, the owners of the affected structures are absentees or
not available. These types of affected structures totaled to 60 which account for
about 38 percent of the total number of structures.  Therefore, in the foregoing



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaguit-Claver Road                                   j 
social and economic characterization, most responses will only be valid for 99
cases.
7.    Across the entire stretch, from Bacuag to the Boundary of Surigao del Norte, the
modal ethnic origin of the PAFs is Bisaya which accounts for 67 percent. The
next significant (30.8%) group is categorized as others and this group generally
refers to the ethno-linguistic affiliation indigenous to the area which is
"Surigaonon".  These two groups account for practically all of the respondents
(98%).
The average age of the respondents is about 47 years old. Across municipalities,
the mean age ranges from 37 years in Bacuag to 51 years in Gigaquit. The
average age among Claver respondents which is roughly 46.5 years is much
closer to the mean.
In terms of the level of educational attainment, the modal class is elementary
graduate with proportion estimated to be 31.3 percent. In cumulative terms,
about 60 percent of the respondents were unable to complete high school
education. About 17 percent completed high school and college graduates
account for 14 percent of the total respondents. It is interesting to note that the
proportion of those who did not have any form of education at all is only one
percent.
The modal household size is 5 per family. However, it must be noted that
household sizes of 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 each have proportions clustering between 10
and 11 percent. At the extreme ends of the distribution, about six percent are
single households and about 2 percent have either 11 or twelve members.
Slightly more than half (50.5%) of the respondents are characterized under a
nuclear household. However, also a relatively higher proportion (43%) are
extended households. This, implies that, as the household matures, in a
considerable number of cases, members are unable to establish their own
households.  Extended households can be interpreted as an indication of very
limited economic opportunities in the community.
8.    The modal occupation of the Project Affected Families (PAFs) is business
operation. This primary occupation accounted for roughly 35 percent of the
respondents. Farming is also relatively significant with an estimated proportion
of about 15 percent of the respondents. The same proportion is attributed to
those who are engaged in fulltime housekeeping.  The very notable statistical
information is the fact that about 21 percent of the respondents are not engaged in
any occupation at all. The very minimal proportion of those engaged in other
occupations is indicative of the very limited opportunities in the community.
Only about 4 percent are employed in their respective profession, 5 percent as
skilled laborers and one percent as hired farm worker.



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaguit-Claver Road                                   iv
9.   To put the income distribution in proper perspective, it must be recalled that the
instrument was designed to solicit income information only if the structure will be
affected severely. Hence, income variables are only supposed to be valid for
severe PAFs. Further, it must also be recalled that there are severely affected
structures which are public by nature, thus, there are no valid responses to
income variables. There are also absentee owners where soliciting the required
income variables were not possible.
Given the various primary occupation, the average level of total income is about
PhP92,921.  The mean is highest among Bacuag residents and lowest from the
PAFs in Claver. Respondents from Gigaquit are also relatively well off with an
estimated average total income of about PhP118,349. Farm income is very
minimal. This implies that the PAFs are relying more on non-farm economic
opportunities.
It must be noted that in all cases, the mean is higher than the median which
indicates a relatively skewed income distribution. Relatively few individuals are
earning extremely high levels of income and the majority are earning low. In fact,
in case of farm income, the median is zero which indicates that at least half of the
respondents did not have farm-income opportunities.
10.   The modal type of dwelling among the PAFs   across all municipalities is
temporary (35.7%). Semi-permanent dwelling account for about 32 percent.
However, a relatively higher proportion are also living in permanent dwellings
(17.9%).  It must be noted that about 14.3 percent of the PAFs are living in
shanties. By municipality, Gigaquit does not reflect the modal class of all the
PAFs combined because in the town, the modal class is semi-permanent. The few
PAFs in Bacuag are split equally between those living in permanent and those in
temporary dwellings with each sharing an estimated proportion of 3.6 percent.
The proportion of the respondents with access to electrical power is relatively
high. About 90 percent of the total household respondents are able to access
electrical energy. The other ten percent is divided into two: those who are using
kerosene gas for lighting (3.6%) and those using oil for lamp (7.1%). The
kerosene users are concentrated in Claver while the oil lamp users are mostly
residents of Gigaquit.
Majority of the PAFs, in aggregate terms, have access to potable water through
pump well system. Access to the other types of water system is practically split
between the two extremes. On the one hand, about 28 percent access water
through pipe systems. On the other hand, 21 percent of the PAFs are still
collecting rain water.



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaguit-Claver Road                                     v
The modal fuel type used is wood (67.9%) and about 28.6 percent are using LPG
for cooking. The remaining 3.6 percent is accounted for by those who use
kerosene gas for cooking. About 68 percent of the respondents are using either
semi flush toilet facilities. However, the proportion of those who are still using
the antipolo system is still relatively high at 14.3 percent. It must be stressed
here that also a relatively higher proportion of the PAFs does not have any toilet
facilities at all.
11.   The project design for the entire Bacuag-Claver Provincial Boundary section of
NRIM-Phase I generally followed the center line of the existing road pavements.
There were a few cases where realignments were made; however, these
realignments are within the existing Right of Way (ROW) as established by the
District Engineer's Office in Surigao City, Surigao del Norte. Hence, there are
no land acquisitions in this particular section of the road improvement project
12.   Based on the RAP Census, 159 structures will be affected by the road
improvement project: 113 are privately owned structures. Of these 113, 82 PAFs
are severely affected while 31 are marginally affected. 46 structures are public
such as Barangay Waiting Sheds, electric posts and structures for public utilities
among others.
Of the total 159 structures, about 119 will be severely affected and 40 will be
marginally affected.  In Bacuag, there are more public than private structure
affected. The same pattern is also true for Claver. However, in Gigaquit, more
private structures are affected.
The most common use of the structures affected is residential (39.5%).
Structures used both for residential and commercial purposes are also fairly
common. These structures account for about 21 percent of those affected by the
project. A considerable number of commercial structures have also been affected
by the project as well as public structures and utilities and a smaller proportion of
other structures such as churches and fences.
13.   In some cases, particularly if the structures are used for commercial purposes,
income loss is also a significant consequence of the road improvement projects.
The proportion of structures used fully or partially for commercial purposes will
provide an indicative extent of the income loss.  Based on the LARR policy,
income loss is estimated on the basis of foregone earnings of the commercial
establishment during the construction period not exceeding the equivalent income
for thirty days.
14.   Within the area of affected structures particularly those which are residential,
there are agricultural improvements that will be affected by the project. The most
common crops are coconuts and fruit trees. However, the bulk of the disturbance
on agricultural crop improvements are along the less settled areas of the road



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaguit-Claver Road                                     vi
where lands are cultivated but the farmers are non-residents in that specific area.
In such cases, the census was done to merely locate the specific crop
improvements and value the crops in terms of the current prices available at the
District Engineers' Office.
15.   The most number of severely affected structures is in the municipality of Claver
with a count of 58 and an estimated share of about 49.6 percent, then Gigaquit
comes second highest with an estimated severely affected structures accounting
for roughly 39 percent.  Bacuag account for only about 11 percent of the total
severely affected PAFs. By municipality, the aggregate distribution that more
residential structures are affected is also reflected in Claver and Gigaquit.
However, in the case of Bacuag, there are more public and commercial/residential
that are affected than there are residential.
There are 40 marginally affected structures in the road improvement section in the
Bacuag-Claver Provincial Boundary road improvement project. Most of these
structures are residential which account for about 45 percent of the total. A
considerable proportion (25%) of commercial/residential structures will also be
affected.  Among these marginally affected PAFs, the high proportion of
residential structures is consistent across the three municipalities.
On the basis of the first cluster of crop improvements, banana and coconut are the
most common valuable crop improvement in areas along the highway. In terms
of the broader classifications, fruit trees and forest trees also account for a
considerable number of the affected improvements on the land. The complete
listings of all affected improvements along the highway is outlined in Annex E.
16.   The total compensation package for 40 marginally affected structures is estimated
at roughly PhP639,246. This compensation package includes replacement costs
to structures, crop improvements within the vicinity of the structure, and forgone
earnings for structures used fully or partially for commercial purposes.
There are about 119 severely affected structures with an estimated total
entitlements of PhP3,839,137. This package is spread across the three
municipalities, by types of structures.
By municipality, as in the case of the marginally affected structures, Claver
accounts for more than half of the total compensation package for the three
municipalities with an estimated cost of about PhP376,006. Again, the remaining
portion is shared between the other two municipalities: PhP243,435 for Gigaquit
and for Bacuag, PhP19,806.
17.   In addition to the compensation package to the PAFs, RAP implementation will
entail overhead and logistical costs. This cost covers the management of the
implementation process, honoraria to field personnel and committee members,
maintenance and operating expenses and financial administration, among others.

As summarized, the total cost of the RAP is PhP 6,507,427 and $2,000.00
18.   The underlying principle of the LARR Policy Framework, in general, and the
RAP in particular, is to provide mitigating measures to at least ensure that the
PAFs will not be worse off as a consequence of the road improvement project. It
is for this reason that the survey instrument was designed to capture the critical
aspects of the PAFs social and economic conditions to provide the benchmark for
future assessments in the context of monitoring and evaluation.

Development interventions such as physical infrastructures undoubtedly result into
significant positive impacts to the community and the residents both in terms of
economic and social activities.  However, it is equally true that any development
intervention results in some negative externalities.  In the case of road infrastructure
projects, the obvious negative consequence would be in terms of the social costs
associated with environmental damage and human dislocation.
Within the framework of the DPWH Medium-Term Development Program (1999-2004),
the Department has been introducing institutional reforms. In particular, the Agency has
institutionalized, through the creation of offices in the department, the in-house capability
to assess the social and environmental consequences of the projects under the National
Roads Improvement and Management Program (NRIMP).
Hence, the department has promulgated the social policy framework and specific
guidelines for the implementation of projects under NRIMP. The framework and specific
guidelines are operationalized in the Policy Framework for Land Acquisition
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (LARR) in general, and in the principles outlined for the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), in particular. The said framework is anchored on the
philosophy that the adverse impact of NRIMP should be avoided, minimized and/or
mitigated to ensure that the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) will not be worse off, if not,
benefit from the project. Implicit in the framework are elements of just disturbance
compensation based on fair market value and replacement cost, participatory process
through local consultations, and internal/external monitoring to ensure proper and
effective implementation of the projects.
In order to operationalize the policies and principles outlined earlier, it is necessary to
conduct rigorous and systematic assessment of the project areas based on acceptable
standards in research methods and analysis.
2.    OBJECTIVES
In general, the objective of the RAP is anchored on two basic principles: prevent, if
possible, the dislocation of local settlers and if the disturbance is unavoidable then the
objective of RAP is to assess the extent of disturbance that NRIMP project will cause to
local settlers, provide mitigating measures to minimize the impact and to provide
compensation to actual damages to properties and other land improvements. The RAP

will also provide the mechanisms for implementation including the logistical and
administrative.
Specifically, the objectives of RAP include:
2.1.  to set up a process to allow for public consultations with PAPs on the NRIMP
projects;
2.2.  to determine the number and geographically locate the PAPs and assess the
extent of disturbance;
2.3.  to estimate, based on current market value and replacement cost, the disturbance
compensation;
2.4.  to provide the operational mechanisms for timely RAP implementation including
total budgetary allocations; and
2.5.  to formulate the terms of reference for internal and external monitoring of RAP
implementation.
3.    METHODOLOGY
3.1.  Institutional Collaboration
RAP preparation and implementation was designed as a collaborative effort among three
key institutions, DPWH, the LGUs, and the consulting Firm. To ensure smooth
implementation  and effective coordination among these institutions,  a series of
orientation and public consultations were organized.
On the one hand, orientation programs were organized to enable DPWH and LGU staff
members who will be involved in RAP preparation and implementation to appreciate the
philosophy and principles behind the RAP. On the other hand, public consultations were
designed to inform  settlers along the sites about the project and the expected
consequences to the community and the households.
3.2.  Data and Sources
The basic inputs for RAP preparation include primary and secondary data. Secondary
data about the overall social and economic situation obtaining in the communities along
the project sites were generated through municipal documents. Further, secondary data
were also generated pertaining to the valuation of affected structures and land
improvements.   For affected structures, prevailing market prices of construction
materials were generated to assess the replacement costs. For agricultural improvements,



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-ClaverRoad                                       3
current assessed value of crops and other commercial trees were also solicited from the
Assessors' Office. Secondary data pertaining to the technical description of the project
design were used in the linear acquisition and mapping.
Primary data were also generated through actual Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and
key-informants. Attributes of PAPs at the household level were generated through the
administration of a structured survey instrument and through complete enumeration of
the identified PAPs. Critical primary data were also solicited from key-informants. For
instance, technical informations were required to determine the number of Project
Affected Families (PAFs) and the extent of disturbance. Right of Way (ROW) limits
were solicited from the appropriate key-informants at the District Engineer's Office.
3.3.  Population
Because of the nature of the problem, it is required that complete enumeration of all
affected structures, families, and all other land improvements will have to be accounted
for to establish the impact of the road improvement project.
3.4.  Analytical Tools
In order to put the Resettlement Action Plan in proper perspective, there was need to
characterize the communities affected by the project. This was done by employing
descriptive statistical analysis of both secondary and primary data pertaining to the
respective communities. Specifically, the analysis involved the use of the standard
measures of central tendencies, dispersions and distributions.
The determination of the compensation matrix for each of the affected households and
the total compensation package was fairly straight forward. Valuation of structures
affected by the Project was based on the concept of Replacement Cost. Values were
determined based on the estimated quantity of materials needed to put up a structure
similar to the one that will be demolished due to the Project and monetized using the
current prices of materials as per records of the District Engineer's Office.  Similarly,
valuation of agricultural and other biological land improvements were based on the
assessed value provided for by the District Engineer's Office.  In special cases where
additional entitlements were required, valuation schemes based on the principles outlined
in the LARR Policy were adopted (Annex A).
The mechanical routine of generating summary of actual values were accomplished by
simple algorithmic instructions for the computers using standard application software.
The cost component of RAP implementation was determined by employing simple
budget planning.

4.    PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCEEDINGS
To ensure that the implementation of RAP will be done smoothly, it was embodied in the
policy framework of NRIMP to undergo a series of public consultation. The public
consultation was done at two levels. i.e. at the municipal level and at the barangay level.
Two orientation meetings were conducted at the earlier stage of the RAP preparation
report. Both meetings were facilitated by the Chief of EIAPO. The first was conducted
at the DPWH CARAGA Regional Office in Butuan City and the second was at the
Surigao del Norte District Engineer's Office in Surigao City.
Due to the proximity the three municipalities affected by the Bacuag-Gigaquit-Claver
road improvement project, it was deemed sufficient to hold a single consultation in the
municipality of Gigaquit which is the town at the middle.
To ensure wider participation, particularly among potential PAFs, letters of
communications were sent earlier to notify the respective LGU officials. As indicated in
Annex B.3, the consultation was well attended including the three respective mayors, the
Barangay Chairmen of the affected communities and potential PAFs.
During this consultation, in attendance was only LGUs but there were representatives of
PAFs in every barangay.
Annex B outlines the highlights of the proceedings in both orientation meeting and public
consultations. The orientation meetings were basically centered on the introduction of
NRIMP and the LARR Policy Framework because the audience were the implementers
of RAP.
Consequently, most of the discussions clustered about issues relating to the Role of the
DPWH Regional and District staff members. In contrast, because the audience of the
public consultations were the potential PAFs, issues revolved around compensation and
entitlements.
5.    RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
5.1. Project Description
The Bacuag-Gigaquit-Claver Road segment under NRIMP I is part of the long- term
development of the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road. However, for Phase I of NRIMP, the
Surigao Norte Contract Package is only one of the three which includes Marihatag-
Barobo-San Francisco Road in Surigao del Sur and Mati-Manay in Davao Oriental.

The Bacuag-Gigaquit-Claver road improvement section comprises of two sections
which apparently stretches across the three municipalities for a total road length of
about 44.5 kilometers (Table 5.1).
The first segment starts from Bacuag to the town proper of Claver. The segment is about
15.7 kilometers long. Only about 4 kilometers of the entire stretch of road is paved with
concrete cement and about half a kilometer is characterized to be in either very bad or
bad condition. The remaining segment of about 11.8 kilometers is paved with gravel
where six kilometers is characterized as either in good or fair condition and the
remaining 5.8 is in bad or very bad condition.

The other segment which starts from the town of Claver up to the provincial boundary is
generally a gravel road. Only about 2.7 kilometers of road is paved with concrete and
the remaining stretch of roughly 26 kilometers is paved with gravel characterized as
either in very bad or bad condition.
5.2.   The Local Government Units
5.2.1. Bacuag
Bacuag is, relatively speaking, an old municipality. The influx of migrants, generally
from the province of Bohol, started as early as the 1880s and the municipality itself was
established in 1919. In the earlier developments. The municipality was then comprised
of only five brarangays.



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-ClaverRoad                                           7
The municipality is spread across a total land area of about 14,617 hectares divided into 9
different barangays.  Close to half (44%) of the municipality  are mountainous with
patches of forest, grass lands, swamps, and marshes. The remaining portion of arable
lands are being utilized generally for low intensive agricultural production.

Source: MPDO, Bacuag, Surigao del Norte, 1997.
The available statistics based on the socio-economic profile of the municipality is quite
old (1997). In recent years there have been construction of concrete pavement along the
national passing through the municipality. However,   for the other portions of the
municipality, most of the characterization in terms of the level of road infrastructures
would still be very relevant. Even the recent characterization presented earlier as part of
the project description indicated the very low level of concrete pavement in the Bacuag-
Claver segment of the road.
The total length of the road network for the municipality is quite minimal. For the total
length of about 99 kilometers of road, only about 1.5 kilometers were paved with
concrete in 1997. The remaining 97.5 kilometers are paved with gravel and the bulk of
the roads are classifies as barangay roads. In terms of road density, the municipality has
about 688 meters of gravel pavement per square kilometer of land area and about ten
meters of concrete pavement per square kilometer.
5.2.2. Gigaquit
Gigaquit is the second to the last town to the south towards the provincial boundary to
Surigao  del Sur.     The   general topography   of the   town   is  mountainous.
From a relatively short distance from the shorelines, the area of the town abruptly rises
towards the Diwata Mountain ranges.



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-ClaverRoad                                           8
The municipality is composed of 13 barangays spread across an area of about 23,570
hectares.  Most of the arabe lands are devoted to the production of coconut and some
irrigated lands are devoted to the production of rice.
The road network of the municipality is relatively less extensive. The only portion paved
with concrete is about a kilometer of road along the highway cutting through Barangay
San Isidro and about 4 kilometers from the highway towards the Central Business District
of the municipality.
There are on-going attempts by special projects funded by the World Bank to provide
irrigation and farm to market roads in the municipality particularly in the in Barangay
San Isidro. Specifically, an eleven kilometer all-weather road is under construction to
connect the upland barangays of Lahi and Sico-sico to the lowland communities. At this
point in time, the only practical means of access to the upland barangays is through
Daywan river via pump boats.
5.2.3. Claver
Claver, as a geo-political unit, became a municipality only in 1955. Hence, relative to the
other municipalities in the province, it is a very young town. The total land area of the
municipality stretches to about 32,262 hectares of land spread across 14 barangays
including an island and a few islets. The total population of the town is about 17,376.
While the area is quite huge, most are spread along the mountainous sections and are
therefore classified as forest lands. Only about 30 percent of the land area has been
declared alienable and disposable (A&D) lands.

The available data set provided by the Municipal Planning and Development Office
(MPDO) does not contain information on the length and classification of roads under the
administrative jurisdiction of the provincial and national agencies. The total length of the
road network for the municipality of Claver is very low. The total length of concrete is
about 3.5 kilometers; however, but the total road length is only 22.6 kilometers. Further,
a high proportion of the road network is still earth pavement.
Considering that the area of the municipality is relatively large, then the road density
would indeed seem very minimal. In terms of the total road length, the density is only
about 70 meters per square kilometer of land area.
5.3.   Socio-Economic Profile of Project Affected Families
The total number of affected structures is 159. However, some affected structures did
not have any valid responses with respect to the type of respondents (60).  This is
because some are public infrastructures and public utilities where it is not possible to
identify a specific respondent for such type of structures. In some cases, the owners of
the affected structures are absentees or not available. These types of affected structures
totaled to 60 which account for about 38 percent of the total number of structures (Table
5.3).  Therefore, in the foregoing social and economic characterization, most responses
will only be valid for 99 cases.
Among the affected structures with valid responses, the modal type of respondent is the
spouse with an estimated proportion of roughly 40 percent. Husbands, as respondents,
accounted for about 18 percent and a minimal proportion (3.8%) of the respondents were
the children.

53.1. Demography
As raised in the previous section, there are only 99 cases with valid types of respondents
and hence, the only cases where socio-economic characterization is possible. In most
characterization, therefore, the number of cases with valid responses is 99.
Across the entire stretch, from Bacuag to the Boundary of Surigao del Norte, the modal
ethnic origin of the PAFs is Bisaya which accounts for 67 percent, 33 percent of which
are PAFs who owns marginally affected structures while 67 percent are Bisayan PAFs
with severely affected structures (Table 5.3.1a). The next significant group generally
refers to the ethno-linguistic affiliation indigenous to the area, which is "Surigaonon".
This group accounts for about 30 percent of the total number of valid cases. Severely
affected Surigaonon PAFs represents a total of about 77 percent while those marginally
affected PAFs only represents about one fourth of the total Surigaonon PAFs.
There are no information on the chronology of the influx of Christian migrants in the area
and also with respect to their cultural makeup. Surigaonon and Bisaya are two of the
dominant ethno-linguistic groups in the area. These groups, however, are not classified
as indigenous people.
PAFs along the Bacuag-Claver segment include migrants from Ilocos, Southern Tagalog,
and Visayas. However, most identify themselves as either Bisaya or Surigaonon.
Majority of the severely affected Bisayan PAFs reside in Claver. Severely affected
Surigaonon PAFs, on the other hand, reside mostly in Gigaquit.

At this point, it would be worthy to note the distribution of the respondents by
municipality. About 90 percent of the respondents are under the political jurisdictions of
the municipalities of Claver (47.5%) and Gigaquit (42.4%).              The remaining 10 percent
are within the boundaries of Bacuag.
The average age of the respondents is about 47 years old. Across municipalities, the
mean age ranges from 37 years in Bacuag to 51 years in Gigaquit. The average age
among Claver respondents which is roughly 46.5 years is much closer to the mean.

In terms of the level of educational attainment, the modal class is elementary graduate
with proportion estimated to be 31.3 percent. In cumulative terms, about 60 percent of
the respondents were unable to complete high school education. About 17 percent
completed high school and college graduates account for 14 percent of the total
respondents.  It is interesting to note that the proportion of those who did not have any
form of education at all is only one percent.
The modal household size is 5 per family (Table 5.3.1c). However, it must be noted that
household sizes of 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 each have proportions clustering between 10 and 11
percent. At the extreme ends of the distribution, about six percent are single households
and about 2 percent have either 11 or twelve members.

Slightly more than half (50.5%) of the respondents are characterized under a nuclear
household (Table 5.3.1d). However, also a relatively higher proportion (43%) are
extended households. This implies that, as the household matures, in a considerable
number of cases, members are unable to establish their own households. Extended

households can be interpreted as an indication of very limited economic opportunities in
the community.

53.2. Economy
The modal occupation of the Project Affected Families (PAFs) is business operation.
This primary occupation accounted for roughly 35 percent of the respondents. Farming is
also relatively significant with an estimated proportion of about 15 percent of the
respondents.
The same proportion is attributed to those who are engaged in fulltime housekeeping.
The very notable statistical information is the fact that about 21 percent of the
respondents are not engaged in any occupation at all.
The very minimal proportion of those engaged in other occupations is indicative of the
very limited opportunities in the community. Only about 4 percent are employed in their
respective profession, 5 percent as skilled laborers and one percent as hired farm worker.

To put the income distribution in proper perspective, it must be recalled that the
instrument was designed to solicit income information only if the structure will be
affected severely. Hence, income variables are only supposed to be valid for severe
PAFs. Further, it must also be recalled that there are severely affected structures which
are public by nature, thus, there are no valid responses to income variables. There are
also absentee owners where soliciting the required income variables were not possible.
Consequently, Table 5.3.2b only represent 41 valid responses.         Given the various
primary occupation, the average level of total income is about PhP92,921. The mean is
highest among Bacuag residents and lowest from the PAFs in Claver. Respondents from
Gigaquit are also relatively well off with an estimated average total income of about
PhP118,349. Farm income is very minimal. This implies that the PAFs are relying more
on non-farm economic opportunities.
It must be noted that in all cases, the mean is higher than the median which indicates a
relatively skewed income distribution. Relatively few individuals are earning extremely
high levels of income and the majority are earning low. In fact, in case of farm income,
the median is zero which indicates that at least half of the respondents did not have farm-
income opportunities.

5.33. Level of Living
The modal type of dwelling among the PAFs across all municipalities is temporary
(35.7%, Table 533). Semi-permanent dwelling account for about 32 percent. However, a
relatively higher proportion are also living in permanent dwellings (17.9%). It must be
noted that about 14.3 percent of the PAFs are living in shanties. By municipality,
Gigaquit does not reflect the modal class of all the PAFs combined because in the town,
the modal class is semi-permanent. The few PAFs in Bacuag are split equally between
those living in permanent and those in temporary dwellings with each sharing an
estimated proportion of 3.6 percent.
The proportion of the respondents with access to electrical power is relatively high.
About 90 percent of the total household respondents are able to access electrical energy.
The other ten percent is divided into two: those who are using kerosene gas for lighting
(3.6%) and those using oil for lamp (7.1%). The kerosene users are concentrated in
Claver while the oil lamp users are mostly residents of Gigaquit.
Majority of the PAFs, in aggregate terms, have access to potable water through pump
well system. Access to the other types of water system is practically split between the
two extremes. On the one hand, about 28 percent access water through pipe systems.
On the other hand, 21 percent of the PAFs are still collecting rain water.

The modal fuel type used is wood (67.9%) and about 28.6 percent are using LPG for
cooking. The remaining 3.6 percent is accounted for by those who use kerosene gas for
cooking. About 68 percent of the respondents are using either semi flush toilet facilities.
However,   the proportion of those who are still using the antipolo system is still
relatively high at 14.3 percent.  It must be stressed here that also a relatively higher
proportion of the PAFs does not have any toilet facilities at all.
5.4.  Project Impacts
5.4.1. Impacts on Land
The project design for mne entire iiacuag-Gigaquit-Claver section of NRIM-Phase I
generally followed the center line of the existing road pavements. There were a few
cases where realignments were made; however, these realignments are within the
existing Right of Way (ROW) as established by the District Engineer's Office in Surigao
City, Surigao del Norte. Hence, there are no land acquisitions in this particular section
of the road improvement project.
5.4.2. Impacts on Structures
Census and inventory of affected assets were conducted in January- March 2001,
including the conduct of baseline socio-economic survey for marginally and severely
affected households. The cut-off date is 13 March 2001.
Based on the RAP Census, 159 structures will be affected by the road improvement
project: 119 are structures which would be severely affected by the road improvement
project and 40 will be marginally affected.
In both severe and marginally affected structures, the common use are residential,
commercial, and commercial/residential (structures used for both residential and
commercial purposes).  Among severely affected structures,  the three categories
account for about three quarters (69%) of the total structures (Table 5.4.2). The
remainder is spread across structures used as public infrastructures, public utilities and
other uses such as walkways and school fences, among others.
The proportion of the three categories in the marginally affected structures is even much
higher, which is estimated at about 77.5 percent.  The remaining  proportion is
distributed across public infrastructures and other uses.
Of the 159 structures, the road project will affect 113 PAP households who will be
adversely affected by the loss of their main structure (i.e. independent house, cum store
or independent shops). 82 PAFs are severely affected and 31 are marginally affected. On

the other hand, 412 PAP households who are losing an estimated 3,810 trees and
perennials of various species have been identified.
5.4.3. Loss of Income
In some cases, particularly if the structures are used for commercial purposes, income
loss will also be a significant consequence of the road improvement projects. The
proportion of structures used fully or partially for commercial purposes will provide an
indicative extent of the income loss.  Based on the LARR policy, income loss is
estimated on the basis of foregone earnings of the commercial establishment during the
construction period not exceeding the equivalent income for thirty days.
5.4.4. Impact on Land Improvements
Within the area of affected structures particularly those which are residential, there are
agricultural improvements that will be affected by the project. The most common crops
are coconuts and fruit trees. In cases such as these, improvements are assessed and
valued using the current market prices of construction materials as provided by the
District Engineers Office, Department of Public Works and Highways.
5.5.  Compensation Package
5.5.1. Entitlements
There are no land acquisitions in the Bacuag-Claver-Provincial Bdry Road Section
improvement project. Hence, the compensation entitlements are limited, as the case
maybe,   to  affected structures,  trees and other improvements and disturbance
compensations such as foregone income and subsistence allowance for PAFs.
5.5.2. Affected Structures
Based on the guidelines, if the total floor area affected exceeds 20 percent of the total
floor area of the structure, the impact is considered severe. In such cases, the whole
structure will be acquired and estimated for payments. However, in the implementation
of the survey, field workers were given the prerogative to deviate from the rigid 20
percent cut-off to allow for special cases for considerations. For instance, it will not
require 20 percent of damage for light structures and shanties to destroy the stability of
the structure; hence, judgments are made at the field where even at less 20 percent, some
structures were considered to be severely affected. They are also cases where mitigation
measures can be suggested to spare huge and expensive structures.  All structures are
within the ROW as established by the DPWH. Hence, entitlements are on the basis of



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-ClaverRoad                                      19
their being owners or tenants of structures. In this case, entitlements are patterned in the
schedule outlined in Table 5.5.4.
5.53. Land Improvements in Absentee Landholdings
During the course of the RAP Survey, valuable land improvements along the roads were
determined to be affected by the road improvement project. However, in cases where the
landowners or tenants are non-settlers in the area, it was deemed appropriate for
practical purposes, to simply locate the specific improvement along the road section and
attach the corresponding value.
5.5.4. Compensation Matrix
In line with the aforementioned objectives and principles of resettlement (Chapter 3) and
the legal framework (Chapter 4), the matrix below will be used in the settlement of
claims for compensation for lost assets of PAPs. Unless otherwise indicated, payment of
compensation and other entitlements and the extension of assistance will be given to PAP
households, not individuals. No relocation site is being envisaged for the project. PAFs
that will be adversely affected by the loss of their main structures will reorganize their
structures on adjacent or nearby lots.

Hence, there are only four distinct types of PAFs in relation to affected structures:
marginally affected owners; marginally affected non-owners; severely affected owners;
and severely affected non-owners. Additional entitlements depending on the attributes
of the PAFs are provided for as outlined in the entitlement matrix in the LARR Policy.
Since the PAFs are thinly stretched along the entire segment, there will be no elaborate
relocation scheme. Each severely affected PAF will have to individually workout their
own relocation process using the proceeds of the compensation package that accrue to
them as part of their entitlements.
5.5.5. Value of affected Perennials
As mentioned earlier, the value of perennials was estimated based on the current market
prices as provided by the District Engineers Office, Department of Public Works and
Highways.
All in all, about PhP 332,725.00 will be required to compensate for damages to trees and
other perennials.
5.5.6 Compensation Matrix for Resident PAFs
Based on the LARR policy the compensation entitlements are summarized in Table 5.5.4.
At this point it is deemed appropriate to outline the basic assumptions adopted to
operationalize the entitlements provided for under the Policy.
5.5.6.1. Replacement Costs.
The affected structures were mainly categorized as  residential,  commercial,
commercial/residential, public infrastructures,  public utilities  and other types of
structures. The structures, based on the linear acquisition survey were evaluated as to
whether the impact is severe or marginal following the guidelines in the LARR Policy
and the appropriate cost entitlements were estimated using the replacement cost concept.
5.5.6.2. Land Improvements
In most cases, other valuable improvements within the home lot were also affected.
These improvements were also valued to form part of the total compensation package for
the PAFs. Valuation of other structures were done on the basis of the replacement costs
concept and valuation of crop improvements were done on the basis of the current
market value.



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-ClaverRoad                                     28
5.5.6.3. Income Loss
In cases commercial structures, owners and tenants were entitled to a compensation of
foregone income as a projected consequence of the implementation of the road
improvement project. Income losses were determined as equivalent to the estimated
average monthly gross sales of the commercial enterprise.
5.5.6.4. Relocation Allowance
Renters of severely affected structures were expected to be dislocated from their current
dwellings. Hence, as provided for in the LARR policy, these PAFs were entitled to a
relocation allowance equivalent to their respective monthly rental.
5.5.7. Compensation Package
Table 5.5.7 summarizes the compensation package for the PAFs based on the estent of
impact, type of structures and the additional compensation entitlements.

5.5.8. RAP Implementation Cost
In addition to the compensation package to the PAFs, RAP implementation will entail
overhead and logistical costs. This cost covers the management of the implementation
process,   honoraria to field personnel and committee members, maintenance and
operating expenses and financial administration, among others. It is suggested here that
the total implementation costs of the RAP be pegged at 10 percent of the total
compensation to the PAFs. Hence, the implementation cost is projected at about PhP
5.5.9. Distribution of Total Compensation by Municipality
As a matter of policy, RAP implementation will be done by the DPWH District
Engineers Office in collaboration with the local government units through the Municipal
RAP Implementing Committee (MRIC). Hence, there is the need to outline the total
compensation package by municipality.
5.5.9.1. Marginally Affected Structures
The total compensation package for 40 marginally affected structures is estimated at
roughly PhP 639,246 (Table 5.5.10.1). This compensation package includes replacement
costs to structures, crop improvements within the vicinity of the structure, and forgone
eamings for structures used fully or partially for commercial purposes.

The bulk of the compensation accrues to the owners of marginally affected commercial
or residential/commercial structures with a combined estimated costs of about PhP
360,000. The remaining cost estimate of about PhP280,000 is spread across the other
uses including residential, public facilities and other structures.
By municipality, Claver and Gigaquit have the higher compensation packages estimated
at about PhP 376,006 and      PhP 243,435     respectively.   The higher compensation for
Claver is attributed to the damage to commercial cum residential structures estimated at
PhP253,436.
5.5.9.2. Severely Affected Structures
There are about 119 severely affected structures with an estimated total entitlements of
PhP 3,839,136 (Table 5.5.10.2). This package is spread across the three municipalities,
by types of structures.

6.  Implementation Schedule
The implementation of the RAP follows as soon as the World Bank concurs with the
salient features of the RAP as endorsed by the GOP through DPWH/IBRD-PMO. After
the approval of the RAP Report, implementation will be managed by the EIAPO with
the supervision of the IBRD-PMO.
6.1. MOU and Establishment of Committees
Table 6 outlines the fundamental steps, procedures and schedule of the activities
required for the implementation of the RAP. To set up the structural basis for the
implementation of RAP, the institutionalization of the roles of the various stakeholders
in the project will have to be operationalized. This can be done through the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the DPWH and the Local Government
Units.   The MOU will pave the way for the establishment of the various committees
required for the implementation of RAP, namely; the municipal-based Resettlement
Implementation Committee (RIC) and the Grievance Committee.
6.2. Training-Orientation on RAP Implementation
Because the concept and the process are relatively new even to the DPWH bureaucracy,
there is need to orient the District Offices and the counterpart members of the Local
Government Units (LGUs) on the RAP Implementation procedures.
Immediately following the formation of the MRIC, its members will be oriented on the
work of the committee. Specifically, the MRIC members will be trained in RAP policies
and implementation procedures
6.3. Validation of RAP Report
With the assumptions that the implementing mechanisms for the RAP at all levels has
been established, then all the stakeholders can participate in the collaborative work of
validating the RAP Report prepared by the consulting Firm. Validation will involve
cross checking of the identified PAFs, the accuracy of the linear acquisition, and
validation of entitlements and compensation.
6.4. Public Infornation Campaign
As soon as the validating team finds the RAP Report to be satisfactory or is in
compliance with the standards set in the LARR Policy Framework, then a public
information campaign can be launched to reiterate the existence of the project and to
allow the PAFs to prepare the necessary supporting documents, if needed, for the
compensation to be made possible.



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-Claver Road                                  34
6.5. Finalization of the Compensation Package
Subject to modifications in response to changing price conditions, the compensation
package will then be finalized to determine the amount to be paid for each individual
PAF. Once completed, PAFs will be asked to fill up some forms to indicate their
concurrence to the compensation package and to the terms and conditions of the
compensation.
6.6. Public Meeting/Disclosure
In a public forum, PAFs will be made aware of their entitlements as a consequence of
project disturbance. At this point in time, PAFS will also be informed of the schedule of
payments and the schedule of civil works to allow the PAFs to prepare for their
reorganization or relocation and to harvest any standing agricultural crops.
6.7. Cut-off Date
As provided for in the policy, only structures existing on or before March 13, 2001 will
be entitled to the compensation package.
6.8. Payment
Payment will have to be done in a public place. Hence, the RIC should coordinate with
the LGU officials to ensure that PAFs within their areas of jurisdiction are made aware
of the schedules of payments.
6.9. Handing Over the Site for Civil Works
One month before the scheduled start of civil works, RAP implementation shall have
been completed. This means that PAFs have been paid, reorganized or relocated, and all
the stakeholders in the implementation process have performed their tasks in accordance
to the DPWH Resettlement Policy.

7. Monitoring and Evaluation
The underlying principle of the LARR Policy Framework, in general, and the RAP in
particular, is to provide mitigating measures to at least ensure that the PAFs will not be
worse off as a consequence of the road improvement project. It is for this reason that the
survey instrument was designed to capture the critical aspects of the PAFs social and
economic conditions to provide the benchmark for future assessments in the context of
monitoring and evaluation.
The instrument was also designed to capture the salient attributes of the PAFs and their
affected properties to ensure that the monitoring and evaluation team can validate as
whether or not the determination of the entitlements and the estimation of compensations
are along the principles outlined in the LARR Policy Framework.
The PAFs profile, the entitlements and the estimated compensation packages presented
in the earlier sections are mere summaries of the raw data structured in a standard
database format.  Electronic copies of the database are provided for to facilitate the
monitoring and evaluation of the RAP implementation and impact.
Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the RAP is designed to be conducted
at two levels: internal and external monitoring. Internal monitoring will be conducted
by the Environmental and Social Services/EIAPO in collaboration with the Ditrict
Offices, the local government units (LGUs) and the PAFs. DPWH will solicit the
services of independent agencies such as research and academic institutions, or other
qualified consulting firms to conduct the external monitoring and evaluation (EMA).

11. Consultation Proper
Part of the process to finalize the draft Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is to conduct a
public consultation where public officials and the affected population meet and discuss
the project and its likely impacts. This was done to ensure that the community
understands the nature and extent of the project. A consultation implies sharing of ideas,
which help in better understanding of the issues arising in the said activity. Such
gatherings help disseminate information from project officials to the affected population.
It provides accurate information to the affected population and also dispels fears and
misconception, thus providing the foundation for collaboration between the affected
population and the project officials.
One week before the scheduled date for public consultation, letters of notice were sent to
the mayors of the municipalities within the project's boundaries, informing them of the
public consultation to be conducted by the Katahira Consultant and the Engineers from
the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The letters were also faxed to
the District Engineers in Tandag and Surigao City. Due to some hitch in communication,
the letter was not able to reach the office of the District Engineer in Surigao City. They
were only informed by the consultant upon his arrival in the province.
Dr. Prudenciano Gordoncillo, Katahira consultant, facilitated the public consultation. He
presented the project including its overall objectives and merits. The concept, as well as
the process of implementing the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was also briefly
explained. The roles and responsibilities of the DPWH, the LGUs and the Community
were further identified during the consultation. The public was also informed of the
schedule of the socio-economic survey in their respective municipalities.
III. Highlights/Issues Raised
1). Claims for the compensation for lost assets of PAPs. The consultant assured the
public that all PAPs residing in, doing business, cultivating land, have rights over
resources within the project area will be eligible for compensation for lost assets.
PAPs who own private lands must show title, tax declaration or any proof to show
ownership of the lands. Public physical infrastructure such as waiting sheds, electric
posts, water pipes, irrigation system, etc., which will be affected by the project are
Al-5



NRIMP-RAP: Bacuag-Gigaquit-ClaverRoad
entitled for compensation. It was also cleared in the consultation that the PAPs who
lives within the road right of way will be compensated only for the affected structures
and not for the land. The DPWH will be responsible for the payments for the lost
assets.
2). Scope of the project's road construction. Dr. Gordoncillo clarified that the road
construction will affect the provinces of Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Agusan
del Sur and Davao Oriental. For Surigao del Norte, the road construction includes 12
km from Bacuag boundary to Claver. The road project will improve and rehabilitate
gravel roads and convert it to Portland Cement pavement. Existing roads that needs
repair will also be rehabilitated. Deteriorating bridges will also be replaced and
drainages will also be put in place.
3). Concreting of roads in Brgy. Urbiztondo, Claver. The Brgy. Captain of Urbiztondo,
Claver suggested for a re-route since there would be many structures that will be
affected in the area including a school fence. Engr. Sol Abasa from DPWH head
office however, told the Brgy. Captain that they will first look into the design made
by Katahira Engineers. However, she reiterated that still, the Katahira Engineers will
have the final decision when it comes to the road design.
4). Assistance from the LGUs. The consultant urged the Mayor and Brgy. Captains of
Gigaquit, Bacuag and Claver to orient their barangay members regarding the project
ahnd the socio-economic survey to be conducted by the project team. Such
orientation will facilitate the data-gathering process and ensure the quality of data
provided by the community.
