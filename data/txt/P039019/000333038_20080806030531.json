outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            cost and time overruns need to be reduced through improved\n            procurement and contract management. The public's\n            acceptance of road user charges and confidence in the Road\n            Fund must be earned by the satisfactory utilization of funds\n            applied in a consistent and transparent manner.\n            Modernization of technical and business processes requires\n            corresponding reforms at the organizational level in order\n            to be sustainable. Policy change and restructuring at the\n            sector level requires broad-based, strong client ownership\n            at all levels of government. Governance issues and\n            corruption are heavily influenced by both internal and\n            external environments, so remedial measures need to be\n            comprehensive and targets realistic."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
