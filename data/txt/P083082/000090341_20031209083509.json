      (MSME) Project in Nigeria aims to increase the performance\n            and employment levels of MSMEs in selected non-oil industry\n            sub-sectors and in three targeted states of the country. To\n            achieve this, the project in Nigeria will: (i) develop and\n            strengthen the capacity of local intermediaries to deliver\n            financial and non-financial services to MSMEs; (ii) reduce\n            selected investment climate barriers that constrain MSME\n            performance; (iii) mobilize, via (i) and (ii), increased\n            private investments in MSMEs, and intermediaries. The\n            project has the following five components: Component 1) will\n            seek to deepen and broaden the financial services available\n            to MSMEs. This will be achieved through the provision of\n            grants to assist qualifying institutions and companies to\n            provide up to four types of commercially sustainable\n            financial services to MSMEs. These grants will be used to\n            finance technical and capacity building assistance to the\n            providers. Component 2) will seek to develop the market for\n            business development services (BDS) by supporting\n            intermediaries to respond to unmet MSME demand for BDS\n            focusing on the three target States. This will be done\n            through the provision of grants and technical assistance to\n            qualifying institutions and companies to develop products\n            and to strengthen their operations in order to be able to\n            respond commercially and over a sustained period to market\n            demand. Component 3) Technical and capacity building support\n            will be provided through the IDA credit to assist in the\n            following initiatives of the Government of Nigeria: (a)\n            Registration Reform, (b) Commercial Dispute Resolution, (c)\n            Leasing services, (d) Credit Bureau, and (e) Secured\n            Transaction System. Component 4) IDA resources will be\n            allocated to provide selected Federal and target State\n            Government Agencies with MSME development responsibilities\n            the opportunity to access global best practices.\n            Specifically, advisory services would be available to\n            provide best practice capacity-building to institutions with\n            policy and related responsibilities for the MSME sector.\n            Component 5) IDA funds will be allocated to finance the\n            execution, reporting, review (semi-annual and mid-term) and\n            monitoring of project components and independent evaluations\n            of selected issues, particularly through case studies.\n            Provisions will also be made for equipment and operational\n            costs and other financial, audit, training and consultant\n            assignments as required and laid out in the approved annual\n            procurement plan."}, "docdt": "2003-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
