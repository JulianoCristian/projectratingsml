        Enterprise Project for Nigeria were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome is\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: results framework should be\n            designed to measure direct impact of the project. This\n            includes ensuring that monitoring and impact indicators\n            directly correspond to the project objective and are easily\n            measurable. This is essential not only to assessing whether\n            project objectives have been achieved, but also to ensuring\n            that the targets are practically achievable and within the\n            control of the project management. In case of significant\n            project delays, which may affect implementation of original\n            project design, a review of planned project activities\n            should be conducted to confirm that they can be practically\n            implemented. As a result of long delays, operational and\n            political circumstances may change. Implementing entities\n            should include key staff with required qualification and\n            experience with World Bank procedures from the very start of\n            the project. As there was no suitable entity within the\n            government, and based on previous experience with government\n            run projects in Nigeria, a private entity was tasked with\n            project management. The Project Management Unit (PMU) also\n            employed national staff in some key positions thus building\n            local capacity, while the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)\n            was staffed with civil servants. As a result, it is likely\n            that the local staff capacity to implement complex projects\n            was increased, and should provide a significant human\n            resource for future projects. While the engagement of a\n            private sector operator may have increased overall\n            implementation capacity in a complex implementation\n            environment, the private PMU has also experienced initial\n            challenges with applying World Bank procurement guidelines.\n            All core project management functions should be within a\n            single implementing entity. Implementation arrangements\n            envisaged both the private PMU and government led PIU. While\n            most of the project management functions were with the PMU,\n            including procurement, the responsibility for financial\n            management and disbursements and compliance with World Bank\n            rules in these areas rested with the PIU. Though it was a\n            pilot project, which allowed for a more flexible design and\n            testing of new approaches, the breadth of the operation may\n            have been too ambitious. This is especially true with regard\n            to numerous activities aimed at reforming the investment\n            climate which required wide institutional support which\n            could not be fully secured."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
