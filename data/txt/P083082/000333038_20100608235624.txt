                        Extension of Closing Date
              MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE PROJECT
                                LOAN

                                 Restructuring Paper



1. It is proposed to extend the closing date for Micro, SMALL AND MEDIUM
   ENTERPRISE PROJECT, Credit No 38390 (P083082) from June 30, 2010 until June
   20, 2011.

2. The project implementation started slowly and the project has continued to lag behind
   the original schedule ever since. There were a combination of reasons for this
   including; poor project preparation, the need to wait for the Central Bank of Nigeria
   (CBN) to approve a microfinance policy and the lengthy procurement process
   experienced for the larger contracts. The project is now performing well and has
   recently gone through an extensive Financial Management (FM) and procurement
   review resulting in improvements in the fiduciary components. Overall the project
   has already met many of its original targets. The project implementing agency
   requested a two year extension last year but this was not approved by the Federal
   Ministry of Finance (FMOF). Following continued good performance of the project
   the current request for an extension has now been received from FMOF.

3. The proposed extension to June 20, 2011 is necessary to enable concluding several
   procurements which are already in advanced stages as well as to implement a
   minimum of $900,000 of matching grants under the three value chains. There is also
   an additional group of applicants who have tentatively been reviewed for grants, but
   any grant made to them would likely extend beyond June 30, 2010. The team has
   discussed and agreed with the Borrower the action plan and is convinced that the
   action plan is feasible and realistic, and will enable a successful achievement of the
   Project Development Objectives within the proposed time.

4. This will be the second extension of the project. The original closing date of June 30,
   2009          was         extended           to        June          30,         2010.
