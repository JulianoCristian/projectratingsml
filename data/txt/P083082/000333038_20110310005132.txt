                        Extension of Closing Date
             MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE PROJECT
                               LOAN

                                 Restructuring Paper



1. It is proposed to extend the closing date for Micro, SMALL AND MEDIUM
   ENTERPRISE PROJECT, Credit No 38390 (P083082) from June 20, 2010 until
   December 31st 2011.

2. The project implementation started slowly and the project has continued to lag behind
   the original schedule ever since. There were a combination of reasons for this
   including; poor project preparation, the need to wait for the Central Bank of Nigeria
   (CBN) to approve a microfinance policy and the lengthy procurement process
   experienced for the larger contracts. The project is now performing well and has
   recently gone through an extensive Financial Management (FM) and procurement
   review resulting in improvements in the fiduciary components. Overall the project
   has already met many of its original targets. The project implementing agency and
   the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMOF) have requested a six month extension to
   allow them to scale-up the successful access to finance and business development
   services components prior to the project closing.

3. The proposed extension to December 31st 2011 is necessary to enable support to
   government's enterprise creation and entrepreneurship training programs as well as
   provide increased access to finance by downscaling commercial banks to serve SME
   clients. The team has discussed and agreed with the Borrower the action plan and is
   convinced that the action plan is feasible and realistic, and will enable a successful
   achievement of the Project Development Objectives within the proposed time.

4. This      will      be      the     final      extension      of     the      project.
