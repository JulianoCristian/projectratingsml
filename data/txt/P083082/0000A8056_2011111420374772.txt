                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Increase the performance and employment levels of MSMEs in selected non-oil industry sub-sectors and in pilot areas of the country. To achieve this, the
                         project in Nigeria will: (i) develop and strengthen the capacity of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs; (ii) reduce
                         selected investment climate barriers that constrain MSME performance; (iii) mobilize, via (i) and (ii), increased private investments in MSMEs and intermediaries.

                         As this project approaches its closing date the activities are being wound down and the PIU is preparing for an orderly close of the project. Project funds are also being used to
                         support the Federal government's enterprise development program and business plan competition to stimulate SME activity throughout the country.

                         Most of the microfinance institutions have now recovered from the worst of the financial crisis. Only one institution continues to struggle with a high portfolio at risk. Over 50% of the

                         borrowers are women. Given the current trends, we expect this component to have far exceeded the original targets and to be completely sustainable following the project closure.

                         The investment climate component has produced good results in Alternative Dispute Resolution and support to the CBN on the establishment of the Credit Bureaus. The Business
                         Development Services component has also proved successful with training provided to more than 18,000 small Nigerian businesses far in excess of the original target. The impact
                         evaluation surveys indicate very positive returns to these activities.
