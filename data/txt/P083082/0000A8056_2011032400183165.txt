                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Increase the performance and employment levels of MSMEs in selected non-oil industry sub-sectors and in pilot areas of the country. To achieve this, the
                         project in Nigeria will: (i) develop and strengthen the capacity of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs; (ii) reduce
                         selected investment climate barriers that constrain MSME performance; (iii) mobilize, via (i) and (ii), increased private investments in MSMEs and intermediaries.

                         On the whole, this project continues to perform satisfactorily. Over the past few months the Access to Finance (A2F) component has extended support to another new microfinance
                         bank which started operations in Kaduna. It is the first new MFB to start operations outside Lagos. Despite an excellent start the past six months have proved a difficult period for the

                         microfinance industry. Following the banking crisis several MFBs have been forced to close their doors. Two of the seven grantees had their licenses revoked by the CBN and have
                         closed their operations. The remaining MFBs continue to improve the quality of their portfolios rather than expand operations. With improved market conditions this situation will
                         soon be rectified.

                         The investment climate component has produced good results in Alternative Dispute Resolution and support to the CBN on the establishment of the Credit Bureaus. The Business
                         Development Services component has also proved successful with training provided to more than 10,000 small Nigerian businesses.
