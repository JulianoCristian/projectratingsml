     the support provided by the project in developing social\n            safety nets, ensured social protection, and a sustainable\n            likelihood. Several lessons are drawn from the project,\n            first, that project management, in the context of weak\n            institutional capacity, requires continuous technical\n            support, particularly in the early stages of the project,\n            while management continuity, provides the stability for\n            implementation, in line with appropriate project design.\n            Conflicting rules, and regulations on the release of\n            Government funding led to delays in fund transfers, thus,\n            release procedures should be specified early, during\n            appraisal, timing the Government's budget approval, to\n            project initiation, preventing lack of funds. Furthermore,\n            when financing of social programs becomes almost fiscally\n            independent from budgetary transfers, payroll tax rates may\n            be very high, risking distortions in the labor market, and\n            slowing economic growth. Instead, social programs design\n            should incorporate aspects of equity, and affordability, and\n            social policies should be consistent to the country's\n            institutional capacity. Thus, training of staff, responsible\n            of social programs becomes paramount."}, "docdt": "2000-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
