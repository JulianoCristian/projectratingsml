ScrsonaXL         Government of AlbanLa
moaL              SDR 3.9 mllion (US$S.5 million equivalent)
mU3EU            Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity
Zatino           The proposed Project will assist the Government's
iSt ?asan         efforts to reform its social protection systems so as to
alleviate the disruption resulting from the economic
transition, while at the same time conflguring those systems
to be compatible with a market-oriented economy. SpecifLc
project objectives are to: (a) consolidate fundamental
reform of social insurance and social assistance program
through policy development; (b) strengthen inotitutions
responsLble for planning and management of cash benefltsg
and (c) strengthen and develop training, research and
statistical institutions to support social policy formation
and implementation.
Zxaisec           The Project will comprise two components:
(a)   Social Insurance Refo   .  The first component will
support the Social Insurance Institute (sIX) in:
(i) establishing a Soclal Insurance Fund, through policy
development to implemont a new umbrella Social Insurance
Law, and through development of actuarlal methods to assess
contributions needs for the Fund; ($$) developing new
systems for collectlon of individual contributlons,
monitoring and collection of debt, control of collection
fraud, determlnation and payment of beneflts, and control of
recipient fraud and abuse; (iLi) developing an automated
Social Insurance Register to serve as the basle for
determining eligibilty; and (iv) strengthening the SIl
organLzational structure, including staff training and the
establishment of a Project Coordination Unit.
(b)   Social Assistance Develotment. The second component
will support the Ministry of Labor, social Protection,
NmigratLon and Ex-Politically Persecuted People (MOLSP) nin
(i) developing policies for a new social assistance scheme
(to be based on adhia ekonomike, an existing community-
managed program for the neediest), and defining the
appropriate inotitutional framework for program
admiaLstration; (LL) strengthening the capacity of the
LnstitutLons (MOLSP, local government and the UnLversity of



Tirana) to mnage nd implemnt the soial assistance
progami and (Lii) developing a statistical databae to
sonLtor socLal chang.
UmmZLtss.        The Proct's major benefits will be to strengthen the
social safety net by improving the structure end financial
viabilLty of the soclal insurance and social assistance
scheme. The Ptoject will contribute to reducing the fiscal
drain from the social insurance system through the
devlopent of wmoe efficient systems.  xt will strengthen
the institutional capacity of the social insurance system
through support to policy development, planning, anagement
and evaluation. It will also improve the efficiency,
effectiveness and quality of client services through
modernization of the administrative infrastructure.
81,mkuz.          The major risks includes (i) the time lag and coordination
difficulties involvd in creating institutional capacity at
lower lvels of administration, both in soclal insurance and
social assistance; (Li) the rapidly rising number of people
with no source of incom due to the expiration of
unemployment benfits which could exceed the capabilities of
local social assistance administration, thereby undermining
efforts at better targetings and (Lii) potential conflicts
of interest within central government and between central
and local government organizations. Uxtensive technical
assistance will be provided to strengthen the project
management capacity of the institutions involved, assist in
the detailed design of strategic systems plans, and enhance
project implementation. The mid-term review process could
lead to a rethinking of project costs and activities,
especially those concerning MOLSP and SX. Significant
efforts will be made to improve external donor coordination
and internal division of labor among various government
agc ies.

1.1     Albania began the transition from an extreme form of command economy
towards a markt economy in 1991. from a much more fragilo economic base and
wlth a lese developed social safety net than the other reforming countries of
Central and Eastern Europe. The political transition took plac. with a higher
level of tension, violnce and a greater dislocation of social and economic
instit- ions and people thn elsewhere in the region.,1
1.2      Due to very low levels of income (US$425 and US$250 por capita in
1991 and 1992)1' and an extremely egalitarian incomes distribution, unusually
large sections of the population became vulnerable to the dramatic compression
of real incomes which took place in 1991 and 1992.
'. 5 rlaou
1 3      In the period 1990-92, state enterprises had virtually ceased to
function due to lack of raw materials, spare parts and the breakdown of
comand lines. CDP has declined by 45 percent over 1990-92. Abolition of
obligatory guaranteed payments to idle workers (sheltered wages) in July 1992
made labor allocation in enterprises more flexible. However, it also
unleashed a process which created unemployment of close to one-third of the
labor force, wlth more thn half of the State-Owned Enterprise (803) labor
force dismissed. It also set the schedule for increasing pressure on social
assistance by July - September 1993 when unemployment benefits will expire.
1.4     Against this backdrop, the social safety net has an especially
important role in Albania in inreasing confidence in democratic institutions
and maintaining a social conensus for a particularly difficult economic
transition. From an immediate-term and medium-term perspective, the
establishment of a sustainable and carefully designed social safety net
provides the only hope that the social fabric of the nation will not break
down and that massive deterioration in human resources will not occur.

1 S      Insuring universal *ocl l protection was among the central objectives
of Albania's old socialLst regime. Ironically, the key ingredients of social
policy under that system - guaranteed employment, sheltered wages, subsidized
prices on basic conamer goods, generous social insurance provisions - were
also the major contributors to economic stagnation and fiscal imbalance. The
transition to a market-oriented systm has meant eliminating theos untenable
measures. This process has created large-scale social instability and
seriously threatens the welfare of the unemployed, the unemployable, and those
at the margins of productive activity. Some of these social costs of
transition are unavoidable and are expected to diminish as economic otability
returns. In the meantime, a new social safety netl1 containing the necessary
incentives to productive behavior and which is consistent with the country's
economic capacity must be constructed and carefully targeted to the most
vulnerable groups.
1.6      The most pressing social problems at present are related tot  (a) the
drastic increase in prices following price liberalization and the ensuing fall
of real wages; (b) the emergence and growth of open unemployment following the
removal of employment guarantees and sheltered wage., the imposition c harder
budget constraints on public enterprises, and the privatization of
agricultural land and industrial enterprises; and (c) the surge in the number
of those with expired unemployment benefits still without a job or other
source of income. Initially, the Government introduced a limited increase in
the wages of civil servants to compensate for increases in the price of a
basket of five essential commodities. in addition, a wages policy governing
public enterprises has allowed similar increases if the enterprise's financial
situation permits. The Government has also introduced an unemployment
compensation scheme to protect those affected by economic restructuring.
1.7      To complement contribution or work-history dependent social insuranc
benefits (pensions, sickness and disability benefits, unemployment
compensation) and to catch those falling through this first layer of
protection, the Government has also introduced a variety of state-financed
social asaistanc measures targeted to specific social or economic groups
(residents of rural areas, farmers with small pieces of land, ex-political
prisoners, unemployed university graduates, orphans, etc.). Subject to
intense political lobbying, and continuously at risk of being expanded in a
disjointed way, the resulting package of assistance programs has become
unwieldy and unsustainably expensive.
1.8      With the growing numbers of people at risk and mounting pressure to
compensate for the economic losses of different segments of the population,
the burden of social protection weighs heavily at a time when Government

1.9      There are at present two basLc soclal insurance sehemes operatlig Ln

a.   the State SocLal Insurance for Emnioved Porons V/ which provLdes
beneflts in respect oft

- maternity benefits (maternity leave allowances);
- grants in respect of childblrth and c9ath;
- pensions for aged, dLsabled persons and survivors; and
- allowances for persons disabled sance blrth.

- pensions for aged, dlsabled and survlvLng persons.
FollowLng the dLssolutLon of agrLcultural cooperatives ln October 1991,
transitional arrangements for the CFSI have remalned unclear. In effect,
prlvate farmers have stopped payLag contributions but continue to claim
benefits under the system. The new Soclal Insurance Act #7703, dated May 11,
1993, will provide a flat rate pension for contributing self-employed pensLons
in agriculture. The Act leaves the contrlbutlon rate at the dlscretlon of the
Councll of MLnisters. At present, former cooperatlve members are waived from
contributLons for a period of two years.

1.10    Law #7521, 'focial Assistance for Persons Who Became Unmploye Due
to the Zmplementatiom of Econcmio Reforms", in force since January 1992 and
lts amendmet #7579, of July 1992, are principally       WM=  _am=
legislation of the Lnsuranoe typ, with employer, but not employe,
contributions, and containing a number of provisions for social assistance.t1
The unemployment ompensation provisions are restrictive, applicable only to
those unemployed due to restructuring of enterprises and of the economy. The
ocial assistance elements ln the law include non-contributory oupport for
certain merit categories: ex-political prisoners and persecuted people,
military personnel, discharged soldiers, agricultural specialists, seasonal
workers, and univergity graduates with no employment history. Unemployment
benefits, lIke the rest of the social insurance benefits, are based on the
indivldual's past wages (and in theory are linked to pact contributions).
However, upper and lower limits are tied to the minimum wage, as are the
social assistance awards, creating undue (and politically sensitive) upward
pressure on the minimum wage. Act #7703 dated May 11, 1993, establiahes a new
social insurance regime which includes an unemployment insurance branch, from
October 1, 1993, when the Act will enter into force.
1.11      Pure Social AssistMag2e  Cash benefits for rural households were
also granteds (a) as part of the Land Reform Act No. 413 with income support
based on soil quality and per capita size of the farm in hilly and mountainous
areas; nd (b) as compensation for the lncrease in the price of wheat,
differentiated for mowutain, hilly and plain areas. The latter was eliminated
in October 1992. Other social assistance benefits included ndam5 .konomike
(economlc aid), a means-tested benefit for families with no income, originally
sanctioned by Directive No.3 of 1968. This benefit is paid from central budget
grants distributed to and by local municipalities. The n-w Social Assistance
Act which was adopted by Parliament on May 19, 1993, creates a unified
framework for social assistance.

1.12    The social insurance scheme, in principle, is financed through
employers contributions which increased from 11 percent of total payroll in
1975 to 21 percent in 1991. Contributions were reduced to 19 percent in
December 1991 in exchange for transferring full responsibility for sickness
benefits to enterprises. Rarlier increases in contributions haM been mad
necessary by the unusual generosity of the scheme On the benefits side and by
the aging of the population. While the number of pensLoners increased by 130
percent during the period 1980 to 1991 (from 163,000 to 376,000) the number of
insured personstV increased by only 24.5 percent in the same period (from
1,082,000 to 1,347,000). In 1992 the number of pensioners rose to 443,000,
while the number of contributors dropped to 1,180,000 due to increasing
unemployment.

1.13     The schem  is financed on a pay-au-you-go basis. Although originally
conceived to be self-financing, social insurance was fully financed through
contributions only up to 1957. Since then, State budget subsLdles have been
required, and peaked ln the mLd-298Os when State contrLbutions covered around
3S percent of expenditures. In 1991, expenditures totalled 1.981 billion
leks# of which 27.6 prcent was financed through budgetary subsidies.
However, increases in benefit levels as well a the rapid inerease in the
number of pensioners raised expenditures to an estimated 3.9 bllion l-ks
(compensations included) in 1992, at a time when contributlons were declining
sharply due to declinLng employment and loss of contributLons from the
peasantry of the abolished cooperatlves, who constituted 42 percent of the
lneured ln 1991. As a consequence, State fLnancLng increased to more than
half of the sc¢Lal lnsurance expendltures ln 1992, even wlthout includLng the
unemployment beneflt scheme. The Lncreasing reliance of the social insurance
system on Government budget financing is an obvious weakness of the current
system. Since the present legislatLon wlll change only from October 1, 1993,
contributions will fall behind expenditures even further ln 1993 as they dld
ln 1992 (see Annex B).
1.14     SimLlarly to previous aocial insurance programs, the unemployment
compensation program introduced in January 1992 is conceived as a separate
contributory Lasurance scheme, wlth employers payLig a further 6 percent "taxw
on payroll. Bven more so than other programs, the unemployment compensation
scheme is dependent on general revenues to fill a large defLeLt that was
created by hlgh levels of unemployment startlng ln the second half of 1992.
1.15     As in other centrally planned economies, AlbanLa' s almost universal
social Lnsurance scheme was the cornerstone of social policy. The soclal
insurance system was set up to carry out most social assistance functlons, and
hardly any non-contributory soclal assistance benefits and provisions beyond
social Lnsurance were available, except speclflc health-related servlces,
usually in the form of State-operated LnstLtutionalized care for categories
defined as "burdens" on the worklng population, such as handLcapped children
or adults. Poverty was ideologically denied and lts manifestatlons were
conceived in the context of undeserving poor", or exceptional personal
cLrcumstances. The unavoidable sacrifices associated wlth the traraitLon to a
market economy - the rapld contractlon of real wages, the emergence of long-
term unemployment and a surge ln the number of vulnerable groups - have been
changing this picture substantially. However, targeted social assistance
programs remained modest, barely exceeding 0.5 percent of the GDP in 1992 when
major prLce rises and economlc dlslocatlons took place (although price
subsLdLes increased from 1.8 percent of ODP to 3.5 percent between 1990 and
1992). In view of likely further deterioratLon and inevitable tlghtenLng of
soclal insurance provisions, the need for non-contributory social assistance
wlll contlnue to Lncrease ln 1993 and beyond. Present budgetary and
adminLstrative structures are not able to accommodate the substantially higher
claim on social asslstance beneflts whlch is likely to occur in 1993 when a
large number of former unemployment compensation beneficiaries wlll fall out
of the scheme and wlll apply for social assistanoe.

1.17     Prevlously, all socLal insurance contributions wore paid directly by
State establishments to the State Bank (through the SavLngs Dank's network).
As a result of the mergence of growLag numbers of private enterprlses, the
S11 plans to introduce a system for collecting contributions from private
entrepreneurs. However, they lack the staff and experience to collect
contributlons efficiently and to monitor debts. It is symptomatlc that the
private sector ln 1992 paid ln only 42 milllon leks in contributions Lnstead
of the expected 100 million (ln 1990 and 1991, it paid 1 and 2 million,
respectively). Effective enforcement of contribution from the emergLag
prlvate sector (including private landowners) as well as the restructured
public enterprise sector will be decLsive factors in the success of the soclal
innurance reform.
1 18     No indlvldual contribution records are kept by the SIX. An
ndiLvidual flle is opened, and a number assigned at the local social insurance
offLe, only when a worker begin, qualifying for a pension. As was the case

gainful activities ln Albania or even work abroad. For thLi reason,
responsibility for unemployment benefit payment was officially transferred
from enterprises to local labor offices on January 22, 1993. Thus labor

1.20    The social insurance scheme covers all economically active persons.
Modelled after the Soviet system, lts beneflt provlilons are characterized by
generous eligLbilLty condLtions, lncluding low pensionable ages, preferential
categories of work and preferential treatment for women, and generous benefit
forulas wlth relatlvely hlgh replacement rates, especlally as regards
short-term beneflts. Thus Albania developed, at a very low level of Lncome, a
very generous, unlversal social Lnourance system prior to having experlence
wLth a less expensive and more approprlate social assistance system. Except
durLag the early years of socialism, contributions have never covered
expenditure. However, an excessive centralization of GDP in State budgets
(two-thirds of GDP), and full dlscretLon of the Party-State over those funds,
made it possible to finance thls prematurely unlversal system of soclal
insurance.   In the absence of a genulne social assistance system, especlally
prior to the adoptlon of Law # 7521 for unemployment assLstance ln 1991,
practLcally all social protection was carrled out through social Lnsurance
provLsions. Wlth LncreasLng economic problems, it has not been possible to
maintain the real value of beneflts. As a consequence, the soclal insurance
system is providLng too low pensions to too many people at a very hlgh cost.
tey issues relating to the major benefits financed through the social
insurance scheme are reviewed briefly ln the followlng sectlons.
1.21    Old-Aae PensLons. Old-age penslons are the most expenslve beneflt
(currently pensions account for 83 percent of all social insurance payments or
92 percent lf food compensatlons paid on pensions are included) and requLre
signlfLcant tlghtenLng of eligibillty condltions (see Annex B, Table 2).
Normal retlrement is at age 60 for men and 55 for women, lower than in most
Western European countrles * Generous ellgiblilty requLrements for earlier
retirement for women and certain categorLes of workers, and short waiting
perlods for eliglbillty to full penslon, ralse the benefit period relative to
periods of actual contrLbutlon. There is also preferentlal treatment of
certaln categorLes for merLt, specLal servLce, or arduous and hazardous work.
Consequently, the effectlve average retLrement age is 52 for women and 58 for
men. ProvLsLons allowing for early retirement ln condltlons of unemployment
are lncreasingly beLng used. Whereas in 1991, seven percent of new
retirements fell lnto thLs category, ln 1992, the number rose to 38 percent.
Glven that pensions are hlgher than unemployment beneflts and have unllmlted
benefLt periods, thli approach to protectLon of the unemployed is expensLve,
and will carry budgetary repercussLons for many years.
1.22     on the other hand, lack of provlsion for regular lndexing of mLnimum
pensions increases the numbers of pensioners at rlsk of poverty. Although



minimum pensions have been increased three times in the last two yearSW,
they have been set arbitrarily for laok of cost-of-livLng statistlcs and
without application of actuarlal methods. A more systematlc provision for
lndexLng needs to be bullt Lnto the law.
1.23     UnIgeiom    aelit.  The unemployment benefit, only recently
introduced, neds to be monLtored closely to ensure a balance between the
objectlve of providing socLal protectlon ln a perlod of widespread
unemployment where families may have few alternative income sources, and the
objectlve of stLmulatLng re-employment. Among the features to be changed are
coverage of rlsks other than the defined one (loss of job resultLng directly
from economic restructuring), and reduclng the replacement rate (70 percent of
average of last year's wage for the flrst six months; 60 percent for the next
six months), wlth the benefit made flat-rate accordlng to the new Social
Insurance Act, which will enter into force on October 1, 1993. Paying a flat-
rate unemployment beneflt for a fixed period of one year is important, in view
of budgetary implicatLons of higher benefits or longer duratlon and of the
overwhelmLng administratlve needs of an alternative complex system wlth
variable beneflts levels and duration.
Other Benefits
(i)    Dieability Pensions. The number of disabillty (invalidity) pensions
is increasing, which is not necesearily the result of increased
dlsabllity among the populatlon, but possLbly relates to the
employment situatLon: disability pensions are higher and last longer
than unemployment beneflts. Eligibllity is set generously and
definltions allow for benevolent implementation. There is also
probable abuse through the medical xpert commlttees or at least some
key persons in the declsion-making process. Under the present
system, employment injury coverage is combined wlth general
disability pensLon wlth lts flat contribution rate desplte obvious
differences in risk of injury on-the-job in different employment
settings (by sector or by individual employer). ThLs eliminates any
incentives for employers to undertake accident prevention measures.
MakLng employment injury a separate branch of soclal insurance, with
adequate contributions paid by employers, will increase motlvation
for implementing preventLon measures.
(ii)   Survlvor Pensions.  Pensions are offered to too many categories of
survlvors with overly generous conditlons. The new Soclal Insurance
Act will limlt ellgibility only to dependents, dLeabled and aged, who
are close relatives and shared household at the time of death and/or
were entitled to alimony support under the civll law.
(LLL)  Slckness Benefit. The  sickness benefit Ls easily abused ln times of
mass layoffs, and there is little control built lnto the system. The
number of sLckness beneflts and thelr duratlon had been gradually

increasing. In order to reduce abuse, in 1992, it becam necessary
to introduce employers* liability for sick pay for an Laitlal 14
dayo, with social insurance picking up support beyond that period.
The new Social lnsurance Act will lntroduce better coordinated
contribution and benefit structures for short-torm benefitse,
including maternity leave and industrial accidents.
Structure of centribtion2 and IncentiLvs
1.24    Current contribution levels are inadequate. An employer's
contribution of 19 percent of payroll is unrealistic in view of expenditure
levels, and clearly needs to be raised. There are no contributions paid by
individuals, and hence little responsibility of the insured for the soundnes
of the scheme, nor incentive to maintain a cap on benefit levels.
1.25     Certain categories of workers (miners, women, policemen, soldiers,
turners and more than 400 other professions) are currently allowed earlier
retlrement and/or shorter contribution periods without any differentiation in
contributions. Thli is a major redistributive element of the social insurance
system whlch follows an ideologically motivated rationale no longer valid
under the conditions of political democracy and the transition to the market
economy. Still, these provisions are seen by many vocal groups as acquired
rights which they wish to preserve. In view of the huge cost of these
provisions and their highly inequitable nature, a new social contract needs to
be worked out in which these exceptions are eliminated or minimied. The new
Social Insurance Act (#7703 dated May 11, 1993) managed to curtail the
excesses of the former legislation but is still beoet with heavy compromises.
1.26    No actuarial analysis li applied in determining contributions or
benefits, either for the system as a whole or wlth respect to specific groups
or branches of social insurance. Social insurance contributions are
considered part of overall State revenues, and benefit payments are considered
part of overall budget expenditures. Contributions and benefits policies are
thus more closely related to overall revenue and expenditure policies than to
insurance considerations. Under this arrangement, the extent of state subsidy
to the system is not transparent. Collection and benefit delivery functions
are administered separately, and there is little built-in incentive to pursue
debt collection or curtail abuse.
Weak Aohib urtratlve InfrIatrcu
1.27    The social insurance administration was among the more effective
institutions under the old regime, managing up to 1S-20 percent of the State
budget and efficiently paying out benefits to a large number of pensioners and
other beneficiaries. They managed the scheme in the past because much of the
administration was transferred to employers.  Now, under the new arrangements,
the adminLstrative tasks formerly carried out by employers will have to be
performed by 811 offices. The expanding demands on the social insurance
system will require a correspondingly enhanced institutional capacity. The
growlng administrative burden of collecting contributions from private
entrepreneurs is already straining 8S1's local offices and making eligibility
verification more difficult. if, in addition, the system is to attaLn the



- 10 -
financial sustainability and autonomy required to tackle the problems
descrLbed in the preceding sections, a considerably stronger administratlve
and managerial lnfrastructure will be needed. Among the *pects that would
need strengthenLng ares
(i)    Canacity for PolLcy Development, At present, there exLsts a lack of
capaclty to develop soclal and financial pollcy related to the
settLng of benefLt and contributlon levels and ollgibilLty
requLrements. Development of such a capacity would require soclal
pollcy analysls and financial management sklls not presently
avaLlable ln the MOLSP and the SM,
(iL) Co1lectLon of ContrLbuiLons. Collectlon of contributions was le8s
problematlc in the past when there was direct control by State
instLtutions over financLal flows of all economic unlts ln the
country. But the emergence of prlvate enterprises, the growLng
autonomy of publlc enterprises, and the prlvatizatlon and parcelling
up of State farms and cooperatives all contribute to making
collectlon and control of abuse a major task. The SI1's understaffed
and technically ill-equipped local (district) administration is
unable to collect contrlbutlons from the growlng number of small
establLshments and self-employed persons and assure adequate payment
of benefits. The lack of relLable information about lndLvidual
contribution records and the lack of an efficlent way to Identify
indlvlduals makes it impossible to bring about a closer relation
between lndivldual eligibliLty and cash benefits.
(iii) Inteoration of Unemolovment Insurance AdmLnLatratLons. Considerable
cost savings could be obtaLned by integrating unemployment insurance
administration with other social lnsurance schemes, transferring this
responsibility from the NCLSP to the 8II over a longer period of
time. This would have the advantage of requirlng a single
administrative structure for collection and payment, rather than two.
Also, lt would allow the WOLSP to use lts own infrastructure for the
dellvery of more proactive services aimed at promoting employment.
If this were done, the SII would need to expand lts administrative
capacity to handle the requirements of the unemployment insurance
scheme.
(iv)  InformatLon Manaaemnt. Currently, all social Lnsurance transactions
are processed manually, and the prLnclpal instrument for recordlng
work history is the individual's *work book". Similarly to other
formerly socLalist countries, no record of contributions is kept as
this is assumed to be impliect in the individual's work record. This
may no longer be the case under conditions where lndividuals may pay
social inourance contrlbutions from different income sources. in
addition, payment records are kept at the dLstrict level, making
information transfer difficult if the individual leaves the distriet.



- 11 -
1.28    Due to the historical blae towards soclal lnsurance in social policy,
Albania has little experience in designing ad implementing social assLitance
interventions. The scant knowledge available about living etadard, incMes
and expenditure patterns to identify groups and indivLduals in ned prevents
effective targeting of assistance. Consequently, some socLal assistance
programs, like the wheat price compnsatlon scheme put briefly into place in
1992, were doomed to failure and had to be abandoned. Others, like the land-
related income support scheme, found better proxLes of Lndicators of econoic
status (e.g., location, siz*, quality of land and siLe of family supported by
it), but still entaLl substantLal leakages. in addition, the need for social
assistance targeted to the neediest segment of the populatlon is not obvious
to some vocal social groups whlch perceive social assistance as a threat to
their acqulred rights. It is important, therefore, that soclal assistance
reforms address the issue of targeting in a pragmatLc way and, at the same
time, be designed to secure the necessary soclal support.
1.29    The legislatlve framework of social assistance activities is weak and
prevents efflcient targeting of socLal assistance transfors. The three
existing schemes - assistance to unemployed; land based rural incom support;
and local economic aid (adimdekonealka) - have confused the insurance,
assistance and merit elements. Instead of focusing on tested needs of
families or indlviduals, they were bullt on loosely deflned proxies of need or
merit, thereby targetLng certain categories of people, often not the neediest.
1.30    AssiLtance to the unemployed is, in fact, a contributory social
insurance scheme with a number of classical social assistance elements, like
dependent supplements and eligiblilty for non-contributing categories like
former political prisoners, dismissed military personnel, agrLcultural
specialLsts released by the abolition of cooperatives, unLveraLty graduates
with no employment records, orphans, etc. Elevatlng these categories to the
level of unemployment boneflt diverts resources from socLal Lnourance and
Lncreases the overall costs of soclal assistance, slnce usually, ln other
countries, social assistance benefits are lower (and individually means-
tested) than contrlbutory social insurance provisions. According to the new
social assistance regime whieh is to be introduced on the ba si of the new
Soclal Assistance Act adopted by the Parliament On May 19, 1993, sme of these
categories will be covered by merLt ponsions (e.g., former polltlcal prlsoners
and persecuted people). Most others will be delinked from unamployment
benefits and will be subjected to a means-test.
1.31    A major flaw of the present legal framework is that there is no
soclal asslstance provision for those long-term unemployed whose unemployment
benefit has expired and who do not have Lncome to rely on. The number of
these people is projected to increase rapidly from les than 10,000 in January
1993 to more than 180,000 in August 1993. SeparatLon of social insurance,
merit and true social assestanc elements from each other is desirable not
only from the standpoint of social insurance but from social assistance as
well. The approval of separate soclal insurance and social assistance laws in

officlancy of both syste.

And famly size). The schem  has kept its maroeconomic costs low (at
0.5 percent of GDP in 1992). However, with agriculture shovLng signs of
recovery, thli nxble targeting may entail increasing leakages. Against thli
backdrop, it seems reasonable to reduce or morg this scheme with one which is
targeted more specLfLeally on the individual family or person (e.g., nSihm

1.33    The only classLcal social assistance benefit ln Albania Ls the local
welfare aid (xAdbue waiuai) apiLed to the  on-agricultural population. The
schme is still minuscule (its overall cost was slightly more than 0.1 percent
of the CDP in 1992) but has great potential for expansion. Flrst, this is the
only bnefit currently in place for which the long-term unemployed wlth
expired unemployment compensatlon can apply. Second, it already entails a
basLi man*-testLng element, delegated to the local level (Directive #1/1,
September S, 1992). However, the schee will como under increasing pressure
in 1993 as the numbers of long-term unemployed surge and therefore its
fLnancing and  administrative rr ngmnt may not be suffiLent.
Administrative procedures and the tent of the dliective for the schme are

social worker networks, a domestic NGO sectorlW and religious charity network
are all but lacking. The lack of experience in social administration hinders
the formation of social policLes at all levels.sU Furthermore, the absence
of ocial worke. a, which reduces the efficiency of targeting and delivery of
social assistance benefits, inevitably increases the costs of social policy
interventions. The weakness of domestic WOos prevents them from contributipg
substantially to the poverty alleviation effort and sharing the burden of the
stat soeial welfare actlvities. Also, concerted efforts by the main
international organizations currently active in Albania (UNDP, UNICEF, Red
Cross, EC/PEMR, Feed the Children, etc.) would be more efficient with the
support of domestic NOOs.
D. Goverment Reftr PPIAUM
1.36     Responding to the above issues, the Government is trying to
restructure and strengthen the social safety net and focus on bringing its
social policies in line with the requirements of a decentralized democratic
society and a transitLonal economy. It has abolished the system of sheltered
wages for idle workers, introduced contributions to support an unemployment
boenefit scheme, established an independent 81X, and increased financing for
social assistance benefits (ndanluawmiku).  The Government has worked out a
reform plan and a Policy Framework PaperI which clearly separated
contributory social lnsurance from non-contributory social assistance and
merit scheme. Subsequently, the Parliament enacted an up-to-date Social
Insurance Act (#7703 dated May 11, 1993) and a corresponding Social Assistance
Act (dated May 19, 1993).
1.37     With the election of a democratic Parliament in April 1992, the new
Vovernment declared its intention to introduce reform to reduce State
lnvolvement in social insurance, and increase the individuals' and employers,
responsibility for the financing of the benefits. With assistance from the
World Rank, the Government appointed a standing committee to coordinate the
U n iountiezs like the Czech Repubic. ugary and Pol*d with much highe" levels of Income ad less

process of social ln**ranc. reformW. The major polLcy objectives of the
Government codified in the new SoLal Insurance Act, ares
(L)   abolshLng privilegs of certain groups of insured, rethlnkLng the
criterla for eligibility and award of beneflts to improve targeting
and efficioncy of banefits delivery. This will be achieved by
Laoresing the effective retirement age, tightenLng disability and
survivors' conditions, introducing an Lnsurance-based, flat-rate
unemployast bnf ilt scheme, end blending other. short-term bensfits
into a comprehoenve system providing coverage of temporary
contlngencies with employers' liabliLty to bear tho cost of the
sLckness benefit for the flrst 14 days;
(11)  improving institutional capaclty of the social Lneuranco system to
dellver efficient servlces through reorganized and modernlzed
management and administration; and
(il)  minimizing and rationallzing reliance on the State budget for
financing the autonamous SP in order to achieve a balanced actuarial
system.
1.38    The new SocLal Insurance Act, whLch will implement these objectLves,
was drafted by a special multi-disciplinary committeo assisted by experts from
the World Bank, and was passed by the Parliament on May 11, 1993. ThLs law,
limLted only to the genral compulsory social insurance scheme, will enter
into force on October 1, 1993. it wlll
(i)   condltion beneflts upon payment of contributLons by eliminating non-
social insurance elements (such as early retirement pension, and
uneployment benefit to non-contributors)j by tlghtening ellgibilLty
condLtions of practlcally all benefits; and by introducing a two-tler
pensions system conaLstLng of (a) a mandatory basLe scheme provldLng
support as a sum of a flat rate component at manimum subsLtence and
a contribution-related ineremental component based on lndlvldual
records, and (b) optlonal private Lasurance schemes.
(LL)   create actuarial balance of the system over time and an immediate
substantial reductLon of social expendlture on social insurance from
State budget; introduce mployer-employee partLeLpation in financing
the system; and lncrease the total contributlon rate over several
years to 42.5 percent of payroll (flat rate with r spect to self-
employed);

1 39     In 1992, the Government realized that growLng poverty, a further drop
in budget revenues, the wasteful and inequitable exlsting Social AssLstance
Law (#7521 and #7579), the lack of institutional capacity, and the reform of
the social insurance system would necessitate a ref*rm of the social
assistance system as well. In July 1992, the Councll of Ministers approved
initiating legislative work. The new Social Assitance Act, which wa worked
out with World Bank assistance, focuses on redesignLng eligibilLty criteria to
improve targeting benefits to the most needy - i.e. the unemployable and the
poorest segments of the population. During the preparation of the Act, the
existing but under-utLlised means-tested social assistance benefit, nadm
*keaom, was reinforced through some additional financLng. The wasteful and
poorly targeted wheat prLce subsidy scheme was discontinued.
1.40     The Government understood that in order to adapt the scheme to the
requirements of a market conomy in transition, a remodeling of the social
benefit structure through improved targeting techniques was needed. The
social assistance reform and the new Social Assistance Act are based on an
improved and extended nadhnewkornmk which will strengthen means-testing at the
local level.

1.41     In view of increasing income differentiation, mainly due to unequal
access to remittances from family members working abroadW and the lack of
income taxation and effectlve monitorLng techniques, a local level
dLecretionary means-test wLth its inevitable trade-offs appeared as the most
offLcLent solution for targeting. The new Social Assistance Act introduces a
system of block grants. The amount granted to each local authorlty (urban
bashkiA and rural communes) li set accordLng to indicators such an the
population structure (age and size of famiLes), rate of unemployment, status
of health (mainly malnutritLon), and the dLitributLon of land. The local
authorltles are responsible for dLetrLbutLng thli aid, following guidelines
set by the MOLSP and the social Assietance Act. The maximum benefit was set
at 1410 leks (about VSS13) a month/per family of three ln June 1993.
Currently, thli program provLdes the only benefit that long-term unemployed
persons can apply for when their unemployment benefits expire. Th scheme li
not conflned to long-term unemployed. It provides a generalLzed income-
support of last resort for the needLest segments of the populatLon.
1.42    This program is still relatlvely small, with an allocatlon of only
nine percent of welfare expenditures. It requires a substantial institution-
building effort to develop the admlniLtratlve capacity requlred at the local
level and the correspondLng central Lnspection capacity. in order to respond
to the challenges. The MOLSP, with the support of the Project, is organLiing
intenslve courses to train benefit admLainstrators and social workers. The
MOLSP Li preparing to assume responsibility for varlous types of social
instltutlons servLng the handicapped, orphans, the elderly, etc. A
substantLal amount of foreign expertise is needed ln preparing 1(0W p for these
new tasks. The MOLSP does not have staff with the appr w priate skills and is
not likely to receive enough skilled staff from those inistrLes whlch
currently supervise these institutLons. In the meantime, a School of Social
Work has been establlshed at the UniveraLty of Tirana to train ocLal workers,
and a complex restructuring of social studies is under consideration. Under
the envLsioned new structure, a Faculty of Social Studies would emere with
the capacity to provide students with a solLd academic background for social
policy formation.
Suoumar of Reform Pronosals
1.43     By revising provLsions to create greater consistency among related
programs, realLgaing administrative arrangements, and reforming legislation,
the restructured social safety net developed by the Government will make a
clearer distinction among the three types of support programes (a) *oclal
&nswuranea, funded mainly through contributions and managed to the extent
possible according to strict insurance princlplest (b) socLal assistance,
funded through ear-marked contributions or general taxation and aimed at well-
defined poverty groupsi and (c) merit pensions reserved for preferential
categories such as war veterans and ex-polltlcal prisoners, for which no
matching con':ributLons are required and, therefore, for which the national

1.44     Albania is the poorest Zuropean country and the only one that
qualifies for mDA assistance. the international donor community has been
quick to respond to appeals for emergency  ssistane, but this cannot be
expected to continue for more than a short transitional period. ateanwhile,
pemanent support systems must be established. Social reform osut be
consistent with ongoing economic reforms, and income support systems must be
established which provide appropriate inceontives to productive employment and
critical protection to the vulnerable segmtent of the population against
poverty, while at the some time containing upward pressure on the Goverrment
budget.
1.45     AS has bee  the case with the Bank's previous involvemet in the
dovelopmnt of effective income support system  elswhere in the reion, the
issues invalve  with establishment and strengthening of tho   systems are
complex. The Danic Is Well-suited to support the proposed project initiatives
bcauos of the knowledge of sector isseu  which it ha gaind frm past
lending td sector work in othOr countries, as well as the technical expertise
which it can mobilize. The Bank and the Government agree that deeloping such



an incme support system is a long-term prosso. The proposed Technical
Assistance Project for SocLal Safety Het Development will support the
Governmnt'  first step in developng a mdertn, sustainable and all-Laclusive
incom  support system. The IDA Credit and ass"Lated polLey reforms wll be
critLcal to this process which has technLcal rcquirements that extend beyond
the resources now available through the internatLonal donor community (UNDP,
UNICP,F, SC/PBR, Red Cross, and other international organizations.)  The
socLal assstance component of the Project will help the Government to put
social assistance into a unLfied framework and thus improve its donor
coordlnation actlvitles.
1.46     The proposed Project li a poverty-related operatLon. The maln
objectlve of the soclal assistance component li to organlie a system of licome
support targeted to the most vulnerablo segments of the population. The
social Lasurance component contrLbutes to poverty reductlon by safeguardLng
the minimum beneflts (old age, maternity, sickness, etc.) of those ln the
soclal insurance scheme.
1.47     ThLs Project has been prepared anfl negotLated in tandem wlth the
Labor Market Development Project since the management of unemployment benefits
and lncoma support must be closely linked wlth the development of an effective
labor market. The proposed Project complements the World Bank's program to
assiat ln the social aspects of Albania' economlc transitLon, as reflected in
the Labor Mark)at Development (FY94), Rural Poverty Alleviation (FY93), Health

as well as ln carrying out operations to implement these polLies.
2 4      Under the new system, the administrative responsibilLties of the SIX
will be slgnlfLcantly enhanced, maLnly due tot (a) the increased Lportance
of its contributLons collectlon function; (b) the changing structure of the
economy which grants greater autonomy not only to prlvate enterprisea and
self-employed persons but also to public ones, and hnce increases the risk of
noncompliance with contributLon obllgatlonop (e) the new Governmont policy of
tying ellgibillty to indLvldual contributLon hlitory, coupled wlth a mor

bullt up from scratch and the latter wlll need to be streamlLned and adapted
to new polLiLes and regulations. The Project will help enhance these
operatons by introducing now and improved systeme for: (l) collectlon and
recordLng of contributions at the LidLvldual level; (ll) monLtoriag and
collectlon of debt, and control of collectlon frauds (LLL) determLiation nd
payment of benefiteg and (Lv) control of reciplnt fraud and abuse.
2 10    On the collection slde, procedures will be developed whereby
contributions for social insurance will be collected by employers at source.
For the self-employed, local social insurance agencies will collect
contributions through banks. The revenue thus collected will be transferred
to the central office to be divided eventually among the separate branches of
the SIP. The new social socurlty number system will form the basis for
processing and recordLng contributLons at the lndlvldual lvel. MonitorLng
and collectlon of debt wlIl be improved by the development of a computerlzed
ledger of debts and an arrears collectlon system; the latroductLon of
incentives and sanctions to encourage employers and the self-employed to meet
their contrlbution obllgatlons ln a tLimly mannerg and clearly deflned
mechanlms to enforce debt payment.
2 11    Determination and payment of benefits wll be improved by project
fLnancLng for the lntroductLon of computerLsed access to a common *llglbillty
database and full client history first at the central level and later at the
regional level as well. New methods for non-computerlzed storage of clLent
hlstory compatible wlth the computerlzed system (e.g., using index cards) will
be developed for use at local soclal insurance agencies. Fifty such outreach
offLces are evisaged, out of whlch 37 are already ln operation (eight are to
be elevated to the regional level). The Project will support the upgrading of

the existLig offices and the establishment of new ones by providing the
necessary hardwarGe *ottwar, eupWent, vehicles, and clvil works.
Strategies to control recipLent fraud and abuse (Luentives and anctions)
will also be devloped.
2.12 The redesign of colleotion and payment operations wlll be achievd by
identifying one or two regional offices and four or five local offices to be
used as pilot e nters. TechnLcal assistance will be provided to the Financlal
and Benotits Directorates of the 8Z to help design new regulations,
procedures, operation manuals and staff training materials and test these
materials in the pilot offices. Five or six trainers, possibly selected from
the staff of the pilot offices, will also be trained to carry out trainLng of
all other staff, once procedures have been developed and are ready to be
implemented ln other offices. In additLon, top Institute officials will be
provided with short-term fellowships for visits to other countries to observe
operations in similar institutLons abroad.
2.13     The Project will provide 11 months of fellowships, and technlcal
assistanco for training in collectlon and benefit delivery systems, as well an
funds for training of regional and local staff. The PCUs from both this
Project and the planned Labor Market Development Project will play an
important role in assLting the MOLSP and the SIX in designing and
implementing a detailed plan to facilitate the transfer of administratLon of
unemploymnt bonefit payment from labor offices to SI1 offlies over an
appropriate period of time. Auouanms were obtained at negotiations that a
aid-ter, review will examine the fea"ibillty and timetable of transferrin
responsibilities for unemployment benefit payment from local labor to SIX
offices. (in the meantime, labor offices will be assisted in administering
unemploymnt benfit payments by the proposed Labor Market Development
Project.)
2 14    InformatIon Mananmant nd AUtaMatlon 1081.4  iLIon i)  successful
implementation of the social Insurance reform will depend on how effectively
benefit payments can be linked with individual contributions. This implies
that the SIX and its local offices will need to have quick and easy access to
reliable lnfomation on lndividual contribution historles on which eligibility
can be determined and benefit awarded. Monitoring of contributions and the
reduction of fraud also requires effective information management. The
Project would improve social insurance administration by assistLng the
Government n eastablishing a Social Insurance Register (SIR) for personal
Identification and eligibillty recording, and in computerisiag the data
processing system of 8S1.
2.15     The SIR will serve as the basis for processing and recording most
transactions* using a unique social security number as the key to information
recording and retrieval. Uach indlvidual will be asslgned a social security
number coded to indicate date of birth, sex and place of birth, thereby
reducing the degree to which personal information will need to be provided at
each transaction, whle at the same time ensuring access to accurate
information for data processLng purposes. Th new identification system  wll
elimlnate overlappLng of numbers - a problem of the current system wher each
dlstrict follows its own numbering system - thus facilitating uninterrupted



- 23 -
reording of indivldual contrlbutLon history, rgardleos of place of work and
eventually replacing the system of LudLvldual vwork booksl. ThiL single
ocLal security nmbr could be used by the individual whn payLng
contributions, applying for beneits and receiviag paymnts. it could also
potentially be used for other purposes such as taxpayer identification,
eploymet services reLstration, health care, ae. The SIR databae will be
supported by direct 1likages with birth and death reisters. Iore volatile
data, such as address chges, will be capture  dlrectly frm clients during

traLning in social insurance policy and admlnLstration will be provided to top
manageMent to: (i) increase their exposur to international mngement
st ndards by, e.g., producing and introducLng operatLonal manuals for modern
soclal insurance system;g and (11) help establish efficient admLaistrative
procedures within and between units, as well as between national and regional
offices. Thls ssistance, in tho form of a senior pollcy advisor experienced
ln the management and contLnuing reform challenges of a modern soclal
insurance system, is already in progress, through funding under the Project
Preparation Facilty (PPF). Priority attention will be given to the new units
beLng created in the 8$ management structure - actuarial, financial planning,
information technology, soclal pollcy developmnt and general admlnistration
units - as well as to the elght regional offices, to compleent the technieal

fellowships for tralning in socLal insurance administratlon will also be
provided.
2.19     in additlon, the Project will provide assLitance for setting up a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the office of the Director General. During
the arly phases of implementation, project management consultants wl1l expose
the PCU to modern project management techniques: controlling critieal paths,

assistance to develop the needed capacitLes both in the 1M0L8 and ln local
governments. Partlcular attention is focussed on the block grant system for
ndiaJm *koncaike ln this resect. The responsLbility for this program will
rest with the X0LSP, workLag through local governments as executLng agencles.
The assumption is that local governments, beLng closer to the coamunity of
beneficiaries, will be in a better position to LdentLfy thou families most ln
need. The TM 0L, on the other hand, will set policies and determine budgetary
allocations ln the form of block grants, and perform an oversight function
during implementation through the establishment of a Social Assistance

essential office equipment and supplies. The MOLSP has already set up a
trainlng unit to facilltate the organization of the first intensive courses
for local government soclal adminlstrators and soclal workers. The activities
of training unlt are at present belng supported by the PPF and will be
continued under the Project upon effectlveness.
2.29     Finally, the Project will complement the overall donor asseltance to
the Universlty of Tirana to launch a program of teachlng and research ln the
following areas: (i) soclal work, to traln personnel ln the management of
social lnstltutions and treatment/care of vulnerable parts of the populatlon;
(ll) social pollcy, to traln experts to analyze, diseuss, prepare and

2.31     Poverty MonitorLia UB8SO.5 millons.  Albanla is presently undergoing
a rapld and dramatic process of soclal change, and a reliable statistical
database to monitor thli development does not exist. A statlstical database
is also necessary to strengthen the design of social programs, partliularly
those requirlng ldentification of poverty groups targeted by income support
and poverty reduction programs, and to determine criteria for central block
grant distributlon to local goverments for social assistance benefits. The
required statletlcal database should comprise three parts: Ci) the
development of poverty surveys; (11) short-term pllot studies on poverty and
labor force behavior to respond to the immediate needs for shaping social
asesstance polley and lay the ground for more regular surveys; and
(1ii) improvement of administrative statlstice.
2 32     The responsiblilty for carrying out household surveys rests with the
newly established National Institute of Statistics. The Institute has
received asesetance from VNDP/UNS0 to carry out pllot living condition surveys
and is in contact with several other donors for possible addltional
asesstance. Therefore, the Project w$il focus its resources on developing the
statistical capabilities of MOLSP. Xt is foreseen that MWL8P will contract

2.33     The Project will provide six months of technLcal assistance for the
development of a statistlcal database.  In addition, the Project will provide
funding for seven months of staff fellowships, an well as fundLng for training
of r*elnal mad local staff in survey techniques, including two months for a
training specialist and the necssary software. It will also provide a
general fund for carrying out similar short-term pilot studies on living

3.2        Basis of Cost Estimates.  Project costs were estimated as folLows:
(a)  Base Mts.  All project costs are based on February 1993 prices at
the official exchange rate of 104 leks per US dollar. Technical
assistance (TA) costs are derived from recent fees quoted for
comparative specialized services in Bank financed projects in Eastern
Europe and are estimated per month at US$20,000 for short-term
specialist services, and US$8,000 for overseas fellowships. The
monthly costs of TR include fees, relocation/recruitment costs,
housing and subsistence, and overheads. Equipment unit costs are
based on recent quotations from suppliers of equipment and software;
(iii) unit costs for refurbishing buildings (US$120-S150 per square
meter) were provided by the Albanian Institute of Building Technology
and confirmed by private building contractors; and (iv) staff salary
costs are based on current public service salary scales.
(b)  Continaencv Allowaaee          Project costs include a contingency for
unforeseen physical variations/additions (USSO.4 million) equal to 5
percent of the base cost of technical assistance and staff salaries,
and 10 percent for all other project item. Annual rates of foreign
price increases have been estimated at 3.1 percent annually during
project implementation. Base costs and contingencies have been
estimated only in US dollars because of the large differential
between the estimated annual foreign and local inflation rates.

(C)    hLZ      ann ma.w gWn . The forelgn exchange component was
estimated a  follows  (a) buildLng refurbLhment-40 percent;
(b) office furniture, equlpment, teaching materials and software-9S
percent; (c) technical assistance, fellowships and studls--100
percOnt  (d) recurrent costs for equipment operation and maintenance-
-S0 percent pe) local staff salaries--0 percent  and (f) building
maintenance-costs-lS percent. The resulting foreign exchange
cmponnt, including contingenci"s  is estimated at US$.4 million,
or about 86 percent of total project cost.
(d) Customs Duties and Taxes. Project costs do not Include any estimates
for customs duties and taxes. Tho Government has recently decided
not to impose taxes and duties on goods and services procured under
the Project. Supporting documentation to this respect was brought to
negotiations by the Government representatives.
Xe) Ineremntal Recurrent Costs. Only incremental recurrent costs are
included in the estimate of total project expenditure. They amount
to US$0.4 million, or 7 percent of total costs, including
Contingencies. The Government will assume US$0.3 million, or about
70 percent of incrmental recurrent costs. The recurrent costs will
mainly be non-salary expenditure items related to the annual
operation and maintenance of equipment and facLlities. The
incremental recurrent costs are not expected to cause an undue burden
on the SMI and the N4OLSP and are deemed to be sustainable.
S. Proiect Zlinanc
3.3      The proposed IDA Credit of US$S.S million would finance 89 percent of
total project cost, or 100 percent of the foreign exchange component and 19
percent of local costs. The Government would finance the balance of project
costs (USSO.7 million), or 81 percent of local costs. The project financing
plan is shown in Table 3.3 below.

C.  Prolect Manaaeent and XmWlmntation
3.4      The Project's two components are linked conceptually, but they will
be implemented by two separate entities - Sn and MOLSP, and will proceed
independently of each other. Primary responsibility for implementing the
first component (Social Insurance Reform) will be with 811. NOLSP will have
final accountability for the implementation of the second component (Social
Assistance Development). Specifically, project implementation
responsibilities will be ao follows:
(a) Social Xnsurance Reform Co_moonent. The SII will be the implementing
agency for this component. The Director General of SIX will be
assisted by a Project Coordination Unit (SII-PCU) which has been
established under his Office, as reflected in Annex C. rts function
is to coordinate the implementation of the four social insurance sub-
components by designated existing line units of SI1 (namely the
Financial Directorate, Social Policy Unit, Benefits Directorate, and
the Central Systems Department). The SI2-PCU has three key staff
already in place under PPF financing: the Project Manager carrying
out functions of project coordination, disbursements and records
management; a Procurement Officer; and an Accountant. The unit will
be supported by an expatriate senior management advisor experienced
in social insurance project management and an expatriate senior
policy advisor with broad experience in the policy aspects of social
insurance and social assistance policies and programs. The SII-PCU
will prepare a detailed project implementation schedule showing the
overall network of project activities, and use this tool to monitor
implementation performance and to allocate project resources. It
will also prepare a format for periodic reporting related to the
implementation schedule, summarizing current implementation status,
highlighting problems, issues and actions recommended, and setting
out performance targets for the next period. Funding for this
component will be provided on a grant basis through the Government
under a subsidiary agreement to be drawn up between MOP/MOLSP and
3II. Egecution of the Subsidiary Agreement on behalf of the Borrower
and Srl will be a condition of Proiect effectiveness.
(b)  Social Assistance Develonment ComDonent.  The MOLSP Directorate for
Social Assistance (DSA) will implement this component. The Director
of DSA will be assisted by the PCU which has been established in
MOLSP to coordinate activities under the proposed Labor Market
Development Project being processed in parallel to this operation.
This PCU (MOLSP-PCU) will consist of three staff members, including
the Project Manager, a Procurement Officer, and an Accountant, and
will be responsible for procurement, disbursements, and records
management. The MOLSP-PCU, in cooperation with DSA, will prepare a
detailed implementation schedule for this component and will use this
detailed schedule for monitoring performance and allocating
resources. The MOLSP-PCU will also coordinate other multilateral and
bilateral assistance in this sector. It will be responsible for
preparation of periodic progress reports to Government and IDA on the
status of implementation, as in para 3.4(a) above.

3.5      Traininc of the 3-1 MaaN=. and staff in project iiplemfntation,
procurement, finance, ete. has been inttiated. The Goverrmnt is conisidriAg
the posuibl4ity that agencie should enter into a contractual relationship
with those staff who will be receivlng training, prior to the training abroad
or in Albania. in order to obligate them to remain in or enter into public
service, upon completion of the training course.
3.6               gAonlona and E valuation. With few exceptions, the activities to be
Lntroduced under the Project and the methods to be applied will be nw to
Albania. Therefore, it will be exitlcal to establish early on a system to
monitor project activities and measure their outcome. Three types of
lndicators will be used to monitor and evaluate the Projeots (a) lngu
anigLatorg to measure whether project inputs such as technical assistance,
equipment, civll works, and staff training are delivered on time, and ar the
correct quantity and qualityl (b) out=ut indicators to measure whether and to
what extent services or products to be delivered such as training programs for
relevant staff and new social insurance/assistance legislation are actually
delivered, and to what extent the deignated Lnstitutions functionj and
(c) outcome indicators to measure the effectiveness of the products and
services delivered and the extent to which project objectives have actually
been attained. These latter would include timely and efficient payment of
benefits, smooth functioning of the regional and local offices, and increase
in number of social workers and administrators.
3 7      A list of iadicators for project monitoring and evaluation, a
description of how the necessary information will be gathered, and the
frequency with which they will be reported were discussed during appraisal and
finalized at negotiations. Aseuganegg were obtained that, by March 31 and
September 30 of each Project year, the PC0 will submit to IDA  aconsolidated
report of the status of project implementation based on the above indicators,
as well as other developments in the country. This report will indicate
whether: (a) the Project's original objectives remain validt (b) project
implementation is advancing sufficiently to justify its continued
implementation: and (a) any significant restructuring of the Project will be
necessary to improve its effectiveness.
3.8      Bank Lunervision.  Because this will be one of the two initial IDA
operations for the sector in Albania, the Project will require intensive
supervisLon, especially in the first year of implementation. About 20 staff
weeks of Bank supervision, more than the normal ten to twelve staff-weeks per
year of supervision resources, will be required during the first year of
implementation (Annex U). Wherever possible, staff will cover multiple
supervision tasks in the same missions for other social sector projects
considered for Bank finncing, including the Labor Market Development Project
which is scheduled for prosentation to the Board at the sae time as this
Project. A  urances were obtained at Negotiations that a mid-term review of
the Projectl progress will be carried out by the Bank and the Borrowor by
June 30, 1995.

estimated costs and procurement methods can be found in Annex J.
3.11       The two PCUs will be responsible for procurement.  One staff member
from each of the two PCUs will be trained in IDA procurement procedures both
by IDA staff, to the extent possible, and through participation in one of the
procurement seminars organized by the World Bank and the International Labor
Organization in Turin, Italy, from time to tlme. In additLon, an expatriate
senior management advLsor, currently boing flnanced under the PPF and to be

financed under the Credit, with experience in international procurment, is
al"ady in place, asslstLng the PCU staff ln procurement as vell as providing
on-the-job training to thm. Procurement wl3l be undertaken as deslrnbed in
the paragraphs below.
3.12              . Equipment to be procured under the Project will consist
of vehicles, offlie equipment, includlig computer hadware/software, photocopy
machines, fax machines, furniture, consumables for t;ese machines, tralning
materials and related supplies.  o the extent possible, these ltem  will be
grouped lnto major packages of oods, the contents of which could be typlcally
suppIled by one supplier. quipment contracts, whlch aro estimatod to cost
US$100,000 or mor equivalent per contract, will be procured following
Lnternatlonal competltive bldding (ICE) procedures ln accordance with the
UGuldelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit*, May 1992.
Vehicles and offlee equipment and materials will be grouped into four major
ICE packages. Albanian manufacturers competing for bids under ICB will be
allowed a preferential margin of 1S percent or the prevalilng customs duty,
whichever Ls lower, over the CI? price of competing imports, subject to the
domestically manufactured goods havlng at least 20 percent of domestlc value
added. Equipment procurment though 1CB will account for approximately
75 percent of the total value of equlpment requirements. The remalnlng
25 percent of the equipment ltems will be suitable for procurement methods
other than ICB.
3.13   bnternational Shonina and Dr   Contractina baed on comparison of
at least three quotations obtained from at least three different eligible
countrles wlll be used for approximately ten packages of equipment whose
estimated value would be less than USS100,000 per contract, having an
aggregate value of US$300,000. Contracts for lntellectual property such as
books, technical journals, tralning materials, computer software, including
amnual upgrading and llcening arrangements, eastmated to cost about VS$60,000
aggregate, may be awarded following direct contracting or negotLations with
property/copyright owners.
3.14    Local Shonina. Local sundry items, not exceeding USSS,000 per
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$25,000 equivalent, could be purchased
on the basis of prudent local shopping, by compring prlese obtained from
thre independent suppliers, in accordance wlth local shopping procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
3.1S    CLlvl Works   IDA will finance 50 percent of the US$4a0,000 allocated
for civil works. The refurbishing/remodelling of the eight regional social
Lnsurance officos and construction and remodelling of 50 social Lnsurance
outreach offices will consist of small value dLspersed contracts ostimated to
cost between VS$8,000 and USS$S,000, totalling US$400,000. These contracts
are not expected to attract foreLgn bidders. Therefore, these contracts will
be awarded following local shopping procedures based on the comparison of
quotations obtained from at least three qualLfied local construction
companies. During appraisal, it was established that the number of civil work
contractors ln Albania is inereasing as a result of privatization of
Government-owned agencies and that the local shopping procedure will be
suitable for Albania.



- 36 -
3.16    'Technical ae.istance t7Ao     Technical assistance will consist of
specialized services Involving econasulting flrms and individual experts for 122
months grouped ln two TA packages and 38 staff-months for contracts wLth
indlviduals at a total cost of U8$2.7 mlllion. US$700,000 equivalent will be
allocated for training mad fellowships whlch will be procured both from
consulting firms and social lnsurance organizations abroad. The above-
mentioned TA/training and fellowships will be procured ln accordance with the
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Local training will consist of
training of local staff, both at headquarters and local offlces for the S1I
and MOLSP.
3.17     Incremental ftcurXet Costg.  IDA will finance 100 percent of foreign
exchange costs (totalling US$150,000), including equipment operation and
maintenance, etc., and materials and supplies for the PCU and central and
local social insurance offices. These items will be procured in accordance
with Bank guidelines. The Government will finance 100 percent of local costs
(US$300,000), including items such as staff salaries, travel/perdiem,
equipment and building maintenance, supplies, taxes, duties, and local labor.
FacLlltLes maintenance and staff salaries will be procured in accordance with
local procedures acceptable to IDA.
3 18     Contract Review. The knowledge in Albania of IDA procurement
procedures is limited. The staff of PCUs will be trained in these procedures
(para. 3.9). Meanwhile, in order to ensure compliance with IDA's Procurement
Guidelines, procurement documentation (i e , advertisement, bidding documents,
evaluation reports, contract awards, etc.) for all contracts to be awarded
through ICB wlll be subject to prior review by IDA. Furthermore, in order to
ensure that the staff of the PCOs understand the procurement procedures, the
first two international shopping packages will be subject to IDA's prior
review. Similarly, procurement documentation for consultant asslgnments for
trainLng and fellowships (Terms of Reference, letter of invLtation, evaluation
report, draft contract and draft negotiated contract) will be subject to IDA's
prior review, except for contracts below US$30,000, for which only TORs will
be subject to prior review. It is estimated that prior review will cover 95%
of the value of all contracts for equipment and technical assistance. The
remaining contracts will be subject to selectlve post-award revlews by IDA. A
detaLled list of procurement packages under the Project, as well as an
implementatLon schedule, are included as Annex G.
3.19     Procgrement Information to be Provided by the Borrower.  The PCUs
will promptly inform IDA of contract awards and procurement Lssues and will
include the followlng procurement lnformation ln perlodlc progress reports:
(i)   revised cost estimates for indlvidual contracts and the total
project, LncludLng best estimates of allowances for physical and

A. *emot
4.1      The Project's major benefits will be to strengthen the social safety
net by assisting the oovernment with the introduction of   (i) a contribution-
based and actuarially more balanced social insurance scheme; and Jii) a needs-
orlented, means-tested social assistance system which could accommodate thos
who fall out of social insurance provisions. The Project will strengthen the
institutional capacity of the social insurance and assistance systems through
support of critical developments in policy design, implementation, management
and evaluation.
4.2      On the social insurance side, the Project will improve financial
management of the SIP, and the collection and benefit delivery system. It
will introduce new information management methods and would improve central
and regional administration. By tightening eligibility conditions, the
Project will raise effective retirement age and cut waste in disability
benefits in order to help target these provisions. As a consequence, State
obligations in financing the deficit of the social insurance scheme will be
reduced substantially over the project life.
4.3      The Project will help to create a modern social assistance schme
with better targeted benefits and social welfare institutions which are all
but missing from Albania. This is critical in view of the planned changes in
the social insurance system which it will complement and the dire needs of
vulnerable social groups during the difficult transition to a market economy.
The Project will play a crucial role in policy and program development by
transferring skills and expertise from abroad and by supporting in.ensive
training of social administrators and workers. By supporting poverty
monitoring and research, the Project will increase the level of precision of
social policy decision-making and will mobilize social solidarity.
S. Risks
4.4      The major risks includes (i) the time lag involved in creating
institutional capacity at lower levels of administration both in social
lnourance and social assistance; (ii) potential conflicts of interest within
central government and between central and local government organs; and
(Lii) a rapidly rising number of people with no source of income due to the
expiration of unemployment benefits could exceed the capabilities of local
social assistance administration, thereby undermining efforts at better
targeting. A schedule for the transfer of responsibility for unemployment
benefit administration from MOLSP to the SIX has boen considered by the two
institutions, since an overwhelming number of unemployed could paralyze social
insurance offices. In addition, extensive technical assistance will be
provided by the Project to strengthen management capacity in the institutions
involved, to assist in the detailed design of strategic systems plans and to
enhance project implementation. Significant efforts will be made to improve
external donor coordination and internal division of labor among various
government agncies.

2.   Social insurance (even excluding unemployment compensation) constituted
the largest proportion of all social expenditures (7*9 percent of ODP) in
1992, followed by education (5 percent) and health (4.8 percent). Together
with the unemployment schem the share of social Lnsurance programs reachod
11 8 per cent of the GOP whlch was hlgher than educatlon and health combined
and as such is unprecedented ln internatlonal comparLson at Albania's level of
Lncome. (At the end of the 1970. expenditure on social securlty benefits was
15-17 percent of GDP ln developed countrLos, 14-1S in formerly soclallt
countrLes, 3.8 percent in AfriLa. 2 7 percent in AsLa and 4.2 percent ln Latln
America according to the TLO). The number of soclal insurance programs was 9
in 1992 whereas ln 1987 the average of soclal securLty programs (social
assistance lncluded) of the developed 0-24 countrLes was 5, the then centrally
planned countrles 4.44, and that of developing countries was 2.71.
3.    Pensions make up the bulk of social Lneurance expenditure (see Table 2).
