Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: a) highway contracting\n            authorities should be aware of road construction market\n            conditions, and to the extent possible let a level volume of\n            work in each year to avoid either flooding the market,\n            resulting in a high price level for contracted work, or a\n            shortage of work that will make it hard even for good\n            contractors to survive; (b) it is generally preferable to\n            let the civil works contractors be responsible for all of\n            the inputs required, in order to avoid divided\n            responsibility for quality and delivery; (c) care should be\n            taken to avoid restrictive bidding specifications that will\n            result in lack of effective competition; and (d) additions\n            to civil works contracts should be limited to a reasonable\n            percentage of the original cost; major additions should be\n            subject to economic analysis before deciding to proceed, and\n            should be put out for bid as separate contracts."}, "docdt": "1998-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
