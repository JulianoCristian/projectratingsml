Dear Sir:

            We wish to inform you that the Bank hereby agrees to
amend the Loan Agreement as follows:
            1.    Schedule 1 is amended as attached.  The existing
                  Schedule 1 should be deleted and Attachment 1 to
                  this letter substituted therefore.
            2.    Schedule 4.   Part C
                  Add the following new paragraph 3:
            "3.   Civil works agreed between the Bank and the
            Borrower, signed between April 1, 1990 and the date of
            this Agreement, may be procured under contracts awarded
            on the basis of competitive bidding, advertised locally,
            in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank."
            Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by

this purpose and returning the copy to the Bank.
