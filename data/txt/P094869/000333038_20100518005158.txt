                               PROJECT
                               P094869
                          CREDIT 42640-DOM1


Extension

1. The closing date of the Dominica ­ Growth and Social Protection Technical
   Assistance Project, Cr. 42640-DOM, P094869 would be extended from June 1, 2010
   to December 31, 2010.

2.      The objectives of the project are fully achievable. To date all planned activities
have been contracted and work has been completed for some components. Amongst the
achievements to date are the implementation of new system for Customs, draft
procurement legislation completed, the development of a national investment strategy
and action plan, the establishment of the National Regulatory Commission and the
drafting of alternative energy legislation, the design and implementation of a software
system for registering companies and public lands and a manpower needs assessment for
the public sector. The disbursement rate for the credit is currently 77%.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary because the project experienced delays in
contracting activities to support Component 1- Public Sector Reform and Component 4 ­
Improving Social Protection. One of the reasons for the delay in project implementation
was government's focus on the election, held on December 18, 2009. Prior to this, the
project lost the Project Coordinator and there were delays in hiring the new Coordinator.
These events had definite impact on the pace of execution of the project.

4.      Further, the Human Manpower Needs Assessment consultancy for Component 1
(with a targeted completion date by end of May) commenced work in November of last
year; however, the elections had a negative impact on the work. The recent re-
configuration of ministries and portfolios means that completed activities will need to be
reviewed, and planned activities reorganized. An additional 2-3 months will be needed to
complete implementation. The Change & Process Management consultancy to oversee
the development and deployment of change management methodologies and procedures
and guide the adoption process across the public service in technology implementation,
workforce/human resources transformations, and corporate policies commenced in
February. Proper implementation of this activity will take six months.

5.      The team has reviewed the implementation plan for the activities to be completed
within the extension period and finds it satisfactory.

6.        This will be the first extension of the project.

Reallocation of Proceeds

7.      The cost savings reallocation is less than 5% and is thus a Level II restructuring of
record. Proceeds for Dominica ­ Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance
Project, Cr. 42640-DOM, P094869 will be reallocated as follows:

   Category of Expenditure               Allocation               % of Financing

8.          The proposed reallocation is necessary because Consultant Services (category
2) needs additional funding that has now been made available due to positive balances in
the goods and services category. Savings were mainly achieved in establishing the
Regulatory Commission, as well as by combining the ToRs for the Development of the
National Investment Promotion and the Investment Action Plan. In addition, there were
exchange rate gains between the SDR and the USD from the 2006 (PAD) exchange rate.
These gains are for the Borrower's account and can be used for additional project
activities.

9.      These savings will be used to fund consultant services for sub-component 1.3-
Modernization of the Registry (which is implementing a software system for companies,
and a State Lands registry and website) and sub-component 3.2 - Drafting of Alternative
Energy Legislation. All of these activities are identified in the PAD. In addition, the
training budget for sub-component 1.4 - Strengthening of Fiduciary Capacity will be used
instead to launch a procurement legislation consultancy. This reallocation will increase
the allocation for category 2 by approximately $ 315,466 (USD equivalent).
