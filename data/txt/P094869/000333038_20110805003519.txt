1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Dominica went through an economic crisis in 2001-2002, when output contracted by
about 10 percent and poverty levels rose sharply. The Country Poverty Assessment
(CPA) conducted in 2002 found that 39 percent of the population was poor, while 15
percent were indigent, among the highest percentages in the Caribbean.

In mid-2003, the government adopted a two-stage adjustment strategy to foster
growth and ensure debt sustainability. The first stage focused on achieving
macroeconomic stability through fiscal adjustment and collaborative debt restructuring.
This effort was supported by an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and
the Bank’s Economic Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) in 2004. The program was
largely successful, as the overall central government balance was reduced from nearly 11
percent of GDP in 2000/01 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004, and public sector debt fell
from a peak of 130.8 percent of GDP in 2003 to 116.1 percent of GDP in 2004, following
a restructuring of Dominica’s official debt under the Paris Club framework.

The second stage of the adjustment strategy focused on key structural reforms to
establish the basis for private sector-led sustainable growth and poverty reduction.
This stage was part of the Government’s Medium-term Growth and Social Protection
Strategy (GSPS) for 2005/06-2009/10. The GSPS had four pillars: (i) Fiscal policy and
administrative reforms; (ii) Enhancing the investment climate for private enterprise
development; (iii) Sectoral strategies for growth; and (iv) poverty reduction and social
protection

The GSPS focused on invigorating private sector led growth and improving key
social services, including health and education to build human capital. It gave
special attention to vulnerable groups such as youth, which had unemployment rates of
about 40 percent. Thus, employment generation was essential for poverty reduction. That
called for increasing international competitiveness, improving export performance and
enhancing the attractiveness of the economy to investors. The latter required reducing
firms’ costs, improving the reliability of transportation, lowering the cost of energy and
increasing the productivity of the labor force. The Bank’s analytical work 1 and work by
other donors helped to fine tune the Government’s strategy and action plans.

The GSPS proposed a number of strategic policy actions to facilitate private sector
development and improve the environment for private enterprise, including (i)
accelerating implementation of its comprehensive Public Sector Reform Strategy (PSRS)
aimed at improving effectiveness of service delivery, enhancing accountability, and

Fiscal Sustainability and Improve Efficiency and Equity of Public Expenditures. June 2005.



                                                 1
streamlining regulations and procedures that may hinder private sector activities; (ii)
improving the judicial and land administration systems; (iii) implementing
recommendations emanating from a comprehensive analysis of Dominica’s investment
climate; and (iv) implementing policy and regulatory measures aimed at lowering costs of
transport, electricity, water and telecommunication.

Consequently, the Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project
(GSPTAP) focused on reforms in four strategic areas: (i) making the public sector
more efficient and effective; (ii) improving the investment climate; (iii) reforming the
regulatory framework for the energy sector; and (iv) improving social protection.

The GSPS had also become the focal point for donors’ support to Dominica. In
particular, the European Union (EU) allocated approximately US$12 million in grants for
budgetary support to Dominica, and decided to align and harmonize its tranche
disbursement conditions for this budgetary support with the Results Framework agreed
between the Government and the Bank for the GSPTAP. In addition, the EU provided
another US$580,000 in a grant for parallel co-financing of the technical assistance
operation (through a Bank administered Trust Fund).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the GSPTAP was to enhance the
Government's effectiveness to deliver public goods and services by strengthening the
institutional capacity of key agencies to facilitate Dominica's private sector
competitiveness and productivity and to provide targeted social assistance to reduce
poverty.

The Project Outcome Indicators listed in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were:

   (i) Increased capacity of the public sector to implement reforms;
   (ii) Better regulatory framework governing the electricity sector;
   (iii) Greater transparency and efficiency in public procurement;
   (iv) Reduction in the processing time at customs; and
   (v) Better targeting, planning and administration of social assistance programs.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO and Key Indicators were not formally revised. However, a Third Ordering
Restructuring designed to clarify the PDO and sharpen the indicators was approved by
Management and agreed with Government in May 2009. Both original and revised
indicators are described in Annex 2.




                                            2
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The PAD states that “the project will benefit Dominicans through: (i) enhanced
private sector competitiveness and productivity and improvement in employment
prospects resulting from private sector-led growth; (ii) improvement in the quality of
public goods and services offered by a more efficient public sector; (iii) more competitive
pricing of electricity as a result of a better regulated electricity sector; and (iv) better
targeting and efficient delivery of social protection programs. In particular, two groups
that were expected to benefit from the project were brokers and importers, and then
existing and potential beneficiaries of social protection programs.

1.5 Original Components

The project was comprised of the following components:

Component 1: Making the public sector more efficient and effective (48% of total
project costs - US$1,240,000)

This component provided technical assistance to the Government to implement key
elements of its public sector modernization strategy focused on streamlining the public
sector to increase the efficiency of service delivery while lowering costs. It aimed to
assist in strengthening control over public finances and increasing the transparency and
efficiency of public procurement. The sub-components included:

1.1 Strengthening of the Reform Management Unit (RMU). The RMU planned and
implemented the public sector reform program. The activities that were financed included
manpower needs assessments in targeted Ministries and Departments and mapping of the
change management process to guide their re-organization/restructuring. This sub-
component also supported the improvement of the technological capability of the unit.

1.2 Strengthening of Customs. Activities supported included: (i) implementation of a
detailed action plan for the Customs Modernization Program including training of
Custom’s staff; (ii) implementation of a risk management system for customs
inspections; and (iii) modernization and automation of ports and customs information and
payments systems, including the upgrade of ASYCUDA - the customs automated data
system.

1.3 Modernization of Registry. This sub-component financed the modernization of the
Registry through the full-scale computerization of Companies and Trade Marks section
of the Registry to allow for on-line business registrations and searches. The improvement
of the computer technology within the land titles section of the Registry was also
expected to reduce the turn-around time for registering properties.




                                             3
1.4 Strengthening of Fiduciary Capacity, including: (i) strengthening financial
management capacity within the Accountant General’s and Auditor General’s
departments with the introduction of various software programs, Cognos and Smart
Stream being utilized to account for GoCD expenditures and provide the necessary
reporting mechanisms in that regard; (ii) implementation of a Procurement Action Plan to
modernize the public sector procurement system; and (iii) taking measures to integrate,
where possible, into the pooled procurement initiative being piloted between Grenada and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines under the ongoing Grenada Public Sector Modernization
project.

Component 2: Improving the investment climate (10 percent of total project cost -
US$252,000)

This component aimed at strengthening the institutional and regulatory environment for
attracting investment to Dominica. Specifically, the activities under this component
sought to address deficiencies in the system of investment promotion as carried out by the
Dominica National Development Corporation (NDC), and prepare a National Investment
Strategy and an Action Plan to build a well-functioning investment promotion agency.

2.1 Development of a National Investment Strategy, to focus the limited public resources
in areas which support private sector development and where attracting foreign direct
investment (FDI) could contribute to the national objective of increasing private sector
led growth for poverty reduction.

2.2 Development and Implementation of a National Action Plan, including the
restructuring of the NDC charged with the mandate to implement the National Investment
Strategy. The restructuring of the NDC involved a split into two separate agencies; (i) an
investment promotion agency; and (ii) a Tourism Authority. To support implementation
of the Action Plan, this sub-component financed training of staff in relevant activities
(market intelligence, direct contacts with investors, services to investors, and after-care of
investors) as well as upgrading office and technical equipment, publication of
promotional material, development of an interactive website which will serve to promote
Dominica’s products and services to the wider regional and international frontiers and a
special software for access to foreign investors’ databases as well as subscription to
relevant international business information databases and services.

Component 3: Reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector (27 percent to
total project cost - US$695,000).

The objective of this component was to regulate the energy sector, including the
production and distribution of electricity to improve competitiveness. The specific sub-
components were:

3.1 Establishment of National Regulatory Commission. This support was to follow
passage of the Electricity Act, which would provide the legal basis for the establishment
and operations of an independent regulatory commission for the electricity sector. This



                                              4
sub-component financed the activities of the regulatory commission for the first 12
months covering office operational costs, staffing, training and technical assistance. The
expectation was that after the first year, the operations of the regulatory commission
would be fully financed from license fees, other fees and levies.

This component also involved the employment of a number of persons within the IRC
who provided important support throughout the implementation process.

An interactive website was also developed and launched for the IRC. This website
assisted in promoting to the public IRC products and services and also various policies
and guidelines under which the Institution operates.

It also envisaged that in the medium-to-longer term Dominica will benefit from the
regional electricity regulatory initiative, possibly resulting in further reduction of the
national cost of regulation.

3.2 Drafting of Alternative Energy Legislation, to provide the legal and regulatory
framework for the development of alternative energy technologies, including hydropower,
wind and geothermal energy.

Component 4: Improving social protection (9 percent of total project costs -
US$232,000)

The objective of this component was to strengthen the Government’s capacity to better
target, plan and administer social assistance programs for poor and vulnerable persons.
There were three sub-components as follows:

4.1 Beneficiary Selection System Modernization, including: (i) design and
implementation of a transparent and objective targeting mechanism for selection of
beneficiaries; (ii) development of a central beneficiary registry; and (iii) application of
information from recently developed poverty maps to better target community based,
school-feeding and short-term employment programs.

4.2 Institution Strengthening. Improving the administrative capacity to deliver social
assistance through: (i) development of program databases to track beneficiaries and
expenditures for the Education Trust Fund (ETF) and the School Feeding Program (SFP)
in the Ministry of Education and further work on database development for the Public
Assistance Program (PA) at the Ministry of Community Development; (ii) documentation
of policies and procedures for the PA and ETF; and (iii) establishing linkages and access
to the different databases to assist in policy decision making at the sector level.

4.3 Public Information Campaign. Design and implementation of a public information
campaign to inform the public about new approaches to the delivery of social safety net
programs (including the new approaches to targeting and registration of beneficiaries)
and about other social protection reforms.




                                            5
Component 5: Project Management (7 percent of total project costs - US$181,000).

This component financed the operation of the small Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
integrated within the Establishment, Personnel and Training Department and employing
permanent government staff and where necessary contract staff. More specifically, this
component financed the project coordinator, the cost of the annual project audits,
computers for the PCU as well as the costs of staff assigned to the project.

1.6 Revised Components

Components were not revised during the life of the project.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Outcome Indicators of the project were modified following the Mid-term
Review in December 2008. As described in the Request for Approval of the
Restructuring, dated May 1, 2009, “the purpose of this modification was to improve the
original outcome indicators that were somewhat vaguely delineated in the Supplemental
Letter of the Credit Agreement and the PAD”. This modification, however, was largely
a reorganization of what was originally in the PAD (see Implementation of M&E below).
Since neither the development objectives or outcome targets, nor the number and content
of components/sub-components nor the component costs, financing plan or the allocation
of credit proceeds were changed, it was deemed to be a Third Order Restructuring 2, not
requiring approval by the Board of Directors and thereby not a formal restructuring.

In May 2010, upon request by the Government dated January 29, 2010, the closing
date of the project was extended from June 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010. Shortly
thereafter, the closing date of the EU Co-financing Trust Fund and Grant for the
GSPTAP (TF092145) was extended retroactively and for a second time to August 31,
20103, and the Administrative Agreement was extended from June 20, 2010 to December
31, 2010.

The funding allocations among disbursement categories were modified several times.
In September 2008, the percentages of expenditures to be financed in categories 1, 2 and
3 were increased from 69%, 40% and 59% respectively to 100% to allow full usage of
the existing IDA allocation for all three categories (the percentages in categories 4 and 5
were originally 100%, so all categories became 100% financed).

At the same time, proceeds across categories were reallocated, in response to the
Government’s request dated August 8, 2008. The reasons for that reallocation were: (i)


2
  As per the guidelines governing the restructuring of investment projects at that time, which were
approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2006.

3
    The first extension from December 31, 2009 to February 28, 2010, was granted in December 2009.




                                                     6
changes in the procurement plan to use one consulting firm, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to implement all activities related to
customs reform; and (ii) additional resources had been obtained from other sources such
as the EU budget support contribution. As a result, Categories (1) Goods and (3)
Training were reduced to allow an increase in Category (2) Consultant Services (Table 1).

In May 2010, the proceeds across disbursement categories were reallocated again
(Table 1), to reflect what was happening on the ground. This reallocation allowed to pay
for the MIS consultancy which was above the budget allocated for this component, the
software which was developed for Private lands, the LAN for the Customs department,
and the drafting of legislation for alternative energy. The de-facto final allocation was
somewhat different, since the cost of various components exceeded their allocation for
reasons described below. Those extra costs were financed with savings in other
components and exchange rate gains.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project Development Objective (PDO) as well as the 5 original Project Outcome
Indicators covered most aspects of the operation, but they were general in nature.
Further, this operation could only partly be held accountable for meeting the PDO, since
other donors were actively pursuing the same general objective. Nevertheless, the PDO
and Project components addressed key priorities of the Government’s Growth and Social
Protection Strategy and the Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Project supported the
Government’s efforts to carry out reforms prescribed by those Strategies.

The scope of the GSPTAP, while responsive to the client demands, was overly broad
thus complicating the management and supervision of the project. That may be
difficult to avoid when working with a small country and preparing the one and only
operation in several years. For example, Component 2 – improving the investment
climate, achieved substantial results, but this area was also being supported by other
donors. In that respect, however, it should be recognized that at early stages of
preparation, interventions in labor market reform as well as involvement in the
agricultural sector were deliberately excluded from the operation, in spite of the fact that
the latter was an area which the authorities wanted included in the operation, reflecting
that a degree of selectivity was exercised by the team while attempting to remain
responsive to client demand. (Minutes of the Concept Note Review Meeting, March 3,
2006).

The GSPTAP furthered the two pillars of the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for the OECS sub-region, approved by the Executive Board in September 2005:
(i) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; and (ii) reducing vulnerability by
promoting greater social inclusion. Elements of the GSPTAP, however, could be
perceived as contradictory to a guiding principle of the CAS as the Project supported
establishment of a national regulatory commission (IRC) for electricity in Dominica,
while the CAS called for regional integration and coordination efforts in that area. It
should be noted, however, that the Government requested the inclusion of this component
within the framework of its agreement with the IMF, and that establishment of the IRC
was seen as a precursor to a regional regulatory authority.

The PAD points out that design of the GSPTAP drew from lessons learned from
previous operations in Dominica and elsewhere in the Caribbean. In particular,
implementation was managed by the Project Coordinating Unit who worked in close
collaboration with the Reform Management Unit which fell under the auspices of the
Personnel Services and Training Department, thereby building institutional capacity and
improving the likelihood of sustainability beyond the life of the Project. Also, the
management and monitoring of implementation by a high level Steering Committee and
the appointment of champions to head working groups for each component drew from
lessons from past experience. In practice, the effectiveness of those arrangements varied
across components. At the same time, the stated intention of addressing customs reform



                                             8
and restructuring of the Registry to show early visible results to build ownership of the
Program was not met because the time needed to implement those reforms was
underestimated. That suggests that the design of the project did not take fully into
account the tight capacity constraints in the country.

Risk assessment in the PAD was appropriate. The overall risk was rated as moderate,
ranging from high for exogenous shocks and delay in support from donor partners, to low
for the loss of political support. Most aspects were covered, and the mitigation measures
were straightforward. In addition, by engaging the EU in parallel financing (which
increased the size of the project by almost 40%), the Project leveraged available donor
grant financing, which was one of the mechanisms proposed in the CAS.

2.2 Implementation

The Project was off to a slow start. It took some time to identify and recruit the project
coordinator in Dominica, and there was a change of Task Manager (TM) at Headquarters
at an early stage of implementation and then again after restructuring. The Trust Fund
agreement with the EU was signed over one year after the Credit became effective, and it
required supplemental coordination efforts by both the Government and the Bank. For
example, the EU monitored progress based on Bank supervision missions, but late in the
life of the Project, the EU requested a different verification method relating to the private
land registry indicator.

The Project spread over a wide set of issues, while implementation capacity within
government was fairly limited. Thus, several elements of the program which appear
not to have been a top priority for the government, such as drafting alternative energy
legislation, were pushed back and were not completed by the closing date. Others, such
as procurement legislation, underwent various rounds of lengthy consultations, which
were not completed either. Implementation took longer than planned also because of the
length of time required for Cabinet and/or Parliamentary approval.

In addition, there were delays in procurement and contracting of consultants for
various components of the Project. In some cases, because of the small size of the
local market, it was not possible to obtain the minimum number of quotes required by
Bank procedures. Also, apparent misunderstandings among all involved led to protracted
negotiations with UNCTAD which delayed customs reform. On the other hand, once it
was launched, the reform of customs expanded and became a comprehensive institutional
change which could have far reaching benefits for international trade and economic
activity as a whole (see 3.2 below). Also, government officials pointed out that Bank
staff were responsive to their concerns and requests, and tried to address them
expeditiously.

As mentioned above, at the Mid-term Review in late 2008, the Outcome Indicators
were reorganized and rephrased in order to facilitate monitoring and supervision.
Also, as Table 1 shows, the allocation of proceeds among disbursement categories
changed dramatically over the life of the project. The latter resulted in part from



                                             9
increases in costs, due to the long time period between their estimation and the actual
spending, and to the introduction of the new 15% VAT in 2006.

Disbursement lags led to questions in internal discussions and memoranda on
whether the Satisfactory rating of the project was justified.                  Eventually,
disbursements picked up, but initial delays led to the extension of the closing date of the
project by 6 months to finalize activities. Nevertheless, several outcome indicators were
only partially achieved or not achieved by the revised date (Annex 2).

All in all, the 370 document entries in IRIS testify to the huge costs to the Bank of
preparing and supervising the GSPTAP. Government officials told the ICR mission
that it also required a huge effort on their side, and that in the future they would hesitate
to engage in a new project if it is for less than US$5 million. Since IDA allocations to
small countries are relatively small, the challenge for the Bank is to prepare fewer, larger
operations that are relatively simple and straightforward in design, which address a
reduced number of key priorities and leverage resources from other donors. Hopefully,
this will reduce the cost of management and supervision.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The design of the Results Framework was cumbersome. The PDO
was one long general sentence that covered everything. The Outcome Indicators were
general and non-measurable (e.g., “increased capacity of the public sector to implement
reforms” or “greater transparency and efficiency in public procurement”). Several
Intermediate Outcome indicators were also very general (e.g., “Reform Management Unit
planning, designing and implementing modernization plans”, or “Reduction in the used
of paper based customs declarations”). Only at the level of Arrangements for Results
Monitoring, which specified target values for years 1, 2 and 3 of the Project life, there
were numerical values that could be monitored. Then, however, the final target values
for the component of Social Protection asked for 100% compliance in three social
protection indicators, which was not realistic.

Implementation. In order to address the problems embedded in the Results
Framework, the team clarified the PDO and made the Outcome Indicators more
specific at the Mid-term Review. In fact, however, that was largely done by bringing
forward what was originally spelled out in the Arrangements for Results Monitoring into
the Results Framework. For example, “Reduction in the processing time at customs” was
replaced by “Reduction in the average time for customs clearance from seven days to one
day”, but the latter was already defined in the table of Intermediate Outcome Indicators
attached to the original Supplemental Letter and the PAD. As part of the restructuring,
the Outcome Indicator requiring the establishment of a “self-financed semi-autonomous”
agency for registry was taken out, after the authorities argued that it was not agreed with
them nor included in the Credit Agreement.

Utilization. Restructuring of the Results Framework helped in monitoring progress
of several outcome indicators. Although it did not eliminate all problems (such as the



                                             10
requirement for 100% compliance in social protection indicators), it was incorporated
into the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs). However, since the new
Results Framework drew from the table of Intermediate Indicators, several duplications
emerged. Moreover, the original Results Framework still needed to be monitored. As a
result, supervision missions and the ICR had a hard time identifying which outcome
indicators needed to be monitored to assess progress in the Program.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project triggered none of the Bank’s Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies.

In late 2009, financial management and procurement were downgraded to
Marginally Satisfactory due to delays in procurement processes and submission of the
audit report. Those problems were resolved shortly thereafter.

A procurement supervision mission visited Dominica three months after the closing
date, and found no major issue regarding procurement. The mission concluded that
procurement under the project had been carried out, in general, in compliance with
arrangements agreed in the project financing agreement. This was explained by the fact
that about 70% of contracts awarded were subject to Bank prior review. In addition to a
close follow-up, training in the area of Bank procurement procedures was provided to the
project team and to technical implementing agencies’ staff at a very early stage.
However, there were a number of delays that were attributed to: (i) the small size of the
economy limiting the number of bidders; (ii) the fact that coordination and procurement
functions were the responsibility of one person; and (iii) the departure of the first Project
Coordinator who attended the Bank procurement training. In addition, the project would
have benefitted from an early preparation and adoption of the operations manual and
procurement plan, as well as clear Terms of Reference for implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The integration of the PCU in the Reform Management Unit at the Ministry of
Finance is expected to help in completing the reforms which had not been finalized by
the closing date. Longer term sustainability, however, depends on continuous support by
the political level.

No follow up operation is considered at the moment.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the GSPTAP were and remain relevant for Dominica’s social and
economic development. If anything, the relevance of these objectives is accentuated by
the global financial crisis, which makes even more compelling for the country to achieve
higher levels of efficiency and international competitiveness.


                                             11
As it closed, the relevance of the Design and Implementation of the GSPTAP is
mixed. In retrospect, the choice of a Technical Assistance operation over a DPL was
warranted, both because of the small size of the operation as well as the need for capacity
building in Government and public agencies. However, trying to be responsive to the
Government’s priorities, the Project scope was too wide, taxing implementation capacity
in the country. For example, given support by other donors for improving the investment
climate for the private sector, it’s hard to assess what was the specific impact of the
GSPTAP in this area. Also, while the creation of the Independent Regulatory
Commission (IRC) was envisioned as a precursor to a regional regulatory authority which
is more cost efficient, its success in improving the regulatory environment in the
electricity sector reduced interest within Dominica towards the regional approach to
energy regulation, which was highlighted in the CAS and is now being pursued by a new
Bank operation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Despite delays and challenges faced during implementation, the operation made a
substantial contribution to improving the environment for private sector activity in
Dominica and set the basis for a more efficient system of social protection.
Commitment by the authorities and a close follow up by the Bank helped overcome the
slow start, delays in contracting of consultants, limited capacity of implementation, and
protracted approval processes by Cabinet and Parliament.

The project had four components: (i) Making the public sector more efficient and
effective; (ii) Improving the investment climate; (iii) Reforming the regulatory
framework for the energy sector; and (iv) Improving social protection. An assessment of
each of the components follows below:

Component 1- Making the public sector more efficient and effective: Moderately
Satisfactory. This component provided technical assistance to the Government to
implement key elements of its public sector modernization strategy focused on
streamlining the public sector to increase the efficiency of service delivery while
lowering costs. More specifically, it supported activities to improve human resources
management, improve and increase the transparency of auditing, modernize procurement,
restructure the Registry, and reform customs.

After wide consultation, a Human Resources Audit of Ministries and Departments
of the Public Service was completed. The audit included a satisfaction survey and a
review of personnel files of all established positions, followed by consultations with the
unions. On the succession plans for Ministries and Departments, the Reform
Management Unit (RMU)/Establishment, Personnel and Training Department took an
alternative approach in that rather than developing and launching time bound, fully
costed succession action plans, it developed a methodology (Tool Kit) for preparing
succession plans when required, and it identified key positions where those plans would
be applied. Due to the Parliamentary elections at end 2009, this activity was put on hold



                                            12
until after the new authorities took office. The final report was completed in October
2010, and Cabinet gave approval of the recommendations and action plan in April, 2011.

At the Auditor General office, the new auditing management systems were not fully
operational by the closing date. The office got the IDEA software in early 2010, but
staff was not able to complete training. The SMART Stream system was used for the
budget process, but it was not operational yet for auditing. Regarding the new
procurement legislation, consultations with key stakeholders initially scheduled to be
completed by March 2010 were still ongoing one year later, and the new legislation
prepared under the project was not timely finalized as agreed in the TORs discussed with
the Bank. This was due to the extended consultation process which was required and
corresponding delays in the drafting process. However, the procurement legislation is on
the agenda for the next sitting of Parliament scheduled for June 29, 2011. Among other
things, the new legislation would ensure that all contracts above EC$1 million are
awarded by competitive bidding. As of March 2011, most but not all contracts were
subject to competitive bidding, as per the matrix of Outcome Indicators.

Reform of the Registry is well under way, but not as spelled out in the original
Results Framework. As mentioned above, when the Framework was restructured after
the Mid-term Review, the notion of the Registry being “semi-autonomous” was taken
out. The Registry is part of the Government financial system and as such, it cannot be
“self financing” either, as all its revenues go to the Treasury and it is financed by the
budget. As it turns out, however, its revenues are substantial and could finance its
operations easily. The land registry is fully computerized, and the time it takes to register
property was reduced: at the time of the ICR mission, First Title registration was taking
60-90 days, compared to several years before the reform; Part of Land registration was
taking about 35 days, down from 3-6 months; and Direct Transfer was taking about 30
days, compared to 3 months before the reform. There is now a separate Registry for
companies, which also deals with patents and intellectual property. Companies can be
registered in one day. While newborn children are registered at the hospital, the Registry
in the Birth and Death section is not fully computerized. A business proposal for a
Secured Civil Registry and Certificate Issuing System has been approved by Cabinet in
June, 2011.

The reform of Customs had a slow start, but it achieved the targets of the Project,
and is already showing tangible results on the ground.4 Firstly, the upgrade from
ASYCUDA 2.7 to ASYCUDA World (AW) was completed and is fully operational.
That reform was fully endorsed by the President of the private brokers association, who
told the ICR mission that transactions costs of dealing with customs have been reduced
significantly, and thus doing business in the country became more profitable and
predictable. Further, the AW is user friendly and web based, and thus available 24/7.
Secondly, the process of achieving a paperless environment for customs transactions was


4
  The slow start was due to delays on contracting with UNCTAD as well as in the procurement of
equipment. In addition, the new Customs Act No. 20-2010 became effective only on December 1, 2010.



                                                13
well under way. Under the new system, the cargo manifest is an electronic document
fully integrated into the commercial declaration, which Customs receives electronically
even before cargo arrives to port. Hence, the electronic manifest has replaced completely
the outdated paper-based manifest (100 percent of reduction). In the case of paper
declarations, users need only one copy instead of four (75 percent of reduction). Thirdly,
the last target was virtually achieved, as the time for the clearance of goods was reduced
from 8.65 days in July 2010 when the new system was launched, to just over one day
(1.42 days on average in the last quarter of 2010, and 1.29 days on average in the first
quarter of 2011).5

Component 2 - Improving the Investment Climate: Satisfactory. This component
aimed at strengthening the institutional and regulatory environment for attracting
investment into Dominica. Specifically, the activities under this component sought to
address deficiencies in the existing system of investment promotion as carried out by the
Invest Dominica Authority (IDA) and prepare a National Investment Strategy and an
Action Plan to build a well-functioning investment promotion agency.

The objectives of this component were achieved, although not necessarily as a direct
outcome of the GSPTA. Other donors were active in this areas as well. In particular,
the Invest Dominica Authority was established in July 2007 under another project, and
analytical work on improving the environment for private investment was financed by
several donors. Preparation of the National Investment Strategy, however, was supported
by the GSPTAP, and the Strategy was approved by Cabinet in November 2010. The
Invest Dominica Authority started to implement the Action Plan shortly thereafter.

The Invest Dominica Authority has two units: (i) investment promotion; and (ii)
facilitation of services to investors. The second unit operates the one-stop-shop for
investors, which is now operational. In addition, the number of days to process
investment applications has been gradually reduced: proposals of up to EC$2 million are
reviewed by a sub-committee of Cabinet within 2 weeks, while proposals above that
amount are reviewed by Cabinet within 3 weeks.

Component 3 - Reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector:
Moderately Satisfactory. The objective of this component was to regulate the energy
sector including the production and distribution of electricity to improve competitiveness.
In particular, it supported establishment of a national Regulatory Commission, which
should be funded, staffed and fully functional; and drafting alternative energy legislation
and submitting it to Parliament for approval. The rationale behind this component was
that electricity tariffs in Dominica were among the highest in the Caribbean6 and they
undermined competitiveness.        During preparation, there was discussion on the


5
 The CATT report for Dominica of December 2010, indicator 114, shows that more than 50% of the
declarations took more than 24 hours to be released because it refers to the whole year 2010.

6
  Electricity tariffs are high largely because a small population is spread over a relatively large and rugged
terrain, coverage is 97 percent, and due to high fuel costs.


                                                      14
establishment of a regional regulatory commission, which was viewed as more cost
effective. The Government, however, insisted on a national commission, as per its
Growth and Social Protection Strategy Paper (April 2006).

The Independent Regulatory Commission (IRC) was established in late 2007 and
started to operate in July 2008 when its Executive Director was hired. The GSPTAP
financed its activities in the first year (several consultants were extended for another 3
months), but now it is being funded by Government. The guidelines of IRC policies are
in the web, and those include methods for dealing with unexpected tariff and other
regulatory issues. Authorities in Dominica are satisfied with the way in which the IRC
operates, and they intend to maintain it as the national regulatory agency notwithstanding
the Bank’s current initiative to promote regulation at the regional level, which should be
more cost effective. Apparently, the success of the IRC as a national regulatory
commission is also drawing attention in several neighboring islands.

A draft of alternative energy legislation has been circulated and it underwent several
revisions, but there was no final version when the ICR mission visited Dominica in
March 2011.7 The final revision is currently being undertaken at the Chambers of the
Attorney General for onward transmission to Parliament. Cabinet has to approve the
final draft before it is submitted to Parliament.

Component 4 - Improving social protection: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
objective of this component was to strengthen the Government’s capacity to better target,
plan and administer social assistance programs for poor and vulnerable persons. In
particular, the Project supported: (i) modernization and streamlining the systems for
beneficiary selection and registration: (ii) activities to strengthen the administrative
capacity to deliver social assistance; and (iii) design and implementation of a public
information campaign to inform citizens about new approaches to the delivery of safety
net programs.

While the rating of this component reflects the fact that most targets were not
achieved by the closing date, substantial progress was made in key elements of the
program (see below). Further, it should be recognized that: (a) this component had a
late start, as key consultancies started only in 2009; and (b) targets requiring 100%
identification of beneficiaries, 100% registration, and 100% of ETF, SFP and PA
beneficiaries and expenditures captured in the data base, were not realistic. In addition,
there were technical problems in developing the new information system, coordination
among relevant ministries was initially not smooth, and the process slowed down prior to
the elections at the end of that year.




7
 Several studies indicate that Dominica has potential for geothermal generation, which could supply all its
domestic demand and exports of about 15 MW to neighboring islands.



                                                    15
Notwithstanding these difficulties, the welfare system of Dominica is undergoing a
substantial change, both in terms of policy as well as implementation. At the policy
level, in January 2011, Cabinet approved means-testing as the target mechanism to be
used to identify beneficiaries, thereby increasing transparency and removing subjectivity
from this process, and the National Beneficiaries Information System (NBIS) was
launched shortly thereafter. Further, the new set-up establishes linkages between the
core programs in the safety net. In terms of implementation, social workers were trained
in the new targeting mechanism and potential beneficiaries completed application forms;
operations manuals for the ETF, PA and SFP were approved; and key monitoring
indicators were identified and a monitoring plan for the three programs was designed.
Incidentally, the Ministry of Education will not have a separate data base but it will rather
have access to the NBIS in areas that are relevant for its work. Finally, the public
information campaign has been prepared and a number of public relations activities have
already taken place.


3.3 Efficiency

The nature of this Technical Assistance Project did not allow for the calculation of
net present value or other financial variables. The US$2.6 million project was
expected to have only a minimal direct economic impact in the short term, and that seems
indeed to be the case. However, in the medium and longer term, the outcomes of the
Project are expected to contribute to Dominica’s economic and social development.
Better control and deployment of human resources within the civil service and lower
costs of operating the Registry are likely to save fiscal resources. Also, improvement in
quality and timing of audits as well as more transparent and efficient public procurement
would result in better value for money. Further, an improved environment for private
investment and better regulation of electricity are likely to contribute to economic growth.
In the longer term, development of geothermal generation capacity would lower domestic
energy costs and improve the balance of payments by reducing fuel imports and
exporting electricity to neighboring islands. In addition, the comprehensive reform in
customs could be a point of before and after in international trade and have a direct
impact on competitiveness and economic activity. In the social protection area, the new
beneficiary information system was still being put in place, but once it becomes
operational it would save administrative costs and enhance both the coverage and
efficiency of the social safety net.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The PDO and key associated outcome targets of the GSPTAP were largely achieved,
or are likely to be achieved relatively soon, notwithstanding a slow start and delays
during implementation. The reform process of the civil service was advanced by the
Program. The Registry of land and companies is working much better, and the upgrade
to ASYCUDA World has already had a major impact on efficiency at customs. The
Invest Dominica Authority is providing information and services to investors, and the
recently established IRC is perceived by both the authorities and the public as fulfilling a


                                             16
positive function in the electricity area. Delays were longer in the social protection
component, and targets were not achieved by the closing date. However, the technical
work on the new National Beneficiaries Information System (NBIS) has been completed,
Cabinet has approved means-testing as the targeting mechanism, and the system will
become operational shortly. The NBIS would help improving both targeting and coverage
of social protection programs, even if their coverage does not reach 100% as specified in
the Outcome Indicators.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Insofar as the improved environment for private sector development succeeds in
attracting more investment, the resulting generation of new jobs would contribute to
reducing poverty. In addition, the new National Beneficiaries Information System
would improve coverage and efficiency of social protection programs. As of March 2011,
information of about 75% of current beneficiaries was entered into the new system, and
95% of those were confirmed. Better targeting of beneficiaries is expected to result in a
more efficient allocation of social expenditures. Improved coordination of the delivery of
social assistance would save administrative costs. Authorities, however, are concerned
that some people who were rejected by the new system because of size of household or
age may still need help, and they are looking for mechanisms to address that problem.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The human resources audit of established position in Ministries and Departments,
which was completed under the Project, would improve management in the public
sector. The Auditor General office was strengthened with new hardware and software,
the Registry was restructured and is now performing its duties within shorter periods of
time, and customs administration was taken to a higher level by the upgrade to
ASYCUDA World. The establishment of the IRC, with transparent methods of operation,
was a major institutional change in the energy area. When the new procurement law is
approved by Parliament, it would also be an institutional improvement. Finally, when
fully operational, the new NBIS will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
institutions managing key social protection programs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The reform at customs, which was one of four sub-components within the first
component of the Program, acquired increased importance over time and became a
major outcome of the GSPTAP. A comprehensive and detailed M&E matrix was
developed during implementation, containing specific steps in eight focus areas: (i) legal
framework; (ii) organization and management; (iii) human resources management and
training; (iv) information and communication technology; (v) control systems and
processes; (vi) external cooperation; (vii) enforcement and compliance; and (viii)
integrity (Annex 3). This matrix spells out the tasks in each area as well as who was
responsible for execution and the expected time frame of completion. This sub-


                                           17
component took a long time to take off, but import brokers see those reforms as a major
improvement in the system, which greatly facilitates international trade.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
Rating: Moderate

The risk that development outcomes would not be maintained varies somewhat
across the components of the Project. The risk to outcomes of component 1 is low to
moderate, as it strengthens institutions in the public sector and improves its operational
efficiency, thereby creating stakeholder groups who benefit from those reforms and
would oppose back tracking. An example of that is the reform at customs, which
facilitates and reduces costs of international trade. Likewise, for the improved operations
of the Registry, and for the services provided by the Invest Dominica Authority
(component 2). The risk could be significant, however, with regard to the new
procurement legislation, which has been bouncing back and forth for a long time.
Approval of this law is required to ensure that all public contracts above threshold are
advertised and awarded through transparent and competitive bidding.

The risk to the liberalization and current regulation of production and distribution
of electricity is moderate. While the new IRC is perceived as doing a good job and
protecting consumers, the cost of maintaining a national regulator is high. If this cost
becomes unbearable, the government may decide that it is advantageous to participate in
the regional regulatory authority, the development of which is being supported by the
Bank.

The risk to the sustainability of the new National Beneficiaries Information System,
once it’s operational, is low. Again, its higher efficiency is likely to save administrative
costs and draw support from beneficiaries.

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The areas included in the GSPTAP were all of strategic relevance for Dominica. In
fact, they were also part of the Growth and Social Protection Medium Term strategy of
the government. However, the value added of the second component – Improving the
Investment Climate, is not so clear since there were other donors providing support in
this area. The Results Framework was general and with Outcome Indicators difficult to
measure. A subsequent Table of Arrangements for Results Monitoring in the PAD



                                            18
presented interim and final target values for several OIs, but some called for 100%
compliance, which was not very realistic. The implementation arrangements were good,
with the PCU collaborating with the Ministry of Finance and the creation of a Steering
Committee and working groups for each component. However, the slow start of the
Project suggests that assessment of readiness for implementation was lacking. Finally, the
Risk Assessment included in the PAD was appropriate, covering most aspects of risk and
describing mitigating measures for each one of them.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project lost its Task Manager (TM) almost right after Board approval, and
there was another TM change in the last year of implementation. While that is not
uncommon in the Bank, the two transition periods between TMs appear to have resulted
in delays in receiving responses to no-objection requests. Also, it took some time for
new TMs to become familiar with the various aspects of the Project. However,
authorities pointed out that TMs responded expeditiously to Government requests when
at World Bank Headquarters, but it took more time to get responses when they were on
mission in other countries. TMs had also to administer the Trust Fund (TF) that co-
financed the Project and had to report progress to the EU, which was complicated by the
different time frame of the TF.

In general, supervision missions focused on development impact, and processes were
adequate. However, because of budgetary considerations, there was only one field visit
to Dominica in 2009, and most supervision was done virtually that year. At times,
management perceived that ISRs’ reporting on program performance and the time needed
to achieve its targets was overly optimistic. Supervision of fiduciary and procurement
was appropriate, based on periodic reports by the PCU and several missions to the
country.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The GSPTAP was only the second project in the past 20 years that the Bank
approved for Dominica, which was not for reconstruction after natural disasters.8
As such, it’s understandable that it would tend to spread over various areas. All these
areas were also in the Development Strategy of the Government, and were relevant to
Dominica’s social and economic development objectives. However, the Results
Framework was phrased in general terms and the Outcome Indicators were not always
measurable, which required a restructuring at the Mid-term Review and generated
confusion during supervision. Nevertheless, the GSPTAP contributed to strengthening

once the new National Beneficiaries Information System is fully operational, also to
improving the coverage and efficiency of social protection programs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

While staying the course on the reform program, Government took time to approve
measures and submit new legislation to Parliament. Some reforms took longer than
expected because of technical reasons, such as development of the NBIS. Others, such as
procurement legislation, were delayed by lengthy public consultations. In addition,
several legislation proposals were delayed simply because there is only one person in
government that drafts those proposals. All in all, the majority of targets were achieved.
While a number of targets were only partially achieved or not achieved by the closing
date, several are near completion and most are expected to be completed in the near
future.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The PCU was part of the Reform Management Unit/Establishment, Personnel
Training Department. The first Project Coordinator organized the Unit and engaged
with agencies that were responsible for implementation. Further, the Coordinator
followed up closely with those agencies and reported progress (or lack thereof) to the
World Bank. The PCU also reported on financial management monthly to the Financial
Secretary of Finance and quarterly to the Bank. That arrangement worked well, albeit not
always on time (report was done within the time frame as noted by the Operations
manual. Reporting was usually done on time). Likewise with regard to audit reports. In
general, the follow up, reporting, and coordination with the World Bank after the first
year of implementation. However, the PCU provided efficient support to Bank missions
visiting Dominica throughout the life of the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory for the reasons described
above.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

Project-Specific Lessons

      Agreeing with UNCTAD on the terms of the consultancy to upgrade ASYCUDA
       2.7 to ASYCUDA World during preparation of the Project would have prevented
       long delays in launching the new system;


                                           20
      Delays in meeting the new procurement legislation target resulted in part from the
       fact that this sub-component of the GSPTAP piggy-bagged on a reform being
       prepared under a project by another donor, over which the Bank had no control;
      The Bank has to ensure that procurement and financial management training is
       provided to the PCU as needed.

General Application Lessons

      The scope of Bank programs in small states deserve further discussion. On the
       one hand, since only one project is prepared in a multi-year period, both the
       Government and the Bank tend to include many activities in the program. On the
       other hand, these countries have usually tight capacity constraints, which calls for
       relatively simple and highly selective programs;
      The Bank could consider special procedures for very small projects, in order to
       facilitate implementation and lower supervision costs. For example, the Bank
       requires a minimum of 3 quotes from suppliers, but in small local markets there
       may not be that many suppliers of a particular item. That is relevant because
       contracting locally could be cost saving when the item involved requires periodic
       service and maintenance;
      Prolonged lags between Project preparation and actual implementation of reforms
       call for: (i) more flexibility to address changing government priorities; and (ii)
       more flexibility in reallocating funds to items whose costs went up over time;
      Leveraging donor funds can benefit the client by increasing substantially the size
       of the project. However, the added coordination efforts impose costs on all sides.
       Thus, it is important to make sure that all are in the same wave length throughout
       implementation, to ensure that the Program is properly monitored and
       coordination costs minimized.
      With hindsight, it seems that having the PCU working in close collaboration with
       the Ministry of Finance improved its access to other implementing agencies and
       facilitated execution of the Program.

7. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARTNERS

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

(b) Cofinanciers. Comment by the EU (Annex 8)

The Dominica Private Sector & Growth Programme was a hybrid between a
General and Sectoral Budget Support Programme. The general condition was linked
to progress in the GSPS, and the specific objective was to improve the investment climate
to foster private sector-led growth, notably through the further development and
implementation of a National Investment Strategy (NIS). The total amount of this
programme was €17.1 million which was comprised of a budget support component of
€16.4 million and complementary support of €646,000. The complementary support was
comprised of €526,000 for technical assistance (TA) to the World Bank (WB) GSPTAC
programme and €120,000 for monitoring and evaluation. The EU Delegation had been

regularly receiving status reports of the WB GSPTAC, some of them constituted the
evidence for backing the fulfilment of the variable tranche indicators. A dialogue with the
Government and the World Bank on progress on EC budget support variable tranche
indicators took place on December 2010 during the Budget Support Review.

                       SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR


PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

A Project Coordinator/Procurement Officer, Mrs. Cecelia Martin and Project
Accountant, Mrs. Tanya Chase-Henry were employed in the World Bank Growth and
Social Protection Technical Assistance Project at the inception of the project. During
the life of the project, Mrs. Cecelia Martin tendered her resignation in August, 2008.
Mrs. Marilyn A. Cuffy-Morris was contracted for a period of twenty-one (21) months.

The project was extended by a further six month due to General Elections which was
held in December, 2009 which led to major project delays. This is dealt with under the
section Trajectory delays in the project. The total number of deliverables implemented
per year during the twenty one (21) month period is noted under the Administration
section. There was need to employ an Administrative Assistant in the project to
provide administrative support on a daily basis. Secretarial and administrative support
was provided by Ms. Dellina Dalrymple, who was recruited in July, 2008.

At the commencement of the Project on 19th, September, 2007, a workshop was held
for Project staff, the Implementing Agency and also the project beneficiaries. This
workshop was facilitated by World Bank staff headed by Mr. Errol Graham, the then
Task Team Leader.

During the initial implementation, a few constraints were encountered in respect to the
arrangements for the release of funds from the World Bank. After meeting with the
PCU, RMU and the Chief Personnel Officer (CPO), the procedure for submitting
requests and authorization for disbursement of project funds according to World Bank
standards was finalized. The procedures for requests for disbursement of funds and
changes to procurement plan were communicated to all project beneficiaries and project
leaders. The Project accounting and reporting processes and procedures were finalized
and the resources required to equip the Project Coordinating Unit was procured. The
preparation of the World Bank project was in direct response at stabilizing the
Dominican economy and (i) to embark on an adjustment strategy being implemented by
the new Government and (ii) to implement key structural reforms to establish the basis
for private sector-led sustainable growth and poverty reduction.

The World Bank Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project was
approved by a Committee of Government officials. The project commenced on 19th,
September, 2008 and closed on 31st, December, 2010. The total projected budget was a
total of EC$7,020,000.00. As at 31st, December, 2010 a total of EC$7,502,867.00 was
expensed. The World Bank credit and EU agreements was extended by six months as

delays.

Project start up Deliverables

A Quik Books accounting software was purchased for use by the Project Accountant.
All Government funds had to be accounted for through the use of an Accounting
software, Smart Stream. The government Computer Center provided training for the
staff of the Project Coordinating Unit in the use of the Smart Stream software.

In an effort to account for use of funds within the project three bank accounts were
opened at the National Bank of Dominica; one EC$, and two $US accounts. The
Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the Establishment, Personnel and Training
Department designed the required authorization mechanisms to operate these accounts.
All withdrawal applications and replenishments were undertaken on a monthly basis
and were approved by designated officials in the Ministry of Finance. Direct payments
would be made in keeping with the guidelines in the Operations Manual.

No Petty Cash accounts were operated throughout the duration of the project. The
provision of a cheque book to disburse funds from the GSPTA bank account was
approved in July, 2008. This greatly alleviated the difficulties experienced in getting
cheques printed through SmartStream, particularly when all transactions were “frozen”
during the end of Government budgetary period.

On commencement of the project the Bank was alerted by the Ministry of Finance and
the first tranche of the funds was requested. In January, 2008, a disbursement of
US$145,000.00 was made into the local bank account as an advance of project funds in
response to disbursement request from the Ministry of Finance. The NBD had
responded negatively to the request from the Ministry of Finance for the World Bank
(USD) account to be changed to an interest bearing account, because this facility is not
offered with foreign currency account, however, in light of the large sum of money and
potential interest which could be received, the Ministry of Finance pursued this matter
by direct negotiations.

By the end of August, 2008 early September, 2008, all requirements for the payment of
the EU contribution to the GSPTA were met. The EU – WB agreement was signed, the
GOCD – WB Agreement was signed for the World Bank administration of the project,
the EU transferred the first tranche of funds to the World Bank on behalf of the project,
and arrangements were made with the local bank (NBD) to open another USD account
for receipt and separate accounting of the EU funds. By February, 2009, no objections
was sought from the World Bank for an amount of approximately US$6,000.00 to be
allocated for project daily operations.

Trajectory delays

Whereas the project commenced on 19th, September, 2007, funds under the EU
arrangement was only made available when the WB/EU Agreement was officially
signed on 30th, September, 2008, one year later. The arrangement to utilize
Euro$526,000.00 was to finance the procurement of goods, consultant’s services and
for Training and Project Management. The end date of this agreement was 30 th, June,
2010.

There was another delay during the first year of the project when the original
reallocations made under the World Bank Credit Agreement was reorganized to reflect
removal of funds from one allocation to another to accommodate payments to be made
to UNCTAD under the respective fund allocation. The request was made on 08th,
August, 2008 and approval was received that same year. The Table shows the initial
arrangement and the changes made to reflect that change.

The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica requested an extension of the
World Bank Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance project due delays
caused by General Elections in December, 2009.


The delays resulted in the request for extension of the following consultancies:-
    MIS consultancy
    HR consultancy


                                                    42
      Public Information Campaign
      Modernization of the Registry consultancy
      Project Audit

Extensions for both the EU and World Bank Credit Agreements were requested and
subsequently approved from 31st December, 2009 to 31st December, 2010. Approval
was also received later in the year for the extension of the EU agreement from 30th
April, 2010 to 07th July, 2010. This meant that the EU had extended the World
Bank/EU agreement to 31st August, 2010 which only gave the Government an end of
withdrawal period up to 30th April, 2010 (four months before the EU/WB agreement
closed). The Bank however, requested that the PCU make requests for all payments
made where counterpart Government funds were used to pay consultants and firms.
This replenishment request had to be done before the deadline date of 30th June, 2010.
All replenishment requests made were approved and disbursed as submitted. As a
result of these delays project implementation was affected as follows –

Factors outside Government or Implementing Agency control

      Approvals on Terms of References
      Extension of the World Bank and EU Agreements
      Lengthy procurement processes with the World Bank Procurement departments.
      Serious delays in responding to approval to EU extension which led to the use
       of counterpart funds.
      Delays in the receipt of replenishments of counterpart funds utilized
      Delays in the receipt of EU funding for various consultancies.

Factors subject to Government and Implementing Agency control

      Lack of ongoing Project follow up in 2008, which led to most of the
       deliverables being conducted in year two and three. Low level of project
       implementation at commencement leading up to 2008.
      Replacement of the new Project Coordinator/Procurement Officer
      The replacement of Steering Committee members.
      The Underestimated cost of the total project
      Savings from various components also had to be utilized after receiving no
       objections from the bank to have these activities completed.
      Re-organization of Ministries/Departments and Corporate Plans due to the
       Government elections held in December, 2009 during a critical stage of the
       project.
      Delays in approval of critical documents by relevant Government authorities for
       project implementation – Proxy means test and NBIS implementation.
      Delays in the approval of various legislations which led to delays in project
       execution and implementation.
      IT system difficulties – Eg. Smart Stream and emails.
      Downtime when assistance from the ICT Unit was not forthcoming.



                                         43
       Delays when second approvals were not forthcoming from the Smart Stream
        system.
       Clarity in the procedures in the release of counterpart Government funding
       Insufficient meetings between PCU/RMU throughout the life of the project – re
        ongoing follow-ups.

Factors subject to the World Bank

       Throughout the life of the project three Task Team Leaders provided guidance.
        These transitions of the Task Team Leaders led to lapses in some aspects of the
        project
       Delays in responding on matters when the Task Team Leaders were out on
        Mission
       Extensive delays in receiving “No objections” to critical matters (Procurement,
        TORs etc.)
       Extensive delays in receiving approvals to EU and World Bank credit
        agreements extensions
       Major time lags in responding to approval of contracts (especially
        Implementation of ASYCUDA World - UNCTAD) which caused consultancies
        to be delayed even further and beyond the project time line.

As noted previously the project commenced in September, 2007. A new Project
Manager was recruited in December, 2008. The project experienced a lag time for
completion of project deliverables in 2008. As of that date, only eight (8-16%) out of
the total number of deliverables were ongoing to date. It was left up to the newly
appointed Project Manager to complete the remaining deliverables over a shortened
twenty-one (21) month period.

The financial resources, which included funding from the World Bank, the Government
and the European Union, of the World Bank Growth and Social Protection Technical
Assistance project were used in its totality.

Three audits were done throughout the life of the project as follows (See Project Audit
section)
 From September, 2007 to December, 2008
 From January, 01st, 2009 to December, 31st, 2009
 From January, 01st, 2010 to January, 31st, 2011 (due to delays with the UNCTAD
    payment arrangement, the auditing of these expenditures were done in February,
    2011 and accounted for in the Auditing period.

Expenditure in the World Bank project based on deliverables

As initially informed the total amount of resources used by the World Bank project was
to the tune of EC$7,502,867.00. This allowed for the expenditure on various
deliverables as shown above.

According to the figures above, you can see a marked increase in the expenditure of the
funds as time passed by. Only 0.7% of the funds were used in the year 2007, with an
increase to 24% in expenditure in the year 2008. There was a 7% further increase in
the use of the funds in the year 2009 to 31.8% and an even marked increase in of 42.7%
in the year 2010 by 10.9%.

Though the pie chart shows that the bulk of the funds were utilized in 2010, a small
portion of that amount was actually paid out in the year 2011 as a result of a few delays
which were experienced with the UNCTAD arrangement. Payments were made based
(to Price Waterhouse Coopers) based on activities completed before the deadline date
of 31st, December, 2010.

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME AGAINST AGREED OBJECTIVES

Evaluation of the Borrower’s Performance

During the preparation phase of the project, various team leaders from Government
departments met and processed the idea of this project document and sought financing
through three different sources of funds, the European Union, the World Bank and
counterpart funding from the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica.
Throughout the life of the project, the process of implementation was carried through
the vetting of various Procurement and Implementation plans. These documents
provided a formal guide towards project implementation and helped the project staff
remained on course on a day to day basis. The Government team went through a major
understudy through the intervention of the World Bank team, where many short
meetings were held with the staff to guide the processes through which the project had
to operate. The project was guided by the Operations Manual, various Accounting
Guide documents and Procurement documents.

Lessons learnt
GoCD
    The project highlighted the need for realistic budgeting during project design.
      All aspects of the project must also be costed and all required allocations made.
    Training in Project Management is required within the public Service
    Government employees need to see the importance of project implementation
      and ensure that all is in place to move the project forward as quickly as possible
      in order to achieve the desired outcome within the stated project timeframe.
    Greater levels of interest and commitment are required by Steering Committee
      members to ensure effective project implementation.
    The necessary legislative framework must be in place in a timely manner
    All Ministries and Government employees who will be critically involved in the
      Project needs to be informed officially. This will assist in the required interest
      and buy-in which is required.
    There should be a clear distinction/communication between the costs that are to
      be supported by the Project Unit and those of the counterpart funds, so that
      these items are properly budgeted and accounted for by the Project as opposed
      to other sources
    Due to the list of activities/deliverables and the inherent delays the project
      lifetime should have been executed over a period of four rather than three years.
    There needs to be team building at the early stages of the project that the Project
      Unit builds upon.
    The Project staff needs to be trained before commencement of the project to
      prevent unnecessary delays due to the need to follow Banks procurement
      procedures.
    Project ownership is critical to the success of a project - This ownership has to
      be done by the relevant departments and Ministries early in the Project so that
      all continues to work as a team from inception to completion.

Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank, any Co-financiers, or of other
partners

Throughout the life of the project, Bank officials visited the Commonwealth of
Dominica to conduct reviews of the project on an ongoing basis. Various meetings
were planned with relevant Government Departments and Ministries.

The World Bank meetings took the form of the following:
    To review the PCU project progress
    To meet with various key consultants and Government employees to review the
      progress of various deliverables.
    To review any financial details as it related to project expenditure and provide
      advise accordingly
    To review the processing of documents and filing of the PCU filing processes.
    To review the methods of Procurement based on the Bank’s procedures
    To work with staff as it related to the Implementation processes and to provide
      guidance as it related to bottlenecks etc.
    To review and monitor the progress of indicators as it related to all deliverables
      funded by the project.
    Technical Advisors, who worked with the bank as consultants, visited the island
      to conduct reviews on specific deliverables – Social Protection component,
      Customs ASYCUDA World.
    Aide Memoires were signed which spelt out certain decisions that were made
      and any discussions for further follow up and possible discussions. These were
      done on completion of the Mission’ visits. The last two mission’s visit did not
      involve the signing of Aide Memoires.

The EU meetings took the form of the following:
    To review the progress of the project based on details presented in the Financial
      Monitoring Report (FMR).
    To review the progress of the deliverables which were funded.
    To monitor the Indicators related to specific deliverables.
    Meetings were arranged with the local EU officials who provided guidance on
      the use of funds especially as it related to the drawing down of funds for
      implementation of other Government activities.
    Meetings were held between the EU office official from Barbados and the
      Registry Department to review the Registry indicator.

Lessons learnt
World Bank
    More support in terms of ongoing follow-up from the Bank officials on a bi-
      weekly basis with the Project Management department especially as it related to
      the progress of the project. This would have enabled more frequent follow ups
      and prevented some of the delays.
    The Bank’s processes and policies are lengthy and very stringent and tended to
      cause severe delays in project implementation.


                                          49
      There is a need to decrease the processing time for providing approvals and
       especially when the Task Team Leader is out of state.
      Measures should be put in place by the Bank to make the process more enabling
       for quick project implementation as oftentimes the time frame of the projects
       are usually short and a lot has to be completed in a very short space of time.
      Facilitate quicker methods of communicating matters as it related to informing
       the Project team on critical matters for continued project implementation.
      The frequency with which Task Team Leaders are changed and assigned to the
       project caused project delays especially at critical decision-making periods.
      Training sessions should have been organized either online or otherwise on an
       ongoing basis.
      Ongoing feedback and support from the Task Team Leaders were favorable in
       some occasions; however, Aide Memoires should form a critical document on
       completion of all visits to document all decisions made and matters discussed
       with relevant officials.
      The World Bank needs to work in closer ties with the Government of Dominica
       to ensure quick procurement, quick responding to critical matters, documented
       Aide Memoires for all Missions’ visit for follow up etc.
      Task Team Leader transition – There needs to be a smoother transition when the
       Task Team Leader (TTL) is changed. The TTL transition impacted project
       implementation and led to delays especially when critical decisions had to be
       made on important matters (World Bank and EU extension requests) and
       response from the World Bank was not forthcoming in a timely manner. This
       resulted in delays in the use of funds, e.g – EU funds.

Description of the Proposed Arrangements for Future Operation of Projects

The following is a listing of proposed arrangements for the future
   1. Liaise with relevant officials who are directly related with the project in terms
       of obtaining the necessary approvals for legislations and regulations that could
       have a major impact no project implementation.
   2. Formation of cross section of committee.
   3. More direct communication/interface with various officials from the Funding
       Agency
   4. Provide for all activities to be funded. This should be clearly articulated and
       documented.
   5. There should be allowances for contingencies.
   6. Maintain effective communication with all key project staff.
   7. Constant liaison with the Accountant General’s Office, Audit Department.
   8. If the project includes an IT component and the ICT Unit is required to provide
       support, the ICT Unit must be involved at an early stage.
   9. The ICT Unit should have qualified and experienced persons to work on major
       IT projects to prevent serious delays with project implementation.
   10. Ongoing follow up meetings with respective Ministry/Department Heads should
       be of critical importance.

ANNEX 6. COMMENTS OF COFINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS

The Dominica Private Sector & Growth Programme is a hybrid between a General and
Sectoral Budget Support Programme. During the first phase of the programme the
Government wished to use EC financing through the budget support modality to create
and enabling environment for investment, however a national investment strategy had
not yet been developed. The National Strategy of the Government – Growth and Social
Protection Strategy (GSPS) – which aims to foster private sector growth by improving
the business climate and enhancing physical infrastructure – was considered the most
appropriate strategy for the programme. Therefore, the general condition is linked to
progress in the GSPS and not a private sector strategy.

The overall objective of the programme is to reduce poverty through sustained
economic growth and increased competitiveness and economic opportunities. The
specific objective is to support the Government’s effort to improve the investment
climate to foster private sector-led growth, notably through the further development and
implementation of a National Investment Strategy (NIS).

The Financing Agreement (FA) was signed on 9/11/2007 for a total amount of € 10.78
million and its operational implementation phase came to closure on 31 December 2010.
A rider no.1 to increase the financial ceiling to reflect the 2006 Flex allocation of €1.02
million was signed in December 2007. A Rider No. 2 to Financing Agreement to adapt
the payment of the Vulnerability Flex and Flex allocations to the Financing Agreement
was signed by both parties in May 2010. The indicators for variable tranches were
initially set in the Annex D of the Financing Agreement, and modified trough two
exchange of letters, first in June 2009 and second in October 2010.

Therefore, the total amount of this programme is €17.1 million which is comprised of a
budget support component of €16.4 million and complementary support of €646,000.
The complementary support is comprised of €526,000 for technical assistance (TA) to
the World Bank (WB) GSPTAC programme and €120,000 for monitoring and
evaluation.

With respect to progress achieved in recently, especially in the area of private sector
development which is the focus of this budget support programme, the GSPS has
fostered as priority the strengthening of an environment conducive to private sector
investments. With the support of the EU and the World Bank Group, simultaneous
efforts are ongoing on many fronts to facilitate the effectuation of this outcome.
Various administrative and structural changes have been pursued in land administration,
tenancy and registration; Customs; company registration; and investment facilitation
and promotion through the WB GSPTAC programme, co-financed with the EC that
finalized activities in December 2010. Specifically, the following results have been
achieved;

      Civil Service Reform; Implementation of manpower assessment as well as
       preparation of corporate plans and organizational charts for each line ministry



                                           51
      Strengthening of Customs; The Customs Bill was enacted on December 2010.
       ASYCUDA World system was launched in July 2010. Staff training and
       computerization of the customs department has been provided in support of the
       introduction of the new system.

      Modernization of Registry; Full deployment of a state-of-the-art land
       information system for public sector land introduced in 2008.

      Strengthening of Fiduciary Capacity; Support to complete the Procurement
       Legislation.

      Improving the Investment Climate; Under this project a new institutional
       structure for the national development corporation was developed. Two
       agencies have been established and are operational. Discover Dominica
       Authority (DDA) and Invest Dominica Authority (IDA). The National
       Investment Strategy (NIS) has been adopted. However it has not been placed in
       the Government's website yet.

The EU Delegation has been regularly receiving status reports of the WB GSPTAC,
some of them constitute the evidence for backing the fulfilment of the variable tranche
indicators. A dialogue with the Government and the World Bank on progress on EC
budget support variable tranche indicators took place on December 2010 during the
Budget Support Review.
