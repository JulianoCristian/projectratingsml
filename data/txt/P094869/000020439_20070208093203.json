effectiveness\n            to deliver public goods and services by strengthening the\n            institutional capacity of key agencies to facilitate\n            Dominica's private sector competitiveness and\n            productivity and to provide targeted social assistance to\n            reduce poverty. The project has five components that will\n            make this possible. The first is making the public sector\n            more efficient and effective and this will be done by\n            strengthening the reform management unit; strengthening\n            customs; modernization of registry; and strengthening of the\n            fiduciary capacity. The second component is improving the\n            investment climate. This will be achieved by the development\n            and implementation of both a national investment strategy\n            and national action plan. The third component consists of\n            reforming the regulatory framework for the energy sector.\n            This involves the establishment of a national regulatory\n            commission and the drafting of alternative energy\n            legislation. The fourth component is improving social\n            protection which involves three steps: modernize and\n            streamline systems for beneficiary selection and\n            registration; institution strengthening; and a public\n            information campaign. The final component is project\n            management which involves financing the operation of the\n            small project coordinating unit integrated within the\n            establishment, personnel and training department and\n            employing permanent government staff and where necessary\n            contract staff."}, "docdt": "2006-10-10T00:00:00Z"}
