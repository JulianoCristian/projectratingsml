To date\n            all planned activities have been contracted and work has\n            been completed for some components. Amongst the achievements\n            to date are the implementation of new system for customs,\n            draft procurement legislation completed, the development of\n            a national investment strategy and action plan, the\n            establishment of the National Regulatory Commission and the\n            drafting of alternative energy legislation, the design and\n            implementation of a software system for registering\n            companies and public lands and a manpower needs assessment\n            for the public sector. The disbursement rate for the credit\n            is currently 77 percent. The extension is necessary because\n            the project experienced delays in contracting activities to\n            support public sector reform and improving social\n            protection. One of the reasons for the delay in project\n            implementation was government's focus on the election,\n            held on December 18, 2009. Prior to this, the project lost\n            the project coordinator and there were delays in hiring the\n            new coordinator. These events had definite impact on the\n            pace of execution of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
