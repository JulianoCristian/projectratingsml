PROTECTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Growth and Social\n            Protection Technical Assistance Credit Project for Dominica\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            delays in meeting the new procurement legislation target\n            resulted in part from the fact that this sub-component of\n            the project piggy-bagged on a reform being prepared under a\n            project by another donor, over which the Bank had no\n            control. The Bank has to ensure that procurement and\n            financial management training is provided to the Project\n            Coordinating Unit (PCU) as needed. The scope of Bank\n            programs in small states deserves further discussion. On the\n            one hand, since only one project is prepared in a multi-year\n            period, both the Government and the Bank tend to include\n            many activities in the program. On the other hand, these\n            countries have usually tight capacity constraints, which\n            call for relatively simple and highly selective programs.\n            Leveraging donor funds can benefit the client by increasing\n            substantially the size of the project. However, the added\n            coordination efforts impose costs on all sides. Thus, it is\n            important to make sure that all are in the same wave length\n            throughout implementation, to ensure that the program is\n            properly monitored and coordination costs minimized. With\n            hindsight, it seems that having the PCU working in close\n            collaboration with the Ministry of Finance improved its\n            access to other implementing agencies and facilitated\n            execution of the program."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
