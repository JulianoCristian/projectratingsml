INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR
A POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$85 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance a power transmission project in India.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-32a, dated May 10, 1972), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 2, 1972. This report estimated that for the Indian Fiscal
Year ending on March 31, 1972, the economy grew at significantly less than
4 percent. For the current year, growth is expected to be even lower and,
indeed, there is the prospect that there may not be any growqth at all. The
principal factor in the decline this year has been the serious failure of
the monsoon. In comparing the rate of economic growth achieved over the past
two years with the average of 5 percent p.a. experienced during the preceding
two years account should be taken of the fact that the Indian economy under-
went two years of bad weather in a period of sharply falling foreign aid and
provided substantial economic assistance to Bangladesh.
3.        Until the beginning of 1972, performance in the industrial sector
had been especially disappointing with a downward trend from a growth rate
of 7.1 percent in 1969 to 4.5 percent in 1971. However, the figure for
1971 obscures some improvement which began to take place during the last
quarter and which was sustained during the first quarter of 1972. Over
these six months industrial production increased by 7.2 percent compared with
the same period the year before. But this improvement has to be qualified
first because much of it was confined to the textile industry which recovered
from the effects of a severe shortage of raw cotton and secondly because
recent data indicate that no further increase in industrial output occurred
during the latter part of 1972. The factors which have brought about this
situation include lack of demand for certain capital goods, shortage of
imported raw materials, labor unrest, power shortages, as well as managerial
difficulties especially in the steel industry. Cumbersome administrative
procedures in applying industrial policy have also aggravated the situation.
These factors have been present in varying degrees almost continuously over
the past decade with the result that India's industrial potential has yet
to be fully realized. What marks out the last 3 years is the severity of
the deceleration in industrial activity notwithstanding the modest reprieve
gained in the early part of 1972. The Government of India (GOI) recognized
that fresh initiatives must be taken through industrial policy measures.
Revisions of the industrial licensing policy have been announced recently; it
is as yet too early to evaluate the effects of these revisions on invest-
ment and output.



4.        Agricultural production registered an increase of over five percent
in each of the first two years of the Fourth Plan, with foodgrain production
reaching 108 million tons in 1970/71. In 1971/72 foodgrain production
was affected by rather indifferent weather with the result that only an
estimated 106 million tons were produced. This year weather conditions
have been disastrous with a complete failure of the monsoon in both the
west and east sides of the country, an unusual occurrence. Meaningful
estimates have still to be mad.e but clearly production of summer foodgrains
will be substantially below last year's level, with the result that India
is enduring very serious food shortages over large parts of the country.
The Government had hoped that large food grain stocks built up between 1968
and 1970 wqould be adequate to meet requirements in'bad years. But the combined
effect of supplying food grain to Bangladesh and the severity of the drought
this year has led to food grain stocks being reduced by about half, to 3-4
million tons at the end of 1972. These stocks are now being depleted at a
rate of one million tons a month. The Government has decided to import about
two million tons of food grains and nore may be required if the winter crop
also fails. Other crops have also been affected. Jute and, to a lesser
extent, cotton production are expected to be lower, while the shortage of
oil seeds could be quite severe with the resulting need for higher imports.
5.        In the present situation, the generally favorable trend in
agricultural production over the past several years should not be overlooked.
Even if this year's food grain crop should be between 95 and 100 million
tons, it would still be significantly above that obtained in the last
serious drought year, 1965/66, when production reached only 72 million tons.
This would indicate that the considerable investments in irrigation facilities
fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs have had the effect of reducing
the impact of droughts. If yields this year remain high on irrigated land
in spite of adverse weather conditions, and reports of good crops in the
Punjab and Ilaryana are favorable indications, this will confirm the success
of the new technology and highlight the need to broaden its use within India.
6.        The wholesale price ind.ex has increased at a rate of 6.5 percent
between July 1972 and December 1972. An important factor has been the rapid
inc-rease of food prices, which went up at the same rate over this period
reflecting expected food grain shortages.    In an effort to control inflation,
the Government has l-mited the overdraft facilities available to State
governments, previously a source of deficit spending, and is considering
r.easures to control. more effectively the level of food grain prices, but
such steps are likely to be offset by the relief programs necessitated by the
drought.
7.        India's net reserves position at the end of September was US$1,188
million or the equivalent of 39 percent of annual imports, plus debt service
paymeats. Reserves have fallen by nearly US$100 million since March 1972.
Further pressure on the country's declining reserves from food grain imports
is -nevitable. On the export side, recenr estimates indicate a 23 percent
increase In exports between April and November this year, as compared with the
eorrespondling period last year.  But overall, the rate of growth of exports
I^as -7een slow in the recent past and uncertainty surrounds future levels of
aid. In the circumstances, India should clearly continue to receive
uL>sbtantlal aid from IDA.



-.3.-
8.        A document setting out the approach to the Fifth Plan for the
period 1974/75 to 1978/79 has recently been published by the Government.
Economic self-reliance and the elimination of poverty are held to be the
major tasks of the Fifth Plan. In the light of the experience of the Fourth
Plan, considerable effort will be required to achieve the 5.5 percent annual
growth which is the target for the Fifth Plan period.
9.        A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN DIDIA
10.       Since 1949, the Bank has made 40 loans and 48 development credits
to India totalling US$1,110 million and US$2,014 million (both net of
cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts US$564 million has been repaid
and US$770 is still undisbursed.   Annex II contains a summary statement of
disbursements as of January 31, 1973 and notes on the status of currently
active loans and credits.
11.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$4.3 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold
and US$6.0 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$24.4 million, US$16.9
million represents loans and US$7.5 million equity. A summary statement of
IFC operations as of January 31, 1973 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
12.       The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years
has been on agriculture and agriculture related projects. This reflects
the importance of agriculture, which contributes about 50 percent of India's
GNP and the corresponding investment priorities of the Government. In ad-
dition to the Agricultural Universities project which was signed on November
10, and the Nangal fertilizer project signed on February 9 projects in agri-
cultural credit, in agro-industries, and in agricultural markets are expected
to be ready for consideration by the Executive Directors this fiscal year.
13.       Lending to industry will also be a prominent feature of the
program for this fiscal year. Assistance to the industrial sector will
concentrate on the support of development finance institutions through the
recently approved credit to the Industrial Development Bank of India, and
a tenth loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India.
Industry will also benefit from an Industrial Imports credit. In addition
assistance to infrastructure development is provided for in this year's
program through the credit for power transmission presented here and a
credit in support of the Government's telecommunications investment program
which has just been appraised. India's large cities, particularly Bombay
and Calcutta, require major investment in public services to keep up with
the growth of their populations; accordingly a Bombay water supply and sewerage
project and an urban development project in Calcutta are also included in
this year's program.

PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
14.       The Structure of the Sector.   The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948
bestows primary responsibility for generation, transmission and distribution
on the States and for national power policy and coordination on the Center.
Within the States, operational responsibility is vested in the State Electric-
ity Boards (SEBs) which, though autonomous, function largely as departments
of State Governments from which they have derived most of their resources.
The parochial perspective of the States in governing the development of genera-
tion and transmission were acceptable so long as development was limited but
over the past two decades the structure of the sector has changed significant-
ly, and integration of operations on a regional basis has become necessary to
achieve a better balance between demand and capacity. This need is reflected
in the establishment of five Regional Electricity Boards, but their present
advisory nature and lack of statutory recognition prevent them from perform-
ing this function effectively. At the Center, several agencies influence the
resource allocation and utilization decisions affecting the power sector but
there is a clear need for a central authority in planning and coordinating
power development. It is geneirally recognized that the Center should even-
tually be endowed with responsibility for generation, transmission and bulk
supply of electricity to the States, but progress towards this end remains
slow. Thus, effective regional and national integration will require sub-
stantial institutional changes. Investment priorities in the sector, to date,
have reflected a heavy bias in favor of investment in generating plant at
the expense of transmission and distribution. The inadequate investment in
transmission and distribution facilities has resulted in anomalies in the
balance between generation and distribution, leading to surplus capacity in
some areas and power shortages in others. Accordingly, since 1965 Bank
Group lending has focussed on improving transmission throughout India. The
shift in lending strategy from supporting generation to assisting in the
financing of transmission systems recognizes the need for inter-connection
of transmission systems through inter-State and inter-regional lines to im-
prove transfers from surplus to deficit areas and, within States, to support
the Government's large rural electrification program.
15.       Performance of the Sector.   Progress in the power sector during the
first three years of the Fourth Plan has failed to live up to expectations.
Additions to generating and transmission capacity have fallen short of Plan
targets even though expenditures have exceeded allocations. Slow implementa-
Lion of projects resulting from delays in equipment deliveries and also labor
problems is largely responsible. Poor utilization of existing capacity due
to inadequate maintenance and lack of spare parts has further affected the
growth of power output. The shortage of rain last summer severely curtailed
Ltne output of hydroelectric stations and led to the present acute power
shortage with cuts in power supply, particularly to industrial consumers, up
to 50 percent in some States. The Ministry of Irrigation and Power has pro-
posed that total installed capacity should be increased to about 50 million
KW I/ in the investment program for the decade 1972-81 to meet an estimated
It   Nameplate rating.  Firm or effective capability is estimated to be
about 70 percent of nameplate ratings during 1973-74.



load demand projected to grow at 12.5 percent to 36.7 million KW by that date.
It may, however, be possible to reduce this margin between installed capacity
and market requirements if adequate progress is made in developing the trans-
mission network. Just how large additional generating capacity will have to
be depends partly on the extent to wiich full transmission integration on a
regional and national scale can be achieved, a measure which could save capac-
ity of about 2 million KW by 1980/81. The decade plan contemplates an im-
portant expansion of the transmission system, particularly during the period
1972-77, to permit better utilization of the generating facilities expected
to be available during this period. During the period there will be an es-
timated investment of US$622 million equivalent to be invested by the bene-
ficiaries in transmission. The latter figure compares with about US$1,300
million equivalent to be invested in generating capacity. The ratio of in-
vestment in transmission and generation indicates a decided improvement over
that in 1966-70.
16.       By now, the Fourth Plan projected additions to capacity of about
4.1 million KW; only 2.7 million KW have been added and attainment of the
revised generation target of 20 million KW (as against the original target
of 23 million KW) in 1973/74, the final year of the Fourth Plan, seems
doubtful. The achievements in the field of rural electrification show a
notable exception. The role of rural electrification in maximizing the use
of groundwater for agriculture and in stimulating the development of rural
industries has assumed greatly increased importance and Fifth Plan require-
ments are estimated at US$350 million per year as compared with US$190 million
being spent annually under the current plan. Intensive efforts to extend
electricity to rural areas have had impressive success and, on the present
trend, the twin targets of energizing 1.5 million pumps and electrifying 7,500
villages over the five years of the Fourth Plan look like being reached.
17.       The Bank has been providing financial assistance for power devel-
opment in India since 1950 and, in all, 8 Bank loans and 5 IDA credits
totalling US$352 million have been made. Prior to 1965, this assistance
focused on the financing of generation projects; subsequently, the Govern-
ment reserved the major equipment for these projects for local procurement.
A first transmission loan in which 15 States were beneficiaries is fully
disbursed; a second project financed by IDA in FY 71, which supported nine of
these States is progressing satisfactorily. The project now recommended
covers the six States not covered by the second credit as well as other non-
State beneficiaries.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
18.       The project was appraised by a mission which visited India in
December 1971 and June 1972. Negotiations took place in Washington in
January, 1973. The Borrower was represented by Mr. S.P. Vinze, Joint
Secretary, Ministry of Irrigation and Power, Mr. V.N. Rajagopalan, Deputy
Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Mr. P.P. Ganghadaran, Member and Mr. T.V.
Thadani, Director, Central Water and Power Commission.    The Appraisal
Report (No. 35a-IN) is being distributed to the Executive Directors. A
project summary is attached to this report at Annex III.

Project Description
19.       The project forms part of a $622 million investment program for
transmission systems to be constructed during the period 1972-77 by the
State Electricity Boards (SEBs) of Assam, Kerala, Mysore, Madhya Pradesh,
Orissa and Tamil Nadu, the Beas Construction Board which supplies hydro-
electric power to the States of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the Delhi
Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU) and the Tata Power Company which
supplies power to the City of Bombay. The project would consist of about
4,000 circuit km of transmission lines operating at voltages between 110
KV and 400 KV and about 60 substations with an aggregate capacity of about
4,600 MVA. The project also includes communications and supervisory equip-
ment for the Southern and Northern Regional Boards load despatch stations
operated by GOI.
20.       The total project cost is estimated at $151 million.    The pro-
ceeds of the proposed credit of $85 million would be made available by
the Central Government as part of the funds for general development pur-
poses provided to the State Governments, which would in turn make loans
to the SEBs. The credit has been allocated in accordance with the esti-
mated needs in material ancl equipment of each sub-project, but these
initial allocations may be modified in detail as final design work is
completed. The balance of the funds required by the SEBs would be made
available through other loans by the State Governments, borrowings frorm
institutional sources and internal cash generation. The parts of the
project to be carried out by Beas and DESU as well as the Regional Boards
would be financed by the Central Government directly. The portion of the
credit allocated to Tata would be used by the Government to provide the
foreign exchange for Tata's import requirements and would be purchased
by the Company out of its own rupee resources.
21.       Procurement and Disbursement.   The proceeds of the credit would
be used to finance the procurement of conductors, groundwire, power
cables, towers, insulators, transformers, switch gear, capacitors and load
despatch equipment, all of which would be procured through international
competitive bidding with the Association approving bid evaluation.    Indian
suppliers and manufacturers would be given a preference in the evaluation
of bids of 15 percent or the prevailing tariff, whichever is lower. As in
the case of the previous credit, in the interests of expediting procurement
no withdrawals from the credit will be permitted in respect of any contract
for goods and services awarded more than 18 months after the signing of the
Credit Agreement. The GOI has also given assurances that import licences will
be issued promptly for all imported equipment to be financed under the credit.
The erection of transmission lines and the construction of substations would
be carried out by the construction departments of SEBs or by local contrac-
tors. SEBs and local contractors have proved themselves competent to com-
plete construction efficiently.



- 7 -
22.       The credit would be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost of
substation equipment and transmission line materials provided abroad
and their ex-factory cost if procured in India after international
competitive bidding. It is possible that up to 75 percent of contracts
would be won by Indian manufacturers. On this assumption, the foreign
exchange component of the project would be over US$40 million, including
the import component of items procured by Indian manufacturers success-
ful in securing contracts. Accordingly, the credit may finance local
currency expenditures up to US$45 million equivalent. India has a sound
development program and is making adequate efforts at mobilizing local
resources for development. Because of India's poverty, her capital needs
exceed what can reasonably be raised internally and what is needed to
finance import requirements. For these reasons, external financing of
local expenditures is essential.
23.       Justification.   The basic justification for the proposed invest-
ment in transmission facilities is to permit better utilization of available
generating capacity, to enable reductions to be made in the total amount
of future generating capacity needed to be installed, to achieve substantial
fuel cost savings and to take fuller advantage of the economies of scale.
This project, as well as the earlier ones will significantly contribute
to the growth of State and inter-State transmission networks and further
regional integration through the construction of load despatch facilities.
There is no reasonable basis for allocating the benefits of India's very
large sector development program among its various components, and thus no
reasonable basis for estimating the return on the transmission sub-projects
in this program. But given India's growing power requirements and the
existing distribution of generating plant completed and under construction,
the transmission program, of which the project forms a part, is required
to satisfy economically these growing demands. The only alternatives -
which would be to plan not to meet demand or to revert to past uneconomic
planning of generating expansion - are not reasonable alternatives.
24.       Apart from the provision of essential transmission facilities,
the project would further two important objectives: the continued improve-
ment of the financial position of SEBs begun under the previous transmission
projects and the strengthening of the institutional framework for invesEment
planning in the power sector. Loan 416-IN estlabished financial rate of
return targets phased over varying periods to reach 11 percent and the SEB's
of the States of Madhya Pradesh, Mysore, Tamil Nadu and the Delhi Elec-
tricity Supply Undertaking have reached and are maintaining the rate of
return targets established by that Loan. Assam, Kerala and Orissa lag behind
but will show increased rates of return as a result of the financial measures
to be adopted under this credit and discussed below. The rates of return
targets established under Loan 416-IN will continue to apply.
25.       While SEB earnings have improved generally, their very large
investments in rural electrification have depressed their rates of return.
Rural electrification revenues are insufficient to support the expense of
these investments including debt service and there are definite limits to



- 8 -
increasing rural electricity tariffs. All States have agreed that the
losses incurred by beneficiary SEBs due to the operation of rural elec-
trification schemes will be covered by special subventions.
26.       Considerable arretars of interest accumulated in the past as a
result of insufficient tariffs absorb surplus funds which could be applied
to finance capital expenditures. There is a need to relieve the SEBs of
the heavy liabilities which arise from these considerable sums of unpaid
interest on government loans. Assurances have been received from five of
the States concerned (Kerala, Mysore, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Tamil
Nadu) that interest arrears accumulated up to March 31, 1970 will be
disposed of either by grants or cancellations or other arrangements and
these undertakings are inccrporated in the draft Credit Agreement. The
State Government of Assam, because of circumstances peculiar to that State,
has been unable to offer such an assurance. The original State has recently
been partitioned into three - Assam, Meghalaya and the Union Territory of
Mizoram. As an alternative, Assam proposes to waive payment of interest and
principal accruing on certain loans until such time as the assets and
liabilities are divided and it is able to conform with the action taken by
the other States by taking action to dispose of its accumulated arrears.
There is also a need to introduce modern accounting concepts for the treat-
ment of interest accruing during construction, the capitalization of which
is not presently allowed. The Borrower has undertaken to provide appropriate
standardized guidelines which will be adopted by the Boards.
27.       The concept of financial viability of SEBs, which is accepted
by the Government of India as necessary to further the efficiency of
operations by the power sector, is inadequately reflected in the Electricity
(Supply) Act, 1948. GOI is accordingly establishing an expert committee
to recommend amendments to the Act. The Association would be given an
opportunity to comment on the recommendations of the committee before their
enactment.
28.       A matter of particular concern is the weakness in present develop-
ment planning for the power sector on a national scale. Some progress is
being made towards coordinated operation on a regional basis but not, to
the same extent, towards national development planning. An essential pre-
requisite of this objective, which is fully appreciated by the Government,
is the reactivation of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to pursue its
statutory responsibilities under the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948; i.e.
t-o develop a sound, adequate and uniform national power policy and to co-
ordinate the activities of the various planning agencies in the country.
Currently, the CEA plays only a minor role as arbiter in disputes between
States and licensees and is not exercising its intended functions under the
Act. The Government is taking action to enable the CEA to fulfill all the
functions, responsibilities and duties assigned to it and is providing it
with the necessary technical support. It is not proposed to present any
further proposals for Bank Group assistance in the power sector until the
CEA has been effectively reactivated.



- 9 -
29.       At the same time, it is the intention of the Borrower to extend
the horizon of power planning from the present 10 years to 15 years, in
line with planning policies of the other energy sectors and to establish
full justification of adopted solutions, including inter-sectoral implica-
tions. To this end, agreement has been reached that the preparation of a
15-year plan will be initiated forthwith.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTIORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit Agreement are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
31.       Each beneficiary SEB is required to give an undertaking to the
Government of India regarding the implementation of its part of the project,
its management and financial performance (Section 3.01 of the Development
Credit Agreement)-. Under Section 8.02 receipt of such an undertaking from
each SEB is a condition of the effectiveness required in order to make
effective the portion of the credit applicable to that particular SEB. Other
conditions of effectiveness contained in Section 4.04 of the Development
Credit Agreement concern the measures to be taken by State governments to
waive or otherwise dispose of SEBs liabilities on account of interest arrears
on State government loans, and to subsidize rural electrification operations.
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
33.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.  PROJECT' IN EXECUTION -/
Ln No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing date: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date was
January 31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by
technical and managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new
collieries to supply IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together with technical
consultants, has been providing constant supervision and progress is being
made in resolving the technical issues. On the managerial side, the
Government of India announced on July 20, 1972, that it was taking over
the management of IISCO for two years. The Government has assured us that
this action will not interfere with IISCO's obligation to the Bank. On
January 31, 1973, US$2 million remained undisbursed of which about US$1.25
million has been earmarked for equipment on order and technical services,
while US$0.75 million may be cancelled by the closing date of December, 1973.
The Bank has approved some inrease in the short-term indebtedness and reha-
bilitation program and has agreed in principle to a reduction in the Bank's
mortgage cover.
Ln No. 414      Sixth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$48.3 million loan of May 28, 1965; Closing
date: June 30, 1973
Ln No. 515      Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$25.0 million loan of September 10, 1967;
Closing date: December 31, 1973
Ln No. 683      Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3, 1970;
Closing date: September 30, 1974
Ln No. 789      Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of
the business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

date of June 30, 1970, for 414-IN has been extended three times to June 30,
1973 and that for 515-IN twice, from December 31, 1971 to December 31, 1973.
An uncommitted balance of approximately US$0.8 million under this loan is
to be cancelled; Loan 683-IN has been fully committed as of December 31, 1972.
Commitments under Loan 789-IN are slightly ahead of schedule and disbursement
substantially ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 89      Beas Equipment US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966:
Closing date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has
been subject to some delays, [s part of a larger scheme for the integrated
development of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the
credit outstanding is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery over the
next 12-18 months. As a resu]Lt, the original closing date of December 31,
1972, has been postponed to December 31, 1973.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Association
has approved plans for the expansion of an existing seed processing plant
and construction of a new plarLt. Orders have been placed for the equipment
required for the former and tenders for equipping the latter plant are being
readvertised following rejection of earlier bidding as unresponsive. A
major difficulty arose because! of a lack of response to tenders for land-
levelling. This problem is being overcome through large scale land levelling
demonstrations under field conditions in the project area following an
agreement that contractors should be permitted to purchase imported equipment
of their choice for land levelling.
Ln No. 615     Telecommunications III; US$27.5 million loan of June 18,
1969; Closing date: June 30, 1973
The project, which was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and
50 percent by an IDA credit (153-IN) was designed to assist in financing
the telecommunications expansion program for the first three years of the
Fourth Plan period (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three
months prior to the closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-IN has
had to be postponed from December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. Although
disbursements have taken place broadly in line with the original schedule,
there have been delays in meeting project targets of about nine months for
local exchange installations and up to two years for long distance network,
resulting from difficulties experienced by local factories and delivery
delays of sonie key items. In recent months the situation has improved,
cWspecially at the local factories.

Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9,
1970; Closing date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana
Dam on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam,
and the resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States of
Gujarat and Rajasthan. The project also includes canalization, land levelling,
the construction of field channels, drainage works and roads, and a program
to support agricultural development. The project is likely to be completed
about two years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of
the prime contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to
discharge his contractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by
departmental force account. Since tniat time the Public Works Department has
been making satisfactory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area
are likely to be more extensive and more costly than expected and may not
be completed until 1978. The outlook for other components of the project
remains satisfactory. As the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project, and also before major investments have been made,
both investment costs and benefits will be deferred. Thus the effect of
these delays upon the economic rate of return is not likely to be
significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit
of June 3, 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 203     Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit
of June 24, 1970; Closing date: December 31, 1973
Cr No. 226     Andhra P-radesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.4 million
credit of January 8, 1971; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 249     Haryana Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million credit
of June 11, 1971; Closing date: March 31, 1975
Cr No. 250     Tamil Nadu Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million
credit of June 11, 1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
Cr No. 278     Mysore Agricultural Credit Project; US$40.0 million credit
of January 7, 1972; Closing date: October 31, 1975
Cr No. 293     Maharashtra Agricultural Credit Project; USM30.0 million
credit of March 29, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1975
Of these seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9
million, the Maharashtra project and the Mysore project have only recently
been declared effective. With the exception of the Punjab project, which
has only a mechanization component, all are similar in structure, being designed
to provide long- and medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions
and the commercial banks for such on-farm investments as tractors, minor
irrigation and land-levelling. Such projects are characteristically slow
disbursing since they are complex and involve very large numbers of small



ANNEX II
Page 6
loans to individuals, each of which has to be appraised and processed. Never-
theless, implementation and disbursement have been slower than was originally
anticipated, although by January 31, 1973, US$24.4 million out of US$35 million
had been disbursed under the first of the series to be approved -- the Gujarat
project, which became effective in September 1970 and which has a closing
date of June 30, 1974. No disbursements have been made in the Punjab
project and only relatively small amounts have been disbursed in the other
three projects which have been current for more than one year. The
closing date for the Punjab agricultural credit project has been extended
by one year to December 31, 1973. In all US$43.9 had been disbursed by
January 31, 1973.
There are a number of factors which have contributed to the
situation, the most important of which, quantitatively, are the problems
which have been encountered in the procurement of tractors (which account
for almost 30 percent of the credits). Two events, the imposition by the
Government of India of a 30 percent import duty and the realignment of
the rates of exchange of international currencies, were mainly responsible
for delays, although difficulties were also experienced in finalizing tender
documents. Only in the case of Gujarat credit did an order for the first
tranche of tractors predate these events, and in that case disbursements
are being made. The effect of the duty was to increase prices of imported
tractors so considerably that doubts were raised as to whether effective
demand for such models remained. These doubts have still to be put to
the test. The exchange realignment was instrumental in distorting bid
prices to the extent that, at the last moment, the Government decided to
withdraw the Punjab tender and to re-advertise. Only recently have the fresh
bids been evaluated and it is hoped that prices will shortly be advertised
to farmers in the case of the Punjab credit. Tender invitations in the
case of the other credits are delayed pending the results obtained in the
Punjab case.
It is still uncertain whether the full number of tractors involved
in these credits (some 21,000) will, in fact, be required. If they are
not, consideration may have be given to the re-allocation of proceeds to other
components or to cancellation. The situation should become clearer in the
next few months. If a requirement 'or net imports remains and if effective
demand has been restored, disbursement should be fairly rapid.
The long delays experienced in disbursing against the minor
irrigation components of these credits have stemmed from the need to
establish in the States, Groundwater Directorates capable of providing
the technical advice and appraisal required if an economic utilization of
groundwater is to be obtained and if investments are not to lead to
overinvestment or underutilization of scarce resources. The establishment
and staffing of these organizations has been a prolonged process but there
are now indications that lend:Lng for minor irrigation is proceeding
satisfactorily and further deLays in disbursement are not anticipated.
In several credits, the delays caused by such time-consuming
institutional reform have been exacerbated by resistance to the more



ANNEX II
Page 7
stringent lending terms imposed by the credits which have caused farmers
to seek finance from sources other than those to be refinanced by IDA.
This particular problem now seems to have been overcome as interest rates
in the sector and other lending conditions stabilize around the norms
established by these projects.
A mission has recently visited India to assess in detail the
difficulties and constraints being encountered with project implementation
and disbursements and has recommended action considered necessary to accele-
rate performance. Such action is now being taken where appropriate.
Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation; US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971
Closing date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spraying
of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government is considering the
procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The matter is
now before a Cabinet Sub-Committee and the Association is awaiting the
Government's decision.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunications IV; US$78.0 million credit of May 3,
1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and
has been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over
the last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement action for
delivery of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed. Produc-
tion problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 months. However, production has now picked up and as of January 31,
1973, US$5.2 million had been disbursed under the credit. Full disbursement
is expected by the closing date of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3
1971; Closing date: September 30, 1975
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan
416-IN, is designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment and
materials required to develop a power transmission program in nine States
under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems
associated with preparing bid document suitable for international bidding
and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but contract
awards have now been made for much of the major equipment so that more rapid
disbursement can be expected. Disbursements should be completed by the
closing date of September 30, 1975.
Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer; US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971
Closing date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of
fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. After initial delays, the



ANNEX II
Page 8
project is now proceeding about six months behind schedule. However,
response to tenders has been disappointing and procurement difficulties
and labor problems could leadl to additional delays.
Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971
Closing date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's
wheat belt, was declared effective on November 14, 1972.
Cr No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23,
1971; Closing date: March 31, 1977
This project comprises the construction of a dam on the Godavari
River, a concrete-lined main canal, an irrigation distribution system to
serve 100,000 ha, agricultural support services and the construction of
village roads. With the exception of the lining of the main canal, the
project civil engineering works are generally proceeding satisfactorily,
and disbursements are ahead of schedule. Bids for two canal-lining
contracts, opened in March 1972, were unreasonably high, and the Association
and the State Government of Andhra Pradesh agreed that the contracts should
be retendered as one contract. New bids have now been received and are
being evaluated by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The program for agri-
cultural development is seriously behind schedule and is receiving close
attention by the State Government, with assistance and advice from the
Government of India and IDA review missions.
Cr No. 279     Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7,
1972; Closing date: March 31, 1975
The engineering design for this project, for the expansion of
an urea plant in Uttar Pradesh, is now well advanced and equipment estimated
to cost about US$4.0 million has been ordered. Although delivery of some
equipment may take longer than forecast during appraisal, the project is
progressing without serious difficulties.
Cr No. 280     Railways XI; US_$75.0 million credit of January 24, 1972
Closing date: September 30, 1974
This project, consisting of new and ongoing works in the Indian
Railways investment program for three years beginning April 1, 1971, is
progressing in a satisfactory manner. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 294     Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of
March 29, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1978
This credit, which will help to finance the establishment of
wholesale markets in about 50 towms, was declared effective on July 31,
1972. A supervision mission has recently visited the project and has
reported very good progress in the selection, design and appraisal of
individual market sub-projects. Disbursements are expected to begin within
the next few months, ahead of schedule.

Cr No. 312     Population; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972,
Closing date: June 30, 1978
Deadline for effectiveness originally October 17, 1972 has been
further postponed from February 1, 1973 to May 1, 1973, to permit additional
time for the appointment of Directors of Population Centers. Difficulties
