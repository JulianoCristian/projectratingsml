The project\n            consists of the following parts: Vegetable seed components\n            cover facilities for the production, supply and\n            certification of high quality vegetable seeds. These\n            components will include (i) establishment of a seed farm on\n            reclaimed land to the west of the Delta; (ii) assistance to\n            the Ministry of Agriculture's Seed Certification\n            Agency; and (iii) assistance to the Vegetable Research\n            Institute to strengthen research and breeding capacity for\n            breeder and foundation seeds. The drainage component\n            consists of (i) sealing the lining of the Nasr Canal, the\n            main irrigation canal in the NSPC area, and (ii)\n            construction of a 67 km drainage outfall in West Nubariya,\n            to collect drainage water from the seed farm project area\n            and from the surrounding reclaimed lands. Horticultural\n            development components provide storage, transport and\n            packing facilities for four public sector institutions\n            engaged in production, import and export of potatoes, citrus\n            fruit, and other crops."}, "docdt": "1976-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
