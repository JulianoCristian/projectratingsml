1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
  Country and Sector Background: With a population of 8.6 million (2003), a Gross National Income
(GNI) per capita of US$260, a life expectancy of 48 years, and a literacy rate below 50 percent, Chad is
one of the most impoverished countries in the world. On the basis of the 2003 household survey, the
incidence of poverty (defined as the proportion of households with annual spending below what is
necessary to meet minimal food and non-food needs) was estimated at 55 percent of the population. With
annual GoC non-oil revenues of the order of US$250 million (which corresponds to a bit less than 40
percent of total expenditures), Chad's prospects for growth would continue to be limited in the absence of
its oil resources.

General Sector Issues. Chad faced a variety of issues in the energy sector relating to the use of forest
resources, management of the power sector, and development of the petroleum subsector. Chad's primary
domestic energy resource is its forests. The accelerated exploitation of wood had caused deforestation
around major urban areas. Chad's power sector was characterized by high tariffs and limited access to
power supply, as well as unreliability and poor quality (load shedding). GoC interference was constant
and investment was lacking. The petroleum sub-sector faced various major hurdles, relating both to
production and consumption. Even though oil was discovered in Chad about 30 years ago, due to political
instability the fields could not be developed.

Sector issues to be addressed by the project.        Although the primary responsibility for preventing,
avoiding, mitigating, compensating, and monitoring the environmental impacts of the Doba Petroleum
Project was with the project's private operators, GoC had an important role in monitoring the private
operators, and in preventing and responding to the potential environmental and social impacts of the
pipeline project. Specific Chad actions included:

    · monitoring implementation of the mitigating measures by the private sector operators
    · enforcing regulations on pollution control, health, and nature protection
    · mitigating induced impacts in the producing region
    · monitoring environmental and social impacts
    · regulating the sector to provide a sound framework for making petroleum development in Chad
         environmentally sustainable
    · delivering administrative authorizations on the basis of sound technical analysis performed by
         TOTCO and the upstream operator and checked by the CTNSC
     · conducting Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities on environmental
             matters related to the Doba Petroleum Project.

Rationale for Bank assistance:       The driving factor for this project (PSMCBP) was the Doba Petroleum
Project under the Chad/Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project. The Bank had
recognized that Doba Petroleum Project involved issues such as adverse social and environmental impacts
in the producing region, and lack of capacity for social and environmental management. The Bank's
strategy was to help the government to strengthen its capacity for addressing these issues through a
separate technical assistance (TA) project along with Doba Petroleum Project. The PSMCBP thus aimed
to:

(i) Strengthen government capacity to monitor and manage the environmental and social impacts of
development in the petroleum sector, including the preparation of a Government Oil Spill Response Plan.



                                                      1

(ii) Manage induced impacts and provide opportunities to local populations: Rapid intervention social
infrastructure activities were planned to address the expected in-migration into the producing region and a
pilot development fund was set up to finance complementary development activities

(iii) Strengthen GoC's capacity to monitor the activities of private operators in technical, petroleum, and
other areas, as well as to strengthen its capacity to audit these companies effectively so as to maximize
Chad's revenues.

The Project was also consistent with the key objectives of the Chad Country Assistance Strategy1 (CAS)
(February 15, 1996) which were to restore public sector capacity by enhancing the efficiency of GoC
services, focus public expenditures on poverty reduction, and create an environment favorable to private
sector development. The Doba Petroleum Project was expected to generate substantial oil revenue for the
GoC, which was crucial to Chad's central development objective of accelerating economic growth and
reducing poverty.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objectives of the Project were to: (i) strengthen the capacity of Chad to manage the
development of its petroleum resources in an environmentally and socially sound manner, beginning with
the Doba Petroleum Project in southern Chad; (ii) strengthen the capacity of Chad to minimize and
mitigate the potential negative environmental and social impacts of the Doba Petroleum Project on the
producing region; (iii) strengthen local capacity in the region, and provide opportunities for the region's
residents to improve their living conditions; and (iv) establish an effective framework for further sound
private sector investment in the petroleum sector, and engage effectively with such investors.

Key Indicators were:

     (i)     Effective Government monitoring of the implementation of the Doba Petroleum Project
             (including financial and technical aspects).

     (ii)    Effective implementation of the Doba Petroleum Project Environmental Management Plan
             (EMP), in particular as concerns social impact aspects.

     (iii)   Social infrastructure improvements in the producing region.

     (iv)    Substantially increased Government dealings with potential new private investors.


The formulation of the PDO in the DCA is different than the one contained in the PAD. The PAD PDO
guided projected implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)


     · Local populations.       The Project was expected to mitigate any negative impact of the Doba
         Petroleum Project on the local environment and populations in the producing region, thus
         reducing the potential for social conflicts. The net environmental impacts were expected to be
         positive. To this end, the Project would: (a) finance social infrastructure and set up a Pilot
         Development Fund to finance additional development activities in the region; and (b) provide
         training to upgrade the capacity and skills of the Comité Technique National de Suivi et de
         Controle (CTNSC) and Ministry of Environment and Water (MEWR) to manage the Doba
         Petroleum Project's environmental and social impacts.

     · Civil society. The Project aimed to foster a more participatory approach to development, with
         civil society involved in the preparation and implementation.

     · The GoC. The Project was designed to strengthen the capacity of the GoC to manage the
         technical, financial, and fiscal aspects of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and
         Pipeline Project, and of other petroleum projects in Chad.

     · Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Petroleum (MMEP). The Project was also expected to increase
         the country's ability to develop further its petroleum sector by strengthening the capacity of the
         MMEP.

     · New investors. Improvements in sector management were expected to increase investment by the
         private oil companies operating in Chad and to attract new investors to undertake hydrocarbon
         exploration under a new environmental legal framework in an environmentally and socially sound
         manner, so that the sector could be developed on a sustainable basis.

(a). Strengthening the environmental and social regulatory framework applicable to petroleum
development activities in Chad, building on the lessons of the Doba Petroleum Project.

(b). Strengthening Chad's capacity to manage the technical aspects of the sector by creating an effective
petroleum sector information management system. Specific actions included: training, database
management, promotion activities and technical assistance to enhance Chad's capacity to attract, negotiate,
and otherwise to engage effectively with potential investors in the sector.

In hindsight Project design proved to be extremely complex, especially for a country with limited
institutional capacity like Chad. Although Government's average skills and capacity levels were known at
the time of Project preparation, their importance and impact on project implementation costs and civil
servants' absorptive capacity (availability and learning curve) were underestimated in the Project design.
The Bank should have avoided including too many activities and trying to address several sector issues in
a single TA project. More emphasis should have been put on training and capacity building and ensuring
coherence between the project and the institutional goals and responsibilities. Also, limited funding was
reserved for training at the concept stage. The Project envisaged to hire a consultant to design a training
plan. Instead, funding was used for ad-hoc training that did not respond to medium/long term career
planning and/or sector policy objectives.

Similarly, some risks were not thoroughly assessed, notably institutional and fiduciary capacities. Further,
the project design could have been stronger in the framework and sequencing for building capacity: there
could have been greater clarity on what functions and what type of strengthening were needed and their
timings (with milestones linked to the construction phase), and also an agreement on areas where
"temporary substitution" may have been the way to go just to cope with the accelerated pace of
construction while sustainable capacity was being built.

The mitigating measures that were envisaged at Project design proved to be weak. Bank's support could
supplement, but not substitute for, the GoC's/Project's lack of human and financial resources. In order to
preserve the GoC's sense of ownership, Bank's direct intervention should have been time-limited. In


                                                     4

retrospect, it has become evident that linking the implementation of a capacity building project to the
implementation of a large engineering project such as the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Project was not practicable or realistic in a country with limited human resources and capacity.


1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
There were no changes in the project's design, and scope and scale. However, there were changes in the
Project's schedule, implementation arrangements, and funding allocation as detailed below:

Project Schedule. The closing date of the Project was revised twice. The first extension of four months -
from December 31, 2005 to April 30, 2006 ­ was granted in order to allow sufficient time to finalize the
preparation of a Supplemental Grant. The closing date was further extended until December 31, 2006 to
allow completion of ongoing activities following the lifting of suspension of the country's portfolio in July
2006.
Institutional Arrangements. In September 2004, the GoC informed that Bank that the National
Coordination, which previously reported to the Office of the President, would report to the Ministry of
Petroleum.

Funding allocations. In October 2005, the Minister of Plan requested a reallocation of funds among
expenditure categories under the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) to address significant overruns
experienced under the consultant services/training/audit expenditure category (approximately 40 percent
over the original allocation). The overruns were due in large part to circumstances beyond the GoC's
control. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the Euro/FCFA had a major impact on project funds,
creating a shortfall in financial resources. The consultant services/training/audit expenditure category was
particularly affected due to the lack of relevant local expertise and the consequent use of international
service providers. The faster than anticipated pace of implementation of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum
Development and Pipeline Project forced increased the level of legal and technical assistance required by
the Project Implementing Units to effectively monitor the project. This led to increased costs, especially
with regard to monitoring of compliance with the EMP, and communication/dissemination activities. In
addition, the negotiation of the Permit H, which occurred in 2004 -one year ahead of schedule, resulted in
further unexpected increase in legal and technical assistance to the DPU.

Supplemental Grant. The credit was virtually committed by mid-2003, as priority was given to setting up
the field units in Doba and upgrading the skills of the Doba Project Unit (DPU). In addition, the Project
faced a financial shortfall for the reasons mentioned above.

The GoC officially requested a Supplemental Grant (US$10 million) in July 2004, in order to: (i) cover
outstanding needs; (ii) consolidate the capacity building efforts; and (iii) ensure the sustainability of the
environmental and petroleum units created under the Project.

During the time the GoC was building consensus on the Supplemental Grant, the management of the
sector had been made more challenging as: (i) the GoC's promotional strategy had led to the signing of
new exploration contracts; and (ii) Esso had obtained five new development and production permits. The
GoC's delay in fulfilling the conditions precedent for the presentation of the Supplemental Grant to the
Board (namely counterpart funding, procurement plan and letter of sector strategy 2005-2008) led to the
continuous slippage of the date of the supplemental operation.

Meanwhile, the GoC decided to unilaterally amend the Petroleum Revenue Management Law (PRML)
which was adopted by Parliament on December 29, 2005. This amendment was in noncompliance with
the Loan Agreement which stated that "the Petroleum Revenue Management Law shall not be amended or
waived so as to materially and adversely affect the implementation of the Program." The amendments to
the Law broadened the definition of priority sectors to include, among other areas, security and territorial
administration. World Bank management then decided on January 6, 2006, to suspend all disbursements
under the active portfolio in Chad, which automatically triggered the freezing of the movement of certain
Chadian oil revenues within the escrow account structure in London. As a result of the interim agreement
reached between the Bank and the GoC, the suspension of disbursements was lifted on April 26, 2006 on
all suspended IDA projects other than this project which remained under suspension. Then, the Escrow
Account was partially unfrozen. In July 2006 the GoC and the Bank signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU), under which the Government agreed to (i) prepare a revised PRSP by 2008 as a
permanent framework for allocating resources to priority sectors; (ii) apply specific allocations rules for
2007 and develop a stabilization mechanism to even out substantial year-on-year variations in projected
oil revenue; and (iii) strengthen public finance management as well as the role of the Collège.. Based on
the MoU the GoC revised its budget for 2006 to allocate 70 percent of direct oil revenues to poverty
reduction priority sectors (excluding security and territorial administration). This led to a decision to fully
unfreeze the Escrow Account and to lift the suspension of disbursement on the project. By that time,
several important changes had occurred which warranted the re-design of the operation. In particular, the
national oil company was created and the debate on its role vis-à-vis other agencies and sector ministries
was proving controversial. The PIUs had almost entirely lost their staff due to lack of funding and the
GoC's reluctance to maintain the Project's institutional set up. In addition, agreement on a new sector
policy letter ­ a condition for obtaining additional funds - had never been reached between the GoC and
the Bank.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry




                                                     6

The Project became effective on 03/23/2001, nine months after its approval by the Board. The delay was
due to disagreements between the GoC and the Bank on the Project's institutional structure, as well as
difficulties in staffing the PIUs.

The Project design took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted projects in the energy
sector in Chad and other countries. Risks were highlighted and mitigating measures were outlined and,
wherever possible, adopted. A participatory approach was also adopted by involving the key stakeholders
during Project preparation.

A. Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects. (a) Implementing civil service reforms
is a key governance condition for technical assistance to succeed and be used effectively; (b) Community
and civil society participation should be actively sought in the design of the rapid intervention measures,
the regional development plans, and the pilot development funds; (c)In order to build its own capacity, the
government should be fully engaged in the preparation of the project; and (d) A technical assistance
project attached to an active and promising sector has a good chance to succeed.

B. Risks and their mitigation. The project faced the following modest risks and the measures
mentioned below were taken to mitigate them:

Risk 1: GoC and Private Sponsors are not committed and do not have the capacity to implement
a sound Environmental Management Plan (EMP). Mitigating measure: Conditionality agreed to in
the context of the Chad-Cameroun Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project.

Risk 2: Weak collaboration among stakeholders (Government, NGOs, Private Sponsors).
Mitigating measure: Ongoing dialogue and specific consultative activities; FACIL (Fonds d 'Actions
Concertées d 'Initiative Locale) to support dialogue and participation.

Risk 3: Government does not make best use of trained Chadians. Mitigating measure: Project
provided for enhanced working conditions.

Risk 4: Weakening in continued Government commitment and capacity (including financial) to
strengthen the sector. Mitigating measure: Support provided by the Bank, and linkage to effective
implementation of the Chad-Cameroun Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project.

C. Adequacy of participatory processes. Key stakeholders, within and without Chad, were consulted
during Project preparation. This provided comfort to the GoC's and Bank's task team that their concerns
were taken into consideration, and suitable measures were devised to address them. Public consultation
has been the hallmark of the implementation of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline
Project. People living in the area where the oil wells were planned to be drilled and alongside the pipeline
route were consulted during the preparation of the Environmental Assessment, particularly in the context
of compensation and relocation.

2.2 Implementation

Although the Project was not restructured, its implementation was often at risk for the reasons discussed
below.

In October 2003 the Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) to assess implementation and determine
if corrective actions were needed to ensure the successful completion of the Project. The MTR



                                                     7

highlighted the need to strengthen project management and to refocus the Project from infrastructure
building to training and capacity building. One of the key conclusions of the MTR was the need to review
the Project's institutional set up with the objective to facilitate the mainstreaming of Project's activities
and to ensure their sustainability going forward. This was one key component of the then proposed
Supplemental Grant.

The Project faced the following issues during implementation:

Factors outside the control of the government or of the PIU

Positive Factor. Technical assistance and other types of support provided by bilateral donors and
NGOs contributed to the achievements of the FACIL activities.

Negative Factors

(i) Depreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis the Euro and the FCFA resulted in a deficit of about US$3.6
million and reduced the funds available for the Project.

(ii) The unexpected increased level of legal and technical assistance to the DPU, estimated at US$1.2
million, which could not have been anticipated at Project preparation. This was needed to: (a) negotiate
the renewal of the Consortium's Permit H, which occurred one year ahead of schedule; and (b) provide
feed-back on the Doba blend market price and its relation to the global level of oil prices, which was
made necessary by the dramatic evolution of the international petroleum market.

(iii) Accelerated project implementation. In the six months leading up to the inauguration of the pipeline
in October 2003 (completed one year ahead of schedule), the project came under extreme pressure to
accelerate the pace of implementation in order to cope with the Consortium's fast tracking of construction.
As a consequence, the capacity-constrained PIUs had to significantly accelerate their activities. This in
some cases led to the disregard of World Bank procurement procedures (contracts awarded without the
Bank's non-objection) and resulted in a substantial increase in Project implementation costs. In addition,
ineligible expenditures were financed with IDA resources drawn from the Project's special accounts. In
order to remedy these shortcomings, a detailed action plan was drawn up by the Bank's procurement and
disbursement specialists during the October 2003 MTR and agreed with the authorities. Ineligible
expenditures were settled by the GoC in October 2005 as certified by the World Bank Financial
Management Specialist.

(iv) Low level of capacity. One of the main challenges facing Chad is the relatively low average skills
level compared to other countries in the sub-region. This can be attributed partly to the long series of
political crises, and armed conflicts, and partly to the dearth of local training institutions. Although these
elements were known at the time of Project preparation, their importance, and impact on Project
implementation costs and civil servants' absorptive capacity (availability and learning curve), had been
underestimated.

(v) High turnover of Task Team Leaders (TTLs) and composition of the Bank team. A year after the
Project became effective, the Bank strengthened its supervision team by appointing a new TTL based in
Washington, with overall responsibility for all Projects linked to the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum
Development and Pipeline Projects. The TTL was supported by a resident country manager. In October
2004 a new TTL, already a member of the Bank's Project supervision team was appointed. His tenure
lasted for approximately one year, when another team member succeeded him as Project TTL. Although
the effect of frequent changes in TTLs was mitigated by the appointment of team members, these created


                                                      8

a certain lack of continuity and different approaches to supervision. Until October 2003 the task team did
not include sector specialist. A petroleum specialist and an environmental specialist joined the team
during the MTR. As a result, during the first three years, the Project was implemented on an ad-hoc basis,
without any particular emphasis on appropriate technical guidelines and expertise. By the time the
specialists joined the task team, the majority of the funds had been spent on infrastructure projects, and
little was left for capacity building activities in these two sectors.

Factors subject to Government's or PIU's control

(i) Fluctuating government commitment. As mentioned in Section 5.2, there were many instances during
implementation which demonstrated government's fluctuating commitment. For instance, although there
was a strong government buy-in at the design stage, the Project faced opposition in the initial stages of
implementation, which hampered its progress. It took about a year for the Bank to convince the
authorities on the importance of improving GoC capacity in the petroleum and environment sectors. In the
final stages of Project implementation, the GoC's unilateral decision to change of the PRML affected the
dialogue with the Bank and other donors. As a result the parties focused their efforts on solving the crises,
to the detriment of Project implementation activities.

(ii) High turn-over in project's staff. There was a high turnover of staff in the PIUs. This was
attributable partly to the frequent re-assignment of staff trained under the Project to other
ministries/departments, and partly to the higher level of salaries paid by the private sector that attracted
Project staff. This could have been partially corrected by the GoC by designing and implementing
targeted career plans.

(iii) Liquidity crisis. Chad faced a severe liquidity crisis beginning in late 2003, resulting in large arrears
in the payment of salaries and accounts payable, which in turn led to significant social and political
pressures, particularly since the public could not be convinced that such a situation would occur at a time
when Chad had just become an oil-exporting country. There were also arrears in servicing debt to
international institutions, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).                The
liquidity crisis was precipitated by the IMF's decision not to conclude its review of the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) in January 2004. This forfeited disbursement of SDR5.2 million from the
IMF, and created delays in mobilizing donors' budgetary support, and in counterpart funding.

(iv) Emphasis on building physical infrastructure. Physical infrastructure construction and detailed
design studies completed before first oil in October 2003 diverted some resources from the overall focus
on training. This was mainly in response to strong political pressure and a solid rationale to finance
physical infrastructure in order to show the impact of the Project to communities and the citizenry at
large.

(v) Lack of coordination between the CTNSC and DPU. Despite the presence of National Coordination,
there was a lack of coordination between the CTNSC and DPU. Tension occurred between the two
agencies while conducting environmental and operational monitoring in the field, exacerbating
preexisting differences. The lack of enthusiasm of some of the Project personnel, particularly within
DPU, to interact with their counterpart in the CTNSC for Project activities where coordination was
critical, affected the Project's implementation start-up.

(vi) FACIL's slow start up. FACIL had a slow start due to the lengthy recruitment of qualified personnel
in 2001-2002 and poor cash flow management by the CTNSC, which delayed the provision of necessary
funding. Some difficulties were also encountered in the collection of beneficiary contributions, largely
because of the decline of cotton revenues. In addition, the high salaries offered by the Consortium during
the construction phase of the pipeline resulted in a shortage of competent masons and local contractors.


                                                         9

(vii) National Coordination. The transfer of the National Coordination from the Office of the President to
the Ministry of Petroleum ­ decided by the GoC in September 2004 - undermined its ability to act as an
effective entry point to address all matters related to the Chad-Cameroun Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Project, particularly during the construction period. While the coordination was still in place,
staff was reporting both to their respective ministries (Petroleum and Environment) and to the National
Coordinator, creating confusion and leading to delays and deficient information flows.

(ix) Problems related to Supplemental Grant. The delay in approving supplemental financing (initially
expected to be approved by September 2004) and therefore in making resources available, led to a
complete cessation of most activities during the period, with some critical exceptions, such as the
monitoring of environment impacts, the monitoring of crude volumes sold by the Consortium and the
design of an integrated reporting system for exploration and production.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E Design. (i) The Consortium was expected to publish semi-annual progress reports on the status
of implementation of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project; (ii)
representatives of the various ministries benefiting from the project (including MMEP, MEWR, Finance,
Planning, and Health, among others) and the Bank would meet once or twice each year to review progress
on the implementation of the project; and (iii) MTR was planned to take place approximately two years
after credit effectiveness, (iv) the International Advisory Group was meant to publish a report on the
status of implementation of all projects linked to the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Project; and (v) the Bank team was meant to prepare a semi-annual report to the Board on the
country situation and status of implementation of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Project and related capacity building and technical assistance projects.

The CTNSC was expected to monitor the state of the environment in the Doba oil field area and along the
pipeline. Measurements of the quality of air and water, as well as of the health status of non-workers
within the project area, were to be made. These measurements would be based on analyses conducted on
an ad hoc basis by specialized laboratories and consultants employed by the CTNSC. The CTNSC would
also conduct and publish the results of surveys to monitor the economic status of persons having been
resettled and on the status of financial compensation. In addition, the CTNSC would report periodically
on progress made on environmental management in the Doba region and along the pipeline by publishing
the results of pre-selected performance criteria.

The MIS was the instrument chosen to collect social and environmental data in areas affected by
exploration and production activities. The CTNSC was responsible for its set up and maintenance. The
two main purposes of the MIS were: (i) to monitor the existing social infrastructure and the correlated
socio-economic indicators to allow, along with the defined eligibility criteria, sound planning of the
activities to be undertaken, and (ii) to set mutually agreed, realistic, and clear indicators for each activity,
and to measure gaps between actual and targeted objectives. An operating manual dedicated to
monitoring would describe responsibilities, the contents of the semi-annual reports, the procedures to feed
the system, and the software package.

(b) M&E implementation. The task team held meetings regularly with the Ministries of Petroleum and
Environment, National Coordination, the CTNSC, and DPU to review the Project's implementation
progress. Quarterly reports were prepared on the Project's implementation status until 2004. In addition,
the Bank conducted an MTR in October 2003. In addition, the TTL and the country manager held regular



                                                      10

meetings with the Prime Minister, the office of the President, the Minister of Plan and the Minister of
Finance.

Environmental monitoring. In the early stages of implementation, the CTNSC's monitoring and
evaluation function lacked the capacity to perform environmental monitoring at a level that met the
desired purpose of the Doba petroleum project monitoring system. Prominent problems included the lack
of:: (i) a sufficiently trained team of monitors; (ii) an Environmental Management Information System
(Système de Gestion de l'Information Environnementale, SGIE); (iii) scientific rigor in monitoring; (iv)
systematic organization to select and conduct monitoring events; and (v) ability to make independent
measurements. However, the CTNSC's monitoring capacity increased during implementation but this was
not sustained. In addition, the CTNSC greatly benefited from the reports produced by the External
Compliance Monitoring Group (ECMG) which were the basis for their on-the-job training.

Petroleum monitoring. The DPU was expected to prepare quarterly reports on the status of Project
implementation with respect to activities under the DPU's responsibility. Even though there was no
formal reporting system, monitoring was done on a regular basis, and the report was prepared and
submitted to the TTL quarterly to 2005. DPU had a large team of site supervisors for monitoring drilling
and exploration activities, and a daily and weekly monitoring and information system had been developed
for the Ministry of Petroleum's internal use. In addition, ten inspectors were deployed in the field to
monitor produced and shipped quantities. Four inspectors were permanently on board the FSO and the
offloading vessel to monitor ­ together with Cameroonian custom's officials - the measurement of
exported quantities. Their tasks were to compare manual gauging with automated measurements, and to
ensure that the automated system on board the FSO was not tampered with.              The GoC had also
commissioned an audit to verify the calibration of the meters. In addition, the DPU carried out regular
analysis of royalties and other economic variables, and ensured the launch and supervision of
performance of external auditors. Audit of the Consortium's cost were conducted on an annual basis until
2005 (when the project exhausted its funding).

(c) M&E utilization. Because the MIS was not properly developed, implemented or maintained, the
CTNSC experienced difficulties in collecting social and environmental data, analyzing and utilizing them
for decision making and resource allocation. The DPU was reasonably effective in collecting exploration
and production data and monitoring the compliance of the Consortium with the Convention. Software was
developed by a consultant to assist the DPU in assessing the price of the Doba blend vis-à-vis its marker
crude, the Brent Blend, and transport tariff was regularly monitored using an excel program developed by
TOTCO/COTCO which compliance with the transportation contracts had been verified by a consultant
hired by the DPU. Finally, annual audits allowed the Ministry of Petroleum/DPU to seek adjustments to
the Consortium's costs. Both the CTNSC and the DPU introduced an incentive structure to motivate the
inspectors and site supervisors to improve their performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard issues. Being a Technical Assistance (TA) project, there were no deviations or waivers from
the Bank safeguards policies and procedures during the implementation of the Project.

Fiduciary issues. The project had the following fiduciary issues:

          (i) Ineligible expenditures. The CTNSC and DPU withdrew ineligible expenditures (FCFA 126
              million) from their Special Accounts, mainly because of the delay on the part of the GoC in
              making prepayments from the national counterpart funds. Ineligible expenditures were,
              however, repaid by the GoC in October 2005, and supporting documentation for eligible



                                                     11

             expenditures paid by the country's treasury was used to offset the required counterpart
             funding, in compliance with OP 12.00, Disbursement.

         (ii) Outstanding balance in two Special Accounts. The outstanding amounts of 106.67 million
             FCFA in the Special Account of DPU and 230.89 million FCFA in the Special Account of the
             CTNSC (a total of US$700,000) have not been refunded by the GoC at the time of the
             preparation of this report.

         (iii) Expenditure exceeding the Credit. The GoC had spent about $2 million more than the
             Credit resources. The over commitment was caused mainly because of the lack of monitoring
             of commitments. In line with Bank procedures, it is the GoC's responsibility to settle
             outstanding unpaid invoices.

         (iv) Refunded amount from NGOs under FACIL. An amount of 20 million FCFA (US$40,000)
             was refunded by the NGOs to the CTNSC. This amount which should have been reimbursed
             by the CTNSC to the project by December 31, 2004, is still outstanding. This issue will be
             addressed in the 2006 Audit Report.

         (v) Violation of Credit Agreement in Procurement. During the implementation, there were
             many instances when both the CTNSC and DPU did not comply with the terms of the Credit
             Agreement in procurement activities. Main issues included: (a) non-observance of
             procedures; (b) fragmenting the bidding (Fractionnement des marchés); (c) excessive use of
             single-source contracting; (d) exceeding the ceiling amount for the restricted consultation; (e)
             abusive use of the method of restricted consultation; and (f) absence or non-observance of the
             procurement plan.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a) Transition arrangements:

    National Coordination: The bureau was created to facilitate the coordination of oversight and
    implementation activities related to the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project.
    Since then, the relevant sector ministries ­ Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Petroleum, and
    Ministry of Finance ­ have been strengthened and are able to play a more active role. The role of the
    National Coordination has become less crucial and its future is currently under consideration.

    Ministry of Environment: Being a priority sector, environment related activities receive additional
    funding from oil revenue under the state budget. This allows the Ministry of Environment to ensure
    the continuity of those M&E activities previously funded by the Project. In particular, the Ministry of
    Environment ­ through the CTNSC ­ will continue to ensure the monitoring of exploration and
    production activities and the evaluation of their physical, socio-economic, and health impacts. To
    mainstream the work of the CTNSC and ensure its long term sustainability the Ministry of
    Environment has envisaged the creation of an agency that will specialize in reviewing and monitoring
    the implementation of EMPs with a focus on oil and gas activities. The proposed institutional
    improvement is currently awaiting presidential approval. In addition to state funding, the Ministry of
    Environment has sought the contribution of the EU with regard to the funding of training programs.

    The implementation of a suitable Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) is also
    under consideration, although no detailed action and/or funding mechanism has been finalized by the
    authorities.



                                                    12

    Ministry of Petroleum: M&E activities that were previously carried out by the DPU have been
    gradually integrated into the relevant ministerial departments. In particular, revenue forecast, and
    price, discount and transport tariff monitoring have been entrusted to the Department of Economics
    and Petroleum Legislation. The monitoring of exploration and production activities is carried out by
    the Department of Exploration and Production. The majority of the project personnel, including the
    petroleum inspectors have been integrated into the relevant ministerial departments.

    The Ministry of Petroleum has found it difficult to mobilize sufficient funding to carry out its day-to-
    day activities and strategic functions. Although petroleum is considered a priority sector, the portion
    of expenditure financed with oil revenue remains low compared to other priority ministries. The per-
    capita salary of the Ministry is at the low end of the scale compared to other ministries, suggesting
    that the current profile of its human resources may not be suited to manage the increasing complexity
    of the sector, and the important reforms recently announced by the Government (national oil company,
    introduction of petroleum sharing contracts, construction of a medium size refinery, etc). The salary
    and incentive structure currently applicable to civil service makes it difficult for the Ministry to attract
    the right caliber personnel. The lack of financial and human resources has hindered the Ministry's
    capacity to continue the training program and recruit the technical expertise that is required to design
    and implement urgent institutional and legal reforms.

(b) Performance indicator:

    Ministry of Environment: The Ministry is currently preparing appropriate performance indicators on
    geo-physical, forest resources, health, and other relevant areas, by which the sector can be monitored
    and evaluated in the future.

    Ministry of Petroleum: The development of an integrated monitoring and evaluation system for all
    petroleum assets is one of the activities envisaged under the petroleum sector capacity building and
    technical assistance follow on operation. Economic and technical indicators have been developed
    with respect to producing concessions, and are currently used by the Ministry. These will need to be
    further developed and regular monitoring and updating procedures will need to be strengthened.

(c) Lessons incorporated in the arrangements for post-completion operation. Based on the lessons
    learned from the project, the Bank has advised the GoC to adopt the following measures:
    · Ensure that audits of petroleum and transportation companies are regularly carried out;
    · Improve the cooperation between the Ministry of Petroleum and the Ministry of Environment for
        both exploration and production activities;
    · Establish a stricter cooperation between the Ministry of Petroleum and the Ministry of Finance to
        improve the quality of the revenue forecast and to ensure that payments due to the state by oil
        companies are promptly and correctly received and accounted for;
    · Improve sector governance through the establishment of institutions and a legal framework that
        favor a clear separation between policy, implementation and monitoring responsibilities;
    · Define training activities and career plans that respond to short term needs as well as medium
        term policy and institutional goals.
    · Ensure adequate funding and access to technical expertise is available before undertaking crucial
        sector reforms.

(d) Follow-on project. The GoC has recently requested IDA support to prepare a new operation to
    address the outstanding issues. The new operation is expected to be financed in the form of a grant of
    US$8 million, complemented by GoC funds for up to US$8 million. The new project could help the
    GoC to design and implement the most urgent institutional and governance reforms, some of which



                                                     13

    were already identified during the preparation of the Supplemental Grant. These would include the
    restructuring of the institutions entrusted with the oversight of the petroleum sector ­ Ministry of
    Environment, Ministry of Petroleum, National Coordination, the CTNSC, and DPU, the setting up of
    the national oil company ­ role, objectives, funding, corporate governance, and the upgrading of the
    legal and regulatory framework for the management of petroleum operations and their impact on the
    environment.

(e) Suggested impact evaluation. In order to properly assess the results of this Project and their
    sustainability over time, it is suggested that an impact evaluation be carried out three years from its
    closing.



3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective of the Project is still important to the country's social and economic development. It is also
timely and appropriate to the needs of Chad. The Project is also consistent with the Bank's current CAS
for Chad, the over-arching objective of which is to help Chad make the best possible developmental use
of its new oil revenues (and public resources more broadly) as it strives to attain the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). One of the two pillars of this CAS is strengthening governance, including
institutional arrangements for public resource management and service delivery, the rule of law, and
environmental and social safeguards for oil exploitation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Moderately Satisfactory. Overall, the Project is rated moderately satisfactory in terms of its development
objective (DO). Although most of the project activities were completed, the institutional and legal
frameworks necessary to ensure the sustainable and competitive development of the sector could not,
however, be fully developed. Capacity constraints of the administration and lack of political support for
key governance measures remained the main weakness, which the follow on project aims to address.


The project's major outcomes and achievements are as follows:

(i) Managing the development of Chad petroleum resources in an environmentally and socially sound
manner:

    · The CTNSC was successful in monitoring the operations of the Chad/Cameroon Petroleum
         Development and Pipeline Project during the construction phase and to a lesser extent during the
         operation phase;

    · The CTNSC's socio-environmental field-supervision team steadily improved its capacity during
         project implementation. Twenty four field staff members, including the CTNSC site supervisor,
         an international environment expert, and six technical experts (in biophysics, socioeconomics,
         and health) supervised the Consortium's socio-environmental activities. However the CTNSC
         was unable to retain its staff due to lack of funding.

    · The CTNSC had gained credibility in its dialogue with the Consortium through its technical
         reviews of the successive environmental packages submitted by the Consortium for new fields.




                                                       14

     · Supervision conducted by the CTNSC allowed it to form the basis of operational criteria of EMP
       principles, which were later formalized into environmental guidelines applicable to all oil fields
       developed in Chad. By developing a template and standardizing the guidelines for environmental
       assessments of exploration and production activities, the CTNSC was able to streamline the
       approval procedure and also to reduce the cost of compliance, both for the CTNSC and the
       consortium/operator.

     · In addition to its core mission of monitoring the Consortium's implementation of the EMP for the
       Doba Fields, the main focus of the CTNSC's work was the review of the EIA package submitted
       by the Consortium in respect of two satellites fields in the Doba basin (Moundouli, Nya, and
       Maikeri), and the exploration drilling in the Bongor and Lake Chad basins. The dialogue between
       Exxon and the CTNSC as well as the relevance of the memos reviewing successive EIA packages
       demonstrated that the CTNSC had truly gained credibility and developed sufficient technical
       capacity to review EIAs and to propose amendments where necessary. In particular, better
       mitigation measures and site specific EMPs where devised and implemented by the Consortium
       on the request of the CTNSC.

     · The expertise acquired by the DPU's petroleum inspectors trained by the Project was very useful
       in ensuring that appropriate quality and quantity control procedures were applied to all exports of
       crude oil from Chad. The DPU's site supervisors trained by the Project to oversee the
       construction activities related to the implementation of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum
       Development and Pipeline Project have substantially improved their operational knowledge and
       their ability to oversee the development of other petroleum projects in Chad.

     · Knowledge gained from the Project's training programs and the hands-on experience from the
       Project have considerably improved the Ministries of Petroleum and Environment's ability to
       oversee the day-to-day and strategic aspects of the management of the petroleum sector.

     · Even though many of those who had been trained under the Project had either joined the private
       sector, or were reassigned to other departments, the spill-over effect has benefited the country as
       a whole. Local consulting firms and local businesses that hired or were created by Project staff
       benefit from the transfer of knowledge. In addition, the higher working standards imposed by the
       Consortium have increased the quality of local goods and services and their potential
       competitiveness for future export.

     · Civil society and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) too have acquired expertise in the
       supervision of environmental and social aspects of big projects. For example, the NGO
       consortium Coordination Permanente Pétrole Locale (CPPL) included development NGOs,
       human rights associations, trade unions, and women's groups in the producing area. This group
       played an important role in monitoring the Consortium's activities on the ground. It collaborated
       with and informed the Bank, the GoC, and the ECMG of concerns about some Consortium
       activities.

     Achievement of this objective is Moderately Satisfactory.

(ii) Minimizing and mitigating potential negative environmental and social impacts on the producing
region:

     · The GoC's capacity was strengthened and co-ordination with the Consortium was improved to
       manage land use issues to the benefit of local people and newcomers alike. At Komé Atan, the



                                                   15

  CTNSC worked on a development plan with the local communities to assure that locally
  sustainable water supply and sanitation measures were put in place. In areas where villages
  neighbor large project footprints, the Consortium took a more holistic community approach,
  rather than a narrow household-by-household perspective. The ECMG archaeological specialist
  has noted major improvements with the management of archaeological material in Chad. The
  Chad/Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project was implemented in accordance
  with the environmental and social guidelines initially established for this project. Regarding the
  oilfield facilities, all three of the project's oilfields were brought online without any major non
  compliance events.

· CTNSC's reviews of successive environmental and social packages forced the Consortium to
  develop better mitigation measures.

· Prevention campaigns financed by the Project have helped in raising awareness on Sexually
  Transmitted Diseases (STD)/HIV/AIDS among truckers and other high-risk categories of the
  population. The Project also contributed to the development of a strategic approach on a regional
  scale and carried out successful training programs to: (i) political and administrative authorities,
  including Prefects, Under Prefects, Chiefs of Canton, Chiefs of villages; (ii) doctors and nurses
  on dispensation of various services; (iii) obstetricians and marriage counselors; and (iv)
  organizers of AFRlCARE, liaison officers of Esso, village health officials of ACODE.

· Infrastructure works carried out under the Project helped improving health care, sanitation
  services, and access to clean water in the producing region, thus mitigating the social and
  environmental impact of in-migration of workers from neighboring areas.

· In order to mitigate the effect of accidental discharges of hydrocarbon, an oil spill response plan
  remains to be approved and implementing regulation to be developed.

· The Project was instrumental in raising awareness of the public on health and social impacts of
  the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project. This was achieved through
  radio and television campaigns carried out regularly to provide updates to the general public on
  the progress made in the construction of the pipeline and related facilities. Public consultations
  and information campaigns regularly conducted in the producing region and in N'Djaména
  helped to improve the dialogue with civil society.

· The project financed the development and introduction of sustainable forest management
  practices in six pilot villages. The results became a reference for wider implementation.

· The Regional Development Plan (RDP) was prepared as a framework for analyzing the economic
  structure of the oil-producing region, identifying opportunities and investment options in
  infrastructure, human development and public facilities. The Plan is currently being submitted to
  the Council of Ministries for approval. It will serve as a guiding framework to select projects to
  be financed by the 5 percent oil royalty allocation set forth in the Constitution and in the project
  agreement. Both local and national stakeholders were involved in the initial consultations and
  their views were integrated into a final plan, building on previous studies. Adoption of the plan
  has however been slow.

· The Regional Space Applications Program for Sustainable Development was launched among the
  communities of the Moyen Chari region. The Program facilitated the involvement of local NGOs
  during the implementation phase by creating a network of local communities. The network's
  purpose was to raise awareness among local communities of issues related to the potential socio-
  economic and footprint of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project. The
  network was particularly effective in disseminating information related to the status of


                                                 16

         implementation of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project and related
         environmental protection/mitigation measures.


     Achievement of this objective is Satisfactory.


(iii) Strengthening local capacity in the region and providing opportunities for the region's residents to
improve their living conditions:

     · FACIL micro-credit projects contributed to the social development of the region. For example,
         loans given to 8000 people in 10 cantons and three communes, for carrying out various activities
         (such as marketing of cereals; purchasing agricultural equipment, transforming the agricultural
         products, and cattle breeding) contributed to generate new employments, increase household
         incomes, and improve the standard of living in these communities.

     · Activities financed by the FACIL such as the construction of 29 buildings in 11 school
         establishments, and 58 additional class rooms made it possible to substantially increase the
         number of enrollments. Similarly, construction and/or the rehabilitation of seven bridges, and
         rehabilitation drinking water supply system helped to provide opportunities for the region's
         residents to improve their living conditions:

     · Training courses on different topics (such as poultry breeding, and masonry) were instrumental to
         enhancing the professional competence and skills of about 500 people, improving the commercial
         value of their products, and increasing their incomes.

     · The creation and management of credit and savings banks in nine cantons in the producing region
         led to mobilization of local savings and fostering development activities.


     Achievement of this objective is Satisfactory.


(iv) Establishing an effective framework for further sound private investment in the petroleum sector,
and engaging effectively with such investors:

     · Training and Capacity-building:

         Since the start of the project, considerable efforts were made in training the DPU's staff, as well
         as key staff of the Ministry of Petroleum and Ministry of Finance (MOF). Due to the complexities
         of the agreements governing the exploration and production of the Doba fields, as well as the sale
         and transportation of the crude, three technical assistance agreements with international
         consultancy firms were signed by the MP/DPU. All contracts included substantial training
         components.

          Workshops were held for the benefit of the DPU and of the MP's Economic Department on
          topics ranging from crude oil price forecast, crude oil trading and determination of discounts and
          premia, petroleum economics, petroleum contracts, petroleum accounting and fiscal terms.

          Technical training was provided to the GoC's petroleum inspectors responsible for the
          monitoring of production from the oil field and its delivery to the Floating Storage and
          Offloading vessel in Kribi. Geologist, petroleum engineers, geophysicists, and drilling engineers
          attended specialized courses.



                                                      17

    · Determination of the price differential:

        The Project provided assistance to the GoC in understanding the determinants of the price
        differential between the Doba Blend and its reference crude ­ the Brent Blend. The market price
        of the hydrocarbons sold by the Consortium is an important variable for the purpose of
        calculating both the royalties and the income tax due to the GoC. The procedure for determining
        the market price is clearly defined in the Convention Agreement between the GoC and the
        Consortium. In accordance with the Convention, GoC's approval is required to determine the net-
        back for royalty calculation. The Doba blend is a dense, high acid crude. Mainly due to its poor
        characteristics the Doba sells at a discount to Brent.

        To assess the price of the Doba blend, the GoC developed a model based on the determination of
        the refinery margin Linear Planning (LP) Model. The model, which is an adaptation of the well-
        known Petroleum Argus, was developed by technical advisers financed by the project, and
        requires daily input of crude oil prices and freight costs. To double-check the results of the model,
        the Bank was asked to provide its assistance in the determination of the price differential. The
        Bank developed a model based on the observation of monthly crude price variations over a period
        of four years and their relationship with quality differentials. The results of the Bank's model
        confirmed the average size and trend of the observed price differentials, and were generally in
        line with the results of the LP Model.

        By introducing the LP Model, the project provided the possibility for the GoC to verify the
        market price of the Doba blend obtained by the Consortium, and supported negotiations for a
        higher market price in those cases where the discount proposed by the Consortium was higher
        than the `floor discount' obtained by applying the LP Model.


    · Permit H negotiations:
        A specialized consulting firm was engaged since January 2003, together with a legal firm, to
        advise the Ministry of Petroleum in their negotiations with the Consortium for the renewal of
        their concession. A new Convention (concession agreement) was signed in 2004 with
        considerable improvement in the fiscal terms compared to the 1988 Convention. In addition, the
        GoC received a total US$30 million bonus payment from the Consortium, which contributed to
        alleviate the country's difficult financial situation. For details see Section 3.5 (c)

    · Dealings with potential new investors.
        The GoC has been actively promoting the sector, and three new concessions were signed in 2004.
        In addition, Chad continues to prominently feature in trade conferences on crude quality and new
        geological basins. Geological, geophysical and petrophysical data are currently stored by the
        operators on behalf of the GoC, as the lack of funding under the project has prevented the GoC
        from investing in the data information system which would enhance the quality of its promotional
        activity.

    Achievement of this objective is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Gender Aspects. The Project contributed to raising the awareness of women's potential, and provided a
platform for increasing their contribution to community activities. Under FACIL, women were included
in committees, and they played active roles in decision-making processes. FACIL facilitated the creation
of employment opportunities and income generating activities for women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity
and institutional development)

See Section 3.2 (i)

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Positive:
Permit H negotiations. The legal and technical assistance requested by the GoC with respect to its
negotiations with the Consortium for the renewal of the petroleum exploration and production convention
(Permit H) had not been foreseen in the original Project description. The Consortium's decision to seek
the early renewal of its permit H concession agreement, caused negotiations to start in January 2003. The
support provided by the legal and technical consultants funded by the Project was instrumental in
improving the licensing terms compared to those applicable to the existing concession.

Workshops and Information Sessions. Although not explicitly provided for in the Project, the technical
staff of the Bank designed and organized of a number of learning events on sector specific issues on the
request/to the benefit of parliament, civil society, and sector ministries. This was instrumental to raising
public awareness and fostering multi-stakeholders dialogue on a wide range of policy and sector specific
issues. The most relevant topics included: exploration and production activities, the dynamics of oil price,
the determinants of discount and premia, revenue forecasting and modeling techniques, the role,
organization, and funding of national oil companies, hedging and other risk management techniques, key
element for the success of petroleum laws and contracts, and oil revenue funds and their functioning.

Negative:
There was no unexpected negative impact of the project.

Rating: Significant

Sustainability of many of the achievements of the project is not ensured due to:

Environment:

(i) Inability of the Project to develop a suitable institutional and legal framework necessary to support
the environment protection and mitigation activities. Capacity constraints of the sector ministry could
only partially be addressed by the Project. The Supplemental Grant aimed at mitigating these
shortcomings. At the time of Project closing (December 31, 2006), these shortcomings could not be
addressed.

(ii) Lack of financial resources. As a temporary measure, some allocation has been made in the 2007
national budget for the CTNSC to carry out its activities. But beyond the one year period, there is no
assurance of GoC commitment for sustaining them.

Petroleum:

(i) At the time of writing this report most of the staff of the DPU had been integrated into the Ministry of
Petroleum. Therefore no provision was made in the 2007 national budget to continue supporting it.

(ii) Part of the DPU staff had been transferred to the Directorate of Studies and Petroleum Legislation
(DEELP), thus ensuring the sustainability of the petroleum price monitoring system.

(iii) The site supervisors and inspectors trained under the project have become regular staff of the
Ministry, and they will continue working in the field. However, it is not certain whether the Ministry will
have sufficient financial resources/budget to conduct training programs for constantly updating their
knowledge of the industry.

(iv) The financial and capacity constraints of the Ministry of Petroleum may be exacerbated by the
creation of the national oil company.

(iv) In the absence of resources expected from a follow-up Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and
Pipeline Project and other sector developments, the Ministry may not be able to secure sufficient funding
to acquire essential equipment and create the petroleum database/information system.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

The identification process focused on critical gaps and opportunities for interventions in Chad's
petroleum sector. The project was consistent with the GoC's development priorities and with the Bank's
CAS. The Bank also considered various project alternatives before finalizing the design of the Project. In
addition, lessons learned from other earlier projects in the energy sector were considered and incorporated
into the Project design.



                                                      20

On the other hand, as mentioned in Section 1.5, the project design had shortcomings. In light of these
drawbacks, the overall Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In the initial stages, the Bank's performance was constrained owing to several factors such as: (i) rapidly
prepared project design and the resulting shortcomings; (ii) missed opportunities because of the slow start
of the Project; and (iii) exhaustion of the Credit resources within the first two years of implementation.
Consequently, the following drawbacks were glaring:

     · As mentioned in Section 2.2, during the first three years of the Project, the task team did not
          have a petroleum specialist and an environmental specialist. Consequently, the Project could not
          develop any sector policy or strategy in petroleum and environmental sectors during this period,
          and the Project was implemented on an ad-hoc basis. By the time these specialists were added to
          the team, most of the Credit amount was exhausted, and they were performing technical works
          themselves, instead of supervising the work of technical consultants.

     · Until 2002, the supervision was done by TTLs based in Washington D. C. Given the complexity
          and magnitude of the Project, this arrangement was not sufficient for effective supervision of the
          project. Given the unsatisfactory progress in the execution of the three capacity-building
          projects, the Bank decided to change its supervision arrangements in Chad. Accordingly, in
          early 2002, a former World Bank manager was posted in Chad to coordinate supervision efforts
          and help the GoC implement the capacity-building projects. In August 2004 further progress was
          made with the appointment of a senior program manager based in N'Djamena for half of her
          time, and entrusted with the coordination of the activities across the portfolio of projects linked
          to the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project. The support team was also
          strengthened with the appointment of a procurement specialist, an infrastructure specialist, and a
          senior country officer. The dialogue with the authorities was greatly improved.

     · TTLs turnover during the initial three years of the Project led to lack of continuity and different
          approaches to Project supervision.

     · Following the change in Project implementing structure, the project implementation manual was
          never updated. Yet the Project continued disbursing.

On the other hand, the Bank's performance was commendable on the following aspects, especially in the
later part of the Project, which overweighed the above shortcomings. For example:

     · The Project was the main Bank vehicle to support the development of the GoC's environmental
          management capacity. The Bank prepared draft guidelines to ensure compliance with the EMP
          principles, and discussed them with Exxon and the GoC. These guidelines are being used on an
          ad-hoc basis for environmental management in the petroleum sector, and will form the basis for
          future regulations. In addition, support was provided to the GoC to negotiate EMPs with oil
          developers and to monitor their implementation, to determine if they were in compliance with
          agreed commitments. The Project helped the Chadian authorities develop interim environmental
          assessment procedures for the short-term, which were applied to the development of new fields
          by Exxon, as well as to exploration activities by EnCana in the Lake Chad area.


    · To help bolster GoC accountability and mitigate potential misuse of oil revenues, a
        comprehensive communications program was implemented. It targeted two main audiences: (i)


                                                      21

  the local population in Chad, in consultation with the Chadian authorities, to help mitigate
  unrealistic expectations, while increasing transparency in the way the resources were managed;
  and (ii) the international community.

· The task team assisted the Ministry of Petroleum in designing a medium and long term petroleum
  sector strategy, and developing the necessary institutional and legal framework. The task team
  provided detailed technical and strategic comments on the revision of the petroleum code as well
  as on the legal statutes of the planned National Oil Company.

· The task team provided technical advice and training in petroleum sector related issues. In
  particular on the request of the Ministry of Petroleum the team developed a model for forecasting
  the discount of the Doba blend versus the Brent blend which was used by the Ministry to cross
  check the result of the LP model. Assistance was also provided in evaluating the opportunity of
  reducing revenue volatility through hedging, and various technical and economic aspects of
  sector management.

· An integrated financial model of the upstream and transportation sector was developed by the
  Bank which is still used by the Ministry of Petroleum, the IMF, and the Bank for forecasting oil
  revenue for budgetary and fiscal sustainability purposes. Field performance indicators were also
  developed as part of the model.

· The task team also worked closely with the Chadian authorities to prepare the Supplemental
  Grant.

· The Bank team reached out to various stakeholders including Parliament and various NGOs in
  Chad.

· The task team provided intensive hands-on support to the Chadian authorities to put in place the
  modalities for oil revenue management. The team also conducted an in-depth review of the IDA
  portfolio, notably the two capacity-building projects associated with the Pipeline project, in an
  effort to accelerate their implementation and prepare for follow-up support.

· The World Bank Group appointed a consultant (the External Compliance Monitoring Group) to
  monitor the implementation by the Consortium of the EMP, and to assess work of the GoC's
  implementing agencies in Chad. It visited Chad on a quarterly basis. Its reports were favorably
  judged by all parties involved. In addition, five distinguished individuals--the International
  Advisory Group (IAG)--were appointed to provide an independent overview of the Pipeline
  Project, and to advise the World Bank's President on progress in achieving the broad objectives
  of the pipeline project and the related capacity-building projects. The IAG visited Chad twice a
  year. It was instrumental in helping all stakeholders, including civil society; reach a common
  understanding on the challenges and achievements of the projects and its contribution was highly
  appreciated.


· The Bank engaged the authorities at the highest level through regular visits to Chad of Bank
  senior management to reinforce political commitment to capacity building at the highest level.
  Repeated visits of Bank senior management to Chad helped reinforce commitment of President
  Deby to speed-up efforts in capacity-building.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory because of the unsatisfactory aspects of
Project design, the limited readiness of the Project for implementation, and the shortcomings in the
supervision of the procurement and financial aspects of Project implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(NOTE: When the GoC and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide rating and justification
only for Overall Borrower Performance.)

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Preparation.

The Project was intricately linked with the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project,
which was the result of long and difficult negotiations that the Chadians conducted on their own. The
negotiations were carried out by the GoC's Petroleum Negotiating Team which included representatives
of all the major ministries. During preparation, the project had the full commitment of two executing
agencies, the MMEP and the MEWR, and was designed after in-depth discussions with the Petroleum
Negotiating Team over several months, as well as with the full and active participation of representatives
of several ministries (including MMEP, MEWR, the ministries responsible for planning, health, education,
rural development, transport, and social affairs), civil society, and NGOs. Thus government performance
during preparation was Satisfactory.

Implementation.

The GoC commitment fluctuated during implementation. The project faced opposition in the initial
stages of implementation, which hampered its progress. It was a challenge for the authorities to appreciate
the need for and importance of improving the GoC capacity in the petroleum and environment sectors,
which they eventually acknowledged. Later, despite the difficult operating conditions, the GoC showed its
commitment to the project, most specifically by: (i) improving communication with local stakeholders;
(ii) stepping up its efforts with regard to environment and social monitoring and mitigation activities; (iii)
undertaking to review the current institutional and legal framework; and (iv) shifting its attention from
infrastructure building to human capacity building. But soon thereafter, the GoC commitment started to
wane.

In November 2005 the GoC presented a new revenue management law to the Parliament. The law
provided for the elimination of the Future Generations Fund (FGF), the inclusion of Justice, Territorial
Administration and Security among the priority sectors; and increased the percentage of direct oil
revenues that can be used in non-priority sectors from 13.5 percent to 30 percent. On the other hand the
new law covered all fields. The decision to unilaterally amend the revenue management law constituted a
breach of the project development agreement, which allowed the Bank to exercise its rights to trigger the
suspension of the portfolio of projects.




                                                     23

Although the tasks of the various GoC agencies had been clearly defined, the inter-agency coordination,
ownership of and responsibility for the results and personnel motivation had proven difficult to attain. In
particular, the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Petroleum failed to coordinate their activities.
The relationship between the Ministry of Petroleum and the Ministry of Finance was equally difficult.

Despite a long-standing preparation process with active involvement of the Minister of Petroleum, the
Minister of Environment, and the National Coordination for the Doba project, it became clear during the
negotiations of the Supplemental Grant that there was a lack of consensus among the Chadians on this
Project.

Because of the weak capacity of the GoC and internal differences, timely resolution of issues was a
problem. There were also fiduciary issues such as irregularities in counterpart funding, and ineligible
expenditures under the Project.

The relationship between the GoC and the Consortium came under strain in early October 2004 when the
GoC issued a controversial press release citing several points of dispute with the Consortium based on
their interpretation of the 1988 convention. Points of disagreement included the point of measurement of
production for the purpose of royalty calculation, the determination of the discount for the Doba Blend
compared to its marker crude (Brent Blend), and issues related to the use of off-shore insurance backing
agreements. With the assistance of the Bank, almost all the issues raised by the GoC were settled.

In brief, the GoC did not use the Project (and the Bank more broadly) in the most effective manner for a
variety of reasons, which included: (a) political considerations; (b) lack of real ownership of the package
of TA; and (c) the overwhelming magnitude of tasks resulting from the rapidity of the construction
schedule, and the absorption of all the human resources available on the Chad side for the Chad-
Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

National Coordination
National Coordination, with the assistance of a team of 30 persons, ensured the overall coordination of the
Project. The team was totally supported by GoC funding. In September 2004, the National Coordination
was shifted from the Office of the President to the Ministry of Petroleum. The institutional change that
was made by the authorities without consulting the Bank negatively affected the role and effectiveness of
the National Coordination. In addition, the National Coordination appeared to be unable to effectively
contribute to the discussion on the appropriate legal and institutional set up.

Financial Management Review. The financial management system including accounting, controls,
auditing and reporting was adequate and satisfied the Bank's financial management requirements. The
financial audit reports were all received on time and the opinions in the Management Letters were
moderately satisfactory.

CTNSC
Given that petroleum was a new sector for Chad, the level of sector specific technical and financial skills
available within the CTNSC was extremely low in the initial stages of the Project. Thus, Chad had to rely
very heavily on external technical advisers. ECMG assisted the CTNSC in monitoring the Consortium
compliance with the EMP.




                                                     24

With the assistance of the Bank's technical team, the CTNSC's socio-environmental field-supervision
team steadily improved its capacity during implementation. Twenty four field staff members, including
the CTNSC site supervisor, an international environment expert, and six technical experts (in biophysics,
socioeconomics, and health) supervised the Consortium's socio-environmental activities. This could not
be sustained due to lack of funding.

The CTNSC had gained credibility in its dialogue with the Consortium through excellent technical
reviews of the successive environmental packages submitted by the Consortium for new fields. It also
played a significant role in: (a) resolving conflicts, and maintaining social contact in affected villages.
The conflict resolution role was viewed by the Consortium as especially helpful; (b) awareness-raising
campaigns; and (c) in the verification of the compensation for individual and communities affected by the
Project.

On the other hand, the lack of coordination between the CTNSC and DPU while carrying out field
environmental monitoring and operations monitoring led to tension and different positions between the
two sides. The lack of clarity of roles between the National Coordination and the Ministry of
Environment exacerbated these difficulties.

Procurement Arrangements. During the implementation, there were many instances when the CTNSC
did not comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement in procurement activities. Main issues included:
non-observance of the procedures; launching bidding documents without obtaining No Objection from the
Bank; weakness of procurement activities such as not updating procurement plan, and delays in
processing.

Financial Management. As mentioned in Section 2.4, the CTNSC had several issues related to fiduciary
compliance including ineligible expenditures and outstanding balance in the Special Account.

DPU
The DPU was set up to monitor the financial and technical aspects of implementation of the Project. It
was composed of 36 persons and had a functional reporting line to the Directorate of Petroleum (in 2002
this latter became the Ministry of Petroleum). Given that petroleum was a new sector for Chad, and that
the level of sector specific technical and financial skills available within the DPU was extremely low, the
achievements of the technical and economic staff were remarkable. These included:
 (i)    the establishment of a methodology and related procedures for the determination of the discount of
        the Doba blend to the Brent blend;
 (ii)   the establishment of a methodology and related procedures for the verification of the volumes of
        crude oil production and export;
 (iii) the establishment of a methodology and related procedures for the control of transportation tariffs;
        and
 (iv) the regular conduct of external audits of the petroleum costs, that in many instances lead to the
        obtaining of adjustments to the Consortium accounts.

Procurement Arrangements.        Like the CTNSC, DPU had also many issues related to procurement
activities. For details, see the CTNSC's performance in procurement above.

Financial Management. As in the case of the CTNSC, DPU also had several issues related to fiduciary
compliance including ineligible expenditures and outstanding balance in the Special Account.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory


                                                      25

In light of the GoC and implementing agencies' performance as discussed in Section 10.2, the overall
performance of the Borrower was Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The lessons learned from the implementation of the Petroleum Sector Management and Capacity Building
Project confirm the experience under Bank operations in Chad as well the broader international
experience with the design and management of hydrocarbon sector reforms in countries that are new to
the sector.

 Capacity Building Lessons

 · Need for a proper policy environment and a strong commitment by the highest authorities. Effective
     implementation of capacity building projects requires a clear alignment with medium and long term
     sector policy objectives, and a strong political commitment to carry them through. Unless such
     commitment exists, the Government's interest in supporting investment in capacity building
     activities may diminish over time as the impact of these activities is less visible.

 · Creating realistic expectations. Developing national expertise in the different facets of the oil
     industry (geology, geophysics, engineering, commercial, finance and economics, environment, etc.)
     is a daunting task. Building realistic expectations as to the results that can be achieved with this type
     of projects, and the time frame for achieving them is a key element for securing the continued
     support of the stakeholders. If expectations are too optimistic and results fail to materialize, the
     political interest in supporting the project is likely to diminish.

 · Capacity constraints could have been anticipated earlier in order to enable the more effective
     sequencing of capacity building activities. It is important to carry out a solid pre-assessment of
     existing national capacities and initiate capacity building programs as soon as possible in order to
     have at least some capacity in place when the project is implemented. One aspect that could have
     been stronger in the project design was the framework and sequencing for building capacity: there
     could have been a greater clarity on the type of functions and type of strengthening needed and their
     timing (with milestones linked to the construction phase), and an agreement on areas where
     "temporary substitution" may have been the way to go just to cope with the accelerated pace of
     construction while sustainable capacity was being built.

 · Flexibility should be sought in the implementation of training programs designed to respond to
     immediate needs, and to develop a wider knowledge base for the creation of the human capital
     needed to develop the sector. Especially in countries that are new to the oil sector, training should
     aim at improving the basic knowledge of the sector at all level of government. A larger number of
     staff members from support ministries as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Plan should be
     offered training in petroleum economics and accounting.

 · Continuity of the team working on the project is very important both for the Bank and the Borrower.
     The Project was adversely affected by the frequent change in government, ministries, and
     institutional set up, as well as the change of TTLs on the part of the Bank.




                                                        26

· Linking the implementation of a capacity building project to the implementation of a large
    engineering project such as the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project was
    not practicable or realistic in a country with limited human resources and capacity.

· It is important to avoid including too many activities and addressing several sector issues in a single
    TA project in a country such as Chad which has limited capacity.


Sector-related Lessons

· An adequate legal, institutional, and regulatory framework needs to be in place before production
    start-up. The development of a strategic approach to the design of sector policies and of the
    regulatory framework is a key variable to ensure that the petroleum sector is managed in an efficient
    and effective way. Experience in many producing countries shows that structural reforms are much
    more difficult to promote and implement when oil production has already commenced. The
    institutional arrangement designed to implement the project should aim to strengthen existing
    institutions. This is particularly important when the activities carried out under the project are
    expected to last beyond its closing. Cells and special project or program implementation units
    (supported by donors) by nature are not responsible for delivering on permanent operational
    functions and therefore are not in a position to mainstream policy and institutional reforms through
    changes in day-to-day business processes. Chad may not have had many other options beside the use
    of PIUs when it embarked on the creation of the oil sector on the back of a complex project
    implemented by international oil companies. Because Chad will have to manager the petroleum
    sector for many years to come, steps should have been taken to make use of existing institutions
    and/or devise measures to mainstream project's activities early on.

· Better indicators should be designed to measure progress on capacity building. There should be clear
    and measurable outcome indicators and objective output indicators that can be observed by the
    Government, the Bank, and by civil society groups. Although the project may be part of a portfolio of
    related projects, its objectives and outcome indicators should be linked to the activities carried out
    under the project.

· It is important to have a clear and coherent strategic vision of the sector at the beginning of the
    project itself. This should be complemented with clear milestones linked to the implementation of that
    vision. The majority of the funds and of the actions envisaged under the project were directed to
    managing and mitigating the effects of implementing the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development
    and Pipeline Project (ad hoc training, recruiting of technical advisers to assist the CoC on punctual
    matters arising from the implementation of the pipeline project, information campaigns on the status
    of implementation of the pipeline project, building of infrastructure in the producing region, and
    mitigation of environmental and social aspects in general). Little was envisaged for creating the
    backbone of the sector by developing a sustainable institutional and policy environment.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. The Doba Project Management Component

Output included:

(a). Strengthening the capacity for environmental management:

     · Installation of the personnel of the CTNSC, with national experts assigned to the Executive
         Secretariat and international experts assigned for supervision on site. In addition, a panel of
         experts was recruited for advising CTNSC.


     · Staff training through sessions organized by the engineering and design department of SOFRECO,
         ESSO-Chad and the French Petroleum Institutes. The topics included: (i) Monitoring the quality
         of air; (ii) Environmental management Plan; (iii) Methods for developing environmental impact
         studies; (iv) Environmental Policy and social safeguards; and (v) Auditing of companies


     · Development of the Framework of Regional Development (CDR) of the oil zone


     · Study on the reintegration of the Chadian workers of the Chadian Project of Export after the
         phase of construction.


(b). Mitigating Project Impacts on the Producing Region:

     · International Advisory Panel was installed for the development of a national plan of response in
         the event of accidental hydrocarbon discharge. An oil spill response plan was prepared but
         implementing regulation is still to be established.


     · Regional Development Plan and Environmental Assessment. The Regional Development Plan
         (RDP) was prepared as a framework for analyzing the economic structure of the oil-producing
         region, identifying opportunities and in vestment options in infrastructure, human development
         and public facilities, thus serving as a guiding framework to select projects to be financed by the
         5 percent oil royalty allocation set forth in the Constitution and in the project agreement. Both
         local and national stakeholders were involved in the initial consultations and their views were
         integrated into a final plan, building on previous studies.


     · A number of infrastructure works were carried out to reduce the negative impacts of the Chad-
         Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project which included: (i) Construction of new
         health center in Doba; (ii) Rehabilitation of health center in Bébédjia; (iii) Rehabilitation of Doba
         hospital; (iv) Rehabilitation and extension of drainage facilities in Doba; (v) Construction of

     · Prevention campaign against Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD)/HIV/AIDS. Awareness-
        raising campaigns among truckers and other high-risk categories of the population were
        successfully implemented, with cross-support from the IDA-financed AIDS Project and in
        cooperation with specialized NGOs. The Project also contributed to the development of a
        strategic approach on a regional scale and carried out training programs to: (i) about 500 political
        and administrative authorities, including Prefects, Under Prefects, Chiefs of Canton, Chiefs of
        villages; (ii) more than 30 doctors and nurses on dispensation of various services; (iii)
        approximately 400 obstetricians and marriage counselors. In addition, approximately 40
        organizers of AFRlCARE, liaison officers of Esso, village health officials of ACODE were given
        training and used for sensitizing community members. The Project benefited from direct
        contribution of the National HIV-AIDS Committee supported by another IDA operation.

     · Sustainable management of forest resources. The Project provided technical and financial support
        for the establishment of plans for sustainable management of forest resources in six pilot villages.

     · Study of socio-demographic aspects of the population of the oil zone. This study made it possible
        to have the demographic situation of the zone at the beginning of the project and was meant to be
        used as a reference for the future.

     · Micro credit. The FACIL carried out six micro credit projects at a cost of 354.7 million FCFA.
        Loans were given to 8000 people in 10 cantons and three communes, for carrying out various
        activities such as marketing of cereals; purchasing agricultural equipment, transforming the
        agricultural products, and cattle breeding.

     · With regard to socio-economic infrastructure, the FACIL provided the means for (i) the
        construction of 29 buildings in 11 school establishments, adding up 58 rooms of class and seven
        office-stores; (ii) the construction and/or the rehabilitation of seven bridges; and (iii) the
        rehabilitation drinking water supply system.

     · In the field of capacity building and local development, the FACIL conducted 16 training courses
        on nine different topics, such as poultry breeding, and masonry, which benefited about 500
        people by enhancing their professional competence and skills, improving the commercial value
        their products, and increasing their incomes.

     · Credit and savings banks. In collaboration with the Association for the Development of Savings
        and Credit (ASDEC), the project also ensured the institutional support for the creation and
        management of credit and savings banks in nine cantons in the producing region. The creation of
        these credit and savings banks provided opportunities to mobilize local savings and foster
        development activities.

(c). Additional Information and Communication activities:
     · Dissemination campaigns. Radio and television campaigns were carried out regularly to provide
        updates to the general public on the progress made in the construction of the pipeline and related
        facilities. Public consultations and information campaigns were regularly conducted in the
        producing region and in N'Djaména. These were crucial to raising the awareness on health and
        social impacts of the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, and
        improving the dialogue with civil society.

(d) Monitoring System.

  · The Environmental Information Management System (SGIE) was finalized by the consultant.

Achievement of this component is Moderately Satisfactory.

Component 2. Petroleum Sector Management Component

  · Training and Capacity-building. Since the start of the project, considerable efforts were made in
      training the DPU's staff, as well as key staff of the Ministry of Petroleum and Ministry of Finance
      (MOF). Due to the complexities of the agreements governing the exploration and production of
      the Doba fields, as well as the sale and transportation of the crude, three technical assistance
      agreements with international consultancy firms were signed by the MP/DPU. All contracts
      included substantial training components.

      Workshops were held for the benefit of the DPU and of the MP's Economic Department on topics
      ranging from:

      (a) the fundamentals of petroleum markets, industry key performance indicators, petroleum
      economics, crude oil trading and determination of Doba crude prices.

       (b) the structure and content of the various agreements related to governing the Doba Petroleum
       Project.

       (c) various commercial aspects of the Doba Development Project including royalties, cost
       recovery and tax calculations.

       Courses were held to train the DPU/MP's Economic Department's staff in the use of the Linear
       Program Refining Model and related models for the forecast of crude oil prices and the
       calculation of the net-back.

       In addition, ten petroleum inspectors responsible for the monitoring of production from the oil
       field and its delivery to the Floating Storage and Offloading vessel in Kribi attended a
       specialized technical training course.

       DPU recruited two geologists, three petroleum engineers, a geo-physician, two drilling
       technicians, two pipeline technicians, 10 petroleum inspectors, a procurement specialist, an
       accountant, a documentation specialist, and an IT specialist.


  · Determination of the price differential.          The Project provided assistance to the GoC in
      understanding the determinants of the price differential between the Doba Blend and its reference
      crude ­ the Brent Blend. The market price of the hydrocarbons sold by the Consortium is an
      important variable for the purpose of calculating both the royalties and the income tax due to the
      GoC. The procedure for determining the market price is clearly defined in the Convention
      Agreement between the GoC and the Consortium. In accordance with the Convention, GoC's
      approval is required to determine the net-back for royalty calculation. The Doba blend is a dense,
      high acid crude. Mainly due to its poor characteristics the Doba sells at a discount to Brent.

       To assess the price of the Doba blend, the GoC developed a model based on the determination of
       the refinery margin Linear Planning (LP) Model. The model, which is an adaptation of the well-
       known Petroleum Argus, was developed by technical advisers financed by the Project, and
       requires daily input of crude oil prices and freight costs. To double-check the results of the
       model, the Bank was asked to provide its assistance in the determination of the price differential.


                                                   32

       The Bank developed a model based on the observation of monthly crude price variations over a
       period of four years and their relationship with quality differentials. The results of the Bank's
       model confirmed the average size and trend of the observed price differentials, and were
       generally in line with the results of the LP Model.

  · Permit H negotiations. A specialized consulting firm was engaged since January 2003, together
      with a legal firm, to advise the Ministry of Petroleum in their negotiations with the Consortium
      for the renewal of their concession. A new Convention (concession agreement) was signed in
      2004 with considerable improvement in the fiscal terms compared to the 1988 Convention.

  · Equipment. Data-processing and other office equipment were procured by the DPU.

  · Construction of the offices of the CTNSC and the repair of the offices of the CNPP in Djaména
      were completed.


Achievement of this component is Moderately Satisfactory.

                                             en place dans le cadre du Projet n'a pas été garantie pleinement. Il y a eu
                                             beaucoup de risques liés à la politique et à la gouvernance. Un don

           Les indicateurs qui ont été pris en compte dans les différents documents de référence du Projet (PGE,
           PAD, Manuel d'Exécution) n'ont pas été mis en concordance, ce qui a posé un problème d'adaptabilité
           pendant les phases d'évaluation à mi parcours et à l'achèvement.

5. Le contexte, les objectifs et les résultats obtenus

5.1 ­ Contexte à l'évaluation

Pour exploiter le pétrole découvert dans le sud du pays à Doba, le Gouvernement de la République du Tchad a négocié un
accord de production pétrolière avec un Consortium de compagnies pétrolières reconstitué à deux reprises, en 1992 et en 2000
avec la structure actuelle composée de ESSO, PETRONAS et CHEVRON.

Dans le cadre du projet de mise en valeur des ressources pétrolières de Doba et d'Oléoduc Tchad/Cameroun (Projet
d'Exportation Tchadien), le Consortium de compagnies pétrolières composée de ESSO, PETRONAS et CHEVRON, en



                                                              41

association avec l'État tchadien, ont décidé vers la fin des années 90, d'assurer la production, le transport et la vente sur le
marché mondial de près d'un milliard de barils de pétrole provenant de trois gisements dans le bassin de Doba (Komé, Bolobo
et Miandoum). Ce projet devrait rapporter entre 1,5 et 2 milliards de dollars au Tchad pendant les 30 ans d'exploitation des
gisements (sur la base d'un prix pétrolier Brent d'environ 15,25 dollars le baril, en dollars de 1999). Le projet présente
cependant certains risques, en particulier le risque que les effets environnementaux et sociaux ne puissent être évités, minimisés
ou atténués, et le risque que les revenus pétroliers ne soient mal gérés par l'État tchadien.

Conscient des lourds défis à relever dans le secteur pétroliers, le Gouvernement de la République du Tchad a demandé
l'assistance de la Banque Mondiale pour renforcer les moyens dont il dispose pour suivre et contrôler les aspects
environnementaux, sociaux et techniques des projets pétroliers, à commencer par le projet de Doba. L'appui à la maîtrise des
effets induits du projet pétrolier de Doba est un domaine qui présente un intérêt particulier. Le projet de renforcement des
capacités de gestion du secteur pétrolier a pour but de fournir cette assistance.

Dans le but de renforcer les capacités du Tchad à contrôler et suivre les aspects environnementaux, sociaux et techniques du
Projet de Doba, ainsi que sa capacité de gérer le secteur pétrolier dans sa totalité, la Banque Mondiale a accordé au Tchad un
crédit pour une période de 5 ans d'un montant de 23,7 millions de dollars dont la mise en vigueur est intervenue le 23 Mars
2001. Le Gouvernement Tchadien s'est engagé dans le cadre de l'Accord de ce crédit à apporter une contribution en monnaie
nationale équivalente à 2,5 M$ pour la même période. Ce qui fut fait.

Les activités du Projet ont démarré en Mai 2001 et pris fin le 31 Décembre 2006. Durant cette période, les activités de terrain
ont atteint leur vitesse de croisière jusqu'au moment de la revue à mi-parcours qui a intervenue en Octobre 2003 à l'issue de
laquelle, les besoins en ressources additionnelles ont été évalués et des négociations techniques ont été engagées et finalisées en
avril 2004. Malheureusement, depuis cette date, les difficultés de fonctionnement consécutives au tarissement prématuré du
crédit initial et à la non mise en place immédiate du financement supplémentaire n'ont pas permis aux équipes du Projet
d'atteindre globalement les objectifs de renforcement de capacité retenus. Au 31 août 2004, environ 100 % du Crédit n° 3373 ­
CD avait été engagé et 93 % décaissé.

L'exécution des diverses composantes du Projet a progressé de manière satisfaisante malgré le retard accusé dans le
recrutement du personnel et dans la fourniture de la formation. Suite à l'organisation des campagnes d'information, de
sensibilisation et d'explication, la communication avec la population locale s'est améliorée. De gros travaux d'infrastructures
ont été achevés à Bébédjia et à Doba. Le FACIL a été opérationnel. Il a réalisé des infrastructures socio-économiques, de
formation et signé des conventions avec des intermédiaires financiers dans le cadre des activités de micros crédits.

Il est important de souligner que de 2004 à 2006, les structures du Projet qui sont déjà fortement handicapées par l'absence de
ressources financières n'assurent qu'un service minimum avec un personnel réduit dont la mobilité est liée au soutient
logistique du Consortium. Ce qui prouve la grande difficulté de ces structures de s'assurer valablement que les intérêts du
Tchad et de la population intéressée sont respectés, face aux activités pétrolières qui ne cessent de s'élargir. Tout cela a influé
négativement sur les bons résultats obtenus pendant les trois premières années d'activités intenses du Projet. Les activités qui
devraient être réalisées dans le cadre de la pérennisation des structures du Projet n'ont pas pu être conduites, ce qui porte
aujourd'hui préjudice aux structures du Projet.

Face aux problèmes que rencontrent les structures du Projet, et afin de consolider les acquis du Projet de Renforcement des
Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier et de mettre en oeuvre les activités qui n'ont pas pu l'être du fait de l'épuisement
prématuré des fonds initiaux (Crédit IDA n° 3373 ­ CD), le Gouvernement de la République du Tchad et le Groupe de la
Banque Mondiale ont convenu dès le début de l'année 2004 du principe d'un financement supplémentaire dont la mise en place
aurait dû intervenir bien avant la fin de l'année 2006.

Lors de l'Atelier de Réflexion tenue en Avril 2005 qui a impliqué les ministres concernés, un grand nombre de cadres tchadiens
et l'équipe de la Banque Mondiale, il a aussi été confirmé le principe de la mise en place d'un financement sous la forme d'un
crédit supplémentaire. Depuis cette date, les travaux de préparation ont été accélérés en vue des négociations du nouveau crédit.
Cependant, ces négociations n'ont pas pu avoir lieu, d'une part, du fait que certains préalables relatifs à la présentation du Projet


                                                               42

au Conseil d'Administration de la Banque Mondiale n'ont pu être remplies (lettre de politique sectorielle acceptable à la
Banque) et d'autre part, du fait du malentendu intervenu entre la Banque Mondiale et le Gouvernement du Tchad au sujet de la
gestion des revenus pétroliers.

Cependant, et malgré cette situation, la Banque Mondiale a confirmé en Octobre 2006, sa disponibilité à assister le
Gouvernement du Tchad pour le développement de son secteur pétrolier par l'octroi d'un don d'un montant de Dix (10)
Millions de Dollars Américains, sur l'enveloppe IDA pour le Tchad 2007-2008. En réponse à cette assistance, le Gouvernement
à travers le Ministre de l'Economie et du Plan a confirmé par écrit le 20 Mars 2007 à la Banque Mondiale, son accord pour que
ce don de Dix (10) Millions de Dollars Américains, soit mis à la disposition du Tchad aussi rapidement que possible, car ce
financement constitue un apport essentiel pour soutenir les efforts du Gouvernement dans sa politique de renforcement
institutionnel des capacités et plus particulièrement dans le domaine de la protection de l'environnement d'une part et de
consolider, en temps opportun, les acquis du Projet Pétrole d'autre part.

Selon les dispositions de l'Accord de crédit 3373 ­ CD, qui a été clôturé le 31 Décembre 2006, un rapport d'achèvement
d'exécution doit être rédigé par la Banque Mondiale pour être finalisé et soumis au Conseil d'Administration de la Banque
Mondiale au plus tard le 30 Juin 2007.

Selon les mêmes dispositions de l'Accord de Crédit 3373 ­ CD, le Gouvernement du Tchad doit présenter son propre rapport
d'évaluation d'achèvement selon le modèle utilisé habituellement pour la préparation du rapport pays, pour accompagner le
RAE de la Banque mondiale. A cet effet, le Coordinateur National a commis par décision n°409/CN/2006 du 14 novembre
2006, un groupe de travail présidé par l'Expert Juriste de la Coordination Nationale et regroupant le Secrétaire Exécutif du
CTNSC PI (1er Rapporteur), le Chef de l'Unité Pétrole Doba, le Directeur du FACIL et les comptables du projet (membres)
pour la rédaction de son rapport qui ne doit pas dépasser 10 pages. Il doit contenir en outre les éléments suivants :

    I.       Introduction

Cette introduction fera le rappel du contexte ayant justifié le Projet par l'IDA

    II.      Evaluation des objectifs et contenu du programme

Cette partie devra contenir l'évaluation, en détail des objectifs et le contenu des activités ainsi que les mesures et les actions
soutenues par le PRCGSP

    III.     Evaluation des résultats obtenus par chaque composante du PRCGSP

Il sera évoqué dans cette partie, la mise en oeuvre des mesures et actions prévues par le PRCGSP, les problèmes rencontrés ainsi

propices pour un développement transparent et soutenable du secteur pétrolier.




                                                                43

5.2 ­ Les objectifs originaux de développement du Projet et contenu du programme

Les principaux objectifs au titre desquels le projet de renforcement des capacités de gestion du secteur pétrolier est proposé
visent à renforcer les capacités du Tchad à :

· gérer le développement de ses ressources pétrolières d'une manière appropriée tant du point de vue de l'environnement que
    du point de vue social, en commençant par l'exploitation des champs pétrolifères de Doba, dans la partie sud du Tchad,
· minimiser et pallier les impacts négatifs du Projet Doba et renforcer les capacités au niveau régional, et
· établir un cadre pour favoriser la croissance des investissements privés dans le secteur pétrolier au Tchad.

Malgré les retards enregistrés lors du démarrage des activités, grâce au soutien continu de la Banque et d'autres organisations et
en dépit des capacités limitées de l'administration locale, l'exécution de ces objectifs a été satisfaisante.

Le renforcement des capacités du gouvernement du Tchad a été indispensable pour l'amélioration des politiques générales, des
compétences et des institutions.

Les Composantes du Projet et l'Evaluation des résultats obtenus par chaque composante du Projet de renforcement des
capacités de gestion du secteur pétrolier

Dès son origine, le Projet a été a décomposé en deux composantes principales :


· La Composante Gestion du Projet Doba (18,9 millions de $US), dite `'composante A'', est destinée à soutenir la réalisation
    du projet de Doba en améliorant la capacité du Gouvernement à suivre et gérer les impacts environnementaux et sociaux du
    projet, et en atténuant les impacts négatifs du projet sur la région productrice; et
· La Composante de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier (5,3 millions de $US), dite composante B, est destinée à renforcer la
    capacité du Gouvernement à soutenir et gérer le développement du secteur pétrolier au Tchad.

Dans le cadre de la composante «A» qui vise à renforcer les capacités gouvernementales et à minimiser l'effet du projet sur la
zone de production, des progrès importants ont eu lieu à travers la mise en place des équipes du CTNSC et l'acquisition des
équipements qui ont permis aux experts et agents du CTNSC d'effectuer le suivi environnemental et social des opérations de
construction et des installations du Projet d'Exportation Tchadien, conformément aux dispositions du Plan de Gestion de
l'Environnement (PGE). Face au rythme, à l'étendue géographique et aux nombreux secteurs d'activités (construction,
transport, terrassement, forage, pipeline, etc.), les experts et agents du CTNSC ont pu s'imposer et se forger une légitimité
auprès de leurs partenaires parmi lesquels figurent Esso Exploration & Production Chad Inc (EEPCI) et le Groupe de la Banque
Mondiale, qui demande aujourd'hui à être soutenue par les hautes autorités nationales pour le suivi des trois phases de
l'industrie pétrolière au Tchad à savoir l'exploration, le développement et les opérations.

Les efforts de formations entrepris dans le cadre du Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier ont
permis au personnel du CTNSC d'assumer correctement leurs responsabilités et consolider leur savoir faire. Mais quelque soit
les capacités des experts et agents disponibles du CTNSC, l'acquisition de l'expertise nécessaire exige que ce personnel puisse
bénéficier d'un perfectionnement soutenu avec des programmes de formation qualifiés nécessaires qui font appel à des experts
confirmés.

Dans le cadre de l'Assistance Technique qui fait partie intégrante du Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du
Secteur Pétrolier, le CTNSC a disposé du soutien d'un certain nombre d'experts nationaux et internationaux « à la demande»,
qui après sélection et mise en place, ont produits entre autres les documents suivants : Etude sur la démobilisation, PDR/EER,
PNIDAH, etc. Ces études qui ont coûté cher et qui ont été élaborées dans un processus participatif, n'ont pas encore reçu
l'approbation formelle du Gouvernement. C'est ce qui retarde leur utilisation par les services techniques compétents.

Dans le cadre de la mitigation des impacts indirects du Projet, le programme de construction et de réhabilitation



                                                                44

d'infrastructures publiques a été largement engagé pour un montant d'environ trois (03) milliards de Francs CFA. Il concerne
les mesures d'urgence qui visent à atténuer l'impact d'une immigration en masse pendant la période de construction et porte
essentiellement sur le renforcement des infrastructures socio-économiques, sanitaires et d'approvisionnement en eau potable de
la région ; le renforcement des services de santé (hôpitaux dispensaires et campagne d'information) ; la mise en place d'actions
permettant une utilisation durable des ressources naturelles dans la zone du Projet ; les actions préventives contre les Infections
Sexuellement Transmissibles (IST) et en particulier le SIDA. La mise en oeuvre de ces mesures d'urgence est assurée en grande
partie par les opérateurs privés et les ONG.

Les dépenses engagées pour les travaux de génie civil du CTNSC représentent environ deux (02) milliards de Francs CFA. Le
montant total des coûts engagés pour la Maîtrise d'oeuvre des travaux du CTNSC est d'environ 400 millions FCFA.

Dans le cadre de la prévention contre le SIDA, le projet a contribué au développement d'une approche stratégique pertinente à
l'échelle nationale (boite à images et livrets familiaux) et porte a son actif :
    · plus de 490 autorités politiques, administratives et traditionnelles ont été formés (Préfets, Sous Préfets, chefs de Canton,
         chef de villages) ;
    · plus de 30 médecins, infirmiers formés à la dispensation des différentes prestations retenues dans le cadre du Projet ;
    · environ 400 accoucheuses traditionnelles, tradi - praticiens et pairs éducateurs formés ;
    · environ 40 animateurs d'AFRICARE, Agents de liaison Esso, Agent de santé villageoise d'ACODE ont été formés et
         servent de relais communautaire de sensibilisation.

Par ailleurs, le volet SIDA bénéficie de campagnes permanentes multi médias sur les axes routiers par 2 UVM animées par 2
équipes : une équipe AMASOT (promotion du marketing social du préservatif) et une équipe du Projet lui-même (les
animateurs sociologue du BELACD). Plus de 20.000 posters et affiches avec images parlantes ont été distribuées et 28
panneaux routiers sont installés dans la région productrice.

Dans le cadre des mesures économiques d'accompagnement, le FACIL a obtenu un crédit d'environ 2,2 milliards de Francs
CFA dont environ 1,8 milliards ont été consommés avant le 31 Décembre 2004. Depuis le démarrage de ses activités sur le
terrain en juillet 2002, le FACIL a enregistré plus de 400 requêtes sur lesquelles 70 micros projets d'infrastructures ont été
approuvés par le Comité de Pilotage (CdP). Le total des projets d'infrastructures réalisés par le FACIL, sur la base des contrats
signés, s'élève à 22 pour un coût total de 605 millions de Francs CFA.

Le mode de réalisation choisi pour ces ouvrages (tâcheronnat) a permis d'assurer d'une part, la bonne contribution des
bénéficiaires qui tourne pour l'essentiel autour de 10% et d'autre part, de donner du travail à des artisans locaux mais aussi
d'assurer leur formation. Sur chaque chantier réalisé par le FACIL, en moyenne 4 à 5 jeunes villageois sont formés aux métiers
du bâtiment. Ainsi donc, plus d'une quarantaine de jeunes ont été formés et équipés de petits matériels pouvant leur permettre
de réaliser des travaux d'entretien des bâtiments construits dans leurs villages et également d'exercer le métier de travaux du
bâtiment dans leur zone. Du côté des APE, des comités de suivi des chantiers ont été constitués et formés pour réceptionner et
cogérer les matériels et matériaux de construction en collaboration avec le contrôleur et le tâcheron recrutés par le FACIL.

Dans le domaine du Renforcement des Capacités et Développement Local, le FACIL a réalisé depuis le démarrage de ses
activités, seize (16) sessions de formation sur neuf (09) thèmes différents. Il a aussi assuré un appui institutionnel concernant
la création et la gestion de caisses d'épargne et de crédit dans neuf (09) cantons de la zone pétrolière. Cet appui est réalisé en
collaboration avec l'Association pour le Développement de l'Epargne et Crédit (ASDEC). Il a permis la création de 9 caisses
d'épargne et de crédit dans la zone et leur encadrement technique pendant 12 mois. Les dépenses engagées pour ce volet
s'élèvent à environ 130 millions de Francs CFA.

Dans le domaine des activités génératrices de revenues, le Comité de pilotage du FACIL a approuvé 7 programmes de micros
crédit parmi lesquels 6 sont mis en oeuvre. Le montant total des prêts aux intermédiaires financiers est de 480 millions de Francs
CFA. Ce prêt leur a permis de placer un millier de crédits pour environ 8.000 bénéficiaires dans 10 cantons et 3 communes de la
zone d'intervention du FACIL Les crédits octroyés couvrent plusieurs domaines d'activités : la commercialisation des céréales ;



                                                               45

les équipements agricoles, la transformation des produits agricoles, l'élevage, etc. Le intermédiaires financiers ont dans le
même temps bénéficié des subventions pour un montant total d'environ 100 millions de Francs CFA pour faciliter les activités
de formation des bénéficiaires de crédits et de suivi du remboursement des crédits.

La difficulté que le FACIL a connue par rapport à ce volet d'activités génératrices de revenues, est relative aux difficultés de
remboursement des crédits qu'il avait accordé aux intermédiaires financiers qui sont déclarés défaillants les uns après les autres.
Le FACIL intensifiera ses actions de recours auprès des juridictions de la place, afin de récupérer les crédits consentis sur les
deniers publics.

Il est important de relever que le Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier doit à l'ensemble des
fournisseurs, prestataires de services et entrepreneurs, la somme d'environ 1,3 milliards de Francs CFA. Cette somme
représente les soldes des divers contrats ainsi que les retenues de garantie pour les ouvrages réalisés.

Les partenaires du Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier sont interpellés pour la recherche des
moyens nécessaires afin de désintéresser les ayant droit dont certains ont engagé des actions en justice pour entrer dans leurs
droits. Le Compte Spécial du CTNSC est sous double saisie conservatoire depuis le mois de Mars 2005.

Dans le cadre de la composante « B » qui vise d'une part à renforcer le cadre de réglementation des aspects environnementaux
et sociaux applicable aux activités de développement pétrolier au Tchad, en s'appuyant sur les leçons du projet pétrolier de
Doba et d'autre part, à améliorer les capacités du Tchad à gérer les aspects techniques du secteur, avec la création d'un système
efficace d'information sur le secteur pétrolier, plusieurs activités ont été réalisées on peut citer : la formation, la gestion de bases
de données, les activités de promotion et assistance technique pour améliorer les moyens dont dispose le Tchad pour attirer,
négocier et, plus généralement, traiter avec les investisseurs potentiels dans le secteur.

Afin de permettre au Ministère du Pétrole de définir, piloter et maîtriser une stratégie de développement du secteur pétrolier,
des Consultants Internationaux ont été recrutés pour d'une part, évaluer le prix du brut, faire l'audit des comptes du Consortium,
de s'entourer d'experts juristes et financiers aux fins des négociations du permis H avec le Consortium Pétrolier. Il convient de
noter que l'activité de négociation du permis H n'était pas prévue initialement dans le cadre du Crédit. Toutefois, avec l'appui
des experts conseils, le Gouvernement de la République du Tchad a pu signer une nouvelle Convention Pétrolière en Mai 2004
dont les termes sont plus avantageux que ceux de la Convention de 1988.

Dans le domaine de la formation, 10 Inspecteurs pétroliers ont été formés à l'IPEDEX qui travaillent actuellement sur le site du
Projet à Komé et sur le FSO à Kribi. Il a été également formé des économistes (3) sur le modèle économique, ainsi que des
cadres (300) des Ministères du Pétrole, de l'Environnement et d'eau, des Finances, du Plan, de la Coordination Nationale, du
Collège de Contrôle et de Surveillance, de la Cour Suprême et des cadres du Projet. La composante B a financé la participation
de beaucoup de cadres tchadiens à des colloques et voyages d'études à l'étranger.

Le projet a construit le bâtiment qui abrite actuellement le Ministère du Pétrole avec tout le personnel. Mais, avant cette
construction, le Projet a réfectionné un bâtiment pour abriter l'Unité du Projet Doba. Ce bâtiment sert maintenant à abriter les
services du Ministère des Mines et de l'Energie.

Il est important de souligner que certaines activités prévues dans le cadre du crédit initial n'ont pas été réalisées. Il s'agit entre
autres de :

    · La Campagne de Promotion de la Prospection Pétrolière n'est pas réalisée ;
    · La base de données pétrolières n'est pas encore créée ;
    · La formation de Géophysiciens, Foreurs, Agents dans le domaine d'Archivage et de Gestion des Données Pétrolières,
        Agents dans les Contrats Pétroliers et Fiscalités n'a pas été réalisée.

Au nombre de ces activités prévues mais non réalisées s'ajoutent des activités nouvelles portant sur l'élaboration d'un modèle



                                                               46

économique du secteur pétrolier et formation (gestion des ressources humaines, bourses d'études universitaires, formation
techniques, détermination du prix du brut et des tarifs interprétation et gestion des contrats pétroliers, procédures internes et
management, calibrage des compteurs, allocation des coûts de production et fiscalité pétrolière, la décote), l'étude
d'établissement de l'Institut du Pétrole à Doba, l'étude pour la vision à long terme (analyse et mise en place des structures),
l'audit des Comptes du Consortium et des sociétés Own, les experts juridiques et financiers.

Dans le cadre réglementaire, le Code Pétrolier qui était en préparation au niveau du Ministère du Pétrole, vient de voir le jour en
date du 2 mai 2007.

Il est important de souligner que la Supervision sur Site de l'Unité Doba a cessé d'exister depuis le 31 Décembre 2005 et
aucune disposition n'a été prise pour pérenniser les acquis du Projet. La plupart des principaux cadres (y compris les inspecteurs
pétroliers) ayant assuré la lourde tâche de suivi et de contrôle qualité/quantité des opérations d'exportation du brut tchadien sont
reversés à la Fonction Publique. Ces cadres sont démotivés et n'assurent plus le suivi des activités pétrolières.

6. Evaluation de la performance de la Banque Mondiale

La gestion environnementale du Projet s'est bien passée grâce au financement IDA qui a permis d'avoir les moyens humains et
matériels nécessaires pour suivre et contrôler le Projet. Le parrainage de la Banque Mondiale a facilité la prise en compte dans
le cadre de la réalisation du Projet, des précautions sociales et environnementales consignées dans le Plan de gestion de
l'Environnement (PGE). Ces précautions ont été inspirées par les politiques de sauvegarde de la Banque Mondiale.

L'implication de la Banque Mondiale dans la mise en valeur d'un gisement pétrolier, comme le projet d'exportation tchadien
est une première pour l'instant. Le partenariat entre un consortium pétrolier, deux gouvernements et la Banque Mondiale est
unique au monde. Ce partenariat a permis de réaliser un projet sensible dans des conditions qui respectent les normes exigeantes
de l'institution en matière de protection de l'environnement et de développement local. Ce partenariat a permis aussi de mettre
en place un certain nombre de mécanismes pour assurer que la gestion des revenus pétroliers se fasse dans la transparence pour
la réduction de la pauvreté au Tchad.

Des dispositions législatives et institutionnelles prises avant même la production des premiers barils du brut. Toutes ces mesures
sont initiées sous l'oeil bien veillant de la Banque Mondiale pour garantir l'utilisation rationnelle, juste et transparente des
revenus pétroliers afin de permettre au Tchad l'un des pays les plus pauvres de la planète de rattraper son grand retard dans son
développement économique et social.

Les missions de supervision régulièrement réalisées par le groupe de la Banque Mondiale, le Groupe International Consultatif
(GIC) et le Groupe de Suivi de la Conformité environnementale (ECMG), ont permis d'une part, de corriger durant la phase de
construction, tous les cas de non-conformité, conformément aux prescriptions du plan de gestion environnementale (PGE) et
d'autre part, de transformer durant la phase d'exploitation, les revenus pétroliers en programmes d'action pour la réduction de la
pauvreté.

7. Les leçons tirées du Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier

Le Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier a été un instrument indispensable au Gouvernement
du Tchad pour assurer ses responsabilités aux côtés des partenaires privés dans la construction du Projet d'Exportation
Tchadien (ECMG, GIC/BM). A travers les moyens techniques de gestion, qui ont pu instaurer un système de suivi pour mesurer
l'impact des actions gouvernementales dans les secteurs prioritaires, grâce aux précautions sociales et environnementales prises
dans le cadre du projet et consignées dans le Plan de Gestion Environnementale (PGE).

Les nouveaux projets (projets satellites d'EEPCI et les autres projets d'exploration d'EnCana remplacée aujourd'hui par CNPC)
sont développés selon les principes et objectifs du PGE du PET.

Le Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier a aussi permis au Gouvernement de la République du


                                                                47

Tchad d'encaisser les recettes prévues dans les Accords de Crédits qui à ce jour sont plus que suffisantes pour satisfaire les
besoins pressants du pays et garantir le financement des programmes en faveur des pauvres.

Le Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du Secteur Pétrolier semble répondre aux besoins du Tchad. Mais, la
réduction du temps d'intervention et des ressources financières, le Projet n'a répondu que très partiellement aux besoins qui ont
fait l'objet à maintes reprises d'analyse, d'évaluation lors des différentes missions de supervision de la Banque Mondiale. Les
autorités tchadiennes ont à coeur le souci de consolider davantage les capacités du pays pour une gestion effective du secteur
pétrolier et ses aspects écologiques et sociaux au cours des années à venir. C'est pourquoi un nouveau Coordinateur National a
été nommé en date du 6 Avril 2007.

Il est important de souligner que la situation d'incertitude que connaît le Projet depuis plus de deux ans a favorisé d'une part, la
multiplication des spéculations sur le devenir des structures du Projet (CNPP, CTNSC, UPD et FACIL) et d'autre part, les
récriminations des fournisseurs et des entrepreneurs à qui le Projet doit de l'argent. Le non paiement des soldes des contrats du
Projet a occasionné des actions en justice contre certains entrepreneurs.

La nomination du nouveau Coordinateur National exprime clairement la position du Gouvernement sur la poursuite de la
mission et des activités des structures mises en place dans le cadre du Projet de Renforcement des Capacités de Gestion du
Secteur Pétrolier, contrairement à l'idée répandue qui liait la durée de vie de ces structures à l'achèvement de la période de
construction des infrastructures nécessaires à la mise en oeuvre du Projet et du Crédit 3373 ­ CD.
