IPN REQUEST RQ01/1 
 
April 11, 2001 
 
 
NOTICE OF REGISTRATION 
 
 
Re: Request for Inspection
 
– CHAD: Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project (Credit No. 
4558-CD); Management of the Petroleum Economy Project (Credit No. 3316-CD); Petroleum 
Sector Management Capacity-Building Project (Credit No. 3373-CD)
 
 
 
 
On March 22, 2001, the Inspection Panel (the “Panel”) received a Request for Inspection (the “Request”) 
dated December 15, 2000 related to the above-referenced Projects.  The Request was submitted by Mr. Ngarlejy 
Yorongar who is also acting for and on behalf of 120 residents of the Cantons of Miandoum, Komé, Béro, Mbikou, 
Bébédjia and Béboni (all in the sub-prefecture of Bébédjia), Republic of Chad (the “Requesters”). 
 
 
The Request claims that people living in the Project area and their environment have or are likely to suffer 
harm as a result of failures and omissions in the design, appraisal, and supervision by the International Development 
Association (the “Bank”) of the above-referenced Projects.  The Request claims that development of petroleum 
activities, including the development of oil fields in the southern part of Chad and the construction of an oil pipeline 
between Chad and neighboring Cameroon, represents a threat to local communities, their cultural property, and to 
the environment. There is also a specific claim that those living in the Doba basin are being harmed or are likely to 
be harmed because a compensation plan and an environmental assessment have either not been adequately prepared 
or not prepared.  Finally, the Request claims that proper consultation with and disclosure of information to the local 
communities did not take place. 
 
 
The Requesters’ claim they have or are likely to be harmed as a result of alleged Bank violations of various 
provisions of the following Bank Policies and Procedures: 
 
OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment 
 
OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats 
OP 4.09 on Pest Management 
OD 4.15 on Poverty Reduction 
OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples 
 
OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement 
 
OP 4.36 on Forestry 
BP 17.50 on Disclosure of Operational Information 
OP 10.04 on Economic Evaluation of Investment Operations 
OPN 11.03 on Management of Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Project 
OD 13.05 on Project Supervision

Mr. Ngarlejy Yorongar has submitted copies of authorization of representation signed by 
the Requesters, who have requested that their names be made available only to the Panel 
members, but otherwise remain confidential.  All communications with the Requesters in 
connection with the Request will be sent to Mr. Ngarlejy Yorongar. 
 
 
In accordance with paragraph 17 of the Panel’s Operating Procedures (the
 “Operating Procedures”
), I am 
notifying you that I have, on April 11, 2001, which is also the date of the dispatch of this notice, registered this 
Request in the Inspection Panel Register. Due to the fact that the Panel's “registration” process is often 
misunderstood, I would like to emphasize that “registration” is an administrative procedure established by the Panel 
and that it implies no judgment whatsoever concerning the eligibility of the Request. 
 
In accordance with paragraph 18 of the Resolution, paragraphs 2 and 8 of the 
“
Conclusions of the Board's Second Review of the Inspection Panel
” (the “1999 Clarifications”), 
and paragraph 18 (d) of the 
Operating Procedures
, Bank Management has been notified that it 
must provide the Panel, no later than May 10, 2001, with written evidence that it has complied, 
or intends to comply with the Bank’s relevant policies and procedures in relation to the above-
referenced Projects.  The subject matter the Management must deal with in a response to the 
Request is set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 1999 Clarifications. 
 
After receiving the Management response, the Panel will, as outlined in the 1999 
Clarifications and as provided by paragraph 19 of the Resolution, “determine whether the 
Request meets the eligibility criteria set out in paragraphs 12 to 14 and shall make a 
recommendation to the Executive Directors as to whether the matter should be investigated.” 
 
 
The Request has been assigned IPN Request Number RQ01/1. 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
 
Jim MacNeill 
Chairman
