The\n            components will: 1) strengthen the Government's\n            capacity to manage, and mitigate the impact of the Doba\n            Petroleum Project, - implemented in parallel to the\n            petroleum project in Cameroon - by building the technical\n            capacity to enable legal, financial, and environmental\n            aspects to support project coordination. Training to\n            government staff will be provided, in coordination with that\n            for Cameroon counterparts; likewise, an International\n            Advisory Panel will provide expertise on biophysical\n            impacts, preventive health management, and socioeconomic\n            aspects of petroleum projects. Technical assistance (TA),\n            and logistic support will focus on the engineering\n            monitoring, and evaluation of the Doba oil field area, and\n            along the pipeline, and, include sponsoring for private\n            investments. Infrastructure improvement will include water\n            supply, and sanitation works, and the expansion of health\n            services; 2) build the Government's capacity to manage\n            the development of the petroleum sector, providing legal TA,\n            and training on the implementation of the National\n            Environmental Framework, and on data management on\n            geological information."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
