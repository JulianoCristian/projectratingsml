Project will be to assist the Government to\n            increase the effectiveness, relevance to socio-economic\n            requirements, and efficiency of the education system within\n            the constraints of the 8-4-4 structure, and to adjust the\n            system to overall financial constraints in the environment\n            of increasing social demand which results from a high rate\n            of demographic growth and a consistently high value\n            attributed by the population to education. Specifically the\n            project would: (i) improve equity and quality of the\n            education system by constructing a limited number of primary\n            schools in deprived remote areas, by providing additional\n            teacher training facilities, and by raising the level of\n            educational quality through curriculum development and\n            increased capacity to deliver educational media; and (ii)\n            promote institutional development through strengthening the\n            capability of the Government to plan effectively for the\n            education sector and to manage its expansion at all levels."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
