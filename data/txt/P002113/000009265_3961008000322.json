The primary objective of the Project was\n            to assist in the commercial development of the Oso\n            Condensate Field with the purpose of producing up to 100,000\n            barrels of condensate per day. Bank's performance was\n            highly satisfactory. Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the major obvious lesson to be drawn from the Oso project is\n            that, despite its large and complex physical nature, the\n            financing and covenant structure was relatively simple; and\n            (ii) given Nigeria's current economic difficulties and\n            scarcity of resources, there is a need to ensure in future\n            major upstream petroleum developments that priority be given\n            first to  International Finance Corporation (IFC) sponsored\n            private sector financings with the Bank being utilized only\n            in its potential last resort capacity, subject to restoring\n            and maintaining a viable and stable macroeconomic framework."}, "docdt": "1995-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
