The ERC Project achieved most of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            partially successful, sustainability is likely, and the\n            performance of the Bank was satisfactory while the\n            Borrower's was marginally satisfactory. The PMEAC\n            Project achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was substantial, sustainability is likely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from these\n            projects. First, an adjustment effort should focus on\n            building broad support for the two or three most important\n            policy measures. Second, retrenchment should focus on\n            specific categories of employees. Finally, instead of\n            attempting to retrench civil servants throughout the\n            administration, efforts should be concentrated on those part\n            of the administration that have lost their function."}, "docdt": "1995-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
