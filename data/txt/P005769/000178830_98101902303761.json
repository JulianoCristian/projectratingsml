(iv)\n            introduction of an incentive scheme (currently not in\n            existence) based on reasonable work loads to improve\n            productivity, and (v) management and operating assistance\n            and training through a team of foreign experts. (b) Phase II\n            (1980-81) providing for the replacement or complete\n            modernization of all original spinning equipment, minor\n            expansion of the weaving capacity and replacement of few\n            machines in the processing department. Upon completion of\n            the project (Phases I and II, total annual production in\n            1981 will reach about 14.4 million 1m of 100 percent cotton\n            fabric, 150 tons of cotton wool and 170 tons of sewing\n            thread. The exact scope and optimal timing of Phase III will\n            be determined in light of the results achieved from the\n            proposed project."}, "docdt": "1978-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
