                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation support mission was conducted from January 16 to 27, 2012. There is satisfactory progress in terms of increasing proportion of qualified teachers. The
                         percentage of primary teachers with three-year diploma after grade 10 (the previous qualification requirement for grade 1-4 was one-year certificate after grade 10) reached 15.5% for
                         grades 1-4 and 77.8% for grades 5-8 in 2009/10 against the target of 15.7% and 56.0% respectively for 2012/13 ; and the percentage of secondary teachers with a degree reached

                         77.4% in 2009/10 against the target of 70.0% in 2012/13. The pace of upgrading primary teachers from certificate to diploma has been higher than planned - planned 35,244 and
                         admitted 52,932 (cumulative for 2009/10 and 2010/11). According to Comprehensive evaluation of GEQIP the textbook pupil ratio was 0.51 (or approximately 1:2) in December 2011.
                         The textbook procurement underway should significantly improve the availability of textbooks, one of the key indicators of GEQIP.
                         Based on the findings of Annual School Grants Evaluation, the results of the introduction of school grants have been very positive: ninety eight percent of schools received school
                         grants for 2010/11; ninety five percent of the schools used school grants according to the guidelines; ninety five percent of the schools used school grants to fund School
                         Improvement Plan (SIP) priorities; and in 77% of the schools, PTAs administered the funds. School grants have been substantially scaled up. For example, per student per year
                         grants for grade 1-4 has increased from Birr 15 in 2009/10 to Birr 60 in 2011/12.
                         In addition, the Government has been maintaining the high priority accorded to general education. The share of education in the total Government budget increasing from 21.4% in
                         2006/07 to 25.4% in 2009/10, and the share of general education budget in the total education budget from 52.6% to 55.4% during the same period.
