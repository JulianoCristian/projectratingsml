                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The GEQIP was prepared in the context when Ethiopia, with the rapid expansion of its education system, faced several challenges: (i) limited access to education for most vulnerable
                         groups (poor and female students); (ii) low education attainments; and (iii) low education quality. The rapid expansion of the education system had left a considerable financing gap
                         between the available funds and the anticipated costs needed to improve and maintain quality. This had constrained the availability and predictability of essential inputs critical to

                         support effective teaching and learning such as textbooks, other learning materials and teacher training and support. Based on the Education Sector Development Plan III, the
                         government had developed GEQIP with the explicit focus on quality improvement, as other programs were intended to deal with access. Specifically, the government decided to
                         monitor learning outcomes, a distinctive aspect at that time as not many countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa measured learning outcomes.

                         GEQIP was designed as a two phased APLs over a period of eight years, with GEQIP1 being implemented in four years starting 2009, ending in July, 2013. GEQIP2 is expected to
                         continue for the next four years. The distinguishing feature of GEQIP is that it provides a framework for pooling funds from several development partners: IDA, DFID, Italy, Finland,
                         the Netherlands and GPE. With this common framework, the development partners jointly conducted policy dialogs and implementation reviews and support missions with MoE and
                         government.

                         The original total funding was USD 417 million, including initially USD 333 million from development partners. The actual commitment from development partners increased by USD
                         103 million to USD436 million in response to the need for additional resources and based on review of project results on the ground. The total disbursement including special
                         commitment has to date reached 95% of the donor funds. This is a significant result given the project duration is only 4 years.

                         The overall objective of GEQIP program is to improve the quality of general education (Grade 1-12) throughout the country. GEQIP1 aims at setting the standards and foundations for
                         quality improvement reforms by (i) improving teaching and learning conditions in primary and secondary education; and (ii) improving management, planning and budget capacity of
                         the Ministry of Education and the Regional Education Bureaus. GEQIP2 is expected to expand and consolidate the quality improvement reforms. GEQIP1 contributes to the program
                         through two groups of interventions: (i) provision of new textbooks, teacher training programs and school grants to improve the learning conditions; and (ii) developing capacities to
                         plan, manage and monitor service delivery at every level of the education sector.

                         At the program level, key outcome indicators for GEQIP are: (i) improved learning outcomes through increasing the percentage of students scoring at 50% in national learning
                         assessment in Grade 4 & 8 in core subject; (ii) improved efficiency through increasing the completion rates of Grade 5 and 8; and (iii) improved efficiency in the 1st and 2nd cycle
                         secondary through increasing the gross enrollment rate (GER) in these 2 cycles.

                         At the project level, GEQIP1 project development objective (PDO) indicators are: (i) improved availability of instructional materials for core subjects; (ii) improved supply of qualified
                         teachers; (iii) maintain government commitment for quality inputs through maintaining recurrent non-salary expenditures as % of general education budget for each regions, education
                         expenditures as % of total government budget and general education budget as % of total education budget. Indicators (i) and (ii) relate to improvement in conditions that directly
                         improve learning. Indicators (iii) relates to the government’s capacity to provide adequate financing for quality improvement.

                         Achievement of program indicators – At the program level, all outcome indicators point to satisfactory or higher values than the original targets.

                         (i) Learning outcomes: The national assessment conducted in 2010/2011 school year showed that the percentage of students scoring at least 50% has increased to 29% from 20%
                         for Grade 1-4 and from 10% to 18% for Grade 5 to 8 from the year 2006/07 to 2010/11. However, when the student achievement is disaggregated into level of competencies, by
                         2010/2011, there are still only 46% of students in Grade 1-4 and 39% in Grade 5-8 who master the basic proficiency.

                         (ii) Efficiency: There is a steady improvement in the completion rates for the students in Grade 5 and 8. By 2011/2012 the completion rates have surpassed all of the original targets
                         set for the program level for year 2016/2017. Specifically, the completion rates for Grade 5 have reached 74% (against target of 72%), and for Grade 8 have reached 52% (against a
                         target of 50%). The improvement is significantly higher for girls. For Grade 5-8, the completion rates for female students increased from 33% in 20 06/7 to 52% while the completion
                         rates for male students only increased slightly from 50% to 53% during the same period. Gross enrollment rates in the 1st and 2nd cycles of secondary education also increased. The
                         GER of the 1st cycle stands at 37% in 2011/12 against the target of 44% (by 2016/17) and the GER for the 2nd cycle of secondary education has increased from 5.5% in 2006/7 to
                         8.8% in 2011/12 (surpassing the 2016/17 target of 7%). Gender parity index (which was not included as outcome indicator at PAD stage but later added to the result framework) has
                         therefore improved markedly, reaching 0.9 for Grade 1-4, 1 for Grade 5-8, 0.9 for Grade 9-10 and 0.71 for Grade 11-12.

                         Achievement of PDO indicators:

                         (i) Availability of instructional material: GEQIP1 put the target of textbook to student ratio of 1:1. The project has more than 120 new textbook titles developed, procured and
                         distributed to schools. In addition textbooks and teachers guides have also been developed in several ethnic languages, ensuring that the newly developed materials are more

                         accessible to these groups of students. Currently the ratio of textbooks (based on the number of print orders over the number of students) is estimated at 0.82. However, an external
                         evaluation (Comprehensive evaluation of GEQIP1) done in 2012 made an on-site assessment of textbook availability in classrooms reported the ratio of textbook availability at 0.58.

                         (ii) Supply of qualified teachers: The percentage of teachers with appropriate qualifications (diploma or degree) have increased from 4% in 2006/7 to 30% in 2011/12 for Grade 1-4;
                         from 53% in 2006/7 to 91% in 2011/12 for Grade 5-8; and from 50% in 2006/7 to 91% in 2011/12 for Grade 9-12. The pace of upgrading primary teachers from certificate to diploma
                         has been higher than planned - planned 56,391 and admitted 79,723 (cumulative for 2009/10, and 2010/11, and 2011/12).

                         (iii) Financing: The Government has maintained the high priority accorded to general education. The share of education in the total Government budget increasing from 21.4% in
                         2006/07 to 25.3% in 2011/12, and the share of general education budget in the total education budget from 52.6% to 54.8% in 2009/10. Data on non-salary expenditures, however,
                         has not yet been reported systematically hence trends have not yet been fully established.

                         The PDO indicators stay unchanged during the life of GEQIP1. The review of GEQIP1performance against these original indicators pointed to the following issues:

                         (i)      The indicator for textbook availability was not clearly defined, hence the monitoring of and reporting of the values of the indicator are challenging (there are at least three
                         ways of interpreting this indicator – one is the number of textbook print orders versus the number of students; second is the actual availability of textbooks in classrooms at a point in
                         time; and third is the number of textbooks issued to students as recorded in the school directors’ inventories.

                         (ii)The indicators related to education sector financing are important but they are quite removed from the interventions designed in GEQIP1. Many other programs are also expected
                         to contribute to these indicators. Hence they should have been put at the higher order program level indicators rather than at the PDO level. The reporting of these indicators is not
                         yet systematic; and

                         (iii)Several important results of GEQIP1 are not captured in the PDO indicators - these include (1) the school improvement program and massive school grants to more than thirty
                         thousand schools nation-wide; (2) policy development in the area of curriculum, teacher training and professional development, teacher licensing and re-licensing, national
                         assessment policy etc; and (3) evidence-based planning through the timely use of EMIS and the development of Education Sector Development Strategies etc.

                         Because the PDO indicators were not revised, this final ISR rated GEQIP1 achievement of PDO as moderately satisfactory. However, the team acknowledged that GEQIP1 has
                         delivered more results than the PDO indicators asked for. GEQIP1 accomplishments are the results of the efforts made by MoE and its technical directorates as well as about 60
                         universities and colleges, 11 regions, 900 woredas and more than thirty thousand schools. GEQIP1 Program coordination unit faces the challenge of coordinating a large number of
                         implementing agencies and has, on balance, overcome this difficulty and ensured that project activities are implemented within the project timeframe. This has paved the way for
                         GEQIP2 to be launched and prepared with the aim of further strengthening the results of GEQIP1.

                         The Closing Date of Education for All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund Grant I, which co-finances General Education Quality Improvement Program (GEQIP) , was extended from
                         May 31, 2012 to July 7, 2013 to align it with the Closing Date of the IDA Credit financing GEQIP. The closing date for the Multi-donor trust fund, however is June 13, 2013. As the
                         funds are pooled, activities that are funded by the pooled funds will need to be completed before June 13, 2013.
