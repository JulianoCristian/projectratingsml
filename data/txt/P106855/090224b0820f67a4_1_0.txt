                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Key implementation progress since April 2013:

                         GEQIP1 was restructured twice since April 2013. The first restructuring in June 2013, undertaken at government request, was to extend the closing dates for the four project sources

                         of funds to September 30, 2013 in order to provide additional time to complete outstanding textbook contracts. By September 2013, the disputes of the textbook contracts with one
                         supplier had not been fully resolved. The government requested another extension to enable this dispute to be resolved. A second restructuring was approved in September 2013
                         which extended three of the project funds (IDA credit, GPE new TF and MDTF) and granted an extension to December 31, 2013. The old GPE TF (ex- EFA FTI) was not extended as
                         the funds had already been exhausted. The dispute had now been formally resolved and the two suspended textbook contracts have been formally resumed. Textbook distribution is
                         expected to be completed by the new closing date of December 31, 2013.

                         During this 6 month period, a thorough monitoring of the implementation of textbook contracts by the Bank team had helped the project to close additional 20 textbook contracts.
                         Similarly, a close monitoring of the cash-at-hand position at the implementing agencies pointed to more than USD15 million unspent funds. These funds had been re-allocated to
                         schools grants (USD 12.5 million) and teacher upgrading (USD4.5 millions).

                         The original total funding was USD 417 million, including initially USD 333 million from development partners. The actual commitment from development partners increased by USD
                         103 million to USD436 million based on the positive reviews of the project results on the ground and in response to the need for additional resources. The total disbursement
                         including special commitment has to date reached 99% of the donor funds. This is a significant result given the project duration is in total only 4 and 1/2 years.

                         The overall objective of GEQIP program is to improve the quality of general education (Grade 1-12) throughout the country. GEQIP1 aims at setting the standards and foundations for
                         quality improvement reforms by (i) improving teaching and learning conditions in primary and secondary education; and (ii) improving management, planning and budget capacity of
                         the Ministry of Education and the Regional Education Bureaus. GEQIP2 is expected to expand and consolidate the quality improvement reforms. GEQIP1 contributes to the program
                         through two groups of interventions: (i) provision of new textbooks, teacher training programs and school grants to improve the learning conditions; and (ii) developing capacities to
                         plan, manage and monitor service delivery at every level of the education sector.

                         At the program level, key outcome indicators for GEQIP are: (i) improved learning outcomes through increasing the percentage of students scoring at 50% in national learning
                         assessment in Grade 4 & 8 in core subject; (ii) improved efficiency through increasing the completion rates of Grade 5 and 8; and (iii) improved efficiency in the 1st and 2nd cycle
                         secondary through increasing the gross enrollment rate (GER) in these 2 cycles.

                         Achievement of program indicators â€“ At the program level, all outcome indicators point to satisfactory or higher values than the original targets.

                         (i) Learning outcomes: The national assessment conducted in 2010/2011 school year showed that the percentage of students scoring at least 50% has increased from 20% to 29%
                         for Grade 4 and from 10% to 18% for Grade 8 from the year 2006/07 to 2010/11. When student achievement is disaggregated into level of competencies, by 2010/2011, only 46% of
                         students in Grade 4 and 39% in Grade 8 master the basic proficiency.

                         (ii) Efficiency: There is a steady improvement in the completion rates for the students in Grade 5 and 8. By 2011/2012, the completion rates surpassed all of the original targets set for
                         the program level for year 2016/2017. Specifically, the completion rate for Grade 5 reached 74% (against target of 72%), and for Grade 8 reached 52% (against a target of 50%). The
                         improvement is significantly higher for girls. For Grade 8, the completion rate for female students increased from 37% in 2006/7 to 52% while the completion rate for male students
                         only increased slightly from 51% to 52.% during the same period. Gross enrollment rates in the 1st and 2nd cycles of secondary education also increased. The GER of the 1st cycle
                         stands at 37% in 2011/12 against the target of 44% (by 2016/17) and the GER for the 2nd cycle of secondary education has increased from 5.5% in 2006/7 to 8.8% in 2011/12
                         (surpassing the 2016/17 target of 7%). Gender parity index (which was not included as outcome indicator at PAD stage but later added to the result framework) has therefore
                         improved markedly, reaching 0.9 for Grade 1-4, 1 for Grade 5-8, 0.9 fo r Grade 9-10 and 0.71 for Grade 11-12.

                         At the project level, GEQIP1 project development objective (PDO) indicators are: (i) improved availability of instructional materials for core subjects; (ii) improved supply of qualified
                         teachers; (iii) maintain government commitment for quality inputs through maintaining recurrent non-salary expenditures as % of general education budget for each regions, education
                         expenditures as % of total government budget and general education budget as % of total education budget. Indicators (i) and (ii) relate to improvement in conditions that directly
                         improve learning. Indicators (iii) relates to the government's capacity to provide adequate financing for quality improvement.

                         Achievement of project PDO indicators:

                         (i) Availability of instructional material: GEQIP1 put the target of textbook to student ratio of 1:1. The project developed, procured and distributed to schools more than 120 new
Public Disclosure Copy




                         textbook titles. In addition textbooks and teachers guides have also been developed in several ethnic languages, ensuring that the newly developed materials are more accessible to
                         these groups of students. Currently the ratio of textbooks (based on the number of print orders over the number of students) is estimated at 1.2:1, slightly above the targets for most
                         of the titles. An external evaluation (Comprehensive evaluation of GEQIP1), done in June 2012 and June 2013, made an on-site assessment of textbook availability in classrooms.
                         The study reported the ratio of textbook availability at 0.58 and 0.65 respectively, showing improvement overtime. The lower rate of availability in schools partly reflects the fact that
                         textbooks are lent to students and in general, students take turn in bringing textbooks to school to prevent damage or loss. Further, the availability may have increased as more
                         textbooks were delivered after these on-site assessments. More information will be available as part of the ICR.

                         (ii) Supply of qualified teachers: The percentage of teachers with appropriate qualifications (diploma or degree) increased from 4% in 2006/7 to 30% in 2011/12 for Grade 1-4; from
                         53% in 2006/7 to 91% in 2011/12 for Grade 5-8; and from 50% in 2006/7 to 91% in 2011/12 for Grade 9-12. The pace of upgrading primary teachers from certificate to diploma has
                         been higher than planned - planned 56,391 and admitted 79,723 (cumulative for 2009/10, and 2010/11, and 2011/12). There are more teachers enrolled in the 2012/13. The 2013
                         comprehensive evaluation revealed that teachersâ€™ use of student-centered instructional approaches had slightly improved during the project period.

                         (iii) Financing: The Government has maintained the high priority accorded to general education. The share of education in the total Government budget increased from 21.4% in
                         2006/07 to 24% in 2011/12. The share of general education (primary and secondary) budget in the total education budget was 52.6% in 2006/07 and 42.5% in 2011/12 (excluding
                         federal budget and four regions whose data was not available). This is lower than the target of 56.2%. The share of non-salary expenditure in total regional recurrent education was
                         9% in 2006/07, and 3.2% in 2011/12, (excluding federal and four regions whose data was not available). This level of non-salary expenditure, albeit incomplete, is lower than the
                         target of 5%.

                         The PDO indicators stayed unchanged during the life of GEQIP1. The review of GEQIP1performance against these original indicators pointed to the following issues:

                         (i) The indicator for textbook availability was not clearly defined, hence the monitoring of and reporting of the values of the indicator are challenging (there are at least three ways of
                         interpreting this indicator â€“ one is the number of textbook print orders versus the number of students; second is the actual availability of textbooks in classrooms at a point in time; and
                         third is the number of textbooks issued to students as recorded in the school directorsâ€™ inventories).

                         (ii)The indicators related to education sector financing are important but they are quite removed from the interventions designed in GEQIP1. Many other programs are also expected
                         to contribute to these indicators. Hence they should have been put at the higher order program level indicators rather than at the PDO level. The reporting of these indicators is not
                         yet systematic; and

                         (iii) Several important results of GEQIP1 are not captured in the PDO indicators - these include (1) the school improvement program and massive school grants to more than thirty
                         eight thousand schools nation-wide; (2) policy development in the area of curriculum, teacher training and professional development, teacher licensing and re-licensing, national
                         assessment policy etc.; and (3) evidence-based planning through the timely use of EMIS and the development of Education Sector Development Strategies etc.

                         GEQIP has by and large achieved the PDOs of (i) improving teaching and learning conditions in primary and secondary schools and (ii) improving management, planning and budget
                         capacity of MoE and REBs with some short-coming in the indicators for sector financing. The achievement of PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

                         GEQIP1 accomplishments are the results of the efforts made by MoE and its technical directorates as well as about 45 universities and colleges, 11 regions, 1,000 woredas and more
                         than thirty eight thousand schools. GEQIP1 Program coordination unit faces the challenge of coordinating a large number of implementing agencies and has, on balance, overcome
                         this difficulty and ensured that project activities are implemented. This has paved the way for GEQIP2 to be launched and prepared, further strengthening the results of GEQIP1.
