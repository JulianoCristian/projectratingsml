                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In December 2012, the Joint Management Committee (JMC) of the PSF, based on recommendations from an external review of the pilot, agreed to extend the pilot phase to 30 June
                         2013. This would allow more time to gather learning and lessons and to develop evidence based proposals from national CSOs (Executing Organizations, or EOs) to implement a
                         more strategic Phase II. Individual grant agreements with the 3 EOs were extended with additional budget allocated to cover continuation of existing activities up to December 2013.

                         Restructuring History
