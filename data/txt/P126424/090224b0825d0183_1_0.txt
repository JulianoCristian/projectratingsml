                         While the Peduli Pilot has, overall, been progressing well, as seen in attainment (and over-achievement) of its key indicators, this last reporting period has been one in which critical
                         management decisions were made that have significantly affected the overall program trajectory. As part of the PNPM Support Facility (PSF) portfolio reorganization, in March 2014
                         the Joint Management Committee (JMC) of the PSF approved a shift of PNPM Peduli in its second phase to direct financing by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and
                         Trade (DFAT), as a project implemented through The Asia Foundation (TAF). In recent months, the current pilot project has therefore focused on: (i) supporting the transition planning
                         of program management, implementation and oversight in coordination with DFAT/TAF; and (ii) supporting the final activities of the pilot phase and preparing for closing stages under
                         the World Bank portfolio.

                         In order to ensure continuity of support during the handover and through a ‘bridging’ period until the time when new Grants under Phase 2 become effective (planned to be in
                         September 2014), the team successfully processed the extensions of the existing PNPM Peduli Grant Agreements, in addition to Additional Financing that meets operational and
                         activity costs in this extension period. It was agreed with TAF that they will take over responsibility for staffing and operational costs of Phase 2 EO partners from October 2014, and it
                         is anticipated that their new Grant Agreements with EOs will be operational by September 2014. The new formal closing dates for the existing (Pilot) grants is 30 November 2014,
                         which will allow continued program coverage in this transition phase, and allow adequate time for completion of final local level activities, in addition to final partner and World Bank
                         reporting requirements.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following management decisions made as part of the PSF portfolio reorganization, in March 2014 the Joint Management Committee (JMC) of the PSF approved a shift of PNPM
                         Peduli in its second phase to be under direct financing by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), implemented through The Asia Foundation. In recent
                         months, the project has therefore focused on: (i) supporting the program management transition in coordination with DFAT/TAF; and (2) supporting Peduli Pilot final activities and
                         closing stages under the World Bank portfolio.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
