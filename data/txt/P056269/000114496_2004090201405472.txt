Representations on Project Procurement 
Arrangements     
Dear Sirs:
We refer to Section 3.06 of, and Section I (B) of Schedule 4 to, the Loan 
Agreement to be entered into today between the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the “Bank”) and the Kingdom of Thailand (the “Borrower”) in respect 
of the Social Investment Project (the "Project”). Reference is also made to Section 
2.08 of the Project Agreement also to be entered into today between the Bank and the 
Borrower’s Government Savings Bank (the “GSB”). We also refer to the Bank’s letter to 
the Borrower’s Ministry of Finance in respect of the “Country Procurement Assessment” 
(dated December 2, 1994).
Without any restriction or limitation upon any of the provisions of the Loan 
Agreement or of the Project Agreement, the Borrower hereby undertakes and warrants to 
the Bank that in applying its “Regulations on Purchasing and Contracting for Works and 
the Engagement of Consultants under Project Financed by External Loans” (B.E. No. 
25235 (1992)) (the “Borrower’s Regulations”) for procuring goods, works and services 
under the Project, the Borrower shall at all times ensure full and complete compliance 
with: (i) the Bank’s “Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” 
(published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 and 
September 1997) (the “Bank Procurement Guidelines”); and (ii) the Bank’s “Guidelines 
for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” (as published by 
the Bank in January 1997 and revised in September 1997) (the “Bank’s Consultants 
Guidelines”).
In particular and without any limitation or restriction upon any of the 
foregoing, the Borrower shall at all times take any and all action necessary to ensure 
that:
(a)
Each national competitive bidding opportunity shall be advertised in the 
Borrower’s national press, and bidders will be given no less than thirty (30) days to 
prepare their bids;
(b)
Foreign suppliers and contractors from eligible countries shall be 
allowed to participate in bidding for contracts under the Project, if interested, 
without being subjected to any prior requirement to be associated with local firms;
(c)
Explicit bid evaluation criteria shall be clearly stated in all bidding 
documents;
(d)
Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder at 
the quoted bid price and contract terms;
(e)
Contractors should not be required to accept additional work under an 
existing contract until they have agreed on the applicable rates;
(f)
For contracts for works, prior registration, licensing and/or other 
governmental authorizations or approvals shall not be required for participation in 
bidding competitions; and
(g)
The Bank’s Consultants Guidelines shall be adhered to for the procurement

of services of consultants, non-governmental organizations and trainers.
It is our understanding that, in making the Loan to, and entering into the Loan 
Agreement with, the Borrower, and in entering into the Project Agreement with the GSB, 
the Bank may rely on the representations contained herein.
Very truly yours,
By /s/ Nitya Pibulsonggram
