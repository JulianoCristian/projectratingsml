In order to achieve an economic\n            development along the coastal areas, the project aims at\n            effectively integrate environmental planning and management,\n            through the development, test and evaluation of different\n            methods. To this end, the project includes five components.\n            First the establishment of an institutional and legal\n            framework, thus facilitating intersectoral planning and\n            participation. With the creation of agencies and other\n            groups, in addition to legislation drafting, this component\n            will support coastal management through training and mass\n            media awareness. Secondly, the protection and management of\n            forests and natural habitats will be supported for\n            biodiversity conservation. A third component is the\n            establishment of a coastal environment quality monitoring\n            and information system, setting standards along major point\n            sources of pollution. The fourth component addresses the\n            evaluation of coastal erosion, towards an integrated water\n            management. Finally, the development of a national oil spill\n            contingency plan and marine oil pollution control plan will\n            provide support towards a Regional Black Sea Strategy Action Plan."}, "docdt": "1998-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
