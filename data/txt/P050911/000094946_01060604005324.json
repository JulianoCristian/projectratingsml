This\n            environmental assessment focuses on the Kolkheti National\n            Park. There will be few negative environmental impacts and\n            these will be minor or localized. Impacts may result from\n            construction of park infrastructure, potential increase in\n            recreational use, induced development in surrounding areas,\n            and potential changes in natural resource management. The\n            primary negative impacts may be socio-economic impacts to\n            local residents as a result of restricting current\n            activities such as illegal logging, grazing, or peat\n            extraction. Mitigation measures include siting\n            considerations; establishing boardwalks in place of trails;\n            provision of portable sanitary and waste collection\n            facilities; visual standards for buildings; rotation of\n            trail use; installation of drainage works; restoration of\n            damaged sites; establishment of retention ponds;\n            implementation of a recycling plan; rotation of grazing\n            practices; develop renewable forestry practices; and\n            implement strict logging permit program."}, "docdt": "2001-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
