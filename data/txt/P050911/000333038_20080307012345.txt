F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project aims to strengthen institutions in Georgia to manage the coastal resources of
the Black Sea by developing, testing and evaluating methods to effectively integrate
environmental concerns into sustainable coastal development planning at the national,
regional, and local levels.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)


Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project aims to assist Georgia in meeting its international commitments under the
Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP) and to implement priority actions outlined in
the Georgia Biodiversity Strategy/Action Plan. These priorities include conservation of
biodiversity at sites of international significance on Georgia's Black Sea coast, such as
the Kolkheti and Kobuleti wetland Ramsar sites; restoration of degraded habitats and
resources within the Black Sea Large Marine Ecosystem; and participation in regional
efforts to manage and sustain public goods of a transnational character.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Black Sea plays a crucial role in the welfare of Georgia's population. Not only does
it provide essential goods and crucial links to markets for oil and other products, but it
has intrinsic ecological value and deeply rooted cultural and historic significance. Over
the past decades, uncontrolled pollution, coastal erosion intensified by human
intervention, over-fishing, intervention of alien species, and off-shore dumping have
devastated the Black Sea and its littoral zone. Ongoing economic development, including
construction of oil terminals, creates a substantial new risk from oil spills to the wetlands
and nearshore marine environment of Georgia.

With the change to a parliamentary democracy, Georgia has entered a new phase of
environmental activism. The Ministry of Environment, responsible for coordinating
government efforts to protect and conserve the country's environment, has made
important progress toward strengthening legal and regulatory instruments for improved
environmental management and produced major pieces of environmental legislation.
Georgia has become a party to the Bucharest Convention for the Protection of the Black
Sea Against Pollution (1992), Convention on Biological Diversity (1994), Ramsar
Convention on the Wetlands of International Importance (1996), and signed the Strategic
Action Plan for the Rehabilitation of Protection of the Black Sea (1996). The first
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was also prepared.

In line with the NEAP and the recent development in environmental legislation, the
Georgia Integrated Coastal Management (GICM) project was designed to support the
government's interests in strengthening institutional capacity for environmental
management and ensuring that development along the Black Sea coast is consistent with
principles of environmentally and socially sustainable development. An integrated
approach to coastal management is essential for ensuring Georgia's biodiversity
conservation. Increasing public awareness through information collection and
dissemination, environmental education and participation of local communities and
NGOs was an underlying theme in all components of the project, which was intended to
increase project ownership by stakeholders and to improve prospects for sustainability of
integrated coastal management beyond the life of the project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The project aimed to strengthen institutions in Georgia to manage the coastal resources of
the Black Sea by developing, testing and evaluating methods to effectively integrate
environmental concerns into sustainable coastal development planning at the national,
regional and local levels.

Key performance indicators included:




                                              1

-       intersectoral consultative commissions for integrated coastal zone management
        (ICZM) established and functioning according to agreed objectives and
        procedures at national and local levels,
-       Georgians trained in coastal resource planning and management tools and public
        awareness and conflict resolution techniques,
-       draft legislation outlining mandate and responsibilities of a coastal authority and
        codes of conduct for coastal resource/landscape use prepared,
-       oil spill contingency plan and financing plan developed and approved by the
        government,
-       significant private sector involvement in oil pollution fund capitalization,
-       cost-effective options to address coastal erosion and municipal water use priorities
        identified.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
The project aimed to assist Georgia in meeting its international commitments under the
Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP) and to implement priority actions outlined in
the Georgia Biodiversity Strategy/Action Plan. These priorities comprised conservation
of biodiversity at sites of international significance on Georgia's Black Sea coast;
restoration of degraded habitats and resources within the Black Sea Large Marine
Ecosystem; and participation in regional efforts to manage and sustain public goods of a
transnational character.

Key performance indicators included:
-       establishment of legal status of the Kolkheti National Park (KNP) and Kobuleti
        State Nature Reserve (KNR) and demarcation of their boundaries,
-       encroachment, illegal poaching and harvesting rates reduced over baseline
        conditions,
-       information node for the Black Sea regional environmental monitoring network
        established in Georgia,
-       computer links and information sub-nodes in collaborating institutions up and
        running.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The original development objectives were maintained throughout the project life.

Key indicators were slightly revised at the project mid term to better measure
institutionalization of the ICZM principles and public outreach of the project.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The original global environmental objectives were maintained throughout the project life.




                                               2

Key indicators were revised at the project mid term to address concerns about post-
project sustainability of the beneficiary protected areas and insufficient involvement of
local communities in planning and managing the protected areas of Kolkheti.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries
The primary target groups of project beneficiaries included the communities living within
the coastal zone of Georgia, communities living in and around the protected areas of
Kolkheti, and the communities located in the port cities of Poti and Batumi. In reaching
these ultimate beneficiaries, the project delivered technical assistance to: (i) the
laboratory for water quality monitoring of the Batumi Institute of Marine Ecology and
Fisheries, now absorbed by the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under the Ministry of
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (MoEPNR); (ii) the Central Laboratory
of the Ministry of Health of the Autonomous Republic of Achara; (iii) the laboratory for
water quality monitoring under the Poti Municipality; (iv) the Coastal Dynamics Institute,
now absorbed by the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under the MoEPNR; (v) the
Integrated Coastal Zone Management Center, now absorbed by the Monitoring and
Forecasting Center under the MoEPNR; (vi) the administrations of the Kolkheti protected
areas under the Department of Protected Areas, MoEPNR; (vii) the Convention
Inspection for the Protection of the Black Sea under the MoEPNR, and (viii) the
Maritime Transport Administration and Marine Rescue and Coordination Center of the
Ministry of Transport, now absorbed by the Ministry of Economic Development.

The coast-based laboratories would benefit from the increased capacity to monitor quality
of drinking water, surface water in the sea, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, bathing water at
beaches, marine water off-shore, as well as to track key marine biodiversity (Batumi lab).
The Coastal Dynamics Institute would gain capacity to monitor, model and forecast
coastal dynamics using coastline and river modeling software. The ICZM Center would
accumulate a set of informative and reliable quantitative and qualitative information on
the coastal zone, including reports, photos, satellite imagery, GIS database, maps, etc.
Administrations of the Kolkheti protected areas would become sustainable, modern, and
viable institutions with legally and administratively sound basis, capable of delivering
mandated responsibilities for conservation and sustainable use of natural resources within
these protected areas.

1.7 Original Components
The overall program comprised five components. The World Bank financed the first and
the third components and administered the GEF grant financing for the second
component. The government of the Netherlands provided parallel financing for the
fourth and fifth components of the project.

Component 1. Integrated Coastal Zone Management Institutional Capacity-Building.
This component aimed to establish an institutional and legal framework for ICZM in
Georgia through the development of institutional arrangement to facilitative intersectoral
planning and the participation of key stakeholder groups in coastal resource decision
making. This would be achieved through the creation of: (i) a State Consultative
Commission for ICZM, (ii) the Working Group for the Advancement of ICZM; and (iii)
three local ICZM Consultative Commissions along the Black Sea Coast.


                                              3

Component 2. Establishment of Kolkheti National Park and Kobuleti Nature Reserve
This component sought to improve the protection and management of threatened forest
and wetland natural habitats within the Kolkheti coastal region through: (a) creation of
the Kolkheti National Park and the Kobuleti Nature Reserve; (b) support to protected area
administration and management; (c) establishment of infrastructure for improved
biodiversity protection and development of nature-based tourism; and (d) improved
monitoring and applied research on biodiversity and the effectiveness of conservation
efforts.

Component 3. Establishment of a Coastal Environmental Quality Monitoring and
Information System.
This component was intended to facilitate establishment of an environmental quality
monitoring system and information network through: (a) development of new monitoring
standards and regulations; (b) delivery of necessary measurement, sampling, and analysis
equipment to selected monitoring laboratories and agencies; (c) organization of training
programs; and (d) building a system of coastal information exchange between the central
ICZM node and collaborating institutions located in Tbilisi as well as in Kolkheti (Poti,
Batumi, and Kobuleti).

Component 4. Evaluation of Coastal Erosion and Municipal Water Use.
To assess the factors contributing to coastal erosion, particularly in the risk-exposed areas
of Poti (Rioni River-Mouth) and Batumi (Chorokhi River-Mouth), this component was to
finance comprehensive analysis of municipal water use and associated infrastructure in
Poti and Batumi. Based on these studies a plan for integrated municipal water
management would be developed for each locality, including analysis of cost
effectiveness of interventions to control erosion, and feasibility of proposed options to
sustainability address the most serious aspects of coastal erosion.

Component 5. Development of a National Oil Spill Contingency and Marine Pollution
Control Plan.
This component aimed to increase Georgia's capacity to implement the regional Black
Sea Strategic Action Plan and to deal with existing and future risks of oil pollution
through providing support in preparation, according to the International Maritime
Organization's guidelines, of a national oil spill contingency plan and emergency
response program. It would also facilitate identification of future investment
opportunities for prevention and abatement of oil pollution through contingency and
operational spills.

1.8 Revised Components
There was no revision of the initial project components.

1.9 Other significant changes
At the project mid term revisions were made to the formulation of the expected outputs
and key performance indicators. These changes introduced more emphasis on




                                              4

communicating project objectives and activities to stakeholders and on mainstreaming the
interests of local communities in the planning and management of protected areas.

During project implementation some reallocation of funds increased the amount of credit
resources as well as government co-financing for components 1 and 3 to cover staff
salaries and operating costs for two additional years of project implementation, to afford
a fuller set of equipment for the project beneficiary laboratories, to renovate some office
space of the MoEPNR (including space for PIU) after the Ministry's move to the new
premises, and to address a few more minor needs that had emerged under these
components during implementation.

The project required three extension of the closing date for the IDA Credit and two
extensions of the closing date for the GEF TF Grant that moved these dates from the
planned December 31, 2004, to October 31, 2006, and February 28, 2007, respectively.
These extensions became necessary due to several reasons: project effectiveness 5
months past approval, poor government co-financing of the project at early stages of its
implementation, little commitment to and slow action on the GEF-financed component
at an earlier phase of project implementation, and persisting institutional changes in the
administrations of all key involved institutions: the MoEPNR, the DPA, the KNP, coast-
based laboratories, and the PIU.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was relevant, because it directly responded
to the government's objective to protect the environment and support sustainable natural
resource management through integrating environment into economic policies and
strengthening institutional framework for mainstreaming of environmental planning and
management into economic sectors.

The project idea was conceived during implementation of the GEF-financed component
of an earlier Municipal Infrastructure Rehabilitation project, under which many of the
key elements of the future GICM project were identified. For better formulation of needs,
some participatory workshops and consultation were held with local authorities. The
project component for the establishment of Kolkheti protected areas was designed in
collaboration with regional support groups, facilitated by the conservation program of
WWF in Georgia. A dozen NGOs, actively involved with environmental and social
issues, were consulted to help shape the package of assistance to be delivered to the
beneficiary protected areas and to plan activities in their support zones. While
participatory processes at the project preparation stage looked adequate, difficulties
encountered at the implementation phase revealed a deficiency in community outreach,
because the local authorities, interest groups, and NGOs did not prove to be fully
representative of the affected communities.

The project design was based on comprehensive analysis that included cost effectiveness,
fiscal impact, technical, institutional, social, and environmental implications. Potential



                                                5

risks and expected sustainability of the project outcomes were also considered. The
overall rating of risks was modest and the identified potential threats included loss of the
government's commitment, political instability, delay in adoption of the Kolkheti
protected areas legislation, lack of incentives to encourage compliance with coastal zone
management regulation, lack of cooperation between public and private sectors in
development capacity to respond to oil spills, and inability to recruit and retain qualified
staff for project implementation purposes. The risk analysis proved to be mostly realistic
and the identified measures for risk minimization have been applied during the project
implementation.

The lessons from other Bank projects in the region underscore the need to (i) obtain
support at the highest levels to ensure commitment to project objectives and the
necessary allocation of resources for the project; and (ii) focus on institutional
strengthening and capacity building in the technical and policy areas (this is particularly
true for integrated coastal zone management, which requires an interdisciplinary
approach). Lessons also suggest that (iii) simple focused projects tend to be more
successful than complex and comprehensive undertakings; and finally, (iv) building on
existing PIUs to take advantage of knowledge and networks formed earlier can advance
project design while institutionalizing expertise.

Other valuable lessons for establishing integrated coastal management in Georgia come
from experience beyond the Black Sea, namely, from regional environmental programs in
the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas. These include the need to integrate coastal
management planning into national development plans; the need to build ownership of
the project locally through public awareness and involvement in project design and
implementation; and the need to focus on project sustainability and resource mobilization
to ensure continuity beyond the project implementation period.

The GICM project design reflected these lessons in the project's incremental approach
aimed at building a sound foundation for ICZM through institutional strengthening and
local participation. However, the principles of ICZM do not allow a simple focus
approach and, therefore, the risk of being dependant upon the support of many
institutions could have not been significantly minimized.

2.2 Implementation
Implementation in general was moderately satisfactory. The project had been at risk at
its mid term mostly due to failure of the government to manage conflicting interests of
Kolkheti wetland protection and the development of a large scale oil terminal in the same
area. After receiving strong signals from the Bank and whistleblower NGOs, the
government took several remedial actions, the most important of which was the
MoEPNR's engagement with the Ramsar Bureau for getting advice and guidance on
approaches to compensation for the lost wetlands. In the course of this cooperation some
1,300 hectares of land have already been added to the park area. Significant delays in the
implementation of the GEF-financed component around mid term of the project were
caused by slow decision-making and processing of the transfer of user rights to a building
allocated to host the administration of the KNP. Eventually this issue was resolved and



                                              6

fully adequate premises were delivered to the park administration. Government co-
financing had been poor at the earlier stage of implementation, but later improved and
has not been an issue thereafter. Institutional arrangements for project administration
were generally satisfactory. Estimates of project costs were reasonable.

Changes in country context and project clients/beneficiates
During the project life some major political, policy and administrative shifts occurred in
Georgia, including the national Rose Revolution, revolution in the Autonomous Republic
of Achara (that comprises a good part of Georgia's coastal zone), four changes in the
Minister of Environment in charge of the project implementing agency, three changes in
the head of the Department of Protected Areas, three changes in the director of the project
beneficiary KNP, and a major restructuring of the project implementation unit within the
MoEPNR, including a high rate of staff turnover. These events caused delays in project
implementation due to changing political priorities, policy trends, institutional set-up, and
staffing of key institutions involved, and also due to varying security situation and
accessibility of some project implementation sites.

Altered political/policy framework
The ICZM capacity building component of the project is the one mostly influenced by the
altered national policy trends. Although improvement of the coastal resource
management remained high on the government's agenda, the national and local
consultative bodies for ICZM were considered an additional institutional layer and their
establishment found redundant in the context of the overwhelming trend of liberalization
and de-regulation. A legal framework for ICZM is now established, though its
mechanism is different from what had been initially conceived. The Law of Georgia on
Spatial Planning and Urban Development was passed by the Parliament in 2005. It
provides for integrated planning of development at the local, regional and national levels.
The Law requires that planning is based on consideration of interests of the affected legal
and physical bodies, local governing / self-governing bodies and the State, and also
obligates that ecosystems as well as natural and cultural resources are sustained. With
such Law in force, the government saw no need for specialized ICZM legislation. The
draft ICZM law was, therefore, re-worked into the Guidelines for ICZM and issued by
the MoEPNR as a supplement to the Law on Spatial Planning and Urban Development.
The Guidelines add some specific costal zone dimensions to this legislation.

An ICZM Center was established at the project start-up and it functioned as a PIU for
several years. Later several PIUs under the MoEPNR were merged and the ICZM Center,
as a self standing legal body, was abolished. A new institutional unit for ICZM was then
created in January 2007 as a part of the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under the
MoEPNR. This unit is not a consultative body representing various interest groups of the
coastal zone - as originally envisaged - though it can contribute much to the improved
planning and decision making on coastal matters while acting as an information and
knowledge base. All studies, reports, maps, images, and databases accumulated during
GICM project implementation are being transferred to the Monitoring and Forecasting
Center. The ICZM unit of the Center is designated and equipped to accumulate the flows
of monitoring data and other incoming information on the quality of coastal environment.



                                              7

Therefore, the Center has been given a mandate to facilitate ICZM process through
provision of empirical data, professional judgment, and technical tools for planning,
managing, and monitoring developments in the coastal zone. However, capacity of the
young ICZM unit still needs to be built up to a point that is adequate to its role and
responsibilities.

Overall, the institutional and legal framework for ICZM established as a result of the
GICM project is weaker than targeted at the project design stage.

Kulevi oil terminal
The construction of the Kulevi Oil Terminal, causing a loss of 90 ha of wetlands
protected under Ramsar Convention on the Protection of Wetlands, was on the Bank's
radar screen throughout the project life for several reasons: (i) this large infrastructure
project had major environmental and social impacts within the coastal zone; (ii) it had
significant implications for the outcomes of the GEF-financed second component of the
GICM project; and (iii) the Bank's top management was approached by international and
Georgian environmental NGOs with a plea to exercise sanctions against Georgia due to
negative global externalities of Kulevi oil terminal.

Kulevi oil terminal was declared to be of paramount economic and geopolitical
importance by both pre- and post-revolution governments and the Bank has never
disputed that. The Bank repeatedly flagged to the government its concerns about the
non-compliance of Kulevi project with national legislation and the international Ramsar
Convention, and emphasized the need to mitigate environmental impacts of the terminal.
Construction commenced without an environmental permit and without formal de-listing
of the construction site from the Ramsar Convention on the Protected of Wetlands of
International Importance. Later the permit was issued contingent on meeting several
requirements. At present they are met partially. The developer has produced an
additional study on biodiversity (including a monitoring plan) and shared with the
MoEPNR the first draft contingency action plan for addressing oil spills in the terminal,
including its marine part and the railway access road. The Ministry's comments are now
being incorporated. The developer, through a sub-contractor, has also produced a study
with valuation of damage caused to the ecosystem due to construction and future
operation of the terminal, along with a proposed compensation package. Communication
with Ramsar Bureau on de-listing of the former site and allocating the new ones will be
made by the MoEPNR once the compensation parcel is internally agreed upon.

Overall, commencement of the Kulevi oil terminal construction without addressing
environmental issues was a bad environmental practice and inconsistent with the ICZM
principles. Later the new government of Georgia took several steps towards restoring
environmental compliance of the Kulevi project, including partial compensation of the
loss through allocation of alternative wetland sites for restoration and conservation, and
including them into the Kolkheti protected areas. At the same time, the operation of
Kulevi oil terminal will require taking some area out of the marine part of the KNP, or at
least re-alignment of its present boundaries.




                                              8

Some environmental NGOs argued that the co-existence of the KNP and the Kulevi oil
terminal was impossible and requested the Bank to terminate the GICM project financing
unless the terminal construction was discontinued. It was evident that the possibility of
project closure would not stop construction in Kulevi, but it might be interpreted as proof
of the low importance of Kolkheti wetlands and bring about additional environmental
damage. Furthermore, stopping project financing half way through would waste most of
the investments already made. At the same time, continuing project implementation
would be pointless if the construction in Kulevi could wipe out its outcomes. The
decision to keep the project in the Bank's portfolio was made as a result of careful
consideration of these factors. By the time of the present ICR, outcomes of the GEF-
financed component of the project prove that the wetland ecosystems of Kolkheti are far
better off as a result of project implementation than they would have been otherwise and
the project's environmental objective has been met.

Project outreach and local involvement
Stakeholder workshops during the MTR identified certain shortcomings in project
outreach and communication at the local level. In particular the following deficiencies
were noted: (i) a lack of information about the project for stakeholder communities, local
government, and NGOs; (ii) weak public awareness and involvement in the project work;
(iii) limited tangible positive impact of the project at the local level; and (iv) insufficient
participation of local communities in the planning of protected areas' management.

The main message from the MTR mission was a call for shifting emphasis to the local
level in all aspects: project administration, public outreach, community empowerment,
stakeholder involvement, etc. In response to the mission's recommendations:
(a) a communication strategy was developed and implemented in cooperation with the
administrations of the project beneficiary protected areas;
(b) one PIU staff unit began to function as Public Relations Officer;
(c) one new PIU staff unit was created with a duty station in the coastal zone;
(d) additional funds were obtained from the Japanese Social Development Fund for the
implementation of a Small Grants Program aiming Kolkheti lowland communities,
(e) a number of key output indicators and PDO indicators were reformulated to measure
progress in enhancement of the project work at local level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Monitoring and evaluation of the project implementation progress was based on the
logical framework provided in the PAD that carried a set of goals, objectives, outputs,
and outcomes organized in a hierarchical order and the respective key performance
indicators, as approved. The project outcome indicators included:

· Coordination mechanism for intersectoral planning and management of coastal
    resources established at national and local levels,
· Provision made for introducing and retaining user fees for protected areas,
· User based financing mechanism(s) for control of oil pollution piloted,
· Specialists trained in coastal resource planning and management tools and
    environmental education,



                                               9

· Information node for Black Sea regional coastal environmental monitoring network
    established,
· Black Sea environmental education materials developed for formal and informal
    sectors,
· National park staff trained,
· Local stakeholder participation facilitated in coastal development management
    decisions.

Some of these indicators, though, would have been more suitable to measure project
outputs, rather than outcomes (especially, development of training materials and training
of park staff).

During the MTR, the logical framework and key performance indicators were revised and
upgraded to reflect some lessons learned and to strengthen the logical links between the
project objectives, outputs, and monitoring indicators. Overall, the vast majority of
performance indicators before as well as after revision at the MTR have been qualitative.
A few quantitative indicators lacked baseline numerical data where no relevant
monitoring had been carried out in the country prior to the project launch.

Several tracking tools were used to measure project progress against the established
indicators. The World Bank's monitoring tool, applied regularly throughout the project
life, was the conduct of bi-annual supervision missions of the task team, that included
extensive field work in the project implementation sites, meetings with the project clients,
beneficiaries, and stakeholders. Analysis of the missions' work was regularly
documented in Aide Memoires and ISR Reports.

Advancement of project implementation was reported annually by the PIU through
comprehensive progress reports. However, the PIU ceased submitting progress reports
after the MTR, which created a gap in the borrower's reporting between the project MTR
and completion. The PIU explained this by being overloaded with the government's
frequent, multiple, and sometimes ad hoc requests to report on various project parameters
in a variety of formats. While this argument was not groundless, general progress
reporting to the Task Team should have not been compromised and more attention should
have been paid to the improvement of time management and delegation of
responsibilities within the PIU.

The development progress of the protected areas of Kolkheti was tracked by applying the
WB/WWF Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool. Information obtained through
application of this tracking tool contributed to monitoring of the outputs and outcomes of
component 2 of the project and worked as an additional incentive for protected area
administrations for improvement.

Tracking project-related developments of Georgia's national legislation was also an
indicator for evaluating the project's progress in meeting its development and global
objectives.




                                             10

Overall, the monitoring framework carried a decent mix of qualitative and quantitative
indicators that were measured in the course of the project implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Implementation of the project was monitored to track compliance with four triggered
safeguards: Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Forestry
(OP 4.36), and Projects in International Waters (OP 7.60). Compliance with OP 4.36 and
OP 7.60 has been satisfactory throughout the project life. Compliance with OD 4.01 and
OP 4.04 was considered unsatisfactory during three years of project implementation
(2002 through 2004). The rationale for that was the construction of Kulevi oil terminal in
the wetland area protected under the Ramsar Convention and in immediate proximity to
the KNP.

Later the task team reconsidered the rationale for reflecting activities not funded from the
project proceeds in rating of the project's compliance with the safeguards and found it
more relevant to apply ratings primarily with reference to the activities within the project
scope. Therefore, compliance of project implementation with all triggered safeguards has
been rated satisfactory since 2005.

Fiduciary compliance was monitored on a regular basis through financial management
supervision. Findings and recommendations of supervision were documented in FMS
reports.

The Borrower submitted to the Bank Project Management Reports (PMRs) on a quarterly
basis, as well as annual independent audit reports on the project's books and accounts.
No major issues have been encountered in the financial management of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The government recently created a knowledge and information basis for ICZM by setting
up the new ICZM unit within the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under the MoEPNR.
It is now of the pivotal importance that this new unit is built up to be able to perform as a
potent and viable national node of the coastal environment monitoring network where all
existing studies, reports, maps, images, and databases are combined and all monitoring
data from the coastal areas are further collected and evaluated.

The government of the Autonomous Republic of Achara has taken the first steps to
integrate principles of ICZM into their coastal development plans. These include: (i)
application for funds and TA for the development of landscape master plans for the
territory of the Autonomous Republic, (ii) designation of a new National Park of Mount
Mtirala and ongoing work to establish two more protected areas, including a trans-
boundary one with Turkey, (iii) introduction of pollution hotspot monitoring along the
coast, that implies tracking of point sources of industrial pollution, and (v) improvement
of beach management practices utilizing good and bad experience from the pilot activity
launched in Kobuleti under the GICM project. Successful implementation of these
initiatives would result in a tangible and sustainable improvement of the quality of
coastal environment in Achara.



                                             11

The government of Georgia, using technical assistance from EU TACIS financed Black
Sea Investment Facility (BSIF): Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine developed a number
of infrastructure project ideas, all dealing with the environmental health of the Black Sea.
These include projects for water supply and waste water treatment in the port city of Poti
and the seaside resort Kobuleti, as well as waste management and disposal projects for
Kobuleti and the port city of Batumi. Feasibility studies for these projects are completed
and investments for the detailed engineering design and implementation of these projects
are being secured by the government. Implementation of these projects would contribute
much to decreasing pollution of marine and terrestrial environment in the coastal zone.

The GICM project helped to establish two coastal protected areas. The KNR has already
become an important international destination for wetland studies. The KNP, along with
a major conservation value, carries considerable potential for nature tourism. With an
excellent visitor center, interpretation facilities, and other tourist infrastructure it is ready
to receive and service visitors. Proper marketing of the KNP, possibly in a package with
other natural and as well as cultural attractions of the Georgia's coastal zone, is of crucial
importance.

Some amendments to the Law on Establishment and Management of Kolkheti Protected
Areas are expected to deal with issues arising from (i) social tensions in the Lanchkhuti
district area within the KNP, (ii) compensation for wetlands lost to Kulevi oil terminal,
and (iii) entry of the Kulevi terminal into operation. One legally designated part of the
KNP, which falls under administrative district of Lanchkhuti district, de-facto is not yet
delivered to the jurisdiction of the Park administration, as the authorities have not come
up with acceptable alternatives for community forest use within this area. The
Department of Protected Areas (DPA) under the MoEPNR is working with local
government, the Department of Forestry, and communities to resolve this matter.

The three laboratories supported under the GICM project have received a comprehensive
package of assistance to bring them up to international standards of environmental quality
monitoring. One of the laboratories, however, was closed shortly after project
completion. Due to still ongoing institutional changes, the system of agreed-upon water
quality monitoring data generation as well as their compilation, processing, and
publishing in the ICZM unit of the Monitoring and Forecasting Center is not yet
operating smoothly. Available funding is insufficient for full operation and proper
maintenance of the coastal laboratories. Therefore, their technical capacity is
underutilized. The MoEPNR should promptly address the above issues and come up with
adequate solutions, allowing them to take full advantage of the high-tech laboratory
facilities obtained as a result of the GICM project implementation.

Erosion of Georgia's Black Sea coastline continues to be a pressing problem, originating
from natural as well as anthropogenic sources both within and outside the country's
territory. The GICM project brought in the best international expertise for analyzing
nature of erosion, understanding coastal dynamics and proposing a range of possible
technical solutions. Human capacity, hardware and software for coastal modeling were



                                               12

delivered to the Institute of Coastal Dynamics, which recently was absorbed by the
Monitoring and Forecasting Center of the MoEPNR. This provides good institutional
grounds for the ICZM unit and the coastal dynamics team to work jointly under the
umbrella of this Center and to provide valuable advice to a recently created inter-agency
commission on coastal erosion.

The marine oil spill contingency action plan was drafted under the GICM project in 2000.
The document was not adopted by the government due to lack of consent between
stakeholders on the roles of various agencies in reacting to possible spills. Neither had
the final decision been reached on the mechanism of financing the response actions.
Later the Bank-supported Energy Transit Institutional Development project picked up the
draft action plan to reflect the recent administrative changes and to include a fresh set of
comments from the stakeholders. The new iteration of the marine oil spill contingency
action plan is now delivered to the MoEPNR. The next step would be for the MoEPNR
to circulate it to the Cabinet and facilitate formal adoption by the government.

The World Bank, through its continued sector dialogue with the MoEPNR, will keep
track of the government's next steps and actions on the above issues that remain
important for the purpose of the GICM project developmental and global objectives
beyond its lifetime. An analytical and advisory activity of the Bank, as planned in the
current CPS, around legal and policy issues of resource use in the KNP would be highly
beneficial for continuing cooperation with the government on long term sustainability of
protected areas.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The GICM project was designed during the period of the CAS dated September 12, 1997.
Protecting the environment and supporting sustainable natural resource management was
one of four main objectives of that CAS. Among the associated issues identified in the
CAS were that environmental concern had not been effectively integrated into economic
policies and that institutional arrangement to facilitate the mainstreaming of
environmental planning and management into economic sections were weak. The design
of the GICM project was highly appropriate to the above CAS objective and the issues
identified therein. The GICM project objectives and the design of its component
financed from GEF were also fully relevant to the priorities of the GEF Biodiversity focal
area under operational programs for the Coastal, Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems as
well as for the Forest Ecosystems. The project activities concentrated on the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in coastal forest wetlands and nearshore
waters of Georgia which are of international importance. At the same time, they were
designed to support Georgia in meeting its commitments under the BSEP and to
implement priority actions outlined in the NEAP. The integrated approach chosen in the
project design for the management of coastal resources reflects actual trends of
international environmental legislation.




                                               13

While the project was prepared and approved by the end of 1998, it became effective in
May 1999 and implementation finished in 2006. This period of time was very intense in
terms of political developments in Georgia. After an initial starting period, the project
was affected by the country-wide deteriorating situation in 2002-2003. The project was
successful during this period in ringfencing specific coastal protection activities from the
external situation, including maintaining a positive dialogue with the Autonomous
Republic of Achara during a tense period between Tbilisi and the Achara government. It
was appropriate during this period that the MTR confirmed the validity of the PDOs, with
an increased focus on the need to strengthen communication and local participation.
Following the Rose Revolution in 2004 until present, the government consolidated its
political and economic situation, and began to move in a direction towards more de-
regulation and less interference with the private sector. This resulted in a tension
between the earlier approach and the new one, but no further effort at restructuring took
place to adjust to this new situation, initiated by either the Bank or the Borrower.

The reluctance of the Cabinet to pass the ICZM legislation and to establish representative
consultative bodies for ICZM decision-making at the national and local levels became
apparent in early 2006. The work under ICZM component of the project was then shifted
promptly and efforts were re-directed towards development of ICZM Guidelines. This
non-discretionary document of advisory nature was issued by the MoEPNR in the last
year of the project implementation.

While protection of the environment and of natural resources dropped on the
government's priority list over the project's lifetime, the development of Georgia's
tourism potential has been declared one of the vehicles for the country's economic
growth. In this light strengthening and expanding of the protected area network for
nature tourism is getting high level political support. While the project was at risk in the
past due to failure of the former government to allocate an adequate building for the
administration of the KNP and the limited ownership of the park by its local
administration as well as the DPA, the situation changed significantly under the new
government. With adequate leadership at both central and local levels and the increasing
public funding to the protected areas of Kolkheti, implementation progress of the GEF -
funded protected areas component of the GICM project improved tangibly towards the
end.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives
Achievement of PDO:
The project partially met its development objective. Key indicators of PDO achievement
were (i) creation of a mechanism for inter-sectoral planning and management of coastal
resource use, (ii) ensuring stakeholder participation in coastal management, and (iii)
training a critical number of specialists in the ICZM A legal framework for ICZM has
been established, though through the instruments different from what was planned
initially. The Law on Spatial Planning and Urban Development was passed by the
Parliament in 2005, which provides for integrated planning of development at the local,



                                               14

regional and national levels. This Law requires that planning is based on consideration of
interests of the affected legal and physical bodies, local governing / self-governing bodies,
and the State, and also obligates to ensure sustainability of ecosystems as well as
conservation of natural and cultural resources. With such law in force, the government
saw no need in a specialized ICZM legislation. Instead, the Law on Spatial Planning and
Urban Development was supplemented with the Guidelines for ICZM, issued by the
MoEPNR, that add some specific costal zone dimensions to this legislation.

The project was not able to ensure meaningful participation of stakeholders in coastal
management. Institutional mechanisms for stakeholder involvement should have been
created by setting up representative bodies in several locations of the coastal zone as well
as having one once central body in Tbilisi. However, the project did not result in the
establishment of consultative commissions for ICZM, as such institutions had been
considered a redundant additional layer of decision-making which could restrict the
smooth flow of investments and economic growth. A conceptually different ICZM unit
was set up under the MoEPNR as a knowledge base, rather than a forum for participatory
intersectoral planning of coastal development. The ICZM unit is fully mandated and well
equipped to operate as an information node for the Black Sea coastal environment
monitoring network. Though, due to continuous restructuring of both central and coast-
based institutions that comprise the monitoring network, the ICZM unit is not currently
operating at full capacity and has yet to establish a strong ownership of the system.

A sufficient number of specialists received training in the field of ICZM, which allowed
them to acquire relevant knowledge and skills. Therefore, the project succeeded in
creating human resources for ICZM at the national level.

In summary, out of three PDO indicators one was fully met, while two indicators were
achieved by about 30%. With this status towards the end of the project implementation,
the overall outcome was found moderately satisfactory, because even without the ICZM
law and inter-sectoral ICZM commissions, the project-assisted developments in the legal
and institutional framework allowed for tangible improvement of coastal planning and
management practices. However in the period between the project closure and the time
of this ICR the government showed little interest in promoting integrated planning of
development within the framework established under the project based on the Law on
Spatial Planning and Urban Development and the ICZM guidelines. Furthermore, while
all three beneficiary laboratories for water quality monitoring had been operational by the
project completion and the ICZM unit had been created within the Monitoring and
Forecasting Center for the MoEPNR, at present one of the laboratories is abolished, the
second one has developed problems due to poor management, and the central ICZM unit
is not performing effectively its mandate. Therefore, the ICR rates achievement of PDO
moderately unsatisfactory.

Achievement of GEO:
Overall outcome of the GEF-financed component for the establishment of the KNP and
the KNR is satisfactory and the project met its global environmental objective. Key
indicators of achieving GEO were (i) creation of an information node to accumulate



                                             15

coastal monitoring data, (ii) establishment of use fee collection and retention system in
the protected areas of Kolkheti, and (iii) increasing capacity of the protected areas' staff.
Starting from scratch by designating these protected areas, towards the project
completion their management plans have been approved and operational, the area under
protection has been registered and physically benchmarked, capable administration units
built, effective system of patrolling introduced, high quality administrative and visitor
servicing infrastructure installed, user fee collection and retention by administrations
ruled in, and a strong basis laid for biodiversity monitoring and research. Both
beneficiary protected areas are well established now, with their management structure on
firm footing. Much effort has been invested in regulating natural resource use within the
protected areas and reconciliation of local community interests with the goals of
conservation and nature tourism development. Though this process is still ongoing and
calls for further improvements at the national level, beyond the scope of GICM project.
Issues around marine part of the KNP are not yet resolved. The boundaries of the marine
part must be legally revised due to Kulevi oil terminal entering into operation in 2007,
and its patrolling should be organized. Without undermining magnitude of this problem
the achievement of GEO is still rated satisfactory to reflect a huge difference that the
establishment of the KNP and the KNR made for the Georgia's coastal zone in terms of
formalizing wetland conservation values as well as physically protecting wetlands from
eradication through draining, timber and peat extraction, and other forthcoming threats.

An information node for accumulation of the coastal information was created within the
Monitoring and Forecasting Center of the MoEPNR. It holds valuable sets of baseline
data, as well as analytical reports on the state of environment in the coastal zone, and a
rich gallery of images. Collecting current information and keeping the databases up-to-
date is a challenge faced by the Center.

By and large, the project succeeded in the improvement of the protection and
management of threatened forest and wetland natural habitats within the Kolkheti region
and in integrating these protected areas into the broader objectives of development in the
coastal zone. Achievements in conservation of Kolkheti wetlands is a major contribution
to the implementation of the Georgia Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (BSAP), as
preserving biodiversity sites of international significance on Georgia's Black Sea coast is
among the priorities outlined in the BSEP.

3.3 Efficiency
Costs incurred for implementing the GICM project were US$ 7.9 million along with
potential costs of foregone economic activity as a result of establishing protected areas of
Kolkheti. Out of the total project cost, financing of the GEF component was US$ 1.3
million, which represents the incremental cost for achieving sustainable global
environmental benefits from conservation of Kolkheti wetlands carrying international
importance. The types of foregone economic activities due to establishment of Kolkheti
protected areas comprise hunting and peat mining, none of which would have any major
economic importance. Potential costs of foregone fishing and firewood extraction had
been minimized to negligible level, as the amendment introduced to the Law on the
Establishment and Management of Kolkheti Protected Areas provided for the traditional



                                              16

use zone within the park, where regulated extraction of fish and wood is permitted and
meets the basic needs of the gateway communities.

Overall benefits from the establishment and development of the Kolkheti protected areas
are numerous. Although most of these benefits cannot be quantified, their importance is
well justified. Benefits were secured in public health, tourism, preservation of ecological
resources - including the functional values of wetlands for flood protection, pollution
filtration and habitat values, including habitats for migratory birds. Project supported
research of Kobuleti peat bogs led to the remarkable scientific finding that dramatically
increases the value of Global benefit from their conservation. Namely, peat bogs of
Kobuleti turned out to be of a rain-fed percolating type, which is a unique combination.
Kobuleti bogs also have been proven to have an outstanding growing rate. Ongoing
research may lead to the development of peat bog farming technology for
environmentally harmless production of peat in future.

Investments into the establishment and development of Kolkheti wetlands had an
important positive spillover to the Georgia's national network of protected areas. The
GICM project supported debates over the legal instruments for protected areas zoning
and administration, that have directly resulted in upgrading the national legislation on
protected areas. Also, the GEF component of the GICM project increased awareness of
the importance of wetland ecosystems that had been almost non-existent by the time of
the project start-up.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
The project development objective was highly relevant at the time of preparation and
remained so throughout the project life. With the increasing magnitude of energy transit
through Georgia's seaports and booming investment in coastal infrastructure, the
importance of the project's development objective even grew during its implementation.
At the same time the overriding political trend of creating a welcoming environment for
investment and the tendency towards deregulation altered the government's vision of
what they would like to achieve through introduction of ICZM in this country. The
project adapted to the changing demands of the client and, overall, succeeded in laying
foundation for Georgia's ICZM capacity. However, without proper institutions or forums
for meaningful involvement of local stakeholders in planning of coastal development and
with limited indication of the government's ownership of ICZM principles towards the
project completion and post project phase, the overall outcome rating of the Bank project
is moderately unsatisfactory.

The Global environmental objective of the project has been fully relevant throughout the
project life. The government's ownership of the GEF Component of the GICM project
has considerably increased towards the end of project implementation, which allowed
achieving much despite significant delays and problems encountered earlier in the project
life. Investing a modest amount of US$1.3 million in the GEF-financed component of
the project generated significant benefits at the local, national, and international level and
produced sustainable, irreversible outcomes. With the excellent results and prospects for
wetland conservation in the KNR and in the terrestrial part of the KNP, but little



                                              17

achievements in the marine part of the park due to the compromising decisions on Kulevi
oil terminal, the overall environmental impact of the project is satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
Institutional Change/Strengthening
The process of developing, discussing, and approving management plans for Kolkheti
protected areas has been a learning process for several involved institutions. This
exercise contributed much to the development of in-country capacity of protected area
planning. A team of professionals that had contributed to the management plans of the
KNP and the KNR is currently involved in planning of other protected areas and their
expertise is in high demand.

Experience with Kolkheti protected areas demonstrated certain weaknesses of the public
consultation process previously believed to be good enough and applied to planning of
these protected areas. Lessons learned are fully applied to the process of planning new
protected areas in the country.

A lengthy process of adopting management plans for Kolkheti protected areas led to the
identification of some procedural glitches. As a result, the government amended the
procedure of approving protected area management plans and made it less cumbersome.

Through the building of a new visitor center in the KNP, the project helped to introduce
the concept and principles of "green architecture" to the country. The architect of this
building got the initial inspiration for this approach through one of the project's study
tours to the US National Parks and is now successfully promoting the ideas of green
architecture within Georgia.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

The overall rating for the risk to project development outcomes is significant. The main
background behind this rating is the persisting institutional changes in combination with a
powerful trend of deregulation and liberalization in support of ambitious goals as regards
attracting investments to the country and achieving strong economic growth.

With respect to ICZM institutional capacity building this means that the integrated and
participatory planning approach, as envisaged in the project design, is not well supported
by the government. It decided against creating participatory consultative institutional
bodies for planning coastal development at the national and local levels. The ICZM
Guidelines, developed under the project, represent a somewhat weaker, non-binding
planning tool that leaves the introduction of stronger coastal zone specific regulations and
legal instruments for the future.

The newly established ICZM unit under the Monitoring and Forecasting Center within
the MoEPNR was established very recently. Its new staff has to build up their ICZM
capacity from a basic level. The central ICZM database established under the project



                                               18

(GIS, protocols of data exchange) is currently unattended. Therefore, there is no firm
assurance of having a successful ICZM unit in place any time soon. It should be noted
though, that the approval of the Law on Spatial Planning and Urban Development in
2005 has created a permissive environment for stakeholder participation and
consideration of different interests in planning of coastal development.

With respect to the establishment of coastal environment quality monitoring and
evaluation system, the institutional sustainability of project outcome is questionable. Out
of the three laboratories that received equipment and training under the project, one is
fully functional, one has been abolished with currently unclear arrangements for
absorption of its functions by other institutions, and for one - staff turnover has already
contributed to some loss of the acquired capacity.

The overall rating of the risk to GEO outcome is low. The main reasons for this
evaluation are impressive results from the GEF component of the project. The KNP and
the KNR have been successfully established. The major part of designated territories is
legally transferred to the protected area administrations, border demarcation is completed,
functioning administration units and high quality administrative and visitor servicing
infrastructure are in place. Considerable effort has been made to regulate natural
resources use within the protected areas with tangible results regarding forest
management, fishery and hunting. Both administrations of the project beneficiary
protected areas are continuously working on further improvement of their law
enforcement measures. Ownership of and support to the KNP and the KNR
demonstrated by the Department of Protected Areas is fully adequate. Public funding
from the State budget of these protected areas has been increasing for the last couple of
years. With the current management structure on firm footing, prospects for conservation
of internationally important coastal wetlands and biodiversity are generally good. It is
also expected that the development of nature tourism will contribute to stabilize the
protected areas.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
The Bank's overall performance in the identification, preparation assistance, and
appraisal of the project is rated satisfactory. An Environment Specialist with extensive
worldwide experience in marine biology and coastal matters was in charge of the team at
the early stage of the project identification and preparation. The preparation was
adequately performed in a reasonable time, resulting in a well-designed project
addressing government priorities as outlined in the CAS as well as the Global objectives
of conserving wetland ecosystems and their biodiversity. For shaping up the GEF-
financed component, the outputs of the WWF's Conservation Program in Georgia were
plugged into the project planning. Using of this resource was highly relevant, as the
WWF's work had identified the Kolkheti wetlands as a location for one of the seven




                                              19

potential national park sites in Georgia and produced guidelines for the development of
protected areas in Kolkheti.

All key arrangements for project implementation, including placement of a PIU within
the MoEPNR as well as establishment of accounting, financial reporting, and auditing
systems, had been made on time and with due consideration. The Bank got assurance in
the government's commitment to the introduction of ICZM policies and principles
through the establishment of a central consultative body on ICZM prior to the project
start-up. The State Consultative Commission for Integrated Coastal Zone Management
was indeed set up through a presidential decree in October 1998.

Quality of Supervision
The Bank's supervision performance was moderately satisfactory. In the course of
implementation, the Bank conducted 17 supervision missions (about two a year) and a
MTR. The Sector Manager made important contribution to the MTR by visiting project
implementation sites and participating in the discussions with the project clients,
beneficiaries, and other stakeholders. In general, the composition of the Bank missions in
terms of appropriate skill mix, expertise and staff continuity was assured, with
consultants mobilized for specific areas when needed.

In response to the findings of MTR, a key message of which was the lack of local
community involvement in and ownership of the project, the Bank's task team provided
strong follow up on the development and implementation of a public awareness program.
Furthermore, the task team raised Japanese Social Development Fund financing for
carrying out a project for Improving Livelihood Security in Kolkheti Lowlands, as a
supplemental activity to the GICM project.

The project implementation progress was carefully monitored by the supervision team
and was recorded in the ISRs. The Bank systematically tracked financial management
and procurement under the project through regular oversight of the financial management
system of PIU, commenting on and clearing procurement documents pertaining prior
review contracts and conducting regular post-reviews of other procurement. Safeguard
compliance was also monitored throughout the project implementation and recorded in
all ISRs.

The supervision team has been cooperative and helpful to the project implementing
agency. This implied, inter alia, working closely with four different administrations of
the MoEPNR and three administrations of the DPA that were in office during the project
lifetime, to discuss relevance of the project concept, brief on the implementation history,
explain the Bank expectations of the Borrower performance, and achieve synergy. The
Bank team also maintained constructive dialogue on project related issues with the
environment protection and natural resources agency of the Autonomous Republic of
Achara.

One shortfall in project supervision was that the project team kept its cooperation on
project matters confined to the implementing agency, and within this agency talked



                                              20

mostly with one high ranking focal point designated for overseeing the Bank-assisted
operations. In regular circumstances this could have been sufficient, but in a highly
dynamic political environment and during a period of major policy changes the
supervision team should have sought broader views on the developments which had been
of multi-sectoral interest. With that the Bank could have diagnosed a need for
restructuring elements of the project related to integrated planning process and could
have taken initiative in discussing this matter with the government.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
The Bank's performance was fully satisfactory at the early stage of the project
identification and preparation. Supervision was also well organized and highly
professional, through its efforts were affected by nation-wide political developments
which raised issues of a cross-sectoral nature and, therefore, stronger higher level
management attention might have been warranted at times. The rating of the overall
Bank performance is, therefore, moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Government Performance
The government was highly committed to the project idea at the preparation stage and
acted proactively on a few matters. For instance, the State Consultative Commission for
ICZM was established through the Presidential Decree in October 1998, preceding the
project effectiveness in May 1999. The ICZM Center was established in the capacity of
the GICM PIU in April 1999, also prior to the date of effectiveness.

Shortly after the project start-up the issue of Kulevi oil terminal construction emerged.
Important decisions and rulings made by the government pertaining to this construction
project deviated from national legislation and the provisions of the Ramsar Convention,
which certainly was not in harmony with the ICZM spirit and the best practice.

Later political and policy trends emerging in Georgia caused further weakening of the
government's ownership of the ICZM approach, though no formal request was made for
restructuring or dropping any of the GICM project components. Towards the end of the
project life the government did not adopt ICZM legislation opting rather for non-biding
ICZM guidelines, and did not establish ICZM consultative bodies. This reduced
commitment was exacerbated by numerous changes in environmental and project
management over the project life.

Unlike their mixed attitude towards the ICZM principles, the government's commitment
to the GEF financed component of the GICM project increased substantially over the
time. Significant hindrances were experienced with implementation of this component at
the earlier stage of implementation due to lack of the government's commitment and
delayed decision-making. Later the new administration of the MoEPNR turned things
around and provided excellent cooperation on all major aspects. The strong leadership
of the MoEPNR's central administration and the DPA in achieving sustainability of
protected areas of Kolkheti continues post-project and is remarkable.




                                              21

Delays in co-financing of the GICM project from the State budget was a major issue
early in project implementation. Significant improvement of the country's financial
systems and institutions after the Rose Revolution has eradicated the glitches in co-
financing and it has been smooth ever since.

Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
The MoEPNR provided good leadership and oversight during the preparation and
implementation of the GICM project.

The ICZM Center under the MoEPNR acted as a GICM PIU for the considerable period
of implementation. Closer to project completion a new legal body was established as a
PIU for all Bank assisted operations being implemented by the MoEPNR. While the
ICZM Center demonstrated full dedication to the project goals and objectives and carried
good technical staff, it was weaker in contract management and in meeting established
deadlines. Restructuring of the PIU resulted in a stronger management and closer
integration of its work with the MoEPNR mainstream activities, though the skill mix
deteriorated somewhat with the loss of technical professionals. Reporting progress on the
project implementation was inadequate since the MTR. Eventually, the Implementing
Agency with its PIU managed to deliver majority of the project outputs that had been
under its control and discretion, disbursed all but negligible proceeds of the project and
properly accounted for them.

Performance of the implementing agency is, therefore, rated moderately satisfactory.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Considering performance of the Borrower, the project implementing Ministry, and the
Project Implementation Unit in general during all stages of the project cycle, the rating is
moderately unsatisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

Community awareness and participation in a project may not always be achievable
through adequate involvement of local NGOs.
Community outreach is a big challenge, as that implies extensive work with a great
number of diverse people. Therefore, it is logical to try reaching communities through
their representative bodies, such as elective bodies of local government and more so ­
local NGOs. But that may not always be a sufficient tool for public outreach in Georgia.
Membership of many NGOs in this country is based on belonging to a professional field.
Some are being created to set up bodies eligible for receiving grants or for selling variety
of services. Such NGOs are usually good policy promoters, fundraisers or watchdogs,
but they may not be reliable conduit for community preferences and concerns. Therefore,
the extent to which local NGOs could be used as agents for community involvement calls
for cautious consideration on case-by-case basis.



                                             22

Consultative councils of protected areas in Georgia are actually dysfunctional at
present and their concept needs to be rethought.
An example with the KNP and the KNR illustrated a problem with setting-up and
operating consultative councils to the protected area administrations, with is a generic
issue for the national network of protected areas. The Law of Georgia on the Protected
Areas System calls for having such councils in place and this legal requirement is being
concurred with by formal establishment of the councils, but there is no example of an
effectively functioning council for any of the protected areas. Therefore, revisions are
required to make the councils viable, as they are in other countries. This could imply
altering the existing mandate of the councils, changing the current pattern of member
composition, and/or other measures.

For biodiversity conservation projects it is advisable to plan development of
biodiversity/protected area management plans as early in the project cycle as
possible.
The timeframe necessary for the development of management plans for Kolkheti
protected areas under the GICM project had been dramatically underestimated, and later
it turned out not to be an exceptional case for projects being implemented in Georgia.
Delays with development of management plans resulted in a lesser time and resources
available for their implementation within the project life and with project's assistance.
The lesson drawn from this experience is that preparation of management plans should be
scheduled within a realistic timeframe and as early in the project cycle as possible ­
preferably during project preparation.

Efficiency of capacity building of institutions though short term training of staff is
limited within the systems with high level of staff turnover.
Capacity building activities conducted under the GICM project could have only a limited
effect. One reason is the high rate of staff turnover and institutional instability which
affects all levels of public sector management. The second reason is the general lack of
adequate professional staff in the beneficiary public institutions due to modest salaries
compared to the private sector. The short term training that is possible through a project
could only supplement or improve existing skills but not replace professional education.
Furthermore, investing too much in staff training carries a risk of not getting an adequate
outcome, as there are no guarantees that majority of trained staff will stay in their current
positions through the project life and beyond. Therefore, it is advisable to carefully
balance between staff training and introduction of systemic changes in
institutional/managerial patterns, which are less dependant on staff turnover.

For medium term perspective projects should not focus on introduction of
ambitious environmental legislation, but rather on achieving good environmental
performance under current legal framework.
Provided the assumption that the trend of de-regulation and market liberalization
continues in Georgia, projects would most likely not succeed in fostering establishment
of overarching environmental legislation. Instead, projects should concentrate on
building awareness and capacity for good environmental performance at the level of



                                              23

individual institutions, administrations, and communities. This recommendation is based
on the fact, that current environmental legislation is being applied to full extent and it is
actually permissive for much better performance, provided that there is willingness and
adequate capacity in respective institutions.

Management of protected area projects needs strong presence both centrally and
locally.
Establishment of new protected areas and other conservation efforts in most cases carry
implications for local businesses and gateway communities. Their sensitivity to projects
supporting protected areas calls for strong local presence of project proponents and
implementing agencies from the very early phase of the project cycle. In case of the
GICM project this lesson was drawn during the MTR and corrective measures were taken
afterwards. If the project implementation unit had had local liaison officers in place right
from the beginning, some shortfalls in cooperation with local communities may have
been avoided. On the other hand, a project team's role in maintaining dialogue with
relevant government agencies at the central level is equally important. This is
instrumental for keeping up-to-date on policy trends and political developments, which
may have direct influence on project implementation and may require some fine-tuning
of project activities with the evolving country context.

Success of a project under any line agency would depend on its ownership by a focal
point in a politically strong branch of the government.
The GICM project implementing agency, as well as the main cooperation partner during
implementation, has been the MoEPNR. Since the key decisions on urban and coastal
planning are taken by other line ministries, the project could have benefited from
establishing more intensive cooperation with the (former) Ministry of Urbanization and
Construction and the Ministry of Economy from an early stage of implementation. The
conclusion from this example is that projects, which are complex by nature and carry
development objectives that could be successfully achieved only through multi-sectoral
approach, should be implemented with permanent involvement of all key players.

Managing project implementation in a politically dynamic country should imply
regular scanning of political trends and flexibility in adjusting to changing times.
During the lifetime of the GICM project political environment in Georgia had changed
significantly, which made the Borrower out of need for some of the project's expected
outputs (ICZM law, national and local ICZM consultative bodies). Though the
Borrower`s altered expectations of the project were not formally communicated to the
Bank and no changes to the implementation plan were formally requested by the
implementing agency. Under these circumstances, timely corrective actions could have
been taken and a better outcome achieved if the importance of ongoing political changes
for the project's success had been accurately diagnosed and sensitive components had
been discussed and agreed upon with a broader group of key decision-makers in the
government.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost Effectiveness

The economic assessment of the project, carried out as a part of its preparation, included
analysis of costs and benefits which had been likely to result from project implementation.
The identified costs included the total project costs (USD 7.6 million) and potential costs
of foregone economic activity as a result of establishing the KNP and the KNR. While
the types of foregone economic activities had been well known at project preparation
stage, the associated costs had not been found quantifiable. The expected benefits
included public health benefits; tourism benefits; institutional benefits, or benefits gained
through setting up more effective means for cooperation and decision making; benefits
from preservation of ecological resources; benefits from establishing of an oil spill
prevention program, and non-use values of nature protection such as existence values and
bequest values.

The actual total project cost made USD 8.1 million, which is USD 0.5 million over the
appraisal estimate. The reasons for this are several: one is the fluctuation of the rate of
SDR exchange for USD; second is reallocation of the project proceeds from the
categories of expenditure to be financed 100% from the Bank credit/grant to the
categories financed at a lower % from the Bank credit/grant, which increased the need for
government co-financing; and lastly, the government of the Netherlands increased the
amount of their parallel financing of the project by USD 0.15 million equivalent during
the project implementation period.

The expected types of economic activity foregone due to establishing of the KNP and the
KNR had been hunting, fishing, firewood collection, reed collection, and peat and gravel
mining.
        Hunting for game indeed dropped in result of establishing the projected areas and
        this carries certain economic cost, through decreased hunting and the associated
        economic impact can not be attributed exclusively to the enforcement of the
        protection regime in the protected areas of Kolkheti. An outbreak of the Avian
        Influenza and a few incidences of the disease in wild avifauna registered in West
        Georgia resulted in a significant impact on bird hunting, which had been even
        banned throughout the country for a while.
        Establishment of the KNP resulted in altered patterns of fishing in Lake
        Paliastomi and small rivers flowing through the park. Fishing with illegal devices
        (electric shock) has been generally eliminated and some effort limitation has been
        applied through regulating fishing equipment (specifications of fishing nets).
        Subsistence fishing is allowed in the traditional use zone of the KNP, which
        significantly decreases the cost of foregone economic activity. Regulations for
        the use of Lake Paliastomi fishery are not fully worked out yet and may require
        certain legislative changes.
        The economic impact of restricted forest use due to enforcement of the KNP
        protective regime has been significantly mitigated through the establishment of
        the traditional use zone within the park. Local communities are allowed to collect



                                             32

       a pre-defined volume of firewood in the especially designated forest stands
       seasonally, which ensures that subsistence needs of rural households around the
       park are met.

The project implementation did not cause any cost for resettlement, as the protected area
boundaries had been drawn through an intense consultation process and avoided any
change in land tenure.

Most of the expected project benefits have materialized in result of its implementation.
       Economically the most significant benefits are those received from preservation
       of ecological resources, including the functional values of wetlands for flood
       protection, pollution filtration, and habitat values.
       Tourism benefits from the project are also quite significant, as the wetlands that
       had been actually a no-go area prior to the project implementation, are now being
       advertised as a tourist destination, well suited for receiving variety of visitors, and
       protected area administrations are institutionally capable of selling their services
       and managing visitation. One indirect economic benefit for local communities
       coming from the establishment of the KNP is that the market prices for real estate
       around the park's visitor center have increased in anticipation of increasing inflow
       of visitors and associated job/income opportunities.
       Establishment of the protected areas of Kolkheti had been decisive for the fate of
       wetland habitats and, therefore, for the existence of numerous floral and animal
       populations of this ecosystem, which would have otherwise become extinct in
       Georgia. Furthermore, the project intervention allowed to document the existence
       of unique type of pit bogs in Kobuleti and to conserve them, which is a significant
       gain at the regional level. Therefore, the project fully met expectations pertaining
       benefits from non-use values, namely, the existence value as well as the scientific
       value of the coastal wetland ecosystem.
       Institutional benefits from the project implementation are also tangible.
       Administrations of the two wetland protected areas have been established and
       their institutional capacity built from scratch to the highest national standard. The
       Department of Protected Areas under the MoEPNR of Georgia got vast
       experience in planning, organizing, and managing protected areas at the
       international quality standard level. The project achieved increase in the
       awareness of the importance of wetlands among several key governmental and
       non-governmental institutions.

The public health benefits from the improved water quality monitoring and introducing of
an effective warning system, as well as the benefits from increased preparedness for
preventing and addressing marine oil spills are yet to be received from the project
investments. All necessary inputs are provided and the end results are mostly a function
of upcoming managerial decisions.

Fiscal Impact

Total government financing of the project during its implementation period was
estimated to be $0.9 million USD equivalent over the six year period. The actual amount
of government financing made $1.1 million USD equivalent over an eight year period,
which brought the annual fiscal impact lower than expected. The project was co-financed
with the GEF grant of 1.3 million USD and the Netherlands government grant of $1.15
million USD equivalent (exceeding the appraisal estimate by $0.15 million USD
equivalent) that helped to reduce the fiscal burden of borrowing.

Establishment of the KNP and the KNR did not result in a significant increase of the
number of public servants hired by the government, as the administrations of these
protected areas are relatively small, and because a good part of staff units of park rangers
had been creased through converting staff units of forest rangers under the forest district
administrations. Public funding of operation and maintenance of the KNP and the KNR
has been on an ascending trend towards the end of project implementation, while the
project financing of their incremental operating costs started to drop. It happened in tune
with an agreed upon strategy for a smooth phase-out of the project assistance to protected
area administrations. During the project life the protected areas of Kolkheti were granted
a legal status allowing them to generate their own income through collection of use fees
and selling services. Such diversification of income sources certainly adds to the
financial sustainability of the beneficiary protected areas and provides healthy economic
incentives for their administrations (at least in the medium term, while visitation to the
protected areas of Kolkheti is not expected to exceed their carrying capacity).

 Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

 The KNP - a key beneficiary institution of the GEF-financed component of the project -
 has been periodically surveyed using a simple site-level tracking tool developed for the
 World Bank and WWF and intended for reporting progress at protected area sites. The
 first time this tool had been used in 2002 to document the baseline in terms of legal and
 institutional status of the KNP as well as its functionality and effectiveness of
 management. Based on the scores, the KNP was found 26.5% successful in August 2002.
 In December 2004 the evaluation outcome was 36.6 %. The last evaluation was carried
 out in December 2005, which found the KNP 64.5% successful. Therefore, the progress
 over the evaluation period made 38%.

 Below provided is an evaluation sheet from the last survey of the KNP. According to the
 instruction on the use of this tracking took, the evaluation has been done by the KNP
 administration under the professional guidance provided by the Bank consultant.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Sustainable Development Projects Implementation Agency, acting as a PIU for the GICM
Project, submitted Borrower's ICR on behalf of the MoEPNR to the Bank. Below is the
summary of this document:

Introduction

Georgia's coastline stretches approximately 310 km along the Black Sea. The coastal
zone is dominated by wetland ecosystems. Steep cliffs and mountains appear at its north
and south edges. Up-stream human activities have put increasing pressure on coastal
zone ecosystems along the Black Sea, while further downstream, over-fishing and off-
shore dumping have devastated marine resources. In general, fragmented and weak
management of natural resources at the regional, national, and international levels has
resulted in uncontrolled pollution, unsustainable exploitation and loss of productive
habitats in the coastal zone. In 1996 a regional Strategic Action Plan for the
Rehabilitation and Protection of the Black Sea was signed by all six littoral states and the
process of implementing this regional strategy begun. Its major targets for advancing the
ICZM process within each country include: (i) preparation of national ICZM strategies
and guidelines, (ii) establishment of inter-sectoral ICZM committees, and (iii) adoption
of legal and other instruments for facilitating ICZM.

The GICM project was designed to help Georgia with implementation of the regional
Black Sea Strategic Action Plan through building a strong institutional base for ICZM,
and creating enabling environment for the introduction of improved management
techniques and investments in the coastal zone.


Project Achievements

Building Legal and Institutional Framework for ICZM
The State Consultative Commission for ICZM was established through the Presidential
Decree No. 608 on October 25, 1998 to develop institutional framework for integrated
planning and management of coastal resources in Georgia. This inter-agency
representative body, co-chaired by the Minister of Environment and the Minister of
Urbanization and Construction, served as the forum for interpreting and coordinating
existing policies among the various sectors/stakeholders involved in coastal and marine
resource use along Georgia's Black Sea Coast.

From April 2002 an international consulting firm had been providing assistance to
Georgia through the GICM project in building ICZM capacity, which resulted in the
development of a draft ICZM law and an explanatory note to it. The key features of this
draft legislation included inter-sectoral cooperation and consultation, as well as public
consultation and stakeholder involvement. It provided a coordination mechanism for
participatory panning and management of coastal resources at national and local levels.
Though, the ICZM legislation had not been passed as it was found not in tune with the
government's strong fortitude towards improving investment climate through curtailing


                                              46

time required for clearing business initiatives. No ICZM councils had been founded
either. The draft ICZM law was re-worked into Guidelines for ICZM. This document
was formally endorsed and issued by the MoEPNR in 2006. Guidelines were circulated
to local governing bodies in the coastal zone as well as to relevant units in the central
government, government of the Autonomous Republic of Achara, NGOs, and other
stakeholders. Guidelines are also posted on the web page of the Aarhus Center Georgia.
ICZM Guidelines recommend creation of temporary consultative commissions upon need
during elaboration of development plans for local or regional administrative units of the
coastal zone.

A knowledge and information basis for ICZM was created within the MoEPNR in
January 2007. The ICZM division of the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under the
MoEPNR is mandated to contribute to planning and decision making on the coastal
matters through provision of data and advice.

Establishment of Kolkheti Protected Areas (KNP & KNR)
The KNP was established around an area within the larger Kolkheti wetlands lowland
that had been designated as a Ramsar site in 1996. The KNR is located inland from the
Black Sea coast near the city of Kobuleti and also represents a Ramsar site. Both
proposed protected areas support rare and relic plant communities such as peat bogs and
forests from the Tertiary period. These protected areas provide critical habitat for
numerous species of migratory and wintering birds.

    Land Transfer and Demarcation. The work that preceded legal enactment of the KNP
    apparently lacked public consultation. It resulted in a lengthily and heavy process of
    land transfer. Eventually, the protected areas are now registered with their
    administrative bodies under the Department of Protected Areas and their physical
    demarcation is also completed.

    Adoption of Management Plans. After rounds of reviews by the Bank consultants
    and the key government agencies, the management plans for the KNP and the KNR
    were approved in February 2006 and June 2006 respectively. These documents carry
    important factual information, provide good guidance for protected area
    administrations, and are of a high quality by international standards.

    Building Capacity of Protected Area Administrations. The KNP administration,
    established in the capacity of a legal body of Public Law, is granted the right to
    generate, retain, and re-invest its own revenues in the not-for-profit areas of activity
    that are specified in its charter. The GICM project provided good training
    opportunities for the staff of the KNP and the KNR. Due to significant turnover,
    some of the trained staff is no longer employed in these protected areas.

    Development of Protected Area Infrastructure. Under the GICM project the
    administration buildings were constructed/refurbished for the protected areas of
    Kolkheti. A visitor center for the KNP has been constructed following the principles
    of green architecture and this building is the first example of such environment-
    friendly construction in Georgia. Some limited infrastructure for nature-based


                                             47

    tourism such as boardwalks, shelters, a bird ringing station, hiking trails, observation
    towers for bird watching, etc. were provided to the KNP and the KNR. Top quality
    bi-lingual interpretation materials on the history, culture, and ecology of the Kolkheti
    lowland were developed in cooperation with the US Park Service and installed in
    these protected areas.

    Raising Public Awareness of Kolkheti Protected Areas. The project assisted
    administrations of the KNP and the KNR with a startup of environmental education
    and awareness activities. During the project life the beneficiary protected areas
    organized children excursions, environmental lectures in local elementary and high
    schools, published articles on the regional and international importance of Kolkheti
    wetlands, facilitated community discussions on the local hot issues pertaining
    conflicts between nature conservation and commercial interests. A number of radio
    programs and video materials on wetlands and their protection have also been aired.
    The project sponsored participation of the KNP in several tourism fairs.

Establishment of Coastal Environmental Quality Monitoring and Information
Systems
An urgent need to monitor the quality of near-shore and off-shore waters, rivers and
estuaries, as well as ports and sources of pollution was identified in a regional study
commissioned by EU TACIS in 1994. Untreated sewage, municipal waste, pollution
from dilapidated oil facilities, vessel waste, industrial pollution, and agricultural runoff
represented a well known but insufficiently measured threat to both public health and
coastal ecosystems, with negative impacts to tourism development.

A feasibility study and design for the coastal environment quality monitoring and
information system were developed by an international consulting firm under the GICM
project and groundwork was laid for its implementation. This implied refurbishment of
three beneficiary coastal monitoring laboratories; delivery of sampling, measurement,
and analytic equipment to them; improvement of monitoring standards and data
protocols; provision of training and technical assistance; and establishment of a basic
structure for an effective information system. More specifically, the key elements of the
developed monitoring and information system are: (i) the design and implementation
arrangements for the monitoring and computer-based information systems; (ii) re-
establishment of an off-shore water quality monitoring program with selected
biodiversity monitoring; (iii) strengthening of pollution monitoring in the coastal zone,
including rivers and estuaries; and (iv) creating foundation for a computer based ICZM
information system.

Institutional set-up of the entities responsible for coastal environment quality monitoring
and data management had been changing during the GICM Project life. Due to
uncertainty and a persisting process of restructuring of institutional affiliation and set-up,
the current structure of coastal information system is yet to enter into operation. Batumi
laboratory of the Institute of Marine Ecology and Fisheries has not fully settled in its new
capacity under the Monitoring and Forecasting Center, and a recently established ICZM
section of this Center is yet in the process of formation. On the other hand, the outcome
of the above institutional reforms is fully justifiable and permissive for effective


                                              48

operation of the ICZM function. The main chemical and biological facility for marine
ecosystem research and monitoring ­ which is the laboratory in Batumi, as well as the
main geological and engineering facility for researching and managing coastal dynamics
are now both consolidated within the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under
MoEPNR. All hardware, software, databases and intellectual property, accumulated
under the GICM Project, also belong there. Therefore, there is a permissive environment
for successful operation of the coastal quality monitoring and information system,
conditional to the strong ownership and management provided from MoEPNR.

Coastal Erosion and Municipal Water Management Study
A comprehensive study of coastal erosion in Poti and Batumi regions, morphology of
main rivers draining into the Black Sea (including patterns of sediment transport), as well
as an overview of water supply systems in the main coastal municipalities, their drainage
and sewer systems, waste water disposal and solid waste management delivered
important information which had been used for pre-feasibility studies of possible
interventions and identification of investment priorities.

The project helped to develop a coastline dynamics model and to transfer of the Dutch
experience in this filed to the specialists of the Georgia's Coastal Dynamics Institute. A
workshop on coastal modelling was delivered in 2000 to train local staff in the use of the
coastline and river modelling software (products of the Delft Hydraulics). Hands-on
experience was gained through a joint assessment of erosion processes for Batumi and
Poti by the Dutch and Georgian specialists. The updated beach profile measurements and
historical data to run the model were obtained and its validation was also carried out.

Capacity building of the Coastal Dynamics Institute (currently under the MoEPNR)
included provision of PCs, portable radio transmitters, river and coastal modelling
software, an echo-sounder, and a tachometer.

Preparation of a National Oil Spill Contingency Plan
Preparation of a contingency plan for accidental offshore oil spills, as well as assessment
of port waste reception facilities and development of an investment plan for the control of
marine pollution were carried out by an international consulting company in cooperation
with the Maritime Administration and the Convention Inspection for the Protection of the
Black Sea. The work resulted in a report which contains two volumes of background
information, and a draft National Oil Spill Contingency Plan for Georgia. It was
reviewed by relevant line agencies and stakeholders in Georgia and was also commented
by the International Maritime Organization. The Oil Spill Contingency Plan has not been
adopted by the government so far. Its new iteration is being circulated to the
government's line agencies again.

The Convention Inspection received a set of portable and stationary monitoring
equipment for confirmation measurements of chemicals, oil identification spectroscopy,
etc.




                                               49

In 2001 an oil spill response exercise was conducted in the Batumi harbour for the first
time in more than a decade. The Georgian public agencies as well as international oil
transporting companies involved in Georgia participated in this exercise. It demonstrated
ability of the Georgian authorities to manage complex activities of multiple actors on the
scene of emergency. The exercise had been a unique opportunity for sharpening response
action skills and for checking out reliability of the available equipment.
Recommendations were produced for the creation of a funding instrument enabling
coverage of maintenance costs of the oil spill preparedness and response.

Training and Capacity Building
Project has contributed to the capacity building of the Ministry of Environment and State
Department of Protected Ares and other agencies through training and sponsoring
attendance at various international meetings related to the protection of marine
environment and protected areas management. A few most important training events
attended with the GICM project support by the Georgian public servants and members of
NGOs include:
    the ICZM Law meeting for the Black Sea country representatives, Bucharest,
    Romania, 2000,
    1st Black Sea Conference on Ballast Waters Management and Control, Odessa,
    Ukraine, 2001,

Achievement of Project Objectives and Rating of Key Performance Indicators

Project development objective: The project aimed to strengthen institutions in Georgia to
manage the coastal resources of the Black Sea by developing, testing and evaluating
methods to effectively integrate environmental planning and management into economic
development activities along the Black Sea coast.
The development objective is partially achieved by the project.

Global development objective: The project also aimed to assist Georgia in meeting its
international commitments under the Black Sea Environmental Program (BSEP) and to



                                              50

implement priority actions outlined in the Georgia Biodiversity Strategy/Action Plan.
These priorities included conservation of biodiversity at sites of international
significance on Georgia's Black Sea coast, such as the Kolkheti and Kobuleti wetland
Ramsar sites; restoration of degraded habitats and resources within the Black Sea Large
Marine Ecosystem; and participation in regional efforts to manage and sustain public
goods of a transnational character.
The global development objective is achieved by the project.

(a)     Intersectoral consultative commissions for ICZM established and functioning
        according to agreed objectives and procedures at national and local levels

Unsatisfactory. The State Consultative Commission for ICZM that has been established
for interpreting and coordinating existing policies among the various sectors/stakeholders
involved in coastal and marine resource use along Georgia's Black Sea Coast is not
functioning any more.

(b)     Georgians trained in coastal resource planning and management tools (EA, land
        use planning/zoning; protected area management; GIS) and public awareness
        and conflict resolution techniques

Moderately Satisfactory. Training efforts in land use planning and zoning failed, but
there were several successful trainings delivered in protected areas management. These
were study tours to the neighbouring Turkey, Ukraine, Romania, and the USA. Five
individuals were trained on wetland management and restoration in the Netherlands. The
GIS capacity of the ICZM Center had been highly recognized by users, but this Center
has been dissolved upon project completion. The GIS database of ICZM information is
now owned by the Monitoring and Forecasting Center under the MoEPNR, which
comprises the newly established ICZM unit.

(c)     Draft legislation outlining mandate and responsibilities of a coastal authority and
codes of conduct for coastal resource/landscape use prepared

Moderately Unsatisfactory. ICZM draft law has been developed, but not adopted by the
government of Georgia. A law on Spatial Planning and Urban Development, adopted in
2005, provides a permissive legal environment for ICZM, though it does not carry legally
binding requirements for participatory planning of coastal resource use.

(d)     Legal status of KNP and KNR established and boundaries demarcated

Highly Satisfactory. Legislation is in place. It has been amended with acknowledgement
of subsistence needs of local communities. Boundaries of the KNP and the KNR are
digitally and physically demarcated.

(e)     Encroachment, illegal poaching and harvesting rates reduced over baseline
        conditions

N/A. This indicator could have not been used in a meaningful manner due to difficulty of
determining baseline conditions, as many uncertainties were involved.


                                             51

(f)    Information node for Black Sea regional environmental monitoring network
       established in Georgia

Moderately Satisfactory. The sampling, measurement, and analytic equipment for the
selected monitoring laboratories were procured; monitoring standards and data protocols
improved; training and technical assistance provided; and a basic structure for an
effective information system put in place. There are sufficient prerequisites for the
monitoring and information network to operate successfully, but it is not fully
functioning to date.

(g)    Computer links and information sub-nodes in collaborating institutions up and
running

Satisfactory. Many partner institutions developed simple internet nodes in line with the
overall technical development in the country. The Internet dial-up connection is
available now many coastal zone cities ­ Batumi, Poti, Zugdidi, Ozurgeti, etc. The
project provided Internet connectivity to the KNP through equipping it with strong
computers, internet node with institutional email address, and a homepage. Relevant
hardware and software has also been delivered to a number of institutions in the coastal
zone as well as in Tbilisi which handle the coastal information.

(h)    Oil spill contingency plan and financing plan developed and approved by
       government

Moderately Satisfactory. A high quality draft contingency plan developed, combined
with a field testing through a high-seas equipment deployment exercise. The
government's continued interest in the development of the national capacity for oil spill
response is evident from the approval of the non-pipeline component of the Energy
Transit Institutional Building project. An approval of the draft plan is still pending.


Lessons Learned
The critical lesson from the GICM project is that it had been overly ambitious to expect
that Georgia would have a fully-fledged functioning ICZM system by project completion.
It should be recognized that the ICZM is a long term process and outcomes of the
component A of the project would be a platform for further development over the years
to come. The international experience from the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Sea
Programmes also indicates that the process of implementing change requires long time
and much effort. Many institutions in Georgia are yet in a young stage and considerable
work is needed at all levels of the government to create the structure for and the culture
of cross-sectoral functions.

Somewhat similar conclusions could be driven from the attempts to lay a foundation for
coastal environment quality monitoring system. The general institutional constraints are
affecting its functionality as well and it would be a major challenge to achieve flawless
operation of mechanisms for receiving and communicating data and information across
ministerial and regional boundaries.


                                             52

The project faced difficulties under the protected areas component in localities with high
occurrence and much depth of poverty. Social environment and the magnitude of
problems associated with communities' dependence on the natural resource extraction
should be fully recognized under conservation projects. The other critical issue to find
effective means for communicating project objectives and offered solutions to a variety
of stakeholders that may significantly vary in terms of their social and material status,
vested interests, and aspirations.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments on the project outcomes, their importance, and lessons learned were obtained
from several key stakeholders through meetings and discussions held several months past
completion.

Department of Environment Protection and Natural Resources of the Autonomous
Republic of Achara. On March 28, 2007 the ICR mission met with Mr. I. Goradze, Head
of the Department of Environment Protection and Natural Resources of Achara, to
discuss how the Autonomous Republic, covering about one third of Georgia's coastline,
has benefited from the implementation of the GICM project. The Head of Achara's
environment agency told the mission that he sees particular importance of the GICM
project is catalyzing numerous initiatives for sustainable management of the coastal zone.
A package of assistance delivered to the KNR is highly valuable for conserving a
particular unique wetland ecosystem. Furthermore, the positive experience with the KNR
stimulated the new similar initiatives in the Autonomous Republic. With the assistance
of the WWF the first national park had been planned and legally established in Achara in
2005. Protected area planning gained indeed a strong momentum and work has
commenced towards establishment of two more, one of which is conceived as a trans-
boundary protected area to be co-managed by Georgia and Turkey.

Assistance delivered under the GICM project for strengthening water quality monitoring
in the coastal zone and identification of challenges associated with an ambition to
introduce the Blue Flag Program to Georgia's Black Sea beaches has sensitized the
environmental agency of Achara to water pollution problems. It led to an initiative to
introduce of program for point source pollution control. The government of Achara
financed inventory of water pollution hotspots and is supporting regular monitoring of
discharge at the selected high risk sites.

The GICM project helped to test a model for improved management of public beaches
through a pilot activity in Kobuleti, Achara. It implied delivery of beach equipment to
the local government for leasing it to a concessionaire under the condition of quality
maintenance of the concession area, including adherence to high standards of sanitation
and waste management. Due to institutional and staff changes in the beneficiary local
government unit, this pilot activity had not been sustained beyond one season, through it
actually produced the intended outcome. The Prime Minister of Georgia and the Minister
of Environment of Georgia, both attending the season opening event at the pilot beach,
found the proposed model of its management highly relevant and called for applying it
throughout the coastline. Currently concessions are being issued for segments of public
beaches along great part of Achara's coastline, which allowed to improve service
delivery and to increase public health and environment standards of beach maintenance.

IUCN Programme for Southern Caucasus. On March 22, 2007 the ICR mission met Mr.
R. Gokhelashvili, Director of the IUCN Programme Office for the Southern Caucasus, to
hear his opinion on the GICM project outcomes. Mr. Gokhelashvili noted the importance
of the assistance delivered through the project with conservation of wetland ecosystems,



                                             54

including those representing habitat for migratory birds. The project provided some
infrastructure and equipment for birdwatching in the beneficiary projected areas and
sponsored a publication on avifauna of Kolkheti, which is an excellent educational
material and a guide for birdwatches.

Speaking of the challenges of managing protected areas, Mr. Gokhelashvili mentioned
that the consultative board established for the KNP, alike similar bodies set for other
protected areas in Georgia, did not succeed in becoming a functional and a meaningful
tool for the park management. The generic reason for that could be the composition of
the consultative boards, which mostly comprises pretty high level officials, many of them
based in the capital city of Tbilisi. Furthermore, the entire institutional concept and status
of consultative boards may need rethinking. There should be much more emphasis on
local participation, all way through creation of a forum for community co-management of
protected areas.


WWF Caucasus Programme. On June 27, 2007 the ICR Team discussed impact of the
GICM project with Mr. Nugzar Zazanashvili, Conservation Director, WWF Caucasus
Programme. He noted, that the support provided through the project to the KNP is highly
valuable, as this Park is a key instrument for preserving ecological balance in the Priority
Conservation Area #26 of the Caucasus Ecoregion, as identified by experts from six
countries of the region (Ecoregional Conservation Plan for the Caucasus. WWF, KfW,
BMZ, CEPF, MacArthur Foundation, May 2006). Also, the KNP protects the last
remaining sections of unique lowland swamp forests and wetlands in the Caucasus. It
plays a crucial role in conservation of globally threatened species of sturgeon, including
critically endangered Atlantic (Baltic) sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), which spawns only in
the rivers in the Kolkheti Lowlands. Establishment of the Kolkheti protected areas is
instrumental for preservation of the most significant bird habitats of the Black Sea coastal
zone.

The KNP is the only protected area in the Black Sea basin with a formally designated
marine park. This directly contributes to one of the main goals and the respective
suggested action of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Programme of Work
on Protected Areas: "1.1.3. As a matter of urgency, by 2006 terrestrially and by 2008 in
the marine environment, take action to address the under-representation of marine and
inland water ecosystems in existing national and regional systems of protected areas..."
Though management of the marine part of the KNP calls for further refining and
strengthening.

Mr. Zazanashvili mentioned, that while the GICM project successfully met the main
conservation objectives, it had some shortfalls as well, including a weakness in guiding
the protected area proponents around the conflict of interests with local population.
Despite later measures aimed at problem shooting, long term solutions are still to be
worked out. Implementation of alternative livelihood programs for local communities
could be among further measures for sustaining co-existence of the protected areas of
Kolkheti and their gateway communities.




                                             55

Mr. Zazanashvili shared with the ICR mission his concerns about potential threats to the
KNP that come from its neighboring Kulevi oil terminal. He expressed a hope that
proper monitoring and mitigation plans are applied to address sensitivity of the western
sections of the KNP to an ongoing construction of railway access to the terminal.

Achara-based NGO Chaobi. On June 27, 2007 the ICR team received feedback on the
GICM project outcomes from Ms. I. Machutadze, Head of an NGO Chaobi (mire), which
advocates for conservation of Kolkheti wetlands. The main point made by Ms.
Machitadze is that the project had an outstanding impact in terms of raising awareness of
wetlands among diverse parts of society, ranging from the local communities all way up
to the government. During the Soviet epoch wetlands had no other interpretation than
being wasted areas that also carried venomous wildlife and disease vectors. Therefore,
the State policy called for draining as much wetlands as physically possible for
converting them to agricultural plots. Huge public funding had been spent on this
drainage campaign. With such historical background, it is difficult to overestimate
difficulties associated with educating society on the functions and value of wetlands and
altering perceptions strongly entrenched in public mentality. Establishing protected areas
with a mandate to conserve wetlands has been a strong signal and became pivotal in
altering attitude towards peat bogs of Kolkheti. Furthermore, during the project life and
with its support the KNR became an object for international research and unique nature
of its ecosystem has been scientifically proven.

Ms. Machutadze also mentioned difficulties of reconciling conservation objectives with
the social needs of local poor rural communities. Allocating areas for nature protection
usually carries potential conflicts of economic/social character, which should not be
underestimated or ignored from the very early stages of planning. In case of the KNP, a
good part of the social tension, associated with limiting of the natural resource use, could
have been avoided through including the traditional use zone in the KNP at the time of its
establishment.
