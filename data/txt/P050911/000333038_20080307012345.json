(EIA/SEA) SYSTEM IN TH", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Integrated Coastal\n            Management Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Global Environment Objective (GEO)\n            outcomes satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: consultative councils of\n            protected areas in Georgia are actually dysfunctional at\n            present and their concept needs to be rethought. The\n            Kolkheti National Park (KNP) and the Kobuleti State Nature\n            Reserve (KNR) illustrated a problem with setting-up and\n            operating consultative councils to the protected area\n            administrations, which is a generic issue for the national\n            network of protected areas. The Law of Georgia on the\n            Protected Areas System calls for having such councils in\n            place and this legal requirement is being concurred with by\n            formal establishment of the councils, but there is no\n            example of an effectively functioning council for any of the\n            protected areas. For biodiversity conservation projects it\n            is advisable to plan development of biodiversity/protected\n            area management plans as early in the project cycle as\n            possible. The timeframe necessary for the development of\n            management plans for Kolkheti protected areas under the\n            Georgia Integrated Coastal Management Project (GICM) project\n            had been dramatically underestimated, and later it turned\n            out not to be an exceptional case for projects being\n            implemented in Georgia. The lesson drawn from this\n            experience is that preparation of management plans will be\n            scheduled within a realistic timeframe and as early in the\n            project cycle as possible - preferably during project\n            preparation. For medium term perspective projects should not\n            focus on introduction of ambitious environmental\n            legislation, but rather on achieving good environmental\n            performance under the current legal framework. Provided the\n            assumption that the trend of de-regulation and market\n            liberalization continues in Georgia, projects would most\n            likely not succeed in fostering establishment of overarching\n            environmental legislation. Managing project implementation\n            in a politically dynamic country will imply regular scanning\n            of political trends and flexibility in adjusting to changing times."}, "docdt": "2007-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
