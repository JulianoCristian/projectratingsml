Major\n            project activities include: reforestation and afforestation,\n            utilization of appropriate farming technologies, controlled\n            grazing, introduction of improved fallows, improvement of\n            soil fertility through agroforestry and chemical\n            fertilizers, introduction of high value trees and fodder,\n            promotion of livestock, flood control measures, various\n            water management options, and, re-seeding of pasture.\n            Although, potential environmental impacts of these\n            activities were assessed, mostly positive, leading to\n            improvements in environmental health, food security and a\n            lower incidence of diseases, certain activities however,\n            were identified as likely to lead to significant negative\n            environmental impacts. It is probable that a massive\n            afforestation/reforestation could negatively affect both\n            surface, and groundwater supplies if care is not taken\n            regarding selection of tree species, their placement on the\n            landscape, and management. Use of chemical fertilizers could\n            cumulatively make worse the eutrophication problems of the\n            Lake Victoria ecosystem. The project could also lead to\n            social disparities due to differences amongst communities,\n            or social groups accessing project resources and\n            information. This environmental management plan provides the\n            following mitigation measures. Reduction of surface and\n            ground water availability will be minimized by a select\n            intervention of sites, tree species, tree management, and\n            placement on the landscape carefully to avoid water source\n            areas. Pollution of water bodies leading to their\n            eutrophication, due to the use of chemical fertilizers and\n            animal wastes should be mitigated by the application of the\n            correct types of fertilizers, and the correct amount and\n            timing of application."}, "docdt": "2004-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
