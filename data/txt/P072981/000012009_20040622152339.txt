EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
This report describes the 5 five year multi-focal Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem 
Management Project (WKIEMP) which is being executed by the Kenya Agricultural 
Research Institute (KARI, the National Lead Institution) and the World Agroforestry 
Centre (ICRAF). The World Bank implements the project, funded by the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF), under OP 12 Integrated Ecosystem Management.  
 
The major aim of the project is to address the worsening poverty levels due to 
agricultural and environmental degradation prevalent in Western Kenya. It aims to scale 
upwards the successful technologies that have been developed in Western Kenya by 
KARI and ICRAF, and their collaborators. The project also has room for testing new and 
innovative ways of reversing land and environmental degradation. The key development 
goals of the project are to reverse land degradation and promote income-generating 
activities for rural farmers in Western Kenya, and to contribute to improved rural water 
quality. The global objectives of the project are to create opportunities to sequester 
carbon, conserve biodiversity and to improve the quality of international waters. The 
geographic focus of the project is the Nyando, Yala and Nzoia River basins. The project 
will initially focus on the Nyando River Basin, as it is the best characterized river basin in 
W. Kenya and, the most degraded. The project area will consist of twelve 10
´
10
km
blocks distributed across the three watersheds. Because of the wide geographic dispersion 
and large area coverage within the region, a phased approach in implementing project 
activities will be adopted. 
 
To fulfill the above objectives, a number of activities have been proposed. The major 
project activities include: reforestation and afforestation, utilization of appropriate 
farming technologies, controlled grazing, introduction of improved fallows, improvement 
of soil fertility through agroforestry and chemical fertilizers, introduction of high value 
trees and fodder, promotion of livestock, flood control measures, various water 
Page  3
3
management options, introduction of grazing enclosures, de-stocking, re-seeding of 
pasture and enterprise development. 
The potential environmental impacts of these activities were assessed. Most of the 
predicted impacts were positive and could lead to improvements in environmental health, 
food security and a lower incidence of diseases. However, certain project activities were 
identified as being likely to lead to significant negative environmental impacts. It is 
probable that a massive afforestation/reforeststion of the landscape could negatively 
affect both surface and groundwater supplies if sufficient care is not taken regarding 
selection of tree species, their placement on the landscape and management. Use of 
chemical fertilizers could cumulatively make worse the eutrophication problems of the 
Lake Victoria ecosystem. The project could also lead to social disparities due to 
differences amongst communities or social groups in access to project resources and 
information. An environmental management plan (EMP) will be required to address the 
predicted negative impacts at the planning and implementation stages of the project. 
 
The project is expected to cost US$ 5.125 million over the 5-year period.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI, who are the national lead institution) 
and the World Agro-Forestry Centre (ICRAF), as the lead agencies in partnership with 
specific NGOs, local community organizations, and Kenya Forestry Research Institute 
(KEFRI) are in the process of implementing the Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem 
Management Project (WKIEMP). The principal donor for the project is the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) while the World Bank is the Implementing Agency. KARI 
and ICRAF are the executing agencies. The five-year multi-focal project aims to address 
the worsening poverty levels due to agricultural and environmental degradation prevalent 
in Western Kenya. In addition to solving these local problems, better farming practices 
including agro-forestry are expected to also provide global environmental benefits. The 
key development goals of the project are to reverse land degradation and promote 
income-generating activities for rural farmers in Western Kenya, and to contribute to 
improving rural water quality. The global objectives of the project relate to creating 
opportunities to sequester carbon, conservation of biodiversity and quality of 
international waters. The specific objectives are to: 
 
·
Promote agro-forestry and other improved land management activities in 
upland areas to rehabilitate degraded lands, reduce soil erosion and sediment 
control, and reduce nutrient delivery to Lake Victoria from agricultural 
activities; 
·
Improve on-farm and off-farm biodiversity through agro-biodiversity and 
decreased pressure on “natural habitats” (remnant forests, riparian areas, 
wetlands, etc.); 
·
Reduce rural poverty and improve food security by introducing new land 
management technologies to increase yields, and new and improved value-
added cropping systems.  
·
Improve capacity for local communities, farmer associations, national, and 
international institutions to identify opportunities, and formulate and 
Page  8
8
implement policies in support of integrated ecosystem management (IEM) 
approaches, combining local and global benefits;
 
·
Examine the synergy between sustainable agricultural development and global 
environmental benefits such as mitigation of green house gases (GHG) 
accumulation in the atmosphere, forestry, biodiversity loss, and degradation of 
international waters;
 
·
Enhance potential to sequester additional above- and below-ground carbon in 
the project area;
 
Section 58 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act, 1999 requires that 
all policies, plans, programmes and projects related to the undertakings specified in the 
Second Schedule to the Act be subjected to environmental impact assessment (EIA). The 
section also requires project proponents to obtain an EIA License from the National 
Environment Authority (NEMA) before the implementation of a project. The Act as well 
as the Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations 2003, Kenya Gazette 
Supplement No. 56 of 13
th
 June 2003, requires that the project proponent submit a Project 
Report to the National Environment Management Authority. The World Bank also 
requires an environmental assessment in accordance with its relevant safeguard policies 
(particularly OP/BP GP 4.01 Environmental Assessment; OP 4.04 Natural Habitats; 
OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Settlement and OP 7.50 International Waters. 
 
The purpose of this study therefore was to assess the potential environmental and social 
impacts of the various activities associated with the implementation of the Western 
Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project (WKIEMP) objectives outlined above. 
The assessment was carried out taking into account both the World
 Bank’s safeguard 
policies and Kenya’s environmental policy and laws. The outcome of the assessment was 
this Project Report, which was prepared on behalf of the Kenya Agricultural Research 
Institute.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
 
2.1 Location of the project
 
The geographic focus of the project is the Kenyan portion of the Lake Victoria 
Watershed. The project is located in Western Kenya and covers the Nyando, Yala and 
Nzoia river basins (see Appendix 1 - Figs. 1-3). 
 
2.2 Background information
 
The Lake Victoria basin covers 184,400 km
2
of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and 
Burundi, and is home to an estimated 25 million people with an average population 
density of 135 persons/ km
2
.
The Lake Basin is comprised of 11 major river basins 
–
Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Gucha, Mara, Gurumeti, Mbalageti, Duma, Simiyu, 
Magoga, Isonga, and Kagera - and a large lake edge area that drains directly into the lake. 
Two of these river basins, the Kagera and Mara - span national boundaries (ICRAF and 
MOARD 2002).  The Lake Victoria covers a surface area of 68,000 km
2
and adding its 
catchment (covering 184,400 km
2
)
together gives an area of 252,400 square kilometers. 
 
The Kenyan portion of the Lake Victoria basin covers about 42,000 km
2
and is home to 
about 7.9 million people. The average population density is about 190-persons/ km
2
.
Seven major rivers - Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Gucha and Mara, drain this 
area. The first three river basins will be involved in the Western Kenya Integrated 
Ecosystem Management Project. The Nyando River, which drains parts of Nandi, 
Kericho and Nyando districts, has a catchment area of about 3,600 km 
2
.
The Yala on the 
other hand drains an area of approximately 3,400 km
2
while the Nzioa drains an area of 
about 13,000 km
2
.
The lake Victoria drainage area includes lands with high agricultural potential and high 
rates of environmental deterioration.  The Nyando, Yala and Nzoia river basins have all 
experienced high rates of deforestation and loss of topsoil (ISRIC, 1997).   
 
Changes in the lake basin are linked to a number of interrelated problems such as rapid 
population growth, poverty, land degradation, declining agricultural productivity and 
Page  10
10
deteriorating water quality, which must be addressed concurrently to achieve sustainable 
development. 
 
The Nyando River basin has been intensively studied by the World Agroforestry Centre, 
the Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Development, the Kenya Agricultural Research 
Institute and their associates and other organizations, in the last five years, compared to 
the other two watersheds. As a result, there is more scientific information for this basin 
and work on the implementation of the WKIEMP is more advanced for Nyando. In this 
report therefore, Nyando River basin is described in more detail than the other two 
watersheds.
 
2.3 Nyando Basin 
 
2.3.1 Socio-Economic Information 
 
(a) Population  
The Nyando river basin occupies 3,600 square kilometres and according to the 1999 
census data, the population in the basin was 746,515.  The average population density is 
214 persons km
-2
,
with some areas of the basin having over 1,200 people/km
-2
.
Administratively, the basin is divided into districts: Nyando, Nandi, Kericho, Buret, 
Bomet and Uasin Gishu.  Nyando District is in Nyanza Province while the rest are in Rift 
Valley Province. None of the administrative districts lies wholly within the Nyando 
Basin.   
 
(b) Poverty Levels
 
The Lake Basin supports one of the densest and poorest rural populations in the world. 
Western Kenya as a whole is characterized by comparatively lower household incomes 
from the farm. In addition, Western Kenya is also characterized by high levels of disease 
and destitution. Recent studies in the area indicate a high prevalence of malaria, 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and water-associated diseases.  
 
Studies done in the Nyando basin (Brent, 2004) reveal linkages between:  
 
Page  11
11
·
Poverty and land investments. Poor households invest very little in 
agricultural inputs. Additionally, availability of information is an 
important determinant of investments in soil and water conservation.  
 
·
Agriculture, ill-health, and poverty. 
 
·
Irrigation and land degradation. The conversion of 6500 ha of wetlands to 
irrigation in the Nyando basin since 1980 has reduced the filtering effects 
of wetlands thereby contributing to the major sediment plume in Winam 
Gulf and eutrophication of Lake Victoria. The high sediment load in 
Nyando increases maintenance costs of irrigation schemes (200 m
3
of 
sediment removed per week from Gem-Rae in 1997) 
 
·
Community water management and farm investments: Participatory Rural 
Appraisal (PRA) results for Nyando District Focal Areas indicate priority 
problems to be: Lack of water, lack of tools, soil erosion, poor roads, lack 
of technical advice; and low soil fertility.   
 
(c) Land use 
The watershed can roughly be divided into 5 different land use zones. Small-scale 
subsistence maize and sorghum characterize the lower part of the watershed, the lake 
plain between 1100- 1300 m.  Large-scale sugar plantations and smaller sugar schemes 
are located between 1300 m and 1700 m. Gradually, the sugar plantations are replaced by 
coffee in a zone ranging between 1600 m 
–
2000 m.  Small-scale tea farmers and large 
tea estates are located between 1900 m – 2100 m. Relatively large-scale maize and 
horticulture (potatoes, cabbages, etc.) farming characterize the areas above 2100 metres. 
 
Soil degradation and soil nutrient mining characterize many land-use types. The most 
degraded parts of the landscape, both in terms of nutrient deficiencies and soil physical 
degradation, are areas currently used for open grazing and extraction of fuel wood.  Areas 
currently used for subsistence agriculture are characterized by both types of degradation, 
but with lower prevalence rates than in grazing areas.  In part, the lower prevalence may 
Page  12
12
be due to abandonment of severely degraded cropland. Proximal causes of degradation on 
croplands include low investments in physical or biological methods of soil conservation 
and low use of external sources of mineral fertilizers.    
 
The main livelihood strategy in Nyando basin is farming with 48% of the households 
directly depending on agriculture. The major subsistence crops grown include maize 
(52.5%) sorghum (42.3%) beans (13.1%), groundnuts (8.8%), green grams (1.45%) and 
cowpeas (2.9%). The yields are very low but the area has potential for improvement. 
Production, particularly of cash crops like sugar cane and cotton, has been on the decline 
owing to lack of markets, irregular payments, poor road infrastructure and low soil 
fertility. Other crop production problems in the basin include drought, erratic rainfall and 
striga weed.  
 
Most of the watershed is continuously cropped except in the two remaining forest areas 
of Tinderet and Mau, which are getting heavily deforested. 
 
(e) Ethnic Composition
 
The main ethnic groups in Nyando basin are the Luo, Kipsigis and Nandi who inhabit 
Nyando, Kericho and Nandi districts respectively. Local cultural norms and groupings 
are crucial to the success of externally assisted development and conservation initiatives.  
 
2.3.2 Biophysical Information
 
(a) Hydrology 
The Nyando River has four major tributaries, namely; the Ainabngetuny and Mbogo, 
which originate from Nandi District, and the Nyando and Awach which originate from 
Kericho district. The river originates from areas of high rainfall (Kericho and Nandi 
districts). It therefore has high stream discharge and floods are experienced in the lower 
course of the river, covering approximately 50% of Nyando district and parts of Kisumu 
District. The flooding is an annual phenomenon, which has adverse effects on the 
community.  
 
Page  13
13
(b) Climatic Variability 
A
number of paleoclimatic studies have shown that long-term variability in the basin is 
periodic and tends to track events occurring over time periods that are characteristic of 
cyclic changes in orbital insolation and forcing  (e.g. Kroll-Milankovitich cycles), and 
global ocean and atmospheric circulation  (e.g. El Nino/La Nina cycles).  Some of these 
studies (e.g. Stager et al., 1996) suggest that the post-1960 ecological shift in Lake 
Victoria may have had climate driven analogues over the last 10,000 years.   This implies 
that although human impacts on the lake basin environment may now eclipse events 
taking place, climate change could be reinforcing environmental degradation in the lake 
basin. 
 
The more recent historical records show the occurrence of an extraordinarily pluvial 
period from 1961-1964 in the eastern portion of the lake basin.  During this time, the 
water level of Lake Victoria rose by approximately 2.5 meters, and discharges from 
rivers Nyando and Sondu Miriu, for example, were 10-20 times higher than their 
respective 35-year decadal averages.  For the Nyando River Basin, interviews with local 
people suggest that many of the major soil erosion problems either started or were 
dramatically accelerated in their development during the early 1960’s.  It is speculated 
that rapid land use changes, deforestation, infrastructure development and over-grazing 
structurally altered the landscape during the first half of the 20
th
 century.  Prevailing 
conditions during the early 1960’s may then have been such that the basin was essentially 
primed for massive erosion/sedimentation during a period of extraordinarily heavy 
rainfall in the region.  The Nyando basin is particularly vulnerable to the return of large 
rainfall events, such as occurred in the early 60’s.  The return of such an event could 
result in unprecedented mass soil movement from the lake plain into the lake.   
 
(c) Eutrophication  
The water quality of Lake Victoria is affected by sedimentation and nutrient run-off, 
urban and industrial point source pollution and biomass burning.  The Nyando River and 
its associated drainage network is the major source of sediment and phosphorus flow into 
the lake. Phosphorus levels have increased 2-3 times over the last 40-50 years (Hecky, 
Page  14
14
1993, 2000). Measurements of phosphorus (the main nutrient causing lake 
eutrophication) in River Sondu indicated that the concentrations were lower than those in 
the lake but concentrations in the River Nyando were five times higher than those 
measured in Sondu river. Algal concentrations are three to five times higher now than 
during the 1960’s, and much of the lake bottom currently experiences periods of 
prolonged anoxia that were uncommon 40 years ago (Johnson et al.  2000). Ambient 
conditions in Lake Victoria now favor the dominance of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria 
and the spread of the aquatic weeds such as the water hyacinth (
Eichornia crassipes
).   
 
(d) Biodiversity 
The biodiversity focus of the project will be the agricultural landscape and will seek to 
increase functional biodiversity and so-called non-functional biodiversity. The effects of 
management on below ground biodiversity will be investigated, and the importance of 
this to long-term sustainability will be determined, particularly with respect to carbon and 
nutrient cycling. Biodiversity in protected reserves in the project area is under intense 
pressure and strategies to actively protect these resources are urgently needed.  Some of 
the activities of this project should help to reduce this pressure on these reserves, but this 
impact will be context specific (depending on proximity of project interventions to 
protected areas).  Also, the impact will be tenuous as project activities will only partially 
satisfy wood demands of rural populations and may not provide sufficient replacement 
for all of the products that are withdrawn from reserves.   
This project will address biodiversity conservation through on-farm biodiversity 
conservation (i.e., agro-biodiversity), biodiversity enhancement off-farm and, to a lesser 
extent, critical ecosystems/habitats (e.g., wetlands).  Soil fertility replenishment is 
expected to enhance both belowground and above-ground biodiversity through the 
creation of more niches for different types of species. 
(e) Soils & Land use 
Various soil types are found in the basin. The soils of the mountains, hills, plateaus and 
foot slopes are excessively drained to well drained, very shallow to shallow, dark reddish 
brown, stony and rocky, sandy clay loam to clay, in places with an acid humic topsoil 
Page  15
15
and/or moderately deep to deep, (
Phaeozems, Lithosols, Regosols Cambisols
).  Most 
parts of the government protected natural forest (conservation forestry) falls under these 
areas and acts as stabilizers of the thin soil layers and also for protecting the water 
catchments. 
 
The soils of the uplands are well drained, deep to very deep and in some places shallow 
to moderately deep, dark reddish brown to dark brown, friable to firm clay, with a thick 
acid humic topsoil (
Acrisols, Nitosols, Cambisols, Ferralsols
).  The dominant land use 
is tea growing (both estate and small scale).  Tea is a deep-rooted crop that requires a lot 
of rainfall and well-drained acidic soils.  Other crops found in this unit and also requiring 
well-drained soils are maize, potatoes, pyrethrum, wheat and cabbages.  The government 
protected planted forests (production forestry) falls under these areas.  Most of the 
planted tree species are exotic and require deep soils, which are well drained.   
 
The soils of the plains are moderately well to imperfectly drained, deep to very deep, 
brown to black, in places saline and sodic sandy clay loam to cracking clay (
Vertisols, 
Planosols, Gleysols, Fluvisols
).  The dominant land use in this unit is sugarcane growing 
(both estate and small scale).  
 
The soils found in swamps are very poorly drained, deep to very deep, dark grey to black, 
half ripe clay; in many places peaty (
Gleysols, Histosols
).  Rice growing (irrigated) is 
practiced here.  During the dry seasons crops like maize, tomatoes onions and kales are 
grown.  Other major activity is harvesting of papyrus and other species for making mats, 
seats, fish traps and thatching material.  
 
(g) Soil quality 
There has been decrease in soil quality relative to undisturbed areas, as indicated by a 
number of indicators, in areas where sheet, rill, and gully erosion have occurred.  The 
loss in soil quality is related to the degree of erosion.  For example, sheet erosion has 
Page  16
16
decreased exchangeable bases by 39-47 % and soil organic carbon stocks by 17-25 % 
compared with intact sites.  Where gully erosion has occurred the impacts are more 
dramatic. The majority of the soils in the Nyando river basin are deficient in plant 
available phosphorus. It is estimated that between 63 
–
73
%
of
the Nyando River Basin 
is deficient in plant available phosphorus (defined as <8.5 mg kg 
–1
 P-Olsen).   However, 
soil phosphorus levels are high enough to be of environmental concern in parts of the 
lake plain, where erosion risk is also high.  Table 1 shows the major soils, current land 
uses, major limitations and recommended land uses.

(h) Tree Resources 
Research evidence shows that there is an acute shortage of seeds and seedlings for most 
of the preferred species such as Grevillea, Melia, Casuarinas, and Kei apple among 
others. The region is a net importer of wood products (charcoal, wood, poles, firewood, 
timber) and this greatly contributes to deforestation.  Improved fruit tree species such as 
mangoes, bananas and pawpaw are also lacking.  There is an acute shortage of fuelwood, 
timber and poles due to deforestation and communal grazing that hinders establishment 
of tree seedlings.  Women go as far as Sigowet hills in Kericho district to fetch fuelwood.  
As a result, the steep hills have been de-vegetated.  Accelerated degradation is being 
experienced in the hill areas.  Huge gullies are threatening lives and are a major 
hindrance to transportation. It is therefore necessary to establish tree nurseries to satisfy 
the demand for trees and there tree products.   
 
3. PROJECT ACTIVITIES
 
The proposed project activities include the following:

These options are expected to contribute to improved crop and animal production, 
water capture and conservation, and to an increase in on- farm and off-farm 
biodiversity thus improving local livelihoods and natural resource management. 
Additionally, they are estimated to improve the level of carbon sequestration. 
 
In the highlands (>1890 m), the major intervention will be to increase vegetation 
cover. The activities proposed include reforestation and afforestation, utilization of 
appropriate farming technologies such as intercropping, controlled grazing in the 
rangelands and restoration of degraded grazing areas. Water collection structures and 
spring protection will be encouraged as possible
 
communal activities which can be 
used as entry points to the communities.  
 
In the midland (1440-1890 m) areas, the major interventions will be introduction of 
improved fallows, improvement of soil fertility through agroforestry and chemical 
fertilizers, introduction of high value trees and fodder, afforestation, promotion of 
livestock and support for a wetland policy.   
 
In the lowlands
 
(1134-1440 m), the major interventions include: introduction of flood 
control measures, afforestation, agroforestry including introduction of high value 
trees, livestock improvement, water management options, introducing grazing 
enclosures, de-stocking and re-seeding of pasture. 
 
4. PROJECT DESIGN 
 
(a) Selection of intervention areas 
The project will initially focus on the Nyando River Basin, as it is the best characterized 
river basin in W. Kenya and it is the most degraded. The project area will consist of 
twelve 10
´
10
km
blocks distributed across the three watersheds. Because of the wide 
geographic dispersion and large area coverage within the region, a phased approach in 
implementing project activities will be adopted. The table below shows the timing for 
inclusion of blocks in years 2004-2006.

a.s.l. Block center locations will be selected randomly, nested 
within basins and elevation zones and subject to the condition that no part of any focal 
area impinges on 1990 base
line “
forested lands
”. Further exclusions will include: large-
scale commercial agricultural areas (e.g., rice irrigation schemes, tea estates, and sugar 
cane plantations), government lands such as protected areas and game parks, as well as 
wetlands, and urban areas. 
 
(b) CDM activities 
The project defines project eligible reforestation, afforestation and agroforestry activities 
to consist of areas with a minimum contiguous spatial extent of 0.065 ha, and subject to 
the stocking guidelines presented in Table 2 below.

Other qualifying activities will focus on improving soil condition through various 
agronomic and range management measures (e.g. cover cropping with (tree) legumes or 
Page  20

green manures, grazing deferment and rangeland reseeding), and conservation tillage 
(e.g. vegetated contours and/or minimum till practices).  
 
(c) Selection of communities
 
The communities will be selected from the project areas representing the different types 
of degradation problems and different land productivity potentials. A total of 200 villages 
or village clusters (2 or more villages together) will be implementing land-use/IEM plans 
at the end of the project. 
 
5.0 
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS & MITIGATION 
MEASURES  
 
The activities proposed for the WKIEMP have the potential to lead to a number of 
environmental impacts, both positive as well as negative. The impacts may affect the 
natural or human environments. They may be short term or long term. The impacts can 
also extend well beyond the national borders. All these aspects and many more are 
relevant to the current project. The significance of the predicted impacts will depend on a 
number of factors including: size of impacted area, number of people that are likely to be 
affected, whether or not the impacted environment is degraded, probability of occurrence 
of the impact etc. 
 
The participatory manner in which this project is being implemented means that the 
actual interventions and their mix, selection of participating communities, the geographic 
scope and timing of the interventions, are not known. Thus, at the time of preparing this 
report, the potential environmental impacts could only be predicted at a very general 
level.  
 
The potential environmental impacts of the activities proposed for the WKIEMP are 
summarized in Table 3.

Most of the potential environmental and social impacts at both the local and international 
levels are positive (Table 3). Overall, the various interventions, if carefully implemented, 
are expected to lead to less natural resource and environmental degradation, which in turn 
will lead to better environments and sustainable livelihoods. Among the major negative 
Page  23
23
potential environmental impacts include: (a) Reduction of surface & ground water 
availability due to afforestation/reforestation (b) Pollution of water bodies leading to 
eutrophication mainly due to use of chemical fertilizers (c) Creation of social disparities 
due to differences in access to project information and resources. 
 
(a) Reduction of surface & ground water availability
One of the major interventions to reduce run-off, soil erosion and green house gases 
is afforestation and reforestation of the landscape using both exotic and indigenous 
tree species. The project recommends retention of 60% permanent vegetation cover in 
the project watersheds. There also will be agroforestry interventions using a wide 
range of tree species including high value trees. Trees use water and therefore 
massive re-vegetation of the landscape can be expected to lead to changes in the 
hydrology of the project area. The numerous springs along the escarpments could for 
instance disappear following the planting of trees in stream-source areas. To avoid 
undesirable impacts, the following considerations will need to be taken into account: 
 
i) 
Appropriate tree species should be selected for different elements of the 
landscape and farmer preference 
ii) 
The various agroforestry interventions need to be placed in appropriate 
locations in the landscape to maximize their hydrologic and soil benefits. 
iii) 
Consideration should be given to the optimum layout of the agroforestry 
interventions to maximize their benefits. 
 
(b) 
Pollution of water bodies leading to eutrophication due to cumulative use of 
chemical fertilizers
To improve soil fertility, application of chemical fertilizers e.g. TSP and rock 
phosphate are proposed. Depending on the amount, timing and mode of application, 
some of the fertilizers will find their way into the aquatic ecosystems, including Lake 
Victoria, through surface run-off. This would lead to further nutrient enrichment of 
the waters in which aquatic weeds such as algae and water hyacinth will proliferate in 
an already overburdened lake. Appropriate application of the fertilizers, use of more 
Page  24
24
environmentally friendly soil re-capitalization alternatives and reduction of flood 
incidences would help to minimize the predicted negative environmental impacts. 
 
Lake Victoria is a shared ecosystem and therefore any interventions affecting its 
water quality and/or quantity is of interest to the other Riparian countries. Therefore, 
any project activities, which are likely to affect these parameters negatively, are likely 
sources of inter-state conflicts over the water resources of Lake Victoria and the 
hydrological system that sustains it.  
 
(c) Creation of social disparities due to differences in access to project resources
Intervention areas will be selected on the basis of the degree of land degradation and 
socio-economic indicators. Exactly how the two aspects will be matched and still be 
representative of the socio-cultural and socio-economic groupings in the project 
watersheds is not clear. It is therefore conceivable that the selection of communities 
and individuals might be biased and therefore lead to social disparities contrary to the 
spirit of sound environmental governance.  
 
An environmental management plan (EMP) will be required to address these predicted 
negative environmental impacts at the planning and implementation stages of the project. 
The EMP will be expected to contain detailed action plans for each mitigation measure, 
cost of implementation of the mitigation measures, responsible party, implementation 
time-table, monitoring etc.
