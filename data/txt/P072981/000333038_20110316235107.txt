F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objective (PDO), Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key
Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective is to improve the productivity and sustainability of land use
systems in selected watersheds in the Nzoia, Yala, and Nyando river basins through adoption of
an integrated ecosystem management approach.
The Global Environmental Objective is to promote a set of integrated ecosystem management
interventions so as to achieve local and global benefits. These benefits include reduced land
degradation, reduced greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, improved on- and off-
farm biodiversity, and decreased erosion in watersheds that feed into the Nyando, Yala, and
Nzoia river basins.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority) and
Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The Mid-Term Review (MTR) held in June 2008 and subsequent restructuring at Country
Director level (level 2 restructuring) addressed the ambitiousness of the Project design and
original targets, resulting in the revision of performance indicators and redefinition of Project
intervention areas (see Section 1.3). The original logframe was replaced by a results framework,
leaving the original PDO and GEO unchanged. The original and revised indicators are shown in
Annex 2.
Reasons for the revision were to enable performance monitoring of the Project objectives in a
more direct and effective manner, given that some of the original indicators (e.g., negative trends
in erosion rates and phosphorous runoff, and above- and below-ground carbon sequestration
monitored and assessed) were overly ambitious, difficult to measure, or had little or no
systematic linkage to the outputs and outcomes in the existing results chain. With this in mind,
several of the original indicators were replaced by more realistic and measurable ones with
quantitative target values, including those for the PDO and GEO, taking the available baseline
data into account.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country and sector background. Western Kenya, which includes Nyanza and Western
provinces, is one of the most densely populated parts of Kenya, with up to 1,200 persons per km2
in rural areas. The region is characterized by low agricultural productivity, high population
pressure, and lack of off-farm income opportunities. Over 58% of households live in absolute
poverty (below US$1/day). High rural population growth has led to wide-scale abandonment of
fallowing and search for new agricultural land. There has been little restriction on encroachment
onto steep slopes, wetlands, or forests despite the existence of laws and regulations against such
practices.
2.      Large gullies that advance at estimated rates up to 200 meters per year result in fourfold
sedimentation rates of the basin flowing into Lake Victoria over the last 100 years. The high
levels of nutrient and soil loss are primarily linked to deforestation, human or animal induced
vegetation loss on slopes and near waterways, and alteration of soil chemical properties owing to
agricultural production. Communities have relatively limited awareness about upstream or
downstream problems, and mechanisms for addressing land degradation across administrative and
geographical boundaries have been slow to develop.
3.       Project contribution to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The primary rationale for
Bank assistance to the Project was to contribute to the CAS's focus on community based
initiatives in the fight against poverty. In particular, this Project was seen as an important pilot
activity for the formation of community driven development projects in Western Kenya. In
addition, the Bank possessed a comparative advantage in securing cross-country cooperation and
in making available considerable knowledge and experience in Project design and institutional
arrangements that had worked in similar African conditions.
4.     Project consistency with Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Priorities.
Project activities were consistent with the objectives set out in the GEF Operational Program 12
on Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM). The Project was specifically designed to provide
global benefits with regard to biodiversity, climate change, and international waterways.
Furthermore, the Project supported Operational Program 12 outcomes for increased institutional
capacity to implement IEM and investments based on stakeholder participation to address both
domestic and global environment issues and apply a community driven methodology.
1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO), Global Environment Objective (GEO),
and Key Indicators
5.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the productivity and
sustainability of land use systems in selected watersheds in the Nzoia, Yala, and Nyando river
basins through adoption of an integrated ecosystem management approach. In order to achieve
this, the Project was intended to: (i) support on- and off-farm conservation strategies; and (ii)
improve the capacity of local communities and institutions to identify, formulate, and implement
IEM activities (including both on- and off-farm land use planning) capturing local and global
environmental benefits.
6.   The Global Environmental Objective (GEO) was to promote a set of integrated ecosystem
management interventions so as to achieve local and global benefits. These benefits were to
include reduced land degradation, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) accumulation in the atmosphere,


                                                 1
improved on- and off-farm biodiversity, and decreased erosion in watersheds that feed into the
Nyando, Yala, and Nzoia river basins.
7.    Original key performance indicators are shown in Annex 2.

1.3 Revised PDO, GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
8.      Project Restructuring. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) held in June 2008 led to: (a)
revision of performance indicators; (b) Project scope adjustment; and (c) reallocation of Grant
proceeds in order to address the ambitiousness of the Project design and original targets. Those
changes were formalized in March 2010 in the Project restructuring:
a) Revised indicators. The original logframe was replaced by a results framework, leaving the
   original PDO and GEO unchanged. The revised indicators are shown in Annex 2. Reasons
   for the revision was to enable performance monitoring in a more direct and effective manner,
   given that some of the original indicators (e.g., negative trends in erosion rates and
   phosphorous runoff, and above- and below-ground carbon sequestration monitored and
   assessed) were overly ambitious, difficult to measure, or had little or no systematic linkage to
   the outputs and outcomes in the existing results chain. With this in mind, several of the
   original indicators were replaced by more realistic and measurable ones, including those for
   the PDO and GEO, taking the available baseline data into account.
b) Limiting the Project scope. Spatial coverage of the target basins proved to be too large to be
   realized within a limited funding envelope. The MTR mission reviewed and reduced Project
   intervention areas from nine to five blocks: three blocks in Nyando, as well as lower blocks of
   the Yala and Nzoia rivers. It was also recognized that the Project would not be able to cover
   the overall area of those blocks. Thus the Project targeted 15 micro-catchments within five
   blocks as centers for technology transfer and information dissemination without running the
   risk that Project resources would be spread too thin.
c) Reallocation of Grant proceeds. Implementation costs for a decentralized and community-
   based Project were underestimated at appraisal, particularly in view of declining United States
   dollar values and rising fuel costs. To adequately fund critical activities, the Project revised
   allocation of Grant proceeds at restructuring. As a result, a substantially larger portion was
   allocated to the Project administration to cater for underestimated costs of community
   mobilization and decentralized implementation while the allocation for the procurement of
   goods was reduced.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.     Main beneficiaries. The Project implemented its activities in the selected catchments of
the Nyando, Yala, and Nzoia river basins in Western Kenya, which are home to a population of
nearly seven million. The Project was designed to target local communities in those areas as
primary beneficiaries.
10.     Characteristics of the target communities include (i) farming is the primary livelihood
activity for about 80% of the population in the three river basins; (ii) HIV/AIDS rates are among
the highest (35% in Kisumu in 2001) in the country and have left a growing number of rural
households headed by widows or orphans; and (iii) female headed households account for 35% of
the total in some Project areas.
11.    Secondary beneficiaries. The Project intended to promote global benefits with regard to

                                                2
conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, reductions in net emissions and increased
storage of greenhouse gases and conservation and sustainable use of water bodies in line with
GEF objectives, thus benefiting anyone affected by the conservation of natural habitats and
mitigation of global warming. The Project was also expected to generate insights into successful,
community-based IEM models that could be replicated in similar projects, and hence benefit other
target communities.

1.5 Original Components
12.     IEM approach. Where promoting productive activities may conflict with ensuring
ecosystem services, IEM is a means of balancing increased production with environmental
protection. A key element of IEM in the Project was to link upstream and downstream
communities to better manage river catchments as a whole through planning and financing of
interventions that incorporated cross-community concerns.
13.    Component 1: Capacity Building for Community Driven Integrated Ecosystem
Management. Activities focused on two areas of capacity building: (i) strengthening the
development and IEM planning capacity of rural communities and local governments through
organizational and managerial support and transfer of technical knowledge; and (ii) piloting
carbon finance mechanisms. The component had two subcomponents: (i) strengthening local
development and IEM planning; and (ii) enhancing capacity for developing carbon finance
proposals.
14.      Component 2: Scaling up and Financing IEM Interventions. The Project provided funds
for the implementation of IEM activities identified under the first component. Activities were to
include (i) development of village nurseries to support agro-forestry; (ii) dissemination of
improved fallow and cover crop technologies to control land degradation and reduce sediment
loss; (iii) training on improved land management practices; and (iv) a selected number of small-
scale infrastructure activities. Where appropriate and incorporated in Participatory Action Plans
(PAPs) at micro-catchment level, the Project extended grants for community-based sub-projects to
implement those activities.
15.     Component 3: Establishing a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System. Activities
included establishment of the M&E system for the Project to assess Project outcomes and impacts
directly and to refine working methodologies and procedures. The M&E system would also focus
on Project socioeconomic and biophysical impacts.
16.    Component 4 Project Administration. This component funded activities related to the
coordination, administration, monitoring, and auditing of Project activities, including operation of
a Project coordination office in Kisumu. It also acted as a vehicle for collaboration and
coordination with other relevant programs.

1.6 Revised Components
17.    No change was made in planned activities within each component.

1.7 Other significant changes
18.     Reduced availability of funds. The fact that anticipated co-financing of about US$2.7
million (Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund as well as the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)) did not materialize required changes to
the Project design, as described in section 1.3. These changes were made to better align the

                                                 3
Project to the present situation and allow it to deliver tools to promote IEM in Western Kenya,
which could be subsequently scaled up through existing and planned Bank operations.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19.     Scientific design vs. development challenges. The World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF)
played a central role in Project design by completing baseline surveys, designing Project
interventions, mapping geographic areas, and supporting the establishment of the M&E system.
The Project's design had a strong scientific perspective to address degradation of natural resources
(land and water), and paid little attention to on-the-ground expectations by farmers. For instance,
a block-wise approach met scientific requirements to standardize data but was not aligned with
either community structure or ecological boundaries. A theoretical Project design and highly
technical skills required for data analysis posed a challenge to the implementing agency,
contributing to initial implementation delays. As a result, except for an initial advance of
US$400,000, no disbursement was made during the first year of implementation.
20.     Geographic focus and coverage of the Project. The Project considered several alternatives
in determining geographic coverage (e.g., all lands within the Lake Victoria watershed, or fewer
river basins), and selected the priority districts taking into account GEF criteria: carbon
sequestration and biodiversity increment potential, severity of land degradation, and the proximity
to reserves with significant degradation because of external pressure. However, covering nine
blocks (10km*10km each) in three river basins (upper, middle, and lower blocks in each
respective basin) proved to be too large to implement effectively. Prior to the MTR, the Project
concentrated its interventions exclusively in the lower blocks, resulting in the reduction of the
target areas (see paragraph 8(b)) during the later stages of the Project.
21.     Weak attention to immediate livelihood needs. Project design did not initially include
livestock aspects and social dimensions to help address people's stagnant incomes, which were of
central interest to the local communities. As a result, Project staff faced difficulties in mobilizing
communities and sustaining Project interventions without incorporating immediate livelihood
enhancement options into longer-term conservation activities. In recognition of this, technical
expertise (e.g., a livestock officer) was retained and livelihood support activities were diversified
to address these needs during the early stages of implementation.
22.     Lessons of earlier operations reflected. The Project built upon and complemented other
projects in the area (specifically the Soil Management Project (SMP), Agricultural Technology
and Information Response Initiative (ATIRI), Legume Research Network Project (LRNP), and
Lake Victoria Environment Management Project (LVEMP)). Some of the lessons drawn from the
implementation experience of these projects were reflected in the Project's institutional
arrangements including: (i) decentralization of Project management and involvement of local
stakeholders in the decision making process; and (ii) implementation arrangements to manage
household-led activities under community-led umbrella projects.

2.2 Implementation
23.      Slow start-up. The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) was selected as an
eligible implementing agency for a full-sized GEF Project to take the lead in carrying out Project
activities. However, few of KARI staff who was in charge of implementation was involved in

                                                  4
designing the Project. As a result, KARI staff in Kisumu required considerable time and efforts at
the initial stages of implementation to acquaint themselves with Project concepts. Part of initial
implementation delays was attributed to this, coupled with financial flow constraints and, to some
extent, the 2007 post-election crisis.
24.     Working relationship between KARI and ICRAF. Approaches in KARI and ICRAF were
different with respect to various aspects of Project implementation (e.g., a contact-farmer vs.
bottom-up participatory approaches) that complicated working relations between the two at first.
Frequent staff changes within ICRAF added another difficulty in building an effective partnership
and fulfilling commitments between the two agencies.
25.      Linking upstream and downstream interventions. The Project gave insufficient focus on
linking upstream and downstream interventions in addressing broader ecosystem management
aspects. While such linkages were conceptualized in the Project design in order to optimize the
effectiveness of ecosystem interventions, measures to achieve such outcomes were not clearly
articulated in Project documents. In the early stages of implementation, KARI fastened much of
its attention on the lower Nyando, since it was the most severely degraded area characterized by
large gullies threatening livelihoods of local communities. The failure of adjusting this focus in a
timely manner resulted in the devotion of significant human and financial resources to the lower
blocks for more than two years. Subsequently, limited time and efforts were given to involve
upstream communities in undertaking joint conservation measures in order to achieve the Project
objectives of improving sustainability of land use systems and reducing soil erosion in the
respective watersheds.

2.3 M&E Design, Implementation and Utilization
26.    Delayed establishment of a results-based M&E system. Before the MTR, KARI had
reported their implementation progress without ensuring linkages of activity outputs to
performance indicators in the logframe. A viable M&E system was established only after the
MTR (the third year) despite the fact that every mission had identified its necessity from the start
of the Project, and the Bank had provided technical assistance for the development of a results-
based M&E system. As a result, baseline values were established at the MTR that allowed the
M&E of outcome indicators only for the last two years of Project implementation.
27.      Development of Management Information System (MIS). The MIS was developed and
successfully installed at the end of the fourth year. Its use within the Project, however, has been
limited due to the winding up of activities toward Project completion and cash flow problems. In
addition, staff felt that they needed more time to practice with the system before acquiring
sufficient confidence to use it. In order to better utilize Project outputs and strengthen the
institution's M&E capacity, KARI management plans to integrate the MIS into an agency-wide
M&E program.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environment and Social Safeguards Compliance
28.     The Project complied with World Bank safeguard policies as identified in the PAD,
specifically (i) OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment; and (ii) OP 7.50 Projects in International
Waters. Even though the project did not finance or support any activities that affected natural
habitats, or the procurement or use of pesticides directly or indirectly, the Bank advised KARI as


                                                 5
part of its implementation support to take proactive measures for sustainable wetlands
management and integrated pest management through additional survey and targeted training.
29.     Screening and development of EMPs under ESMF. Under the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) elaborated for the Project, sub-project proposals were
adequately screened before approval using a safeguards checklist. The Project developed
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for construction of three water pans and undertook
mitigation measures against potential negative impacts.
30.     The Project Environmental Officer was recruited in the third year of implementation to
provide supervision support to the implementation of environmental safeguards aspects (no social
safeguards policies were triggered). Nevertheless, supervision was less than optimal because of
flow of funding problems. The Project could never undertake environmental audits and related
training for environmental monitoring of a rehabilitated water pan by the end of the Project,
making sustainability of its environmentally sound management by communities uncertain. A
targeted training module on sustainable wetlands management for relevant stakeholders was not
fully implemented either.
Fiduciary Compliance
31.     Project financial management (FM) performance was one of the greatest challenges,
which was rated unsatisfactory for most of the implementation period. FM supervision missions
repeatedly recommended corrective measures in the areas of: (i) unresolved GEF fund flow
constraints resulting in a shortage of resources in the Project account; (ii) irregular provision of
counterpart contributions by the Government of Kenya (GoK); (iii) non-submission of quarterly
financial monitoring reports (FMR) in defiance of financial covenants; (iv) commingling of
Project funds with KARI's Development Vote funds; (v) exhaustion of funds allocated to the
training category without timely intervention by Project management; (vi) poor maintenance of
Project cash book at KARI Headquarters and the Project Coordination Office (PCO) in Kisumu;
and (vii) inadequate document filing practices at PCO. Project management addressed most of
these problems in due course, but some areas, such as flow of funds constraints and FMR
submission, remained weak over the life of the Project.
32.     Flow of funds problems were caused by the lengthy administrative process (from PCO to
KARI Headquarters to Ministry of Agriculture and to Treasury) leading to severe delays in
submitting withdrawal applications. Irregular submission of SOE-based applications by KARI
exacerbated the situation, resulting in exhausting the Project account and dealing on credit. As a
result, 98 sub-projects developed by community groups in the Lower Yala and Nzoia river basins
received grants of a total of KES9.8 million (approx. US$121,000) shortly before the Project
closure, after awaiting financing for nine months since approved. 65 sub-projects in the upper and
middle Nyando were never approved due to the lack of funds. Some of Project activities missed
the optimal timing (e.g., tree planting along with initiation of rainy seasons) or were not realized to
the extent as planned (e.g., safeguards training and exchange visits of community groups). Slow
disbursements also adversely affected the momentum of the community engagement as shown in
Annex 6. US$315,000 (7.7%) was left undisbursed at Project closure.
33.     Procurement performance. Considering the funds flow constraints experienced over much
of the Project's life, procurement has been affected negatively. This led to delays in procurement
processes and subsequent slow implementation start. While this situation had improved towards
the MTR (at which time much of the major procurements had been finalized), contract

                                                  6
management (such as the speedy follow up on delayed deliverables, closure of non-performing
contracts) has been one of the main challenges towards the end of the Project. PCO had to work
hard over the last six months to ensure an orderly closure of existing contracts and to avert
contractual disputes while ensuring their value for money.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
34.     An impact assessment study at Project completion reported that land management practices
adopted most by communities were crop rotation and minimum tillage other than tree planting.
Since improving the sustainability of land use systems was one of the two components of the PDO,
establishing an effective strategy and mechanism to sustain the IEM activities adopted is a key to
achieve the objectives. In recognition of this, the Project conducted the following operations.
35.    Community sensitization and exit strategy discussion. Sensitization meetings were held in
all Project intervention areas to discuss the exit strategy for sustaining community activities
beyond the life of the Project. Some communities have successfully evolved to be self-sustaining
commercial enterprises to tap the local market for their new commodities such as tree seedlings,
and have received grants from other funds such as the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) to
implement their PAPs.
36.     Post-completion operation. The Project established formal institutional linkages (e.g.,
Technical Advisory Group (TAG) at the Project level and Basin Technical Committees (BTCs) at
the district level) and informal networks among extension service providers that will provide
longer-term support to the community-based activities and promote their sustainability after
Project closing. The Project also facilitated to formalize some micro-catchment committees under
either the Water Resource Management Authorities (WRMA) or the Ministry of Gender, Children
and Social Development1.
37.      Knowledge and experiences sharing. The pool of experienced staff on sustainable land
management and community-driven watershed rehabilitation is now available in KARI and can
assist in effective implementation of other similar projects. Dialogue with other Bank projects has
been established for this purpose. KARI also plans to publish a manual of best practices and
lessons learned that documents the process of engagement with communities and provides
illustrative cases of best practices on IEM and livelihoods activities. This will provide a valuable
learning and reference tool for other Bank projects that implement community-driven
environmental and livelihood initiatives.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
38.    Relevance to country priorities. Improving the productivity and sustainability of rural land
use systems remains a GoK priority. In mid-2008, the government developed a long-term
development strategy, Vision 2030, which aims to transform Kenya into a globally competitive,
prosperous, middle-income country by 2030. One of the three pillars of this strategy is a social
one that aims to build a just and cohesive society enjoying equitable social development in a
secure environment. A Medium-Term Plan (MTP) for the first five-year phase from 2008 to 2012

identifies agriculture as a key sector and focuses on policies and programs for enhancing food
security, productivity and value added.
39.     Bank assistance strategy. Corresponding to the government priorities, the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Kenya issued in 2010 highlights the improvement of natural
resources with a special focus on climate change and disaster responsiveness. One of the elements
under this objective is to manage land and water resources, especially in key water catchment
areas by supporting investments that reduce vulnerability of farmers to weather shocks through
income diversification, livestock management, and improved soil and water conservation.
Emphasis is also given to the enhancement of agricultural productivity and food security in order
to help unleash Kenya's growth potential.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
40.     General Assessment. Outcome indicators achieved their targets mostly satisfactorily, with
some of the targets exceeded. However, prolonged financial flow constraints undermined the
sustainability of some achievements and, considering the Project's small coverage within the total
watershed area in Western Kenya, its contribution toward the achievement of global benefits was
limited. Achievements based on the results framework elaborated at the MTR are shown in Annex
3.
Achievement of Project Development Objective
41.     The targets of the PDO outcome indicators were achieved in full in terms of engagement
with the direct beneficiaries. About 7,500 households (close to 40,000 people) have collaborated
with the Project over the last five years, with 90% of sampled households giving a satisfactory
rating or more in the stakeholder satisfaction studies. The number of food-deficit months per
annum has decreased by one month (from 5.3 to 4.3 months) for beneficiary households between
2004 and 2009 while surrounding non-participants of the Project reported an increase from 4.9 to
5.4 months over the same period.
42. While a productivity of maize as staple food was not significantly changed as shown in
Annex 4, ten to twenty-fold increases in maize yield on small acreages were cited by some
beneficiary households. Higher yields of cash crops (e.g., tissue bananas and vegetables) as well
as diversification of farm products (e.g., livestock, honey and tree seedlings) are assumed to have
provided higher monetary income to beneficiary households. This in turn enabled those
households to purchase more food, resulting in decrease in food-deficit months. In order to
achieve this, the Project supported to (i) develop and implement PAPs (82% implemented) as on-
and off-farm conservation strategies (off-farm included water pan construction, river bank
protection, and gully rehabilitation) prioritized by communities; and (ii) build communities'
capacity (90% of target households participated) and set up institutional linkages and informal
networks (95% of identified institutions participated) for coordinating community-driven IEM
activities.
43.     On the other hand, however, the sustainability of land use systems was not fully attained
mainly due to (i) financial flow constraints discussed in section 2.4; and (ii) insufficient
understanding of Project staff with regard to upstream-downstream linkages to enable longer-tem
environmental improvements. Grants for sub-projects provided shortly before the Project closure
raise the risk of unsustainable resources management without having proper monitoring and
technical assistance by the Project. Community groups in the upper and middle Nyando never had
opportunities to finance and scale up their IEM activities (Component 2) due to limited time and

                                                8
resources availed by the Project, making likelihoods to be able to sustain their practices
questionable. The beneficiary survey showed that about half of the respondents had partly
implemented new skills gained through the Project, while the other half had not; about 30% of
them attributed this poor response to lack of funds.
Achievement of Global Environmental Objective
44.    GEO was intended to achieve local and global benefits including: reducing land
degradation; reducing GHG accumulation in the atmosphere; improving on- and off-farm
biodiversity; and decreasing erosion in watersheds that feed into three river basins. The Project
reduced GHG accumulation by reforesting 1,820 hectares of area for carbon sequestration (as
compared with a target value of 1,200 hectares) and the observed incidence of soil erosion
decreased from 60 to 45% of erosion-prone clusters identified in the Project intervention areas.
While quantitative changes in biodiversity and land degradation are unknown due to
methodological difficulties and subsequent changes of outcome indicators, qualitative increases in
crop and tree species were observed in the on- and off-farm intervention areas.
45.    Project interventions in the 15 micro-catchments in three river basins, which represent less
than 2% of the total watersheds area in Western Kenya, are unlikely to generate significant
regional or global benefits beyond target river basins. The Project did not articulate adequate
linkages of Project interventions to global environmental benefits in its design and set highly
ambitious objectives despite the comparatively limited scope and financial resources available to
the Project.

3.3 Efficiency
46.     An ex-post economic analysis was conducted to assess the Project's financial and
economic viability. Given the difficulty in quantifying benefits of certain ecosystem interventions,
as well as of observing visible change in outputs shortly after Project interventions, the analysis
was confined to a sub-set of IEM activities adopted by communities such as tree planting,
beekeeping, and water pan construction.
47.     A greater increase in adoption rates of tree planting activities was observed in beneficiary
households compared to control groups (timber trees and fruit trees: 23% increase in adoption over
the Project period; fodder trees: 39%; and soil fertility trees: 40%). At the Project level, the
economic rate of return (ERR) over 22 years was estimated to be 18%, while the estimated ERR at
Project appraisal was 14% in an alternative scenario of decreased number of beneficiaries. The
detailed results of economic analysis are shown in Annex 4.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
48.     There existed a disconnect between overly ambitious Project objectives/targets (as
discussed in paras. 8 and 58) and the Project design to achieve them given the limited scope of
activities it actually finances. While the PDO and GEO were unchanged throughout the Project,
the restructuring addressed the ambitiousness of the original targets so that revised ones could
more accurately capture the achievement of the Project objectives. The Project largely achieved
its revised targets with required efficiency while the sustainability of adopted land use systems
was less attainable and the Project's contribution toward the achievement of global benefits was
limited. Taking into account all those factors, the overall project performance is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

                                                 9
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
49.     Poverty impacts. The beneficiaries ranked improved food yield and food security as the
second largest impact (23% of all the impacts identified), next to the improved environment (31%),
of IEM technology adoption. Increased food production has a direct impact on poverty alleviation
as the study recently conducted in the lower Nzoia river basin indicated that food was the biggest
priority (accounting for 30% of all the needs) identified by local respondents.
50.     Gender aspects. When working with communities, Project staff paid attention to ensure
equal representation of men and women. The communities were also sensitized through
discussions of gender roles and responsibilities (i.e., those of men, women and youth), leading to
greater appreciation of roles undertaken by women and the necessity of including them in decision
making.
51.     Empowerment of the vulnerable. In Project areas, women were traditionally not allowed
to plant trees on farms where adult men were exclusively entitled to land ownership. Young men
do not have access to land until it is inherited by their fathers as head of households. Vulnerable
groups such as the disabled, HIV/AIDS positive people, and widows also had difficulties making a
living. Involving and empowering the vulnerable was a key in the Project's poverty alleviation
and social inclusion approach as they are normally the poorest and most marginalized in the
society.
52.    By the end of the Project, a number of positive results have been observed. The good
performance of a youth group convinced their parents to divide land to them in order to allow
them to continue their IEM activities (such as establishment of tree nurseries). A group of women
evolved to become resource persons to train other communities on IEM practices. A widows
group established a dairy goat multiplication center and supported people living with HIV/AIDS
in producing high nutrient crops such as grain amaranth.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
53.      Inter-institutional partnership was one of the important added values of the Project. The
Project presented a multi-actor scenario, which directly or indirectly involved several different
actors at both the district and division levels. For instance, the Ministry of Agriculture extension
staff at the division level has worked with local communities to implement agriculture-related sub-
projects as part of their departmental responsibilities while staff at the district level provided
technical backstopping for the Project as member of the BTCs.
54.    The BTCs encompassed all relevant sectoral government ministries and Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) (e.g., agriculture, livestock, water, environment, forestry,
public health, social services, etc.) and provided a forum to discuss common challenges at the
micro-catchment level, normally across administrative boundaries. Through these efforts, some of
the micro-catchment committees were integrated into Water Resource Users Associations under
WRMA and backstopping roles in tree nurseries management were increasingly taken over by the
Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and an NGO.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
55.     Attitude change. The Project needed to deal with traditional beliefs of local communities
(e.g., preference for exotic tree species over indigenous ones, avoidance of specific plant species,
and prohibition of tree planting by women, etc.) that at first prevented the equal representation in
the community groups as well as the adoption of appropriate land management technologies.

                                                10
Resistance to change prevailed at the beginning but, through patient communication by KARI
field staff and demonstration on pilot plots, these perceptions have been gradually altered.
Beneficiary households demonstrated higher adoption rates of IEM practices and larger
knowledge gain compared to those of control groups as shown in Annex 4. Through interactive
dialogue with community members, Project staff also learned useful land management practices
based on indigenous knowledge (e.g., use of ash for termite control).
56.      Publicity effect. Publicity of Project initiatives, through awards at contests such as at the
Agricultural Society of Kenya and through newspapers and radio documentaries, led some of the
buyers for tree seedlings and agricultural products to approach community groups on their own
initiative, which helped in sustaining some productive activities even before the Project closure.
On the other hand, the Project experienced some elite capture where individuals were able to
acquire external funding support for their own purposes under the pretext of community
development.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
57.    The risk to both the PDO and GEO is assessed as Substantial, considering several factors
that may affect the maintenance of development outcomes:
a) Financial: Management of tree nurseries relies on the arrangements for input provision and
   payment for seedlings made by the Project. Continuation of the activities beyond the Project
   life remains uncertain depending on access to markets and identification of new buyers of tree
   seedlings. However, some of the community groups were sufficiently proactive with the
   support of Project staff to identify and trade with local buyers such as NGOs, KFS and private
   entities. In addition, new agricultural legislation 2 will require that all farmers maintain a
   minimum of 10% of their agricultural lands in tree cover. This policy will, thus, help markets
   for tree seedlings to expand.
b) Environmental: Weak involvement of upstream communities will make environmental
   benefits such as decreased land degradation and soil erosion less attainable over the longer
   term. Nevertheless, local benefits of carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation are
   expected to increase over time due to the plantation of indigenous trees with high survival rate
   promoted under the Project.
c) Institutional support: The sustainability of outcomes realized through the implementation of
   small grants sub-projects depends in part on technical backstopping and supervisory services
   by KARI and other local institutions. The positive aspect is that the contacts were established
   through the Project between communities and extension service providers at the division level
   to support day-to-day activities based on each organization's respective mandates. On the
   negative side, however, limited resources, understaffing, and high turnover of extension
   officers in local institutions will make continuation of their support dependent on available
   financial and human resources. At least for the Nyando river basin, collaborative
   arrangements are being explored to continue some of these tested activities and partnerships
   through financing under LVEMP II. In addition, considering the strong advocacy for

   decentralization under the new Kenyan Constitution, there are opportunities to mainstream and
   upscale watershed-based approaches in new local government structures. These will improve
   prospects for results uptake.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
58.    Quality at Entry was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory by the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG) because (i) the Project's development objectives were quite ambitious for an operation of
comparatively limited scope in terms of the activities it actually finances; (ii) the broader
ecosystem management aspects were given insufficient attention since most of the Project's focus
was on-farm interventions; and (iii) the Project did not demonstrate adequate linkages to global
environmental benefits it aims to achieve.
59.     In retrospect, considering the challenges experienced at start up and early implementation,
QAG's assessment has been confirmed, in particular as few efforts were made for adjusting the
original design based on the QAG review. The adoption of a micro-catchment approach only later
introduced adequate linkages of on-farm investments to broader ecological services and benefits,
which helped foster a more integrated landscape approach.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
60.     Bank supervision was not always optimal in terms of providing timely and pro-active
support to overcome experienced implementation challenges, particularly financial management,
technical capacity as well as a complex working relationship between KARI and ICRAF (as a
major partner in implementation). Nevertheless, once the Project addressed the design flaws by
adjusting the Project scope and adopting a reasonable results framework, performance improved
with specialized support provided by the Bank for several key aspects:
a) Financial supervision: Bank supervision missions provided specific recommendations to
    assist KARI to address FM challenges including the flow of funds, financial reporting,
    bookkeeping, and document filing. The Bank conducted a FM clinic in 2009 with all parties
    concerned including Treasury, the Ministry of Agriculture and KARI to identify bottlenecks in
    processing withdrawal applications seeking for speedy resolution through consultation.
b) Monitoring and evaluation: Various levels of support were given during supervision in
    assisting the Project to shift from a logframe to a results framework; the Bank team worked
    with Project staff to clarify linkages between a results framework, work plans and a M&E
    system and to integrate a results chain approach into Project management and a MIS. The
    integrated M&E system has since been established by KARI.
c) Environmental safeguards: As part of the overall review of Project's due diligence with
    respect to Bank safeguard policies, the Bank proactively advised KARI to conduct situation
    analysis and targeted training for sustainable wetlands management and integrated pest
    management so that the Project could maximize its potential benefits in those areas.
(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                12
61.    Original shortcomings in Project design were overcome by reaching strategic agreements
with KARI to restructure the Project, and adopting an adaptive management approach. This
allowed for flexibility in addressing emerging issues, assisted the Project to achieve its
development objectives and disburse the grant in almost full. However, there might have been
even more opportunities for an integrated watershed-based approach to realize greater
environmental benefits, if adjustments to the Project design and scope had been carried out earlier
by the Bank. In the latter case, the Bank performance would have been rated as Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
62.     GoK commitment. Government performance during Project implementation was mixed.
On the positive side, a government ownership was ensured throughout the Project period, partly
contributing to the achievement of Project objectives. In addition, noting that the Agricultural
Sector Development Strategy demands an increase of the State forest cover up to 10% and new
agricultural legislation requires expansion of tree cover on more than 10% of farm lands, evolving
market opportunities will promote the sustainability of tree nursery management initiated by the
Project.
63.    Counterpart funding and funds flow. On the other hand, the quarterly provision of
counterpart funding by the GoK (Ministry of Agriculture) was erratic, forcing KARI to advance its
own resources to cover counterpart expenditures. The lengthy bureaucratic process of withdrawal
applications through the line ministry and Treasury delayed timely disbursements. This in turn
obstructed critical Project activities because funds to pay for the procurement of goods and
services, sub-projects as well as incremental operational costs were not available on time. It also
negatively affected communities' motivation and cohesion due to long outstanding commitments
by the Project. In some cases, KARI could not comply with its financing commitments for two
years, which both demoralized communities and slowed down Project progress. Although the
issue was raised repeatedly by the Project team and the Bank, adequate interventions were not
made in a timely and responsive manner to resolve the problems.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
64.     Strong performance of field staff. Despite various challenges it faced including the
partnering relationship with ICRAF and financial flow constraints, the KARI Project team in
Kisumu showed satisfactory performance in meeting Project requirements as a result of its strong
commitments and the dedicated efforts of its field staff in particular. Although shortage of Project
staff and delays in recruitment for vacant positions were observed at the early stages of Project
implementation, and training plans for Project staff were negatively affected by financial flow
constraints, the Project team has successfully accumulated expertise in community mobilization
and IEM promotion, which can be capitalized upon in follow-up operations as well as in other
relevant projects.
65.     Institutional arrangements. The supervision functions of Project operations were
adequately decentralized to Kisumu where the PCO was located. However, providing day-to-day
support to communities by Kisumu-based staff still represented challenges in terms of efficiency,
accessibility and visibility. After the MTR, the recommended relocation of field staff to their
respective river basins for closer support was partially implemented in upper and middle Nyando
basin.

                                                13
66.    Fiduciary management. KARI Headquarters played central control functions in major
financial decisions and procurement performance was rated satisfactory over the Project period.
Nevertheless, several financial actions such as quarterly remittances to the Project account and
submission of withdrawal applications and FMRs were not undertaken in a timely manner
impeding the vital liquidity for Project activities.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
67.      KARI's strong ownership and dedication enabled the Project to achieve the intended
objectives to a satisfactory level. Those achievements as well as enhanced partnership with local
institutions and participatory management of community-driven initiatives were attributed to the
strong performance of KARI field staff. On the other hand, there were weaknesses in the agency's
fiduciary management, some of which were not adequately addressed until the end of the Project.

6. Lessons Learned
68.      Key lessons for community mobilization and sustainability of IEM activities. The Project
designed and tested models for community-based IEM. Some learning experiences that proved
their effectiveness are as follows:
a) Addressing immediate livelihood needs. Living in absolute poverty, people give priority to
    food security and income generation. Since environmental interventions such as tree planting
    and soil and water conservation normally take a long time for desired benefits to be generated,
    integrating pro-poor, livelihood enhancement options that produce immediate economic gains
    into community-driven activities was essential to sustain communities' motivation and
    cohesion. This also helped participating communities understand linkages with broader
    environmental benefits.
b) Importance of participatory planning and interaction process. Conventional one-way
    transfer of technology and knowledge never took root in the communities; by undertaking the
    joint process of priority identification and action plan development, community ownership
    could be ensured, which in turn strengthened the sustainability of Project activities. Interactive
    knowledge sharing could also enrich the selection of technologies which are tailored to the
    local context using locally available knowledge and resources.
c) Potential multiplier effects by longer interventions. At the initial stage, the Project had to
    deal with resistance to Project interventions due to cultural beliefs and practices the
    communities had. The Project revealed that changing local mindsets required patient and
    tireless efforts as communities had a steep learning curve. However, once the positive results
    of the new technologies became apparent, communities became quite cooperative and eager to
    expand their activities, revealing the potential to amplify the Project outcomes.
69.    Preventive and holistic approach to ecosystem management should be integrated with
curative/reactive measures. The Project did not effectively curb already extensively degraded
areas such as gullies in the lower Nyando since it could not sufficiently extend its resources to
upstream interventions. A holistic approach at the entire catchment level should be used to
address critical degradation causes to better regulate water flows in the catchment and
subsequently achieve economic and environmental sustainability.
70.   The Project proved the effectiveness of integrating existing relevant institutions into its
implementation framework. Since KARI is a research institution in agriculture, cross-support by

                                                 14
line ministries having mandates of policy implementation was essential to bring the necessary
expertise and ensure consistent support to community activities initiated under the Project. The
cross-sectoral coordination bodies established by the Project facilitated mutual understanding and
collaboration among local institutions that will not only contribute to the sustainability of Project
activities, but also provide complementary and better aligned service delivery based on their own
institutional mandates.
71.      Project design and expected outcomes need to be aligned with existing capacity and
available financing. The Project performance was significantly affected by unavailability of
anticipated co-financing as well as low institutional capacity for Project implementation, which
required close supervision and an adaptive management approach at all stages of Project
implementation. In addition, modifying Project design (e.g., reducing scope and areas of
intervention) should be considered early on to ensure that the adjusted Project can achieve tangible
results.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
72.    KARI largely agreed with the overall assessment and ratings of the Bank's ICR. The
Borrower's ICR (summarized in Annex 7) provided an assessment similar to the findings of the
Bank's.
73.     Nevertheless, KARI felt that an upgrading of the overall outcome rating could be
considered, based on satisfactory achievements of outcome indicators toward their targets. While
the Bank agrees that the Project largely achieved its revised targets, the outcome rating assessment
is given based on the combination of relevance of objectives/design, achievement of development
objectives and efficiency. Thus the rating encompasses the extent to which PDO is achieved.
Taking into account that the sustainability of adopted land use systems, one of the two
components of PDO, was less attainable due to financial and human resources constraints, the
overall outcome rating was retained as Moderately Satisfactory. Other comments made by KARI
were reflected into the final report.
(b) Cofinanciers
74.    Not applicable.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders
75.     No issues were raised by ICRAF who agreed with (i) ICRAF's role in the implementation
and (ii) project outcomes reflected in the ICR.

                                                                       after construction of soil and water
                                                                       conservation structures under the Project.

    Component 1: Capacity Building for Community Driven Integrated Ecosystem Management

    1.     The Project has effectively adopted micro-catchment based approaches to implementation
    and has established organized community structures under the stewardship of elected micro-
    catchment committees to coordinate the planning process and integrate activities related to
    sustainable ecosystem management that transcend local administrative boundaries. Each micro-
    catchment committee developed a PAP to identify priority activities to be implemented and define
    responsibilities, timeframe, monitoring indicators and cost estimates for implementation. About 7,500
    households (close to 40,000 people) in 15 micro-catchments have collaborated with the Project
    over the last five years. Committees were trained on various ecosystem management strategies,
    leadership and group dynamics to enhance their capability to coordinate activities in their
    respective micro-catchments.

    2.     Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed between the Project and some
    NGOs, such as VI Agroforestry, Victoria Institute for Research on Environment and Development
    (VIRED) International, CABI Africa, Inter Diocesan Christian Community Services and local
    University departments to undertake specialized studies including carbon stock measurements for
    climate change, sustainable wetlands management, integrated pest management and
    adoption/stakeholder satisfaction studies. Both institutional linkages and informal networks were
    characterized by joint planning and implementation (including field visits), division of tasks, and
    sharing of information and resources. As a result, most sub projects initiated by the Project were
    backstopped by key GoK departments, leading NGOs and local universities.

    3.      Subcomponent 1.2 on enhancing capacity for developing carbon finance proposals
    experienced long delays due to the change in the implementation protocol which required time for
    the new arrangements to be operationalized. While an inventory of current stakeholder capacity in
    the region was documented and the Western Kenya Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation
    Forum was established, the capacity of KARI, local institutions and communities that was
    strengthened under the Project is still limited in terms of measuring carbon stocks and accessing
    the global carbon markets.

    Component 2: Scaling up and Financing IEM interventions
    4.     82 percent of PAPs have been implemented according to plan. A total of 115 community-
    managed tree nurseries have been established within 15 operational micro-catchments, and a total
    of 2.6 million tree seedlings of assorted species were planted on farms. 48 model farms
    promoting IEM strategies have been established within the Project area. 2,200 hectares of land
    were brought under sustainable land management through interventions such as terracing,
    retention ditches and drainage, and construction of water pans.

    5.      Despite the significant progress and results, financial flow constraints adversely affected
    the adequacy and sustainability of the achievement of PDO. 98 sub-projects developed by
    community groups in the lower Yala and Nzoia river basins received grants of a total of US$ 0.12
    million shortly before the Project closure, after awaiting financing for nine months since the
    respective subprojects had been approved. 65 sub-projects in the upper and middle Nyando have
    never been vetted due to the lack of available funds.            Slow disbursement also affected
    implementation of timely planting activities during rainy seasons and exchange visits of
    community groups which, as a result, were not realized to the extent as planned.

    Component 3: Monitoring & Evaluation and Project Management
    6.      87 percent of the Project fund was disbursed two months before the end of the grace period
    and all the outstanding bills were paid. 90 percent of planned activities were completed by the end
    of the Project closure. However, the prolonged delays in the disbursement of funds affected the
    timely procurement and implementation of this component. The MIS was developed and
    successfully installed only at the end of the fourth year. As a result, it was, however, not fully
    operationalized due to the winding up of activities and cash flow problems during the last year of
    Project implementation. Project staff felt that more time was needed to practice with the system
    before they acquired the confidence to use it.

1. Introduction
Approximately the same analyses carried out ex-ante at the time of project appraisal were
undertaken to assess its financial and economic viability ex-post. Given the difficulty of
quantifying benefits of certain ecosystem interventions, as well as of observing visible change in
outcomes shortly after interventions, the analysis was confined to a sub-set of IEM activities that
communities adopted.
Three types of analysis have been carried out:
       A financial cost-benefit analysis to assess the profitability of the technologies at the
       household level;
       An economic cost-benefit analysis to assess the economic viability of IEM interventions at
       the Project level; and
       A social cost-benefit analysis to include other externalities such as carbon sequestration.
The analysis presented here is a summary of a more detailed working paper that can be found in
the project file.

2. Methodology and Basic Assumptions
The bulk of the field work for this assessment comprises the collection of data using a structured
questionnaire from 362 randomly selected households from the 11 micro-catchments in the three
lower blocks of the Nyando, Yala and Nzoia rivers.
The specific types of intervention that were investigated are the following:
       Trees (timber, fruits, fodder)
       Maize (through soil and water conservation)
       Banana (tissue culture varieties)
       Vegetables (Kale)
       Bee keeping (honey)
       Tree nurseries
       Water pans
       Livestock (improved dairy goat and poultry)
Tree planting. The survey captured the number of trees each household had at the start of the
project and the number planted over the Project period. Hence, the ex-post assessment compares
changes in adoption and numbers of trees planted during the project period between beneficiary
and control households. Trees were differentiated by type and those analyzed were timber, fruit,
fodder and trees for soil conservation.
Bee keeping with improved hives. The adoption and level of improved hives was captured by the
survey. Since these were not present in the area before the Project, all current adoption can be
assumed to be the result of the Project.
Maize. The Project did not promote new maize varieties or agronomic practices, but did promote
the uptake of many different sustainable land management practices. Comparisons of mean maize
yields between beneficiary and control households did not show any positive impacts from the
project so no benefit is reported in the ex-post economic analysis. However, given the significant
differences in adoption of soil management practices, modest economic benefits (35% yield
increase in year 7 and 40% in year 15) were included in alternative scenarios (scenarios 2 and 3),
based on trial results coupled with actual adoption rates from the surveys.
Tree nurseries. The total amount of revenue and income from nurseries during the Project is
estimated from records tracking the numbers of seedlings raised and payments made. Post project
revenue from nurseries was estimated to be much lower on the assumption that, while under
implementation, the Project itself had been the principal source of local demand. During the
Project, about US$167,000 in net income accrued to households for seedling production efforts.
In the analysis, this was divided equally among the last three project years. Following the Project,
it was assumed that initial production would be just 10% of that during the Project, and then
slowly increase in year 8 and again in year 13.
Water pans. Livestock watering and labor time saved was estimated to constitute main economic
impacts. Field officers estimated that about 600 livestock were watered on a near daily basis. An
average herd size of five is assumed (based on the household survey) and watering for 300 days
with a savings of a half day in each time (KES50 per day per herd).
Livestock. Data were collected on goat milk production, chicken production, and egg production.
However, the analysis did not detect any difference between beneficiary and control households at
project completion. This is due to the small number of adopters in the Project areas, given the
mode of dissemination was to introduce few numbers of improved males for breeding in the
communities. The process of upgrading livestock takes time, even when successful. For this
reason, livestock benefits are not included in the following analyses.
2.1 Financial analysis
Household economic analyses were conducted using a 22 year horizon with discount rate of 12%.
Costs and output prices were collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews,
and secondary data. Net discounted costs and benefits were then estimated for each intervention
area from which net present values (NPVs), benefit-cost ratios, and economic as well as social
rates of return (ERR and SRR) were derived.
Underlying scenario. The following three scenarios were used for analysis. In either scenario, it
was assumed that benefits of interventions are accrued since the third year of the Project.
Scenario 1: the most conservative scenario which assumes no change in production increases (for
banana, kale, honey, maize) or in adoption (timber, fruit and fodder trees which have yet to
produce benefits) over time.
Scenario 2: an increase over time in the level of adoption for those households which already have
adopted a specific intervention.
   - Timber: 25% more planted in year 12
   - Fruit: 25% more planted in year 7
   - Fodder: double the quantity planted in year 7
   - Banana: double the quantity in year 7
   - Kale: double the quantity in year 7
   - Bee keeping: quadruple quantity in year 7
   - Maize: increase yields by 35% in year 7 and by 40% in year 15
Scenario 3: the same assumptions as scenario 2 but doubling the adoption rate for kales, banana
and honey (adoption rates for trees are identical in scenarios 2 and 3).
   -   Timber: 25% more planted in year 12
   -   Fruit: 25 % more planted in year 7
   -   Fodder: double the quantity planted in year 7
   -   Banana: double the quantity in year 7 and double the adoption rate
   -   Kale - double the quantity in year 7 and double the adoption rate
   -   Bee keeping quadruple quantity in year 7 and double the adoption rate
   -   Maize: increase yields by 35% in year 7 and by 40% in year 15 and double adoption rate
These more optimistic scenarios are plausible based on experiences with farmer adoption behavior
which indicates a strategy of incremental adoption for these types of investments in Kenya. It is
also justified by the fact that beneficiary households stated that the Project had greatly increased
their knowledge in IEM practices, as compared to that of the control group.
As noted above, left out of the calculations were impacts on livestock (improved poultry and dairy
goats), as these differences could not be detected in the survey.
2.2 Economic analysis
Project level impacts were calculated by first multiplying the household level impacts for each
IEM practice (the difference in NPVs between beneficiary and control households) by the
percentage of beneficiary households adopting the practice to arrive at an average impact across
all beneficiary households. These were then added up to form a total household level impact. This
was then multiplied by the number of beneficiary households to arrive at a project level figure.
To that, the net benefits from tree nurseries and water pans were added which were calculated
independently at the project level.   
Number of beneficiary households. The project appraisal document assumed the Project would
work in all nine blocks envisaged and that in each block there were a total of 7500 households.
However, the Project concentrated its efforts in five blocks after the MTR and it was estimated
that the total number of households is considerably less based on population density and
household size variables (the latter collected from the surveys). A total of 12,962 households were
estimated to reside in the three lower blocks and about 9,570 resided in the Project's micro-
catchment areas. Of this target population, the survey results revealed that about 41% or 3,951
households benefited directly from the Project in the three lower blocks. For the remaining two
blocks (Middle and Upper Nyando), field officers estimated that a total of 500 households was
active in the Project. This was added to provide a total of 4,451 households (roughly close to
20,000 beneficiaries) benefiting from the Project. The discrepancy in the number of beneficiaries
from what was reported by KARI (40,000) comes from the fact that the analysis excluded ones
who had informal/ad-hoc interaction with the Project.
Project costs: It was estimated that Project costs of US$3,784,951 (final disbursed amount) were
evenly distributed over the five years of Project implementation. All costs borne by households,
including establishment, maintenance, and harvesting, were already included in the household-
level analysis so that the resulting NPVs represented net of those costs.
In addition to the economic assessment, two social impacts, food security and knowledge gain,
were also considered. On the environmental side, a quantitative estimate was made of the impact
on carbon sequestration. The increased adoption of many sustainable land and soil management
practices was also documented. However, other than a valuation of carbon sequestration, the
assessment did not include external impacts (e.g., off-farm income effects through market
linkages) mainly because these are likely to be negligible at the time of Project completion.
Moreover the analysis of potential multiplier effects (e.g., timber milling) would have required
significant additional effort that was not possible to undertake in the follow up period for this
assessment.

3. Results
3.1 Financial Analysis
Change in adoption rate. Table 1 shows a greater increase in adoption rates of tree planting
activities among beneficiary households compared to the control groups (timber trees and fruit
trees: 23% increase in adoption before/after the Project; fodder trees: 39%; and soil fertility trees:
40%). The table also shows that current adoption levels of bee keeping, kale and bananas remain
fairly low among beneficiary households, between 4.9 and 13.9%. For trees, it is possible to
calculate the Project effect on adoption, by comparing the change in adoption rates among
beneficiary households against that among control households. This was done for the four main
tree types and the results presented in the table show that the Project did have a large effect in
terms of influencing adoption by between 20 and 33%.

Table 2 shows the difference in production that was detected between beneficiary and control
households. For trees, it shows the mean difference in the number of trees planted per household.
For banana and kale, the yield per acre is shown, which is in turn converted to the total yield per
household using the average area cultivated for these crops. For bee keeping the mean difference
in honey production per household was estimated.
NPV per household. Overall, under the base scenario 1, the NPV per household was estimated to

interventions. In scenarios of increased adoption over time, the NPV per household increased
significantly, to US$1,963 and as high as US$2,844.
The results indicate that the bulk of estimated net benefits will come from timber trees, fruit trees,
and bee keeping, in order of importance, under scenario 1. If relatively minor increases in
adoption were to occur among various intervention areas, then bee keeping could emerge as the
main contributor to income. Timber tree planting is somewhat less attractive in terms of NPV
because of the delay to maturity and benefits realization.

3.2 Economic Analysis
Household-level NPV was aggregated by multiplying the number of beneficiary households in the
three blocks (3,951 households). By adding the estimated NPVs from tree nurseries and check
dams, the total NPVs in the three blocks were between US$5.4 and US$11.9 millions (Table 3).
Then, the additional net benefits accruing to the 500 households in the Middle and Upper Nyando
blocks were aggregated by applying the average household NPV from the three lower blocks to
these additional households, due to the lack of data that better reflected impacts in those blocks.
This increases total project NPV accruing to households to between US$6.0 and US$13.3 millions.
Economic rate of return. Under the base scenario 1, the overall NPV at the project level taking
into account the project costs was US$3.0 million resulting in a benefit-cost ratio of 2.02 and an
ERR on investment of 17.7%. In the economic analysis at Project appraisal, it was projected that
an ERR of 23% was achieved if the Project were to be implemented in all nice blocks, each having
target households of 7,500. However, an alternative scenario, assuming the decreased number of
beneficiaries (about 20,250 households), was also tested in the ex-ante analysis, which was much
closer to actual situations where about 20,000 households were estimated to reside in the five
blocks. The latter scenario provided an ERR of 14%. Thus, an ex-post ERR of 17.7% gives a
sound rationale that the Project efficiency was satisfactorily achieved as originally envisaged.

          3.3 Social Analysis
            Food security and welfare. Questions were asked of all respondents with respect to the number of
          food deficit months, overall food production, purchasing and consumption, and the extent of
          ownership of various assets as of 2004 and 2009. From these responses, changes over time were
          calculated for beneficiaries and control groups.
          Table 4 shows the average decrease in the number of maize and meat deficit months in beneficiary
          households. In the case of maize, the decrease was large, at one month. On the other hand,
          control households experienced an increase in maize deficit periods, by almost half a month and
          had no change in meat deficit months. These statistics indicate that the Project had a considerable
          positive impact on food security. This is further supported by the other food security indicators:
          nearly 60 % of beneficiary households indicate an increase in the production and consumption of
          food over the period. This compares favorably with control households for which only 31 to 37%
          have experienced such positive outcomes.
          A number of assets were also enumerated and changes in their holdings across project and control
          households were analyzed. Some assets, such as motorbikes and bikes, did not change over the
          period for any of the groups. However, changes were detected in mobile phones, improved stoves,
          and radios as presented in Table 4. Mobile phone ownership grew for all household types, but
          more rapidly among beneficiary households than for the control group. The same applies to
          improved stoves. For radio ownership, the figures show an unchanged situation for beneficiary
          households against a slight increase for control households. It is not known, however, whether the
          improved asset holdings for mobile phones and improved stoves (compared to the control group)
          are a result of additional income from the Project or from other factors.

Knowledge Gains. Households were asked to evaluate the change in their knowledge of tree
planting, soil management, crop management, and livestock management during the project period.
Without exception, beneficiary households were much more likely than other households to have
responded that their knowledge increased significantly (Table 5). Conversely, the control
households were much more likely to respond that their knowledge had decreased or remained
unchanged. As an example, 87% of beneficiary households stated that their knowledge of tree
planting had increased while only 55% of control households responded similarly. Households
were also asked about their gain in knowledge with respect to the marketing of outputs and
accessing information. Again, beneficiary households were much more likely to have gained
knowledge. As many as 97% of these households felt that their knowledge on how to access
information had improved, as compared to only 54% of control households. In all cases, the
knowledge gain of households which were not members of IEM target groups but had
informal/ad-hoc interaction with the Project, was in between the case of beneficiary and control
households. Thus, those households also appear to have benefited from the Project.
In summary, the data on knowledge gain is important in evaluating the potential for sustaining the
existing investments and in undertaking new investments in the future. The capacity of
households to invest in IEM has clearly been raised. However, other factors, such as economic
incentives and local institutional support, will also determine the extent to which these
investments will be sustained or upscaled.

3.4 Environmental Analysis
Soil erosion. From Table 1, it is clear that beneficiary households were much more inclined to
invest in these IEM practices. Some of the impacts of these investments can be traced to private
economic returns, either actual or projected. However, beyond the private returns, positive
environmental impacts are expected as well. Many of the soil conservation measures entailed
technologies for reducing erosion, such as terracing, ditches, vegetative strips, minimum tillage,
improved fallows, and others. For each of these practices, beneficiary households were more
likely to adopt these measures than control households. Many of the differences were about 10%
in size, but some were larger, such as in the case of vegetative strips where the adoption rate was
61% by beneficiary households and only 41% by control households. Indeed, the survey indicated
that beneficiary households reported far fewer incidents of soil erosion than did control
households during 2006 and 2009. For example, the mean number of incidents per household
ranged from 1.7 to 5.7 over the four year period for beneficiary households, while the range was
between 4.8 and 17.2 for control households. The four year average was 3.3 for beneficiary
households and 9.0 for control households.
Carbon sequestration. Tree planting offers another way of helping to prevent erosion and protect
watersheds. In addition, it can help to foster biodiversity (e.g., of birds) and sequester carbon.
After removing a couple of outlier tree planters, across all types of trees, beneficiary households
planted an average of 440 trees during 2004 and 2009, as compared to 127 for control households.
The additional 313 trees can potentially sequester significant amounts carbon depending on the
type of tree and management system. In the ex-ante economic analysis, the emphasis was on
rotational shrubs and permanent shrubs which were repeatedly pruned. Those were assumed to
generate 6 kg of carbon per year. On the other hand, the types of timber trees planted by the
Project can produce upwards of 30 kg of wood per year under favorable growing conditions and
management, or about 15 kg of carbon per tree. However, since many of the trees are found in a
less favorable environment in lower Nyando, a more conservative estimate of 10 kg per tree was
used. The total of nearly 160 additional timber and fruit trees can be expected to sequester about
1.60 tons of carbon per year which could provide an additional US$23 per year per household than
would be generated by control households (at a price of US$4 per ton of carbon dioxide, where
one ton of carbon equals 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide). Across all beneficiary households, this
would amount to a NPV of about US$751,946 for timber and fruit trees. The NPV for fodder and
soil fertility trees would be approximately US$431,768.
Biodiversity. Potential biodiversity benefits from the Project can be measured through: (i)
additional wildlife (plants and animals) extraction benefits that would accrue to households in the
project area as a result of the Project; (ii) wildlife stock accumulation benefits in natural habitats,
that would accrue as a result of the Project, with estimation based on the stock value of
endangered or threatened wildlife species; and (iii) the change in long-term livelihood
sustainability or disaster mitigation benefits of biodiversity for food, fiber and human health.
However, not enough data was attainable to estimate the benefits from biodiversity increase.
Lake Victoria. The intervention of the Project in the five blocks covering less than 2% of the total
watersheds area in Western Kenya, is unlikely to generate any significant decline in sediment
loading that would have a perceptible impact on the economy of the Lake Victoria. At best the
SLM technologies and the planting of trees on degraded lands would improve water quality in the
micro-catchments where the blocks are located, but would have no significant impact beyond such
catchments.
Social rate of return. Given the above assumptions, the social rate of return for the Project which
included the environmental benefits from carbon sequestration was estimated to be 19.3%.

                             Annex 6. Beneficiary Survey Results

Objectives and survey design
The beneficiary survey was conducted to assess the impact of the Project on the community's
attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, experiences and reactions after a five year period and determined
the extent to which the objectives were achieved. A total of nine focus group discussions (FGD:
three in each block) were conducted in the Project intervention areas and an FGD check
list/guideline and an observation checklist were used to collect data.

Main findings
1. Participatory Action Plans
We sought to find out whether the communities could identify the ways in which they and partner
organizations were involved with the Project. The members during the discussions could identify
the organization and the Project, i.e. KARI and WKIEMP. Focus groups in all three blocks were
in agreement that they were involved from the beginning of the Project. The initial activities
included problem identification, selection of demonstration sites, community empowerment with
respect to Project activities and strengthening and formation of farmers' groups in integrated
ecosystem management.
Information obtained from the communities revealed that the groups ranked Kenya Forest Services
as the strongest collaborator of the Project at 18% of the total number of organization mentioned
by different groups, Ministry of Agriculture and Other Farmers Associations placed second at
14%, Community Based Organizations, Ministry of Livestock and Local Government Authority at
9% while youth organizations and disabled welfare groups followed at 5% each. For Project
adoption and sustainability, collaboration is of growing importance, especially in terms of having
related organizations work together in order to achieve substantial results.
 Several training sessions were organized by KARI through the Project lifecycle. With respect to
the adoption of new skills as a result of the training sessions, 50% of the groups responded that
they had partly implemented these skills, while the other 50% noted that they had not. About
30% of the groups attributed this poor response to lack of funds, 14% attributed their failure to
implement the lessons learnt to poor leadership skills of the farmers' associations where groups'
financial resources were squandered away, and another 14% were influenced by cultural practices
and beliefs. For instance in the Dhene micro-catchment, the farmer's group refused to have its
hens taken to one homestead where the Kenbrew was being kept for purposes of cross-breeding.
Respondents believed this would go against their beliefs where it is believed that the hens would
die if one crossed the road while carrying them. Competition for resources was also mentioned as
a reason for not implementing new skills as were pests and disease together with salty water that
hindered adoption of new farming techniques at 14% and 21%, respectively. Another minor
challenge was resistance from community members who did not participate in Project activities.
The farmers agreed that soil conservation measures and learning as to how to plant trees were the
most practiced lessons at 13% of the different skills taught, while conflict resolution and poultry
keeping were both mentioned at 11%. Modern farming techniques, livestock keeping and bee
keeping were also gainful skills that the community had attained from the Project at 9%.
Surprising as well were lessons participants had learnt with respect to climate change and its
effects at 6%, while integrated pest management skills had been learned by 4.8%. As for river
bank protection, this activity was mentioned at one site where sand harvesting was prominent (a
micro-catchment in the lower block of the Nzoia river).
2. Impact of IEM technology adoption
It is very encouraging to see the extent to which tree planting has been adopted throughout the
three watershed sites. Information gathered during the discussions indicated that community tree
nurseries had been set up in farms that belonged to individuals, which were the demonstration
sites. From the demonstration sites the tree seedlings were distributed to the farmers. Other
knowledge gained concerned the basic importance of trees and their benefits. Rehabilitations of
the environment were underway in a vigorous manner as a result of several woodlots such as one
in Namduru. The trees have also provided fodder for the livestock, thus reducing the time and
energy previously required to look for grazing land.
The communities have adopted cultivation of new crops recommended by KARI. Butter nuts,
water melon, certified maize, amaranth and eggplant have proven to be very popular with the local
populations around Kapsiti Katuk, Onyuongo and Kapsokale. Others, notably the communities
around Kapsiti Katuk, have taken advantage of the income generating capabilities of these crops
and transport them all the way to Kisumu to sell. Famers have reported that they have noticed
some positive effects on cultivating these crops by adopting the knowledge they obtained during
training sessions. The intensity of soil erosion has been reduced in Kapsiti Katuk and Onyuongo,
although in Kapsokale the case is not the same. Farmers were able to tell the improvement of
soils on the basis of increased food yield and the color of the soil, which has changed from brown-
yellow to dark-brown. One particular farmer gives an example that, before he would harvest
about half a sack of maize (i.e. about 25kg), but now with the adoption of new farming techniques
and environmental conservation measures, he is able to harvest about two sacks of maize (about
100kg).
According to the groups, environmental conservation management technologies have proved to be
a better way of land management. Impact of these technologies include increased food yield,
hence improved household food security, at 23% of the different impact identified by the farmers,
improved environment, especially availability of windbreaks at 31%, availability of cheap green
manure from the trees planted at 13%, availability of wood fuel from the enclosure at 10%, new
opportunities for income generation and hence improved welfare of the family at 15%, and finally,
more activities and less idleness for youth at 7%.
3. Gulley rehabilitation and water pan development
The major problems stemming from the large gullies in Nyando are communication and
transportation interruptions between communities, accidents, injuries and death to human beings
and livestock, hunger and poverty, loss of land for a graveyard, and forced migration. Before the
Project, community members of Onyuongo and Kapsokale tried to implement some measures to
stop the growth of the gullies. The activities included putting in place terraces along the hills and
cut-off drains. The Project tackled some of the problems mentioned by the community members
though the extent to which the problems were dealt with could not be easily quantified. In
Kapsokale, not much was done due to lack of funds. What the Project was able to do was to
introduce new farming techniques, new crops and tree seedlings. In this site, neither a water pan
nor an enclosure could be established around the gulley in order to stop it from growing. From the
villagers' perception, the gulley had expanded even further and deeper in recent times. Recently,
one farmer had lost part of his farmland due to the growing gulley.
As concerns enclosures, of the three sites visited in lower Nyando, there were only two enclosures
i.e. Kapsiti Katuk and Onyuongo. Managing and maintaining these two enclosures seemed to be
a challenge to the communities even though both had tried to put some mechanisms in place to
deal with those that broke into the restricted areas and misused the resources in the enclosure.
These two communities created by-laws on how to govern these enclosures although some people
still knowingly break-in and contravene the laws, especially during the dry season. If approached
and asked to stop this, they wouldn't compromise. In Kapsiti Katuk, this has led the farmers to
approach the local authority to deal with these offenders. A major obstacle, however, is that some
of the offenders own part of the land housing the enclosure so that punishing them becomes tricky.
In Onyuongo, the enclosure was fenced at a distance of around 50m from the gulley, even though
the gulley has grown so close to the fence that local people fear that the enclosure will not be able
to contain the growth of the gulley. What has remained is a small foot path of about 10m between
the gulley and the edge of the enclosure and the locals are anxiously waiting to see what will
happen.
There were constraints in the adoption of these technologies around the gulley sites including
lethargy of community members who do not want to participate in work such as fencing the
enclosure. Cultural beliefs and practices also prevented full adoption of these technologies in the
gulley sites. Unreliable rainfall patterns and pest and disease also proved to be a challenge to the
community. Increased wildlife in the enclosures led to crop damage on nearby farms which was
also a huge problem. The locals noted that, as a result of the rehabilitation of the once degraded
ecosystem, animals, such as monkeys and porcupines, and birds have returned to the area which
they had earlier deserted.
Establishment of water pans was one of off-farm activities undertaken by the Project. One full
fledged water pan was set up in Kapsiti Katuk. In Onyuongo, the process was never completed
while, in Kapsokale, this initiative was not undertaken. The varied level of implementation was
attributed to the lack of funds. Before the establishment of the water pan in Kapsiti Katuk, local
people had to travel for over 6km in search of water. Thus, the water pan has provided water for
both farm and household use.
Conflict in these three particular gulley sites arose over management of water pans and enclosures.
During the FGD site visit, it was noted that the CDF committee had stepped in to finish up the
construction of a water pan in Onyuongo, although there is already a concern as to how the facility
will be managed and governed. Even though the two aforesaid communities did have by-laws
that they hope to implement in governing the management and usage of the water pan and the
enclosure, they did not know who would be part of the governing structure and whether it should
be attached to the existing farmer association committee or be established independently. The
water pan in Katuk Kapsiti de-silting was also proving to generate conflict. Some accused others
of being responsible of silting the waters, yet they did not want to be part of the de-silting exercise
and consequently, the farmers did not know how to manage this problem. As for the enclosure, it
raised conflict as some farmers who owned part of the enclosure sought to use it as they pleased
even though they had agreed that they would keep off it for the time being until full rehabilitation
was attained.
Political instability during 2008 was also an obstacle to adopting these skills. In one particular
demonstration site in Kapsokale, which was the assistant chief's own farm, during the 2008 post-
election violence that had rocked the country, everything was lost because of his support to a
political candidate that his neighbors did not support. In return, he did not want anyone to use his
farm even though everyone had participated in establishing it during the demonstration exercise.
Similarly, in Katuk Kapsiti the water pan is shared between two communities and during political
clashes the members supporting one of the parties were not able to utilize it.
4. Conflicts and resolutions
In addition to the conflicts arising from communally managed resources noted above, a few others
were noted in the FGDs. In Yala and Nzoia, conflicts with the Project emerged over non-payment
for tree seedlings raised by the respective communities. This occurred in the final stage of the
Project when funds were not released to the Project team in a timely manner. Other conflicts
within the communities emerged from mismanagement of funds and distribution of farm inputs
provided by the Project. During the Samadhi Luore and Nyanya Micro-catchment group
discussions, meetings were stopped abruptly by hostile youth groups. It is believed that the youths
of this particular micro-catchment obtained a loan in order to produce as many seedlings as
possible which KARI `bought' with promise of payment at a later date. Two years later, due to
cash flow problems within the Project, the payments were not completed. Not only did this result
in conflict within the groups, but it demoralized the farmers and also tarnished the tremendous
progress that KARI had attained through the Project. Other causes of conflict in these two areas
included community mismanagement of funds and farm inputs donated by the Project, lethargy of
group members, divergence of farm yields from demonstration site results, lack of water for
farming, lack of attendance during group meetings, scarce resources and mistrust among group
members/poor leadership.
In terms of whether they had sufficient skills to resolve such conflicts, 33% of the groups said that
they had no knowledge whatsoever while 67% said that they had limited knowledge to resolve
conflicts. Additionally, 25% of the groups would resolve the conflicts by using the group
constitution while another 25% would seek local authority's intervention. On the other hand, 12%
would simply not attempt to resolve the problem and another 38% preferred to dissolve the
farmers groups as a solution to resolving the conflict.

I. Summary of Borrower's ICR

The Borrower (KARI) has prepared a detailed ICR following the Bank's template, which is
available in the project files. The following summarizes the main findings and assessment of
Project outcomes.
Assessment of Outcomes
1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and implementation
The two objectives of the project (developmental and environmental) are consistent with the
government's SRA to improve agricultural productivity, food security, commercialization and
environmental conservation. Specifically the government recognized the rapid decline in the
natural environment and stagnation in agricultural productivity in western Kenya and initiated a
number of jointly funded projects to improve productivity and reverse environmental degradation.

The project design has been changed over the period of five years it has been operational.
Initially the project proposal considered covering all lands in Western Kenya that fall within the
Lake Victoria watershed. However this later changed to focus on three river basins (Nyando, Yala
and Nzoia). It was seen that since the project was to have an important demonstration effect the 3
river basins were considered appropriate. However the MTR, recommended that the coverage was
still too ambitious given the available resources. Thus finally although the three basins were
retained WKIEMP activities were confined to selected Micro-catchments in Upper, Middle and
lower Nyando; Lower Yala and Land Management Units in lower Nzioa. The Micro-catchments
approach was considered more manageable. The Integrated Ecosystem Management was unique
to WKIEMP and had potential of being more effective in addressing problems of natural resource
degradation and achieving sustainable farming system. Capacity building of communities in IEM,
participatory assessment, planning, decision making, implementation and evaluation had an effect
on empowering the farmers to determine what to do. Scaling-up of proven IEM interventions to
address farmer identified constraints was a prudent way of resource utilization and for quick
outputs. However sequential implementation of IEM intervention starting with Nyando basin, then
Yala and finally Nzoia and only in the lower zones of the last two, ended up disadvantaging the
latter two due to time constraint.
Project Implementation was affected by a number of factors that were not envisaged at the
appraisal stage. The geographical coverage was too ambitious as stated earlier. The eventual
scaling down to micro-catchments enabled the project to more effectively pursue project
objectives. The flow of funds had challenges due to factors such as the system of accessing and
accounting (SOE) that was adopted as per the Grant Agreement. Although the agreement allowed
for use of both FMR and SOE with subsequent switch to FMR, the project never used the FMR to
access funds even though FMRs were submitted first in June 2008 to cover the period My 2008-
June 2008 and subsequently every quarter thereafter. The long route/procedure of processing re-
imbursements and the internal delays in accounting collectively contributed to delays in
disbursements. These delays resulted in delayed implementation of Small Grants programme
which was not operationalized, except in lower Nyando basin, till June 2010, when funds for Yala
and Nzoia were released. Even for lower Nyando, only sum of ksh. 970,000 for seven CBOs had
been disbursed by the third year of the project. The bulk of successful grant applications for lower
Nyando have remained outstanding up to the completion of the project.
The need for long periods of community mobilization and sensitization was not envisaged at
appraisal. However the reality on the ground showed the need for long contact time with the
communities for them to grasp the IEM concept which contributed to over staying in the areas
where the project started operating in.
Implementation of activities related to carbon sequestration and measurements of carbon stocks
was to be done by ICRAF through contractual agreements with a view to build capacity of KARI
scientists in these aspects. However by the end of the project this had not been achieved. This
was attributed to high turnover of scientists from ICRAF who would have spearheaded the work.
However one KARI staff is currently pursuing an MSc at Moi University and the project in
collaboration with an NGO, VI Agroforestry had been initiated to build capacity for project staff.
Even with this arrangement the NGO did not carry out formal training for KARI project staff.
The implementation arrangements of the project had adequate structures from national level to
Micro-catchments. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) provided supervision at National level while
the micro-catchments committees oversaw preparation of proposals and implementation of group
activities. Initially there was a plan to use a structure for scaling-up options (Consortium for
Scaling-up Options for Increased Farm Productivity ­ COSOFAP), to scale up technologies from
group activities, however the project started when this structure was winding up its activities and
thus did not benefit much from it.
2. Achievement of Project Development Objective
PDO Outcome No. 1: Decreased number of food-deficit months per annum. This outcome is
likely to be achieved in the very near future. There are a number of interventions that the project
has instituted towards achievement of this outcome, that show a lot of potential. The use of
improved agricultural practices such as hybrid maize, certified seed, fertilizer and diversification
into horticulture and livestock has increased productivity of the farms tremendously. Instances of
ten to twenty-fold increases in maize yield on small acreages were cited by farmers participating
in the project. A group within Nzoia Basin ­ `Sifuyo Kweg Lamo women group' had its members
increase maize production from 8kg to between 270 and 360kg per farm. Use of TC bananas has
also potential of increasing income and contributing to food security. `Jakech Ratego women's
group' also in Nzoia Basin has already sold 18 bunches at KES 300/= each and suckers at KES
200/=. Another group in Yala basin ­ `Aluor widows support group' are upgrading their
indigenous goats using Toggenburg buck and over 100 does have been served. This has also been
taken up by other groups such as `Rera Small-scale farmers youth group'. The off-springs are
expected to improve household milk availability among members.
Due to the above interventions there is slight decrease in the food-deficit months for households
under IEM. From 2004 to 2009, maize shortage months decreased from 5.3 to 4.5 and meat from
5.7 to 5.5. The households not under IEM reported an increase in the number of food deficit
months, over the same period. This trend is expected to continue as the introduced technologies
are widely adopted and farmers improve their capacity in implementation.
PDO Outcome No. 2: Percentage of households in the project intervention areas that are
satisfied with project intervention. This outcome was achieved. In all the three river basins the
groups in the micro-catchments have very high regard for the project and what it has enabled them
to achieve. The bottom-up approach the project adopted in identifying projects for the
communities/groups ensured that the projects were not imposed on the farmers. The
establishment of Micro-catchment committees contributed to a sense of ownership and enhanced
chances of future sustainability. Some of the technologies that were introduced especially the tree
nurseries have been commercialized giving a lot of incentives to the communities. Finally farmers
are very satisfied with the project's initiative in capacity building of communities in the areas of
crop and livestock production, ecosystem management leading to very good understanding of the
environmental objective of the project, leadership and group dynamics, skills in writing proposals
to seek for funding and capacity to engage service providers. In the 11 micro-catchments that
were studied about 50% of the respondents were motivated to undertake IEM options by
WKIEMP, and 60% were relying on the project as a source of IEM information. This initiated
adoption of IEM technologies as indicated by a subsequent adoption studies undertaken later.
The impact assessment study provided the adoption rates as shown in Table 1 of the various IEM
interventions promoted by WKIEMP. For the interventions where there was baseline data from the
2004 survey, it was apparent that the WKIEMP households had higher adoption rates than the
control households (i.e. those who did not participate in WKIEMP).

The adoption rates are expected to increase with time, given the willingness of farmers to continue
implementing the IEM options beyond the life of WKIEMP. In a survey conducted in 2008
overall percentage of households that were willing to continue implementing IEM activities was
78.2% (Table 2). It was highest in Katuk Kapsit (96%), Samathe Luore (91%) and Sifuyo Masat
(91%) and lowest in Dhene (50%) and Uwasi B (50%).

The impression based on interviews in the field at the time of compilation of this report (June
2010), was that these figures are likely to be higher. The willingness to continue with the project
activities even beyond the funding period is an indication of the level of satisfaction with the
project interventions.
3. Achievement of Global Environmental Objective
Improved regional and on-farm and off-farm biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and rehabilitation
of the degraded lands and catchments was the global environmental objective for this project.
GEO Outcome Indicator 1: Area forested for carbon sequestration. Encouraging farmers to plant
trees was a major project activity that aimed at (a) rehabilitating degraded soils and (b) protecting
river banks in the three river basins. To reach the targeted beneficiaries, the micro-catchment
approach was adopted. Community awareness on importance of trees was done through micro-
catchment committee / group meetings. In addition, there was training on tree nursery
establishment and management organized by WKIEMP and other collaborators like Kenya
Forestry Services.
After five years of project implementation, project beneficiaries (farmers) are now able to
articulate environmental benefits of tree planting including mitigating against global warming
(climate change); soil erosion control and improved biodiversity. Even though most of the groups
did not fully understand the Environmental objectives the enthusiasm exhibited in tree planting
shall contribute significantly towards contribution to Carbon sequestration. However there is need
to link up the farmers to the Carbon market. They are also able to link the importance of joint
upstream and downstream environmental conservation measures along the river basins. A total of
117 community managed tree nurseries have been established and about 2.6 million seedlings
distributed for planting to farmers. The actual area reforested as at June 2010 was 1,820 ha
(equivalent to 2.6 million trees planted with an estimated survival rate of 70%) against a target of
1,400 ha. This figure includes the area covered by the 48 established model farms with average 0.5
ha each. It does not include area covered by the soil and water conservation strategies such as
water pans. Therefore, this indicator was achieved.
Several opportunities are available that are likely to further enhance the number of trees planted in
future. They include:
   Government directive that 10% of all farm holdings be under trees could increase demand for
   seedlings. It is anticipated that the Kenya Forestry Services could buy seedlings from the
   group or community tree nurseries and distribute them to farmers.
   Increased awareness among households in the 15 operational micro-catchments on the
   importance of planting trees and also on removal of cultural barriers (taboos) that women
   cannot plant trees.
   Integrated approach involving agro-forestry and honey production promises as an alternative
   livelihood strategy for farmers along the three river basins.
   Realization that trees are an alternative source of farm income through sale of timber (cyperus;
   eucalyptus etc) in the medium- and long- term.
However, full realization of the environmental objective could occur in the long term. Thus
sustainability of the tree planting activity may require that the existing Basin Technical
Committees and the Micro-catchment committees be maintained; linkages between the nurseries
and Kenya Forestry Service (for supply of seedlings) be strengthened and survival rates of planted
seedlings improved through control of termites (Nzoia and Yala basins) and control of free range
grazing systems especially after crop harvest (Nyando basin).
GEO Outcome Indicator 2: Decreased incidence of soil erosion in project intervention areas. In
an effort to reduce the incidence of land degradation in the three basins of rivers Nyando, Nzoia
and Yala, the project instituted several intervention measures that included: conserving degraded
area through construction of soil conservation structures (cut-off-drains, check dams, water pans);
re-afforestation of degraded lands; multiple cropping and appropriate crop agronomic practices. In
addition, 48 model farms demonstrating integrated ecosystem management practices (woodlot
establishment, improved agronomic practices, and soil and water conservation structures) were
laid side by side on community group owned farms to act as learning centres for other
communities with possible wider adoption by farmers.
Though the implementation of the interventions was faced with several constraints such as lack of
knowledge on land tenure systems leading to fear that the government was about to take their land
if water pans were constructed, and insufficient farmer understanding of the importance of soil
conservation, the project has had several positive impacts. They include:
     Awareness on the role of communities to manage common resources (e.g. streams and
     rivulets, water pans) through WKIEMP community sensitization and trainings was enhanced.
     With support from the project, the community managed co construct several waterpans such
     as Kobam (9,000m2) and Simbi (26,000 m2) in the Nyando basin. These have contributed to
     reduced soil erosion in their vicinity besides provision of water for livestock and irrigation.
     Basin Technical and micro-catchment committees with established by-laws on the
     development and management of the common resources have been established. These
     committees have by-laws that discourage free range grazing initially rampant in these areas,
     and a big contributor to environmental degradation.
     Regeneration of vegetation on degraded sites and the establishment of planted trees have
     been successful in Kalacha (15 acres), Kokoto (3 acres) and Kowala rehabilitation sites.
     Some farmers have adopted introduced fodder crops (Napier) and fodder shrubs (calliandra,
     sesbania etc) for livestock feeds by planting them particularly on terraces thus contributing to
     minimization of soil erosion and overgrazing.
However, concentrating soil conservation interventions efforts at downstream blocks before the
upstream blocks has partially resulted in minimal success in the healing of Koyombe and Katuk
Odenyo gullies. In addition, natural regeneration of land has been hampered by the not-fully
controlled communal free range grazing system and lack of incentives for soil conservation given
the prevailing land tenure system (younger farmers not having full control of land which is under
the control of their elderly parents). However, it has been observed that Onyuongo gully is
gradually healing due to reduced soil erosion upstream.
The baseline value for decreased incidence of soil erosion in project intervention areas
(watersheds that feed into the Nyando, Yala and Nzoia river basins) was based on the number of
clusters observed to be erosion prone in 2006. Subsequent estimations based on the observed and
counted incidences (both by community and PCO staff) of erosion within micro catchment
clusters after the construction of soil and water conservation structures through the project
activities was given as 45% as at June 2010 similar to what was targeted. In this regard the
indicator was achieved.
4. Efficiency
The economic analysis. Household economic analyses were conducted by a team of KARI and
ICRAF scientists in October 2010 using a 20 year horizon with costs and benefits discounted by
12%. Costs and output prices were obtained through data collected during focus group
discussions, key informant interviews, and secondary sources. Net benefits and discounted net
benefits were then calculated for each of the impact areas from which net present values (NPV),
benefit cost ratios, and internal rates of return (IRR) were derived. Furthermore, several scenario
analyses were undertaken.
The first was the long term benefits of current levels of observed differences in impact (for banana,
kale, honey) or in adoption (timber, fruit and fodder trees which have yet to produce benefits).
The second assumed an increase in the level of adoption for those households who already have
adopted (e.g. those who already adopted an improved bee hive is assumed to have increased their
investment). This was done for the case of all enterprises, where it was assumed that honey
production was quadrupled (from a very low initial point), kale, banana and fodder trees were
doubled, and timber and fruit trees increased by 25% (this is lower because WKIEMP farmers had
already planted many of these trees). A third scenario used all the assumptions of the first and
doubled the adoption rate among WKIEMP households for kales, banana and honey. For trees,
scenarios 2 and 3 are identical because already a very high percentage of WKIEMP households
were planting trees. These more optimistic scenarios are justified from experiences with farmer
adoption behavior which indicate a strategy of incremental adoption for these types of investments
in Kenya. It is also justified by the fact that WKIEMP households stated that the project had
greatly increased their knowledge in IEM practices, as compared to the control group.
Table 3 below shows the net economic benefits accruing to all WKIEMP households in the five
blocks lower blocks where the surveys were conducted. The result shows the following overall
economic indicators for the project under the base scenario 1:
   Project level NPV (12% discount rate): $2.1 million
   Project level benefit cost ratio (@at 12% discount rate): 1.58
   Project level internal rate of return: 17.9%

Positive externalities. It was observed that the project empowered the communities and local
partners to prioritize their activities. The practical/hands on implementation of the project
activities by the project staff on the ground was highly commended by the collaborating partners,
especially the officials of the line Ministries, for it empowered the beneficiaries to participate in
decision making and project implementation. This is was contrasted with past practices where
project beneficiaries were only taught in seminars and workshops without the practical application
or follow up on application of what was taught.
The project helped established several community development structures as the micro-catchment
committees which have enhanced the capacity and empowered the local communities to seek
support and solutions for their development problems. Some of the communities due the enhanced
capacities have been able to develop competitive grant proposals submitted to the CDF, NGOs and
other development agencies and received support.
The management and control of the spread gullies was minimized the amount of soil which found
its way to Lake Victoria and hence reduced siltation.
5. Justification of Overall Rating
The PAD listed eight Performance Indicators that were revised at Medium term Review to four
Outcome Indicators, two for the PDO and two for the GEO. As stated above, one PDO outcome
(Outcome No. 2) was achieved while the other, Outcome No 1 is likely to be achieved in the very
near future based on the inventions the project instituted. Both GEO Outcome Indicators were
achieved.
This Satisfactory rating reflects: (i) relevance of the project's design and investments made; (ii)
the positive impacts on the local communities in the three river basins that were derived through
the introduction and adoption of a relatively complex concept of integrated ecosystem
management, (iii) the adoption of improved technologies that led to achievement of the PDO and
GEO outcome indicators, and very importantly (iii) the very enhanced capacity of the
communities and effective structures put in place to provide continuity in the furthering the
achievements.
6. Overarching Themes, other Outcomes and Impacts
The project empowered poor rural household groups in the three river basins through several
interventions:
-   By spending over KES 13 million to buy 2.6 million seedlings @ KES 5 per seedling from the
    117 community based nurseries the later got seed money which they used to strengthen their
    respective groups by meeting financial obligations like paying for registration certificates,
    accessing inputs to further strengthen commercial activities for respective groups, etc.
-   Through the many community training seminars, farmers were empowered to write grant
    winning proposals to undertake demand-driven livelihood enhancing activities for their groups.
    In total, WKIEMP disbursed KES 979,550 to 7 groups in 2007 and KES 10 million to another
    98 groups in 2010. Having also been sensitized on possible areas they could access funds from
    such as local and International NGOs, Constituency Development Fund, Local Authority Trust
    Fund, Women Trust Fund, Fund for the Disabled and the Youth Fund, for their planned
    activities some groups have obtained funds from some of these sources. For instance,
    Nyadorera Adult Learning Centre of Lower Nzoia Block obtained KES 200,000 (from
    Ministry of Health) and 120,000 (from "Njaa Marufuku", Kenya) for AIDs orphans, and Jimo
    Onyuongo Soil Environment and Conservation Group (Lower Nyando Block) obtained KES
    100,000 from Constituency Development Fund for construction of a community dam.
-   Gender cultural empowerment: Through sensitization and training meetings, women have now
    been culturally empowered to plant trees, bananas and even construct terraces. Given that
    majority of farmers comprise women, more trees and bananas are likely to be planted, and
    efforts towards soil conservation will be enhanced, other factors held constant.
Given the many community participatory seminars and demonstrations for agronomic skills
development held by WKIEMP, households have been exposed to low cost technologies such as
row planting, composting, biomass transfer, intercropping, planting of calliandra etc which if
adopted are likely to improve their household food and feed security, improve their nutrition and
enhance household incomes.
7. Summary of findings of beneficiary survey and impact assessment
Social impacts: Food security and welfare indicators. During the impact assessment study,
questions were asked of all respondents on the number of food deficit months, on overall food
production, purchasing and consumption, and on the extent of ownership of various assets as of
2004 and then again in 2009. From these responses, changes over time were calculated for the
WKIEMP group members and the control group as shown in Table 4.
On average WKIEMP households decreased the number of maize and meat deficit months. In the
case of maize, the decrease was large, at almost 1 month. On the other hand, the control
households experienced an increase in maize deficit periods, by almost half a month and had
almost no change in meat deficit months. This is further supported by the other food security
indicators. Nearly 60 % of WKIEMP households indicated an increase in the production and
consumption of food over the period. This compares favorably with the control group for which
only 31 to 37 percent claim to have experienced such positive outcomes.

A number of assets were also enumerated. Some, such as motorbikes and bikes did not change
over the period for any of the groups. However, some changes were detected in mobile phones,
improved stoves, and radios. Mobile phone ownership grew for all household types, but more
rapidly among WKIEMP households than for the control group. The same is true for improved
stoves.
 Farmer capacity building impacts. During the same survey, households were asked to evaluate
the change in their knowledge of tree planting, soil management, crop management, and livestock
management during the 2004-09 periods. Without exception, WKIEMP group households were
much more likely to have responded that their knowledge increased significantly than other types
of households. Conversely, the control households were much more likely to respond that their
knowledge had decreased or remained unchanged. As an example, 87% of WKIEMP group
households stated that their knowledge of tree planting had increased while only 55% of control
households responded similarly. Households were also asked about their gain in knowledge on
marketing of outputs and accessing information. Again, WKIEMP group members were much
more likely to have gained knowledge. As many as 97% of these households felt that their
knowledge on how to access information had improved, as compared to only 54% of control
households. In all cases, the knowledge gain of informal WKIEMP households was in between
the case of WKIEMP group households and control households. Thus, many of these types of
households also benefited from the WKIEMP project.
8. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The overall risk to development objective is assessed as moderate. At appraisal five of the critical
risks identified for the project had direct implication to development outcome; (i) Beneficiaries
might have redirected funds available to other purposes (ii) Community members might not have
been able to work together to manage resources (iii) Non-adoption of technologies intended to
promote IEM (iv) Community groups might have lacked the necessary capacity and (v) Risks
associated with theft and fraud.
The risk of redirecting funds to other purposes was reduced to low due to intensive community
mobilization, training and in developing PAPs. This together with close supervision by the project
field staff assisted by the social and extension staff ensured that funds were spent on the intended
IEM projects.
The training on group dynamics, leadership and conflict resolution provided to the community
groups working with the project, led to the groups working together very well to manage the
resources. However the ICR team got the impression that one of the factors that made the groups
work well together was the support they were getting from the project (especially farm inputs and
cash received for the seedlings raised). Where the groups have commercialized tree nurseries, this
is likely to continue, however the groups that have not found a market for their products,
continued working together shall be a challenge. Thus the risk for groups continuing working
together is rated as moderate. Such groups should be assisted and linked to markets, and in this
respect role of project partners such as extension agents is important after the end of the project.
The IEM technologies that were used were already tested and proven to work, more importantly
the development of PAPs after assessment of framers requirement entailed that the technologies
provided for adoption were those demanded for. Thus the risk of non-adoption of technologies
was evaluated as low. Most of the group members had adopted the technologies (tree planting, soil
conservation, certified crop seed, crop husbandry, fertilizer use, horticulture) in their individual
farms. However within the micro-catchments the off-farm conservation efforts were challenged by
the land tenure system, where individual owners (who were not group members) would not allow
any rehabilitation work to be carried out on their land.
Capacity building for community groups was undertaken in various areas of IEM. Specifically the
groups were trained in tree nursery management, soil and water conservation methods, local
poultry and goat production, bee keeping, sericulture, in targeted micro-catchments in the three
river basins of Nyando, Yala and Nzoia. The groups were also taken through group dynamics,
resource sharing, and conflict resolution. All these built capacity of community groups
participating in the project, thus reducing the risk of lack of capacity to low.
The establishment of management committees within the groups at Common Interest Group level
and Micro-catchments level, controlled the resource use and minimized risk to theft and fraud.
This was further strengthened by the registration of groups with the Department of Social Services
and subsequent supervision of group management by the District Social Services Officers.
However the regulations for operating bank accounts for the grants received were not stringent
enough to prevent theft and fraud. Banks were to be notified of the authorized signatories to the
account through minutes of group meetings signed by all members. The Social Services Officer
did not have to corroborate that the group actually held the meeting. This opened a loophole that
fraudsters within groups could use to defraud. The risk to theft and fraud is therefore rated as
Significant. A group in lower Nzioa lost its last Grant through this means, about three days after
receiving and banking the grant money. Such unfortunate occurrence could be prevented if the
Department of Social Services endorsed the change of group officials before they are presented to
the bank.
Further assessment of risk to development outcome can generally be based on technical,
institutional, economic/financial, environmental and social criteria. The risk is low in some of the
criteria such as (i) the use of tested and proven technologies for IEM in the project entailed
appropriateness to the farming community (ii) the government's policy change and emphasis on
turning around subsistence small-scale farmers into commercial farmers in its development blue-
print Vision 2030, and establishment of support mechanisms will provide required institutional
arrangement for sustainability.
However moderate risk could be experienced in (i) access to financial resources by the farming
communities. There are a number of sources of funds for farmers (CDF, economic stimulus
package, youth and women enterprise funds, Kilimo Biashara, etc.) that could be accessed and
with the capacity built by the project on grant proposal writing, these funds could be accessed.
However, most groups were still not aware that they could submit proposals for funding from
these sources. Thus awareness creation is needed; (ii) on farm inputs where the government has an
elaborate program to reduce costs especially for seed and fertilizer. Under vision 2030, there is a
three-phase program to reduce the price of fertilizer (short-term improved coordination of bulk
purchases, medium-term provision of incentives for local blending, and long-term support to
establishment of local manufacturing capacity). However availability of subsidized fertilizer still
has challenges and this also applies to livestock breeding stock, animal feeds and marketing of
livestock products.
The environmental risk to development outcome is significant. The project succeeded in
formation of active groups and management committees, in building capacity for community
driven integrated ecosystem management (IEM), and effective demonstration of tested
technologies (tree planting, soil and water conservation, crop and livestock production). However,
linking of interrelationships of lower, middle and upper zones along the river basins was still not
appreciated by most of the groups. Only a few micro-catchments committee officials had grasped
the concept. This together with the decision to concentrate on only the lower zones of Yala and
Nzioa, presents significant risk to development outcome. The lower zones are the flood plains and
control of flooding depends on what happens up- and mid-stream. Thus it does not matter how
much development is realized at the lower zone of rivers that are characterized by almost annual
flooding.
The off-farm environmental conservation was also affected due to inaccessibility to degraded
areas in a free-hold land tenure system. The sodic soil types in lower Nyando, presents unique
problems of gully erosion that requires concerted efforts to control amount of water coming from
higher grounds. The few control dams constructed by the project demonstrated their effectiveness
but much more investment than could be provided by the project is required to tame the gullies.
The social risk to development outcome is low. The project involved all gender, youth and
disabled groups to participate in the development activities. The participatory approach in
development of action plans enabled everybody to contribute to decision-making process. This
ensured that the adopted technologies did not impact negatively on local populations. Most
significant impact of the project was breaking of age-old barriers in some communities about
participation of women in planting trees and bananas.
9. Assessment of Sustainability and Risk to Global Environmental Objective
9.1 Sustainability
Box 1: Anticipated measures of sustainability

At project appraisal stage, sustainability was to be achieved through: i) focusing on capacity building of local
technical resource services, and producers; ii) recognizing and capitalizing on the crucial role of local
governments and local producer and community organizations to organize, promote, monitor and assess
implementation; and (iii) utilizing existing institutional structures to implement project activities and deliver
outputs. Additionally, the project was to fund community-based sub-projects, including some community
infrastructure, the required funds for which would be determined based on the community's demonstrated
ability to maintain the assets over the long-term. With a view to further ensure sustainability of the activities
beyond the project period, the project was to build upon existing initiatives in government and non-
governmental institutions, thus reducing the risks associated with the establishment of new initiatives.
It was anticipated that if improved ecosystem management in the target communities could be sustained then
the project farmer beneficiaries could be economically and environmentally be self-sustaining over time.
Furthermore, the project could place funds in the hands of communities and facilitate the provision of technical
assistance through the public or private sector by making application and screening procedures for community
proposals as simple as possible, and by providing ample funds for capacity building at all levels. It was also
expected that experiences gained in farmer-led initiatives on conservation and sustainable use of natural
resources could be replicated within Kenya and potentially other countries with similar agro-ecological
situations.

Several stakeholders including extension agents (Ministries of Agriculture and Livestock
Development), local provincial administration officers, National Environmental Management
Authority (NEMA), Kenya Forestry Services, etc. in addition to KARI were involved in
implementing WKIEMP activities. As these local institutional structures were able to deliver on
the project environmental outputs, it is anticipated that with the completion of the project, some
aspects of the project initiatives especially with regard to protection of community resources such
as dams and water-pans through assistance of the provincial administration will continue. In
addition, at the end of the project, 105 community-based sub-projects had received funding for
integrated IEM activities including construction of community dams. It is anticipated that benefits
arising from implementation of these activities if properly managed will contribute to make the
community IEM activities economically and environmentally self-sustaining over time. Strict
enforcement or observance of by-laws governing micro catchment land degradation and riverbank
protection will enhance environmental sustainability.
Given these scenarios, assessment of sustainability of the environmental objective is therefore
rated moderate.
9.2 Risk
From outputs to environmental objective, it was anticipated that
    beneficiaries may redirect the funds available to other purposes
    community members are able to work together to manage resources
    non-adoption of technologies intended to promote IEM

From components to outputs, it was anticipated that
    difficulty in identifying changes which will have the desired effect
    groups may lack the necessary capacity
    risks associated with theft and fraud

Mis-use of project funds was rare and many environmental conservation activities were
undertaken successfully. This could be attributed to project beneficiary sensitization meetings
which led to attitude / cultural changes among local politicians, farmers and provincial
administrators. Community members worked together in managing common resources through
established micro catchment committees which were backstopped by respective basin technical
committees. However, there is still a need to train micro catchment committee members on
common resource governance, record keeping, financial resource mobilization and management to
minimize the risk of some farmers falling off midstream thus reversing any gains so far achieved
on environmental conservation. In this regard, the risk to non-attainment of this environmental
objective was low.
In several instances, there were difficulties in identifying changes that had occurred with project
implementation. For instance, due to high project staff turnover at ICRAF 4 , measurements of
regional and on- and off-farm biodiversity5, and carbon sequestration could not be undertaken.
However, through a memorandum of understanding between the PCO and Vi Agroforestry, a
methodology for carbon and other GHG emission measurements has been developed and baseline
available. In addition, an inventory of the available skills within organizations in western Kenya
on carbon stock measurements has been documented. Additionally KARI has enrolled a student to
do a masters training in assessments of GHG gases. In this regard, the risk to not attaining this
environmental objective was moderate.

II. Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

The draft has been reviewed by KARI. Generally KARI agrees with the overall assessment of
achievement of the indicators. The ratings are also largely in agreement with those from the
internal review by KARI. However there are a few areas where the wording of statements may
need to reflect the position as at the project closure.
1.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes. KARI suggests that factors which
affected the project positively and negatively be separated for clarity.


4
  Through contractual agreements with KARI, ICRAF was supposed to measure changes in carbon and other GHG
emissions.
5
  Through contractual agreements with KARI, Moi University conducted four rapid biodiversity baseline inventory
surveys to generate environmental baseline data for the lower blocks of the three river basins.
2.      Achievement of Project Development Objective. This section is silent on the PDO
outcome indicator No.2 "percentage of the households in the project intervention areas that are
satisfied with project interventions". This outcome was achieved.
3.      Sustainability of the land use system was not fully attained mainly due to (i) ............. (ii)
Insufficient understanding by communities with regard to up-stream-downstream linkages to
enable longer-term environmental improvements. (note that it is the communities who did not
have sufficient understanding and not the project staff).
4.      Achievement of Global Environmental Objective. There were again two outcome
indicators under this objective (i) area forested for Carbon sequestration and (ii) decreased
incidence of soil erosion. It is the opinion of KARI that assessment is given based on these two
indicators. As indicated in the Bank's ICR the GEO was achieved based on these two outcome
indicators, with an over-achievement of forested areas (1,820 ha against a target of 1,200 ha).
5.      Justification for Overall Rating. The PAD listed eight Performance Indicators that were
revised at MTR to four Outcome Indicators, two for the PDO and two for the GEO. As stated
above, one PDO outcome (Outcome No. 2) was achieved while the other, Outcome No 1 is likely
to be achieved in the very near future based on the interventions the project instituted. Both GEO
Outcome Indicators were achieved. Thus the overall rating could be improved to `Satisfactory'.
6.      The Satisfactory rating reflects: (i) relevance of the project's design and investments made;
(ii) the positive impacts on the local communities in the three river basins that were derived
through the introduction and adoption of a relatively complex concept of integrated ecosystem
management, (iii) the adoption improved technologies that led to achievement of the PDO and
GEO outcome indicators, and very importantly (iii) the very enhanced capacity of the
communities and effective structures put in place to provide continuity in the furthering the
achievements
7.     Achievement of Objectives based on Results Framework. PDO Outcome indicator reading
"decreased number of food-deficit months per annum". The baseline, Target and Actual Values
given in `percentage' do not reflect what the indicator requires thus it could be dropped and retain
the remarks.
