INTEGRATED\n            ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Western Kenya Integrated\n            Ecosystem Management Project for Kenya were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            living in absolute poverty, people give priority to food\n            security and income generation. Since environmental\n            interventions such as tree planting and soil and water\n            conservation normally take a long time for desired benefits\n            to be generated, integrating pro-poor, livelihood\n            enhancement options that produce immediate economic gains\n            into community-driven activities was essential to sustain\n            communities' motivation and cohesion. This also helped\n            participating communities understand linkages with broader\n            environmental benefits. At the initial stage, the project\n            had to deal with resistance to project interventions due to\n            cultural beliefs and practices the communities had. The\n            project revealed that changing local mindsets required\n            patient and tireless efforts as communities had a steep\n            learning curve. However, once the positive results of the\n            new technologies became apparent, communities became quite\n            cooperative and eager to expand their activities, revealing\n            the potential to amplify the Project outcomes. The project\n            did not effectively curb already extensively degraded areas\n            such as gullies in the lower Nyando since it could not\n            sufficiently extend its resources to upstream interventions.\n            A holistic approach at the entire catchment level should be\n            used to address critical degradation causes to better\n            regulate water flows in the catchment and subsequently\n            achieve economic and environmental sustainability. The\n            project performance was significantly affected by\n            unavailability of anticipated co-financing as well as low\n            institutional capacity for project implementation, which\n            required close supervision and an adaptive management\n            approach at all stages of Project implementation. In\n            addition, modifying Project design (e.g., reducing scope and\n            areas of intervention) should be considered early on to\n            ensure that the adjusted Project can achieve tangible results."}, "docdt": "2010-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
