However, inherent in the project process, are\n            unique environmental and social risks, identified in the\n            Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which form the basis\n            for the following mitigation measures. All participating\n            countries are signatories of the Stockholm, Basel and\n            Rotterdam Conventions, and each country program is based on\n            multi-sectoral national steering committees, in close\n            liaison with the technical support unit. The highest\n            standards of vessel safety, and security will be ensured to\n            minimize catastrophic accidents, i.e., breakup of container\n            vessels carrying hazardous materials. Handling of obsolete\n            pesticides inventories shall be conducted by trained staff\n            in accordance with standard environmental practices, who\n            should in turn, be protected from human health hazards with\n            appropriate gear and equipment. Pesticide removal and\n            clean-up shall be in compliance with standard planning, and\n            procedures. Each country's institutional and legal\n            framework should establish and enforce legislation and\n            standards to support implementation of the project, through\n            effective regulatory management processes. In addition, risk\n            assessment shall be conducted in a defined and consistent\n            manner, a process by which priorities will be assigned for\n            the clean-up of sites at the second stage. Monitoring\n            criteria will be in place to ensure compliance with this\n            EMP, by measuring effectiveness of mitigation under the\n            second stage, taking into consideration specific country\n            environmental elements (i.e., economic value of land,\n            agricultural production, water supplies, cultural heritage\n            sites, biodiversity, among others).
