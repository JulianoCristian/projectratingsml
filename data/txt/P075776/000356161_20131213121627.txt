                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Africa Stockpiles Program – Project 1 (ASP-1) was designed to address the issue of obsolete
pesticides by developing and implementing disposal and prevention activities through the establishment
of a new partnership between African countries and their collaborating partners, including the World
Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the pesticide industry represented
by CropLife International (CLI), the Pesticides Action Network (PAN) in the UK and Africa (PAN-UK
and PAN-Africa, respectively) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
ASP-P1 was launched in September 2005 and was designed as an Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
operation to be implemented over a 4-year period in seven countries: Ethiopia, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria,
South Africa, Tanzania, and Tunisia. Program preparation took more than four years, which was mainly
the result of a lengthy partnership-building process, caused by a complex envisaged implementation and
partnership arrangement.
Despite the lengthy preparation, the program’s design suffered from several shortcomings.
Implementation was subsequently characterized by a challenging collaboration among partners,
substantial implementation delays and challenges, and varying performance across the participating
countries. At mid-term review, it was considered difficult to achieve the PDO within the originally set
timeframe and budget in all ASP-P1 participating countries, and it was agreed to restructure the program.
A Level 1 restructuring conducted for four ASP-P1 countries in 2011 eventually positively affected
implementation and facilitated PDO achievement. The overall outcome of ASP-P1 is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. However, despite the program’s complexity, challenges, and poor initial performance,
mitigation efforts eventually resulted in complete disposal of inventoried obsolete pesticides in ASP-P1
Ethiopia, ASP-P1 Tanzania, and ASP-P1 Tunisia, and partial disposal in ASP-P1 South Africa, having
significantly reduced risks to the environment and public health. In addition, measures to reduce future
re-accumulations by establishing sustainable systems of pest and pesticide management were
substantially strengthened across ASP-P1 participating countries.
The elimination of obsolete pesticide stocks remains a development priority. Rural communities cannot
hope to advance if the soil and water upon which their livelihoods and health depend are contaminated
with pesticides, and urban populations cannot prosper if they are suffering from severe illnesses caused by
pesticide poisoning. National development strategies of ASP-P1 participating countries confirm the
importance of eliminating hazardous waste, as do World Bank priorities. The World Bank’s dual goals of
ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity are to be achieved in an environmentally
sustainable manner by taking account of the impacts of climate change, environmental degradation, and
ecosystem changes. New analytical work on hazardous wastes, POPs, and the clean agenda are expected
in the future.

F. Results Framework Analysis 6

Project Development Objective (PDO) - as presented in the PAD (Report No: 32232-MNA): Selected
African countries eliminate inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stockpiles and associated waste,
and implement measures to reduce and prevent future related risks. 7
Revised PDO - The ASP-P1 PDO at the program-level was not revised. However, four ASP-P1 country
projects underwent design adjustments under a combined Level I restructuring in June 2011 (see
Technical Annexes on ASP-P1 Ethiopia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Tunisia).

Global Environment Objective (GEO)- as presented in the PAD (Report No: 32232-MNA): Reduction
of the effects of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) on the global environment.

6
  Annex 3 in the PAD outlined a results framework with slightly differing indicators in comparison to the arrangements for
results monitoring. This ICR draws its evaluation on the results framework.
7
  Corresponding Legal Agreements with ASP-P1 participating countries are discussed in each Technical Annex.

1. PROGRAM CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL
OBJECTIVES, AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1. Country and sector background: During the second half of the 20th century, the African continent
   accumulated large quantities of obsolete pesticides. 10 The accumulation of such obsolete products
   occurred as a result of inadequate stock management, non-distribution to farmers, bans on several
   pesticides, and/or un-coordinated or inappropriate supply from donor agencies. Often in severely
   deteriorated condition, poorly stored and located close to urban and rural settlements and public
   infrastructure, including water supplies, these obsolete pesticide stockpiles represented a serious risk
   to human and livestock health, ground and surface water, land use, and the broader environment. In
   addition, some of these obsolete pesticide stocks included Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) 11,
   posing serious long-term danger to human health and the environment because of their mobility,
   toxicity, bioaccumulation potential, and persistence.
2. At appraisal of the Africa Stockpiles Program – Project 1 (ASP-P1), the amount of publicly held
   obsolete pesticides stockpiled across Africa was estimated at 50,000 tonnes. 12 Most African countries
   were lacking adequate technical, institutional, and financial capacity to properly manage the
   destruction and safeguarding of obsolete pesticide stocks, and clean contaminated sites. They also had
   limited capacity and means to implement sound prevention practices and develop the necessary policy
   and regulatory framework to avoid continuous accumulation. Although several development agencies
   and donors 13 had supported initial activities targeting disposal and prevention operations, resources
   remained limited because of countries’ pressing development needs in areas such as poverty
   alleviation, food security or other elements of sustainable development. In 2000, countries and the
   donor community began to realize that important efficiencies could be gained by promoting a
   strategic programmatic approach to obsolete pesticide elimination for Africa. Such an approach,
   together with the provision of funds specifically dedicated to pesticide/hazardous waste management
   and safe disposal of obsolete pesticides, was therefore sought.
3. ASP was designed to address the issue of obsolete pesticides by developing and implementing cost-
   efficient disposal and prevention activities through the establishment of a new partnership between
   African countries and their collaborating partners, including the World Bank, the United Nations
   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the pesticide industry represented by CropLife
   International (CLI), the Pesticides Action Network (PAN) in the UK and Africa (PAN-UK and PAN-
   Africa, respectively) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). In order to remove all estimated

10
   The ASP classified pesticides as obsolete when they were banned, had deteriorated, or had been damaged, had passed their
expiration date, could not be used for another reason, or were no longer wanted by their owner.
11
   POPs as addressed under the Stockholm Convention, and in this program are: Aldrin, Dieldrin, Endrin, Chlordane, Heptachlor,
DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), Mirex, Hexachlorobenzene and Toxaphene.
12
   In Africa, a total of 51,794 tonnes of obsolete pesticides had been identified by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
This rough estimate did not include contaminated soils (except for contaminated soils in Mali and Botswana), and was intended
to be refined through the country-specific detailed inventories planned under ASP.
13
    For example FAO, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ; previously called Gesellschaft für
Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ)), Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Belgium, Finland, Japan, and the
Netherlands.
                                                                  2
     obsolete pesticide stockpiles in Africa (50,000 tonnes), ASP was expected to require funding of
     US$200-250 million. 14
4. The program was planned to be implemented through a series of projects within a 10-15 year
   timeframe, with ASP-P1 representing the first. ASP-P1 was launched in September 2005 and was
   designed as an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) operation to be implemented over a 4-year period
   in seven countries: Ethiopia, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Tunisia. South
   Africa and Tunisia represented the first APL phase, Mali, Morocco and Tanzania the second, and
   Ethiopia the third. ASP-P1 Nigeria, was not considered part of the APL as it was entirely funded by
   the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Project activities in Nigeria were therefore
   not reviewed as part of this Implementation Completion Report (ICR); however, their outcomes are
   summarized in Box 1.1 15 All seven countries had ratified the Stockholm Convention on POPs and the
   Basel Convention on Trans-boundary Shipment of Hazardous Waste. 16 During the first year of ASP-
   P1 operations, an additional eight countries were expected to be identified and the corresponding
   projects prepared for inclusion in a follow-on project called ASP-P2. 17 This ICR pertains to the first
   group of projects – ASP-P1.

                                             Box 1.1: ASP-P1 Nigeria – Project Outcome
       Trust Fund Amount: US$3.0 million provided by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
       PDO: To strengthen the recipient’s capacity for pesticide management and prevention of future accumulation of
       publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste.
       Overall outcome – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: ASP-P1 Nigeria was a pilot targeted at sensitizing stakeholders
       for and generating knowledge on obsolete pesticides and their impact on the environment and health. Despite
       operational difficulties encountered during implementation as a result of weak project management, the following
       outcomes were achieved: (i) a national inventory of obsolete pesticides was completed; (ii) a Country Environmental
       and Social Assessment (CESA) was prepared, found satisfactory by the World Bank, and publicly disclosed; (iii)
       improved draft legislation was endorsed by the Steering Committee; (iv) a prevention workshop was held; (v) ties with
       the private sector and NGOs were established; (vi) an emergency containment of two identified problem sites was
       carried out; and (vii) communication and awareness raising activities were carried out.



5. The primary financing instrument for ASP-P1 was a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant of
   US$25 million, split between the two principal GEF Agencies; the World Bank (US$21.74 million)
   and FAO (US$3.26 million) towards a total program cost of US$60 million for the seven countries.

14
   This figure was based on estimates of obsolete pesticides in Africa, taking into account that actual costs could rise significantly
if additional stocks were discovered during country level inventories. Since no adequate hazardous waste destruction facilities
existed in Africa, it was agreed that pesticide waste would be exported to approved facilities in developed countries at a cost of
approximately US$3,500 per tonne, resulting in an estimated total of US$150-175 million. The total budget for prevention
measures was estimated at US$50-75 million; thus the total ASP costs were expected to be in the range of US$200-250 million.

   The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) is an international environmental treaty, signed in 2001
and effective since May 2004, aiming to eliminate or restrict the production and use of POPs. In implementing the Convention,
governments take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment. The Basel Convention on the
Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal is an international treaty that was designed to
reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from
developed to less developed countries.
17
   Pre-identified candidate countries for ASP-P2 were Benin, Botswana, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia,
Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, and Swaziland.
                                                                 3
     Additional funds were mobilized through CIDA, a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), 18 and the
     French Global Environment Facility (FFEM). Fundraising was expected to be continued by the
     partnership throughout the life of the ASP, including from the partners themselves.
6. Rationale for World Bank assistance: The World Bank intended to support ASP-P1 based on its
   comparative advantage in having: (i) significant global experience in managing MDTFs and resource
   mobilization; and (ii) unique expertise in managing complex, and regional programs, establishing
   broad-based partnerships and leveraging additional financing. As a GEF Implementing Agency, the
   World Bank had a responsibility to implement activities toward achievement of GEF operational
   programs. 19
7. Higher-level objectives: At the national level, ASP-P1 intended to contribute to the participating
   countries’ development strategies in the areas of public health, poverty alleviation, environmental
   protection and agriculture, and to help them implement their respective National Implementation
   Plans (NIPs) for elimination of POPs. At the global level, ASP-P1 intended to support international
   efforts to eliminate POPs by contributing to the objectives of international agreements such as the
   Stockholm Convention on POPs, and the Basel, Bamako, Rotterdam and Biological Diversity
   Conventions. The program further intended to improve management of toxic chemicals, and promote
   alternatives to pesticide usage, including Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Vector
   Management (IVM). Capacity building for pesticide management and disposal aimed at enhancing
   the overall capability of partner countries to manage other toxic chemicals and hazardous waste.

1.2. ORIGINAL GEO, PDO, AND INDICATORS
8. Global Environment Objective (GEO): Reduction of the effects of POPs on the Global Environment.
9. Program Development Objective (PDO): Selected African countries to eliminate inventoried publicly
   held obsolete pesticide stockpiles and associated waste; and implement measures to reduce and
   prevent future related risks.20
10. Indicators: The success of ASP-P1 in meeting its PDO was based on the following indicators:

1.4 MAIN BENEFICIARIES
12. Local beneficiaries: Primary beneficiaries were intended to be poor and farming communities. The
    project aimed to improve their quality of life by reducing environmental health risks. (i) Poor
    communities: Since obsolete pesticide stockpiles were often located near poorer communities where
    storage conditions were sub-standard and awareness to the proper use of pesticides was low, the
    intended primary beneficiaries were the urban and rural poor. (ii) Farming communities: A wide
    range of pesticides had been used for pest and vector management in agricultural areas, with pesticide
    distributors and small-scale farmers often having low levels of awareness for exposure risks, little
    knowledge of safe pesticide use, inadequate storage facilities, and limited alternative pest control
    methods.
13. National beneficiaries: The governments, in particular the ministries of health, environment, and
    agriculture in the participating countries were intended to benefit from the program through reduced
    loss in capital, and increased pesticide management capacity.

14. Global beneficiaries: The global communities of people, species, and ecosystems were considered as
    global beneficiaries. Taking into account that obsolete pesticides are often characterized by high
    persistence in the environment, 24 the negative environmental impact in the form of damaged
    ecosystems had been considered serious. Extensive cleanup and contamination-prevention activities
    were, therefore, expected to generate substantial global environmental health benefits.

1.5 ORIGINAL COMPONENTS
15. In support of its PDO/GEO, ASP-P1 had four components: (1) country operations; (2) technical
    support; (3) crosscutting activities; and (4) project coordination.
     •   Component 1 - Country Operations (GEF: US$21.74 million; Total: US$51.37 million): This
         was the program’s principal component, encompassing a full range of disposal, cleanup and
         prevention activities to achieve the PDOs in the participating countries. Sub-components were: (i)
         cleanup and disposal; (ii) prevention of pesticide accumulation; (iii) capacity building; and (iv)
         project management and monitoring. Country-specific details on these activities are outlined in
         the respective annexes.
     •   Component 2 - Technical Support (GEF: US$3.26 million; Total: US$4.31 million): This
         component was intended to provide highly technical and specialized expertise required for
         implementation, supervision and monitoring of country-level activities outlined under the first
         component, including: technical advice requested by the countries for the design and delivery of
         training; production of technical guidelines for cleanup and prevention operations; assistance in
         managing technical aspects of procurement and supervision of specialized contractors; advice on
         linking countries with other specialized agencies and organizations; enhancement of health and
         safety; assessment of laboratory capacities; and oversight of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).
         The technical support was also intended to include advice on disposal options, targeted to specific
         country and site conditions. FAO was expected to be responsible for hosting a Technical Support
         Unit (TSU) to coordinate delivery of technical services envisaged under this component and to
         tap into pertinent expertise of other ASP stakeholders. 25
     •   Component 3 - Crosscutting Activities (Total: US$2.44 million): This component was expected
         to deliver knowledge management, awareness-raising, strategic studies and outreach services to
         ASP-P1 through a coordinated multi-country, multi-partner approach. The key sub-components
         included outreach to promote ratification of conventions relevant to the PDO, building Non-
         Governmental Organization (NGO) capacity, knowledge management, and communication. The
         strategic studies sub-component was intended to include an evaluation of alternative technologies
         for the disposal of obsolete pesticides. In addition, these studies were expected to support better
         understanding of environmental health risks associated with the specific pesticides, and to
         contribute to the prioritization and decision-making process within each country. WWF and
         PAN-UK were to host the Crosscutting Activities Management Entity (CCAME) responsible for
         delivery of support services under this component.

                                                             6
     •   Component 4 – Project Coordination (Total US$2.44 million): This component aimed to
         coordinate the implementation and monitoring of ASP-P1 across the various partners. In addition
         to overall coordination, key activities included developing and ensuring implementation of a
         fund-raising strategy, acting as a Secretariat to the ASP Steering Committee (ASP-SC),
         maintaining awareness at the policy level about the project, reporting to donors, preparing work
         plans, progress reports and financial reports, coordinating independent project monitoring, and
         coordinating the design of follow-on projects. It was intended that initially, the World Bank
         would host a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which during the implementation phase of ASP-
         P1 would be transferred to an appropriate African organization (e.g., the New Partnership for
         Africa’s Development (NEPAD)). 26

1.6 REVISED COMPONENTS
16. The ASP-P1 components were not formally revised through a World Bank-approved restructuring.
    However, four ASP-P1 country projects (Ethiopia, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia) underwent
    design adjustments, including revision of components. The associated revisions made are outlined in
    the country-specific Technical Annexes.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
17. ASP-P1 was prepared between 2001 and 2005. It took more than four years from the time of GEF
    eligibility in July 2001, and over three years from concept note review in July 2002 to the program’s
    approval by the Board in September 2005. The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy
    partnership-building process at the program-level caused by a complex envisaged implementation and
    partnership arrangement. Associated discussions included defining each partner’s role, clarifying the
    World Bank’s legal, fiduciary and operational requirements for a high-risk regional program, and
    avoiding conflicts of interest among contracting partners. Particularly challenging was the
    collaboration between FAO and the World Bank as a result of competing interests in accessing GEF
    funding resources. 27 While collaboration between CLI and the World Bank was adequate, it was also
    characterized by lengthy negotiations on finding modalities for channeling industry funds to the
    projects. A mutually endorsed funding agreement was not finalized prior to ASP-P1 Board approval
    in 2005; thus, a definition of CLI’s role and envisaged funding commitments was not included in the
    PAD or the Operational Manual.
18. Soundness of background analysis: ASP-P1 preparation was comprehensive and built on an
    extensive consultation process carried out during preparation comprising: (i) a body of analytical
    work on pesticide disposal and prevention, which informed project design; (ii) various workshops



26
   NEPAD is an economic development program of the African Union, and aims to provide an overarching vision and policy
framework for accelerating economic co-operation and integration among African countries.
27
   Originally, FAO was envisaged to be a technical support agency to the program. However, FAO was approved as a GEF
Agency in 2001, and therefore was able to access GEF funds directly without going through a GEF Implementing Agency as
previously required. FAO’s role and responsibilities in ASP were therefore changed, and caused confusion among partners.
                                                               7
     focusing on sharing experience and lessons learned, 28 which highlighted several crucial areas that
     were incorporated into design; and (iii) a country workshop focusing on gathering feedback from
     ASP-P1 participating countries. 29 ASP-P1 participating countries were selected, appropriately, on the
     basis of FAO guidelines such as country ownership and commitment, a well-identified lead agency,
     and stakeholder participation and national buy-in. Substantial background analysis was also
     undertaken at the country-level with close collaboration between governments and partners, as was
     evident through joint pre-appraisal missions to all participating ASP-P1 countries, and pledged
     financial contributions.
19. However, while key preparatory outputs such as the PAD and the ASP-P1 generic Operational
    Manual provided adequate and comprehensive information for implementing program-level activities,
    country-specific information was lacking (see Section 2.1 of the individual Technical Annexes).
    Despite extensive consultations and preliminary inventories conducted by FAO, the nature and size of
    the obsolete pesticide stocks scattered across ASP-P1 participating countries were only broadly
    estimated during preparation; the discovery of higher or lower amounts of stocks in participating
    countries during implementation was therefore a possibility, which the program’s plans did not reflect
    sufficiently. It was further assumed that no new stocks of obsolete pesticides would be accumulated
    during program implementation and thereafter, which was unrealistic in view of food security
    concerns and intensified agriculture. The STAP Roster Technical Review of ASP-P1 rightly pointed
    to these risks and suggested “to investigate whether the conditions that had led to the initial
    stockpiling are still applicable, and if changed, how this would affect preventative measures to be
    promoted by ASP-P1”. 30
20. Assessment of project design: The program’s design suffered from several weaknesses:
     •   The program design gave insufficient attention to specifying and defining the partnership
         arrangements, and the roles and responsibilities of each partner involved. ASP-P1 was a
         complex multi-regional, multi-country program involving a variety of partners and heavily
         relying on efficient and effective collaboration. With the exception of a set of ‘Partnership
         Principles for Implementation of ASP’ articulated in Annex 1 of the ASP-P1 PAD, no formal
         documents defined the partners’ respective roles and their collaboration in detail. Further, NGO
         participation in ASP-P1 was configured and intended to be managed at the program-level,
         whereas the collaboration arrangements at the country-level were unclear. An independent
         evaluation of the program’s design and initial implementation, finalized in June 2009, suggested
         that unclear definition of the roles and working relationships among the institutional partners,
         particularly those of the World Bank and the TSU, negatively affected the program’s efficiency
         and effectiveness. 31
     •   The uniform approach ASP-P1 used to the project implementation in participating countries did
         not take individual country contexts sufficiently into account. The PDO, associated indicators, and
28
   In addition to a series of informal partnership meetings, a lessons learned exercise at the First Continental Conference for
Africa on the management of hazardous waste (Rabat, January 2001), and a lessons learned workshop for disposal contractors
(March 2002), were conducted.

         components were pre-configured at the program-level and, as such, applied to all ASP-P1
         participating countries. Country-specific environments were not sufficiently taken into account,
         and during implementation, it became clear that the program approach was not suitable for all
         ASP-P1 participating countries. While the PAD noted a need for flexible implementation at the
         country-level, discussions between the World Bank and ASP-P1 participating countries on how to
         revise the design, together with internal World Bank discussions on how to process these
         restructurings, were lengthy.
     •   The design of the PDO, associated indicators, and components was overly ambitious. Given the
         lack of accurate data on obsolete pesticide stocks that was used during ASP-P1 preparation, the
         PDO, associated indicators, and components were unrealistically designed. A comprehensive
         inventories and Country Environmental and Social Assessments (CESAs) to determine the size
         and nature of stocks and associated disposal requirements were only envisaged to be conducted
         during implementation.
     •   The sequential design of Component 1 was not realistically reflected in the planned
         implementation and disbursement schedule. The completion of an inventory was necessary to
         prepare a CESA, which at the same time had to be completed before disposal activities could be
         initiated. Potential delays and their subsequent impact on overall project implementation were not
         adequately taken into account in the forecasted disbursement schedule and overall project
         timeframe. 32
21. Government commitment: Adequate commitment at entry of the participating governments towards
    the issue of obsolete pesticides was an eligibility criterion for participation in ASP-P1. Governments
    had to ratify the relevant conventions and show a good level of readiness to implement planned
    activities. Please refer to each participating country’s Technical Annex for details.
22. Assessment of risks: Program-level risks were adequately identified and outlined in the PAD. They
    were presented in the form of a matrix and represented a summary of risk assessments undertaken
    during identification, pre-appraisal and appraisal missions to ASP-P1 participating countries. Even
    though the assessment of risks was comprehensive and included a broad range of mitigation measures
    in generic terms, an assessment of country-specific risks and mitigation measures was lacking. At the
    same time, it should be noted that it was difficult to assess country-specific risks in the absence of
    inventories of obsolete pesticides and CESAs, which were only planned to be undertaken during
    project implementation.
23. Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA): An assessment conducted by the Quality Assurance Group
    (QAG) on ASP-P1 in 2007, rated the QEA of the program moderately satisfactory. 33 The panel
    considered that despite the lengthy preparation time the project was approved prematurely, but
    concurred with the World Bank team that delaying Board presentation could have halted the hard-
    negotiated momentum among clients and partners and led to the partnership’s collapse. The panel
    further stated that more thought should have been given to the policy environment, that much of the


32
   For example, procuring a consulting firm to conduct the CESA and a service provider for the disposal of obsolete pesticides,
and overall preparation of the CESA were lengthy procedures that should have been allocated sufficient time.

     first year’s program should have been carried out prior to approval, and that the prospect for
     completing the approved project within the prescribed four-year-time frame was poor. 34

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
24. ASP-P1 was implemented at the program-level, and in ASP-P1 participating countries.
    Implementation was characterized by a complex partnership, substantial delays, and varying
    performance across the participating countries. In 2010, activities at the program-level were
    terminated due to several partners having exhausted their resources, and ASP-P1 continued to be
    implemented solely at the country-level.
25. Key factors that affected implementation and outcomes at the program level, which simultaneously
    translated into implementation delays at the country-level included:
     •   The envisaged governance structures as outlined in the PAD never became operational, and
         affected program implementation. The PCU, intended to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the
         implementation of ASP-P1 among the partners, and the ASP-Steering Committee (SC), intended
         to serve as advisory structure, were never established. 35 Instead, an ASP Implementation
         Committee (ASPIC) was created as a forum for partners to oversee program implementation. The
         partners (i.e., FAO, CLI, PAN-UK, WWF, and the World Bank) met regularly through a
         combination of virtual and face-to-face meetings. However, ASPIC was never formalized, which
         resulted in an unclear overall governance structure, and unclear roles and responsibilities,
         cumbersome decision-making processes and coordination, and a lack of an independent M&E
         function. Eventually, following the GEF failure to approve ASP-P2 in 2009, future initiatives in
         the areas of pesticide management were prepared and managed individually by partners, outside
         the program. 36
     •   Lack of clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and partnership principles significantly affected
         collaboration among partners, and translated into implementation delays at the country-level.
         o    Collaboration between FAO and the World Bank was challenging throughout
              implementation. The unclear roles of the two agencies, and their different organizational
              cultures, and internal procedures and requirements, translated into difficult discussions on
              standard document formats for project-related activities, delays and conflicting messages
              given to ASP-P1 participating countries, 37 exacerbating the already weak operational and
              technical capacity of the ASP-P1 participating countries. In 2008, FAO and the World Bank
              prepared and agreed on a memo, which defined exact roles, responsibilities, and procedures.
              While this memo improved collaboration between the two entities, disagreements remained. 38

34
    Further ratings included: Environmental aspects satisfactory; strategic relevance and approach, technical, financial and
economic aspects, poverty, gender and social development, fiduciary aspects, policy and institutional aspects, risk assessment
moderately satisfactory; and World Bank inputs and processes moderately satisfactory.
35
   NEPAD was intended to host the PCU, which did not materialize due to insufficient capacity.
36
   ASP-P2 was not approved by GEF due to a lack of resources at the end of a GEF replenishment cycle at the time, and poor
performance of ASP-P1.
37
   Standard documents and generic Terms of Reference (TORs) that had been agreed on in the context of the ASP-P1 Operational
Manual were reconsidered during implementation.
38
   For example, FAO and the World Bank had different views on the roles, the national government staff could play in disposal
operations: while FAO was in favor of including government staff to pursue cost-savings and increase national capacities, the
World Bank opposed their participation as health and safety risks were high.
                                                                10
              In 2010, difficulties subsided as FAO had exhausted its GEF funds and significantly
              minimized its support to the participating countries. To compensate for this, the World Bank
              increased its own support through technical and operational consultants funded by the MDTF.
         o    Delayed financial support obtained from CLI. In the beginning of implementation, it was
              planned that CLI funds would be channeled through the World Bank and/or FAO; however,
              shortly after, this was judged to be too complex and time-consuming. Instead, it was agreed
              that CLI would channel its contributions through direct financing agreements with recipient
              governments to support Technical Advisors for Disposal (TADs) as well as parallel contracts
              with hazardous waste management companies. This processes proved to be equally lengthy,
              ultimately further delaying the technical support and the financial contributions from CLI.
     •   World Bank institutional challenges contributed to program implementation delays. ASP-P1 was
         affected by a complex supervision arrangement within the World Bank. Since the program
         operated in countries from two different Regions (Africa and the Middle East and North Africa),
         different staff were involved. In addition, ASP-P1 was supervised by a program-level Task Team
         Leader (TTL) with full budget authority, a program-level co-TTL responsible for francophone
         ASP-P1 participating countries, and co-TTLs at the country-level with no budget authority.
         Particularly during the first three years, this arrangement translated into confusion among staff,
         partners, and Project Management Units (PMUs), cost overruns, and lengthy World Bank review
         and clearance processes of project-related documents. The program also experienced a high
         turnover in World Bank TTLs, 39 requiring transition periods for hand-over activities. Lastly, the
         World Bank’s internal systems were challenging for administration of an umbrella program with
         multiple sub-projects in more than one region, ultimately causing high transaction costs and
         inaccurate reporting. Efforts were undertaken to solve these system-related challenges, but
         without success. 40
     •   Insufficient fundraising efforts. Higher than estimated stocks of obsolete pesticides and
         contaminated soils together with the depreciation of the US dollar resulted in a funding gap for
         the ASP-P1 disposal component of at least US$10.6 million by 2010. 41 The lack of funds was
         subsequently mitigated by formally revising the PDO and associated indicators in four of the
         ASP-P1 participating countries where gaps existed. However, significant efforts to secure
         additional funds were not pursued by the partners and ultimately resulted in non-disposal of some
         of the inventoried obsolete pesticides and associated wastes.
     •   Procurement of disposal services represented a challenge in all ASP-P1 participating countries:
         Procurement of the highly specialized disposal services under World Bank procurement
         guidelines was a challenging and time-consuming process, which was exacerbated by weak
         national procurement capacity in almost all ASP-P1 participating countries (see Section 2.4 in the
         Technical Annexes).

39
   Approximately eight different TTLs led the program during preparation and supervision.
40
   The second and third set of country-level projects (ASP-P1 Mali, Morocco, Tanzania (P103189); and ASP-P1 Ethiopia
(P105711)) could not be processed under the project number which was used for ASP-P1 South Africa and Tunisia (P075776)
since each Board presentation required a separate number. Resulting recording and reporting challenges caused high
administrative transaction costs, and did not allow for a detailed expenditure overview at the program-level.

                                                                  11
     •   The Level 1 restructuring in four ASP-P1 countries positively affected implementation and
         allowed eventual PDO achievement in three countries: At mid-term review, it was recognized
         that the PDO was unlikely to be achieved by the original closing date. It was agreed to
         restructure ASP-P1 to better reflect country-specific environments. With the discovery of higher
         than budgeted stocks of obsolete pesticides, including associated wastes, it was decided to adopt a
         blended approach of disposal overseas and lower cost safeguarding in-country based on risk
         profiling of the inventories of pesticides and associated wastes, and the availability of satisfactory
         storage facilities (i.e., obsolete pesticides and higher risk stocks of heavily contaminated soils
         being disposed of overseas while lower risk stocks of associated wastes being safeguarded in-
         country). In addition, the original PDO had assumed no new accumulations of obsolete pesticides
         during the life of the project, which had been proven difficult to achieve in the context of
         agricultural intensification and food security concerns; therefore it was agreed to focus on
         developing a strategy for management of future accumulations. The restructuring, which was
         approved in 2011 for ASP-P1 Ethiopia, ASP-P1South Africa, ASP-P1 Tanzania, and ASP-P1
         Tunisia, eventually, allowed the countries (except ASP-P1 South Africa) to achieve targeted
         outcomes. 42
26. Learning Review of Regional Projects: A review conducted by the World Bank in 2009, rated the
    program moderately unsatisfactory. The review suggested to: (i) strengthen the program-level results
    framework and define country-specific ones; (ii) clarify roles and responsibilities among partners; and
    (iii) ensure low TTL turnover. 43 Furthermore, an independent evaluation of the program’s design and
    initial implementation, finalized in June 2009, stated that while the program’s partnership was valid,
    it also was a challenge. It stated that each of the specialized partners was characterized by differing
    organizational cultures, traditions, practices, procedures, and interests, and thus making a close
    collaboration challenging. The report emphasized the importance of finding common solutions on
    tasks and procedures. 44

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND
UTILIZATION
27. Overall M&E – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory.
28. M&E design – Rating Unsatisfactory: At the program-level, a complex M&E system, including a
    results framework, had been developed and was described in detail in the PAD and Operational
    Manual. However, the results framework and arrangements for results monitoring showed slight
    discrepancies, and PDO and associated indicators were vaguely formulated and did not cover all
    expected outcomes, having made it difficult to assess impacts. Moreover, M&E systems specific to
    the individual ASP-P1 participating countries were not prepared during preparation. Country-specific
    results frameworks, intended to be finalized by the TSU during project launch, were not prepared;

42
   For ASP-P1 Mali, the Level 1 restructuring was prepared but not approved because of the March 2012 coup d’état and
subsequent suspension of activities. For ASP-P1 Morocco, a Level 1 restructuring was not prepared because the project closed as
originally scheduled in 2010. For ASP-P1 South Africa, a Level 1 restructuring was approved but the late request for an
extension of the closing date, eventually prevented PDO achievement.

   AFRICA: 3A-Africa Stockpiles 1 MMT GEF (FY07) (P0103189): Learning Review of Regional Projects, December 11, 2009.
The assessment reviewed ASP-P1 on the basis of three of the participating countries –Mali, Morocco, and Tanzania
44
   For more detail see Independent Evaluation of Design and Initial Implementation of Africa Stockpiles Program – Evaluation
Report, May 2010, COWI – Document no. 69292-A-1
                                                              12
     only country-specific indicators linked to the different project components were developed, but these
     did not allow for adequate monitoring of project implementation progress as they focused on
     measuring outputs as opposed to progress towards project outcomes.
29. M&E implementation and utilization – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: ASP-P1 lacked
    systematic monitoring and reporting at the program-level throughout implementation, largely due to
    failure to establish the PCU, which among other tasks, was expected to coordinate the independent
    M&E of the program. The ASPIC attempted to monitor implementation of activities during its regular
    meetings, and the World Bank produced comprehensive annual consolidated technical and financial
    reports, which were disseminated to all partners and donors. However, these reports did not include
    systematic monitoring of implementation progress against the PDO and Intermediate Outcome
    Indicators; thus, overall progress (including the technical assistance and cross-cutting activities
    intended to be implemented by FAO and the NGOs) was difficult to assess.
30. At the country-level, until mid-term review, ASP-P1 participating countries operated without an
    M&E system in place. Eventually in 2009, the TSU provided the countries with an M&E tool,
    however, it was considered too complex by some of the countries, and introduced too late in the
    process to be used efficiently. Only in 2011, a results framework was introduced in four ASP-P1
    participating countries as part of their restructuring, which strengthened the M&E of the projects.

2.4 SAFEGUARDS AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
31. Safeguard compliance – Rating Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies: OP 4.01 on
    Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management. In accordance with the World Bank’s
    environmental and social policies and due to potentially significant adverse environmental impacts,
    ASP-P1 was classified as Category A, requiring full assessment. Environmental and social impacts
    were adequately assessed in a detailed Framework Environmental Assessment (FEA), as were their
    mitigation measures in an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). Formal
    country consultations were held in Addis Ababa (April 2002) to discuss details of the program’s
    design, which led to strong endorsement of the approach. 45 An Environmental and Social Assessment
    Synthesis Report was prepared based on these documents, adequately consulted in the ASP-P1
    participating countries, and disclosed to the World Bank’s InfoShop in March 2004. 46 The document
    provided guidance to the ASP-P1 participating countries on how to prepare country-specific
    safeguard instruments, including CESAs. For safeguard compliance at the country-level, see
    Technical Annexes.
32. ASP-P1 did not finance the procurement of pesticides or any other agricultural chemicals, nor did it
    lead to their increased use. The prevention component was initially designed to reduce reliance on
    pesticide use by promoting IPM, improving pesticide procurement and management systems and
    building capacity to prevent future accumulation of pesticides. To meet the World Bank's safeguards
    requirements on Pest Management, the program needed to promote IPM, improve pesticide
    management, and build capacity to address Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and pesticide
    management. ASP-P1 provided adequate training to all participating countries on promoting IPM, on

45
   The meeting brought together representatives from Botswana, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mali, Morocco,
Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tunisia and Tanzania.
46
   The same document was posted on the World Bank’s Public Information Center (PIC) on June 29, 2005, and distributed to the
Board on July 4, 2005.
                                                           13
     the adherence to the International Code of Conduct on pesticide distribution and use, and on using the
     Pesticide Stock Management System (PSMS) (all countries have access to the system and many have
     been using it beyond ASP). The project did not include country specific IPM activities, since they
     were outside the scope of the project. The activities proposed by ASP-P1, which were executed in all
     participating countries largely met the requirements of the pest management policy.
33. Financial Management compliance – Rating Satisfactory: As the signatory of all ASP-P1 GEF trust
    fund grant agreements, as well as the CIDA and MDTF administration agreements, the World Bank
    was adequately supervising the use of these funds through regular missions, review of progress and
    financial reports, audits, follow-up meetings, and regular contact as needed. The World Bank
    produced monthly financial reports, which could be accessed by authorized users via the World Bank
    donor portal, or upon request.
34. Procurement – Rating Not Applicable: The vast majority of ASP-P1 procurement activities was
    carried out by the ASP-P1 projects at the country-level and details can be found in Section 2.4 in the
    Technical Annexes. The ASP partners each used their own procurement procedures to procure
    necessary services, consultancies and pay for operating costs without any reported problems.

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
35. Following the disapproval of ASP-P2 for funding by GEF (due to a lack of resources at the end of a
    GEF replenishment cycle at the time and poor implementation performance of ASP-P1), CLI, FAO,
    PAN-UK and the World Bank began to individually develop and implement pesticide-related
    projects. These projects have been implemented outside the ASP-P1 framework, but have been using
    ASP guidelines, tools, and experience, more specifically:
     •   CLI has supported projects in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, and Nigeria, which safeguarded
         a total of 811 tonnes of high-risk obsolete pesticides and containers.
     •   FAO has implemented projects in other countries including Mozambique, and currently conducts
         a disposal and prevention project in several West African countries using GEF and other donor
         resources. 47
     •   The World Bank has been implementing a POPs project in Egypt, to help the government meet its
         obligations under the Stockholm Convention, and contribute to capacity. The World Bank is also
         currently discussing a possible follow-up project in Mali, which would focus on finalizing
         prevention and disposal activities.
     •   PAN-UK has been strengthening civil society in ASP-P1 countries through capacity building and
         training in health and ecotoxicology monitoring, and supporting prevention activities.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
36. Relevance – Rating High: The elimination of obsolete pesticide stocks remains a development
    priority. Rural communities cannot hope to advance if the soil and water, upon which their

47
  The project is conducted in Comité permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Sécheresse dans le Sahel (CILSS) member
countries such as Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, the Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal.
                                                            14
     livelihoods and health depend, are contaminated with pesticides, and urban populations cannot
     prosper if they are suffering from severe illnesses caused by pesticide poisoning.
37. National development strategies of ASP-P1 participating countries confirm the importance of
    eliminating hazardous waste (see Section 3.1 in Technical Annexes), as do World Bank priorities.
    The World Bank’s environment strategy from 2001, 48 which guided the institution’s work in this
    sector over the past decade highlighted pesticide residues as environmental and health risk factor, and
    today, the World Bank’s dual goal of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity is to
    be achieved in an environmentally sustainable manner, taking into account the impacts of climate
    change, environmental degradation, and ecosystem changes. 49 The World Bank’s current
    environment strategy places particular attention on helping countries to address environment-related
    health issues by supporting the creation of regulatory, economic and financial incentives to reduce
    pollution and increase clean production. 50 In Africa, the World Bank aims to ensure the availability of
    transparent environmental regulatory frameworks and competent institutions for monitoring
    environmental compliance. New analytical work at the regional level on hazardous waste, POPs, and
    the clean agenda is expected in the future.

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
38. This assessment is based on indicators captured in the results framework of the PAD. 51 In 2011,
    project activities in four of the ASP-P1 participating countries were restructured, as it was recognized
    that their design required revision to permit PDO achievement; the restructuring subsequently
    permitted PDO achievement in three ASP-P1 countries. These revisions were, however, not captured
    at the program-level, as the PDO, associated indicators, and components at the program-level were
    not formally restructured.
39. PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: This assessment takes account of one PDO
    Outcome Indicator, which was partly (37%) achieved. 52 It also takes account of ten Results
    Indicators, of which four were fully (100%), four partly (50-83%), and two not (0%) achieved.53 The
    assessment is framed by the program’s envisaged outcomes (i.e., risk reduction and pesticide
    disposal, improved pesticide management, and service delivery to ASP-P1 countries).
40. Risk reduction and pesticide disposal. The level of risk emanating from publicly held obsolete
    pesticides and associated wastes to nearby communities and critical natural resources was
    successfully determined and quantified through the completion of national inventories in five of the
    ASP-P1 participating countries evaluated in this ICR (Results Indicator #1 – 83%). 54 The information
    obtained (location and state of protection of the storage sites, contaminant type and quantity, and

Resilient World for All, January 4, 2012, World Bank
51
   The indicators presented in the results framework differ from those presented in the arrangements for results monitoring.
52
   The second PDO Outcome Indicator was not measurable; the third PDO Outcome Indicator was not taken into account as it
corresponded with the second PDO Outcome Indicators.
53
   Three additional Results Indicators were not taken into account as one was not applicable, one corresponded with a PDO
Outcome Indicator, and one had already been achieved prior to program approval.
54
   The originally planned countrywide inventory of publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste was not carried out in
ASP-P1 South Africa, as it was considered cost-ineffective in an environment where most stocks were held by private farmers
and not by the public sector (see Technical Annex IV for details).
                                                                15
    general condition of the stockpiles) provided the governments with the baseline data and knowledge
    necessary to inform eventual disposal of stockpiles.
41. Despite the program’s complexity, challenges, and poor initial performance, mitigation efforts
    eventually resulted in complete disposal of inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides in ASP-P1
    Ethiopia, ASP-P1 Tanzania, and ASP-P1 Tunisia, having significantly reduced risks to the
    environment and public health. A total of 3,164 of the inventoried 8,949 tonnes of publicly held
    obsolete pesticides and associated waste were eliminated overseas in an environmentally and
    technically sound manner (PDO Outcome Indicator #1 – 35%) 55 by contracted specialized companies
    and in line with national and international regulations (Results Indicator #3 – 50%). 56 In South Africa,
    where obsolete pesticides were predominantly privately held, ASP-P1 succeeded, using CLI funding,
    in eliminating obsolete pesticides in one pilot province, totaling approximately 100 tonnes.
42. Improved pesticide management. The original target of not accumulating new obsolete pesticide
    stockpiles and associated waste was not measurable. At appraisal, it was estimated that approximately
    4,750 tonnes of obsolete pesticides were scattered across the ASP-P1 countries; inventories conducted
    during implementation in the ASP-P1 participating countries revealed the existence of approximately
    800 additional tonnes of obsolete pesticides. However, it is difficult to assess whether further
    stockpiles were accumulated during program implementation or whether the difference resulted from
    inaccurate estimates at the time of appraisal (PDO Outcome Indicator #2 – N/A).
43. The program was also successful in raising awareness on the health and environmental hazards of
    pesticides and encouraging safe pesticide handling through various outreach activities across ASP-P1
    participating countries. An overarching communication strategy was developed by WWF, together
    with a communication strategy toolkit. On the basis of these tools and with support from WWF,
    national communication strategies were subsequently developed by all; however, they were only
    implemented by four ASP-P1 participating countries (Results Indicator #11 – 67%). Overall, WWF
    and PAN-UK actively participated in project activities related to awareness raising, monitoring, and
    communication (Results Indicator #10 – 100%).
44. Service delivery to ASP-P1 countries. The TSU, hosted by FAO, was fully funded and staffed shortly
    after the program became effective (Results Indicator #6 – 100%). However, it should be noted that
    the technical assistance the ASP-P1 participating countries were expected to receive, was not
    provided to the extent foreseen in the PAD, particularly in the areas of M&E, and preparation of
    contracts (e.g., preparation of technical specification and carrying out technical evaluations for project
    consultants and contractors). This lack of technical support was compensated with technical experts,
    temporarily funded by the World Bank, and the recruitment of TADs financed by CLI. A survey,
    specifically targeted at measuring ASP-P1 participating countries’ satisfaction with services received
    from partners, was not conducted (Results Indicator #7 – 0%).
45. The program did not succeed in launching ASP-P2. In April 2009, the World Bank and FAO jointly
    submitted a funding proposal to the GEF for US$20.7 million in support of ASP-P2. The second

55
   Only eliminated obsolete pesticides and associated waste stockpiles are included. The stocks that were safeguarded (as
alternative to elimination following the Level 1 restructuring in four ASP-P1 participating countries), and those that were held
privately in the case of ASP-P1 South Africa, are not included in the assessment of PDO Outcome Indicator #1.
56
   Disposal contracts were completed for ASP-P1 Ethiopia, ASP-P1 Mali, ASP-P1 Tanzania, and ASP-P1 Tunisia, but only
implemented in ASP-P1 Ethiopia, ASP-P1 Tanzania, and ASP-P1 Tunisia. In South Africa, privately held obsolete pesticides
were disposed of overseas in line with national and international regulations, however, with co-financing provided by CLI.
                                                                16
     series of projects of the program was planned to be implemented in 22 additional African countries,
     and the proposal reflected recommendations obtained through the independent evaluation previously
     mentioned. However, ASP-P2 was not accepted by GEF due to a lack of resources at the end of a
     replenishment cycle at the time, and the poor performance of ASP-P1; instead, FAO and the World
     Bank were encouraged to submit funding requests for individual country or regional ASP projects
     once GEF funds became available (Results Indicator #8 – 50%). See Section 2.5 for details.
46. The PCU did not become operational due to a lack of capacity within NEPAD, the entity that had
    been selected to host the unit (Results Indicator #13 – 0%). Consequently, ASP-P1 was not successful
    in strengthening regional capacity for management of future program-related activities.
47. To inform sustainable decision-making in the ASP-P1 participating countries, a study on disposal
    technology options was prepared by WWF in June 2008. The study provided information on the
    treatment and disposal options of obsolete pesticides and associated wastes. Furthermore, a study on
    locust control issues was prepared by FAO as part of the Red Locust Control Program (Results
    Indicator #9 – 100%).
48. While implementation was not systematically monitored at the program-level, the World Bank
    produced technical and financial reports on a yearly basis. These reports provided annual overviews
    of implementation progress achieved by the program and ASP-P1 participating countries, and were
    shared with partners and donors (Results Indicator #12 – 100%).

3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
49. ASP-P1 aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effects of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities by reducing
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement,
    and, thus is also rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.4 EFFICIENCY
50. Efficiency – Rating Low: This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic data to
    support this rating are scarce. At appraisal, neither an economic nor a financial analysis was
    undertaken for ASP-P1 at the program or at the country-level due to non-measurable benefits of
    reducing the risk of environmental contamination. A lack of reliable baseline data in combination
    with controversial aspects related to the valuation of human life and natural resources did not permit a
    cost-benefit analysis. For GEF purposes, the preparation of ASP-P1 at the program-level included an
    incremental cost analysis for achieving global benefits to address the issue of obsolete pesticides in
    the participating countries.
51. In general, ASP-P1 resource use could not be accurately evaluated because: (i) No accurate
    quantitative data were available on the financial and human resources invested in the program’s
    preparation by any of the partners; 57 (ii) with an envisaged PCU that never became operational, there
    was no M&E of the resources spent by FAO available to the World Bank, and thus no accurate data
    available; and (iii) the World Bank’s budgeting system made it difficult to adequately capture

57
  See Independent Evaluation of Design and Initial Implementation of Africa Stockpiles Program – Evaluation Report, May
2010, COWI – Document no. 69292-A-1.
                                                          17
     allocated funds and associated expenditures of a regional program with sub-projects, ultimately
     causing high transaction costs and inaccurate reporting. In addition, efficiency of capacity building
     and prevention activities is difficult to quantify due to time disconnect between project support and
     actual results.
52. When specifically considering efficiency of the disposal component, the unit cost for disposal
    (US$/tonne disposed) is used for measuring efficiency. Based on approximately US$15 million spent
    on the disposal of 3,240 tonnes of obsolete pesticides between 1990 and 2004, it was estimated that
    300-900 tonnes could be disposed of per annum at the cost of US$3,400 per ton. At closing, 3,164
    tonnes of obsolete pesticides and associated waste had been disposed of at the cost of approximately
    US$3,103 per tonne, which represents a slightly lower cost than originally anticipated. 58
    Nevertheless, efficiency is rated low because, while ASP-P1 disbursed 75% of GEF resources, only
    37% of inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste were disposed of at
    program closing.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
53. Overall outcome – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: On the basis of the program’s relevance
    (high), efficiency (low), and PDO achievement (moderately unsatisfactory), the overall outcome is
    rated moderately unsatisfactory. This rating takes into account that the program’s preparation and
    implementation were accompanied by substantial challenges, but also suffered from shortcomings
    that significantly affected the envisaged outcomes. However, it should be highlighted that despite the
    program’s complexity, challenges, and poor initial performance, mitigation efforts, most notably a
    Level 1 restructuring, eventually permitted PDO achievement in three of the ASP-P1 participating
    countries. Risks to the environment and public health were significantly reduced through complete
    disposal of inventoried obsolete pesticides in ASP-P1 Ethiopia, ASP-P1 Tanzania, and ASP-P1
    Tunisia. Table 3.1 briefly provides an overview of PDO achievements at the individual country-
    level; for details, see Technical Annexes.

   The calculation takes disposed amounts of obsolete pesticides and associated GEF resources spent in three ASP-P1 countries
into account: (i) ASP-P1 Ethiopia disposed of 450 tonnes at a cost of US$1.70 million; (ii) ASP-P1 Tanzania disposed of 967
tonnes at a cost of US$5.07 million; and ASP-P1 Tunisia disposed of 1,730 tonnes at a cost of US$3.05 million. Costs include
those associated with repackaging, transport, and incineration of obsolete pesticides and other related activities such as for
example the inventory, safeguarding efforts, associated studies, and advisory services.

3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
54. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development: The disposal of obsolete pesticides and
    associated wastes had a direct positive impact on poor and farming communities, species and
    ecosystems, located in proximity to the identified sites. Baseline data on affected populations, species,
    and ecosystems was not conducted at appraisal; exact impacts are therefore difficult to measure.
55. Institutional change/strengthening: Since the PCU had not become operational, institutional change
    and strengthening occurred at the country level: (i) the regulatory and legal frameworks for pesticide
    management were improved in Ethiopia, Mali, Morocco, Tanzania, and Tunisia; (ii) the logistics of
    hazardous waste transportation have been internalized in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Tunisia, and the
    knowledge gained can inform future disposal activities; (iii) the experience and skills gained in
    managing the project can be applied to other projects and subsequently contribute to success; (iv) the
    experience gained in Ethiopia, Mali, South Africa, Tanzania, and Tunisia, in preparing social and
    environmental impact assessments and management plans; (v) knowledge gained on sound pesticide
    management through the various training courses all participating countries participated in (see
    Section 3.6 in Technical Annexes).
56. Other unintended outcomes and impacts: The private sector through CLI provided valuable
    technical support to ASP-P1 Ethiopia, Mali, South Africa, and Tanzania through the funding of
    international TADs. CLI further funded the disposal of stocks in Ethiopia, South Africa, and
    Tanzania; and played a key role in mobilizing South Africa’s crop protection industry to forming a
    public-private partnership with the government to dispose of obsolete pesticide stocks.

3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
57. Beneficiary surveys were not carried out. ICR missions, including stakeholder workshops were
    carried out in Ethiopia and Tanzania (see Section 3.7 of corresponding Technical Annexes). All ASP-
    P1 participating countries provided completion reports, except ASP-P1 Morocco; information
    provided therein was incorporated in this ICR.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

58. The risk to development outcome varies across ASP-P1 participating countries and has been assessed
    at the country-level. In Ethiopia and Tanzania, the risk is rated moderate and confined to the re-
    accumulation of obsolete pesticides, and a potential weakening of the governments’ commitment to
    sustaining and building on the projects’ outcomes; however, if improved legislations will be enacted,
    the governments are well positioned to sustainably manage and reduce the re-accumulation of

59
  Overall weighted outcomes have been calculated by weighting the separate outcome ratings in proportion to the share of actual
grant disbursements made in the periods before and after approval of the revision. See Section 3.5 in Technical Annexes for
details.
                                                            19
     obsolete pesticides. In Mali, the development outcome risk is rated high due to Mali's post-conflict
     and transitional situation, its strong focus on agricultural intensification, and the relatively low
     priority obsolete stock elimination is receiving in the country's recovery plans. In Morocco, risk is
     also rated high due to the government’s lack of capacity and resources to safeguard and dispose of its
     stocks. In South Africa, the risk is rated moderate given the uncertainty about the government and the
     private industry to approve and implement the newly developed Integrated Waste Management Plan
     (IWMP) to collect and dispose of both private and public stocks. Finally, Tunisia’s development
     outcome risk is rated low based on the government’s demonstrated commitment and capacity, as well
     as the improved legislation for pesticide management. See Section 4 of the Technical Annexes for
     further detail.

5. ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
59. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The
    World Bank together with the other partners conducted numerous preparatory missions to all
    participating countries, which resulted in considerable background information, project plans and
    candid analysis of issues and challenges. FM and procurement assessments were also adequately
    conducted for all countries (see Technical Annexes for details), as well as for WWF, PAN-UK and
    PAN-Africa, which were to be recipients of DGF and MDTF funds during project implementation.
    However, although the PADs were comprehensive and described in detail the envisaged activities at
    the program-level, they were lacking country-specific details, most notably country-specific results
    frameworks.
60. Preparation at the program-level was, lengthy due to difficulties in finding common agreement among
    partners on the program’s design and implementation arrangements (see Section 2.1 for details). The
    World Bank’s authority during these negotiations was undermined by a high turnover in TTLs. The
    challenging partnership-building process ultimately resulted in the PADs giving insufficient attention
    to specifying and defining the collaboration including oversight, and roles and responsibilities of each
    partner involved, which significantly affected program- and country-level implementation (see
    Section 2.1 for details).
61. Quality of World Bank supervision – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Issues caused by the lack
    of a PCU and unclear definition of the partnership arrangement at the program-level, dominated the
    first three years of program implementation, and equally affected project implementation at the
    country-level. Lengthy discussions between FAO and the World Bank on standard formats and
    guidelines, which ASP-P1 participating countries needed for project implementation, consequently
    delayed implementation progress. 60 In 2008, corrective action in form of a jointly written memo,
    which defined exact roles, responsibilities, and procedures, alleviated some of the difficulties;
    however, disagreements remained on a few issues (see Section 2.2 for details).
62. Since efforts to create an interim PCU secretariat had failed, the World Bank team proactively
    substituted for a number of the PCU tasks in order to ensure satisfactory program implementation. In

60
   Standard documents, Terms of Reference (TORs), and procurement guidelines, required for project implementation and
originally agreed on in the context of the ASP-P1 Operational Manual were reconsidered during implementation.
                                                               20
     addition, the World Bank’s internal implementation arrangements were challenging, due to the need
     to bridge two World Bank administrative regions, a program level TTL and multiple co-TTLs, which
     finally often translated into lengthy review clearance processes of project-related documents. 61 Lastly,
     the World Bank’s internal systems provided challenges for administering an umbrella program with
     multiple sub-projects in more than one region, ultimately causing high transaction costs and
     inaccurate reporting. Efforts were undertaken to solve these system-related challenges, but without
     success.
63. Following mid-term reviews in 2008 and 2009, the World Bank team increased its efforts to
    effectively address the program’s implementation delays and maximize the likelihood of program
    success in ASP-P1 participating countries. Corrective actions included increased and more targeted
    operational and technical support through consultants, extension of closing dates, and reallocation of
    existing GEF funds to maximize outcomes. Project design weaknesses were addressed through the
    restructuring of four of the ASP-P1 participating countries, by both revising targets and better
    aligning project activities with country-specific environments (for details see Section 5.1 in the
    Technical Annexes).
64. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The program suffered from
    shortcomings in preparation and design as well as from a PCU that did not become operational, which
    affected implementation at the program- and subsequently country-level, evident through substantial
    implementation delays. However, it must be acknowledged that the program was complex and
    particularly challenging in its implementation; and despite its complexity, challenges, and poor initial
    performance, the World Bank took important actions to improve implementation progress at the
    country-level, and eventually succeeded in supporting three participating ASP-P1 countries to achieve
    envisaged outcomes.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
65. Overall Borrower performance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: Borrower performance at the
    country-level varied across participating ASP-P1 countries; the rating represents an average. Table
    5.1 provides an overview of borrowers’ individual performance. For details on performance at the
    government and implementing agency-level, refer to Section 5.2 of the individual Technical Annexes.

   The program was affiliated to two Regions (Africa and the Middle East and North Africa) with different procedures and
regulations, and the supervision arrangement consisted of a program-level TTL with full and a co-TTL with no budget authority,
which often caused confusion among staff. The program also experienced a high turnover in TTLs, requiring transition periods
for hand-over activities.
                                                               21
6. LESSONS LEARNED

66. Lessons learned that were drawn at the program-level and could serve as guidance for similar
    programs in the future include the following:
   •   The World Bank is not presently well equipped to handle multi-regional and multi-country
       programs. The World Bank's internal systems are not geared for administering an umbrella
       program with multiple sub-projects in more than one region. Possible World Bank support for
       similar approaches in the future should weigh transaction costs and efficiency constraints in
       designing regional programs. Unless strong justification is provided for designing the program
       with country-specific - or at least region-specific - projects should be considered. Furthermore,
       the World Bank's internal processing arrangements for regional programs should be made
       sufficiently flexible to accommodate their characteristics and needs rather than applying coding
       and budget systems that hinder successful implementation.
   •   For multi-stakeholder projects, formalized and defined roles and responsibilities for all
       partners and their collaboration need to be agreed and operationalized prior to project
       effectiveness. ASP-P1 was a complex program, which depended on close collaboration and
       cooperation among several partners and drawing upon their comparative expertise in pesticide
       management, project design, implementation, communications, and monitoring and evaluation.
       To ensure clarity on, and commitment to, each entity’s roles and responsibilities, together with
       guidance on how the partnership should function, should be defined and agreed on during project
       preparation. Concise time and budget bound Terms of Reference (TORs) for all partners, and a
       clearly defined oversight and coordination entity would have greatly improved project design and
       implementation.
   •   ASP-P1 would have benefited from a design that (i) defined envisaged outcomes and PDOs at
       the program-level, and (ii) individually-tailored PDOs at the country-level. The uniform
       approach ASP-P1 applied to all participating countries caused significant delays and transactions
       costs, and is not desirable. Future programs should place emphasis on tailoring individual country
       projects to the country-specific environments.
   •   The dimension of the task should be carefully determined, and projects should be sufficiently
       well-prepared before implementation. Project activities such as a national obsolete pesticides
       inventory and a CESA are lengthy processes but crucial for determining the dimension of the
       disposal task ahead. Ideally, these activities should not be conducted during implementation;
       rather, they should either be conducted during preparation, or during a first implementation phase,
       followed by a second that comprises adequately timed and budgeted disposal activities. This
       could include an approach under which the inventory and the Country Environmental and Social
       Assessment (CESA) are prepared simultaneously.
   •   While it is important to determine the dimension of the task before implementation, it is equally
       important to develop a flexible implementation approach. With the volume of obsolete
       pesticides to be disposed of being a shifting target, especially in larger and infrastructure-poor
       countries, it is important to develop a flexible implementation approach that can compensate for
       actual quantities that are larger or smaller than those estimated at the time of appraisal.


                                                   22
    •   The program's initial assumption that no further obsolete pesticides would be accumulated was
        unrealistic in view of food security concerns and ongoing agricultural intensification.
        Prevention activities are crucial for any future operations and need to be sufficiently reflected
        in the project’s PDO and associated indicators. Prevention activities were not pursued to the
        extent disposal activities were implemented, mainly as a result of not having been sufficiently
        reflected in the indicators.
    •   Realistic and clear indicators and preparation of a reasonable results framework are of
        paramount importance. The PDO and associated indicators did not cover all expected outcomes
        that were expected to be achieved. In several instances they were vaguely formulated, making it
        difficult to assess progress and outcomes.
    •   Project plans should recognize the complexity of project tasks. Project activities such as a
        national inventory and a CESA proved to be lengthy processes. Since their completion was a
        requirement for disposal activities to begin, and the majority of funds was expected to be
        disbursed during disposal activities, disbursement remained low for most of project
        implementation. To avoid low disbursement levels being considered as low performance, project
        implementation plans and schedules need to be realistic.
    •   The participation of adequate technical experts is crucial during program preparation and
        implementation. Preparation of ASP-P1 would have benefitted from more specialized technical
        staff involvement, and, as confirmed by ASP-P1 sub-projects in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Tunisia,
        technical advisors during disposal preparation activities proved to be very valuable and
        significantly contributed to successful disposal.
    •   Knowledge exchange between participating countries of a regional project should be
        facilitated. Preparation of the CESA in the individual participating ASP-P1 countries was a
        lengthy and complex task; the program would have benefitted from a central Country
        Environmental and Social Assessment (CESA) advisor. Furthermore, the procurement process
        could have been streamlined to contract disposal and CESA consultants for all countries to gain
        efficiency.
    •   It is important to comprehensively assess the capacity of African regional organizations before
        designating them as implementing agencies for donor-funded programs. The PCU did not
        become operational due to a lack of capacity within NEPAD, the entity that had been selected to
        host the unit. Consequently, ASP-P1 was not successful in strengthening regional capacity for
        management of future program-related activities.

                                           • To inform sustainable decision-making in the ASP-P1 participating
                                             countries, a study on disposal technology options was prepared by WWF in
                                             June 2008. The study provided information on the treatment and disposal
                                             options of obsolete pesticides and associated waste (Results Indicator #9 –
                                             100%).

                                             the results were used to develop a toolkit for national NGOs to advocate and
                                             lobby for strengthening national policies and raising awareness for
                                             alternatives to chemical pesticides for locust control.

8.7 SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR AND COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
6. The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Republic of Mali, the Republic of South Africa, the
   United Republic of Tanzania, and the Republic of Tunisia submitted completion reports; messages
   contained therein were integrated into this ICR, and associated Technical Annexes (see Technical
   Annexes for details). ASP-P1 Morocco did not submit a completion report.
7. Comments on the draft ICR were received from the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the
   Republic of Mali, the United Republic of Tanzania, and the Republic of Tunisia, and
   incorporated/outlined accordingly. See Section 8.7 of the Technical Annexes for details.

8.8 COMMENTS OF CO-FINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS
8. The draft ICR was shared with all co-financiers and other partners/stakeholders. Comments on the
   program-level ICR were received from CLI, FAO, FFEM, WWF, and the European Commission.
   Comments and edits were incorporated accordingly and/or are outlined in the following. For
   comments received from FFEM, see Section 8.8 in the ASP-P1 Tunisia Technical Annex.
9. CLI: All suggested edits received from CLI were incorporated.
10. FAO: Comments received from FAO were incorporated. Additional comments included:
    a. On the program’s design having given insufficient attention to specifying and defining the
       partnership arrangement, and the roles and responsibilities of each partners involved (paragraph
       20): There was a TOR for the PCU developed but never approved by the World Bank – all other
       partners agreed.
    b. On the collaboration between FAO and the World Bank (paragraph 25): There was a period when
       there was duplication of roles and advice to countries under one of the World Bank TTLs. This
       resulted in a breakdown of trust.
    c. On the delayed financial support obtained from CLI (paragraph 25): FAO had to provide this role
       which was unbudgeted until these people were hired again blurring the lines of responsibility as
                                                    30
        FAO was not supposed to provide this support as defined by WB in the discussions leading up to
        project implementation.
   d. On the service delivery to ASP-P1 countries (paragraph 44): This statement is unacceptable and
      must be changed. The TSU was actively prevented from providing country-level support in the
      project design. We developed the guidance to countries for the CESA with the World Bank TTL
      and countries were trained in its developed although this was not foreseen in our project
      description. Training was also provided to countries on development of disposal tenders. The
      paragraph implies the TSU was supposed to do these activities when in fact we were told by the
      WB that this would be a conflict of interest and were actively prevented from providing this
      support. From the 2001 meeting in London we proposed the placement of chief technical advisors
      in each country as per FAO systems to manage the projects with the country teams. This was
      rejected. Crop Life offered to provide technical advisors and these took an age to materialize. The
      Bank sent in Safeguards consultants to provide this support and confused the countries as they
      were offering advice which was contradictory to FAO. This paragraph is not correct. The
      technical assistance provided by the TSU was as expected in our project document. If it did not
      reflect the support envisaged in the WB document then your document was incorrect.
         o   World Bank response: Paragraph 44 was modified to partly reflect the above comment.
             However, in general, the description of Component 2 outlined in Annex 4 of the PAD
             (Report No: 32232-MNA) was taken as basis for this ICR’s evaluation.
   e. On no available data regarding FAO resources spent (paragraph 51): Again not accurate. Our
      reports were sent to GEF for our separate grant.
   f.   Overall: The main issue was that this was never a true regional project with the associated
        economies of scale or synergies. It was a multi-country project in a single region (or two regions
        in the case of the Bank). The issue was compounded by a lack of mutual acceptance of roles and
        responsibilities and a lack of understanding as to the mode of operation of implementation of WB
        country activities by FAO which made the operation of the TSU as designed impossible. This was
        never really understood and no point was any adjustment made to compensate.
11. WWF: Suggested edits received from WWF were incorporated. Additional comments included:
   a. Component 3 on knowledge management was not implemented to the end as the CCAME
      effectively stopped being operational once funding for its activities stopped in December 2010.
   b. Inadequate resources were provided to WWF and PAN to execute the capacity building activities
      for NGOs.
12. Development and Cooperation - European Commission: Comments received from the European
    Commission included:
   a. The project closed in June 2013, addresses the issue of obsolete pesticides by developing and
      implementing disposal and prevention activities through the establishment of a new partnership
      between African countries and their collaborating partners (including the World Bank, the United
      Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the pesticide industry represented by
      CropLife International (CLI), the Pesticides Action Network (PAN) in the UK and Africa (PAN-
      UK and PAN-Africa, respectively) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)).



                                                   31
b. The project was co-funded among others from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (established by the
   EU together with Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland) but it is not clear to us which component
   was supported by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (supported by EU) through parallel financing.
c. The report refers to a lot of results indicators (13) which are analyzed individually but not in
   correlation with each other’s.
d. The ICR says: “The elimination of obsolete pesticide stocks remains a development priority.
   Rural communities cannot hope to advance if the soil and water, upon which their livelihoods and
   health depend, are contaminated with pesticides, and urban populations cannot prosper if they are
   suffering from severe illnesses caused by pesticide poisoning”.
e. However, though technical support and strategic studies have been delivered and the NGOs
   participation was 100%, unfortunately the projects have shown unsatisfactory results concerning
   mainly the disposal implementation activities which are development priorities. Only 35% of the
   inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste were disposed in four (out of
   6) ASP-P1 countries and the disposal contracts have been implemented only in three countries
   because country counter parts have not been found (the accomplishment of these targets is
   considered of 50%).
f.   Therefore, we are very much concerned on the unsatisfactory results in implementation of
     activities on the field which is affecting not only the objective of the project, but the development
     of the concerned countries.
g. A deeper and correlated analysis of these indicators may reveal other aspects/conclusions that
   could be useful in future at least for the implementation of other projects, such as the
   effectiveness of technical support (including the quality of the studies), role and effectiveness of
   the participating NGOs, etc.

F. Results Framework Analysis - At project approval, no country-specific result framework existed;
only seven Project Development Objective (PDO) Indicators were defined. Following a Level 1
Restructuring in June 2011, a country-specific results framework was introduced. The original seven PDO
Indicators were revised and reduced to two PDO Indicators, and in addition, seven Intermediate Outcome
Indicators were introduced.
                                                  41
Project Development Objective (PDO) – as presented in the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust
Fund Grant Agreement: 65 To assist the recipient in: a) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete
pesticide stocks and associated waste; and b) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related
risks.
Revised PDO – as presented in the Level 1 Restructuring of June 2011 (Report No: 62794-ET): To assist
the Federal Republic of Ethiopia to eliminate and/or safeguard inventoried publicly held obsolete
pesticide stocks and associated waste, and develop a strategy for sustainable management of future
accumulations.

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) - as presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD (Report
No: 39901-ET): Reduction of the effects of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) on the global
environment.
Revised GEO – Not Applicable

(a) PDO Indicators – Original PDO Indicators as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement are
assessed against achievements realized at the time of the project’s Level 1 restructuring in June 2011;
revised PDO Indicators are assessed against achievements realized at project closing in June 2013.

   The PDO, indicators, and components that are stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) slightly differ from those stated
in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement. This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented in the
GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s implementation activities.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1. Country background: Ethiopia’s economy is primarily based on agriculture. At project approval in
   June 2007, the sector contributed around 46% to Ethiopia’s GDP and employed over 80% of the labor
   force. 68 Ethiopia’s highlands had been highly fertile, enabling the country to support a large
   population, but long-term output had been threatened by inefficient land tenure, soil degradation, and
   recurrent droughts. Pests and crop diseases further contributed to crop yield losses; at project
   appraisal, the average crop loss due to pests was estimated to be between 30% and 40%, annually. 69
2. Sector background: Although pesticide use in Ethiopia had been historically poor due to low
   economic performance and the presence of smallholder agricultural systems, efforts to increase and
   diversify food production since the late 1970s had resulted in an increased use of pesticides in the
   agricultural sector. Of the total pesticides imported, commercial farmers were estimated to have used
   about 80%, mainly on cotton; the remaining 20% were used for small-scale farming, household and
   industrial purposes, and disease vector control. Malaria had been prevented and controlled for several
   decades with the application of pesticides such as Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). In
   addition, Ethiopia was one of the eastern African countries that suffered from migratory pests such as
   desert locust and armyworm outbreaks; the ensuing mobilization of international assistance to combat
   the pests often resulted in excessive emergency prevention stocks.
3. The accumulation of obsolete pesticides was aggravated by inappropriate storage conditions caused
   by poor storage facilities, poor management capacities of the stocks, unavailability of required
   application equipment, and a lack of trained staff on pesticide stock management. Product bans,
   unsuitable products or packaging, donation or purchase in excess of need, further contributed to this
   accumulation. Various obsolete, banned, and unwanted pesticides were accumulated throughout
   Ethiopia carrying significant environmental and public health risks.
4. Institutional background: At appraisal, the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) was the
   designated national authority for the Stockholm, Rotterdam, Basel, and Bamako Conventions, which
   had all been ratified by the Government of Ethiopia. However, by the nature of the mandate, 70 EPA’s
   role and responsibilities had focused on policymaking, establishment of system-based standards and
   development of partnership with sector ministries. Consequently, the Ministry of Agriculture and
   Rural Development (MoARD), through its Crop Protection Department (CPD), had overall
   operational responsibility for cleanup and remediation operations.
5. Actions taken: Towards the end of the 1990s, a series of stockpile safeguarding and disposal
   operations was initiated, including an operation that was launched in 1999, and implemented with
   technical support of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and financial support of the United
   States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Netherlands and Sweden. 71 1,500 tonnes
   of obsolete pesticides were successfully disposed of under the project’s first phase (FAO-I); the

     second phase (FAO-II) started in 2004, and allowed disposal of an additional 1,100 tonnes with funds
     provided by Belgium, Japan, Finland and CropLife International (CLI). Project activities further
     included development and enforcement of pesticide policies, implementation of Integrated Pest
     Management (IPM) and Integrated Vector Management (IVM), and capacity building. ASP-P1-
     Ethiopia intended to complement these operations by financing the disposal of remaining 400 tonnes
     of obsolete pesticides that had not been disposed of under FAO-II as originally planned, but stored in
     two locations in Addis Ababa.
6. In preparation of ASP-P1, the Government of Ethiopia had initiated preparatory activities under its
   National Implementation Plan (NIP). 72 These activities included the completion of a preliminary
   inventory of obsolete pesticides across the country, which had identified over 900 sites with obsolete
   chemicals and contaminated soils. Very large quantities of empty containers and contaminated spray
   equipment were also found.
7. Rationale for World Bank assistance: Please refer to Section 1.1 in the program-level ICR.
8. Higher-level objectives: As noted in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the project intended to
   contribute to Ethiopia’s national development strategy 73 in the areas of agriculture and rural
   development, public health, poverty alleviation, and environmental protection. In particular, the
   project aimed to: (i) improve the quality of life in poor communities, by reducing environmental
   health risks; (ii) improve environmental protection; and (iii) enhance the capacity of the agricultural
   sector to better manage crop pests. Contributing to international efforts to eliminate Persistent
   Organic Pollutants (POPs), improving management of toxic chemicals, and promote alternatives to
   pesticide usage that include IPM and IVM represented further objectives.

1.2 ORIGINAL PDO AND INDICATORS
9. The Project Development Objective (PDO), indicators, and components that are described in the
   ASP-P1 Ethiopia PAD 74 slightly differ from those described in the associated GEF Trust Fund Grant
   Agreement. 75 This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented in the
   GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s
   implementation activities; in addition and as outlined in Section 1.3 and 1.5, changes under a Level 1
   restructuring were introduced to the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement.
10. ASP-P1 Ethiopia’s original PDO as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement: 76 To
    assist the recipient in: a) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and
    associated waste; and b) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.
11. At appraisal, only an overall ASP-P1 results framework had been prepared (see program-level ICR);
    results frameworks for the individual ASP-P1 countries, including Ethiopia, were intended to be

1.3 REVISED PDO AND INDICATORS
12. The PDO and indicators for ASP-P1 Ethiopia were revised through a Level I restructuring on June 30,
    2011. 78 The original PDO implied that all inventoried obsolete pesticides would be eliminated. With
    the discovery of higher than estimated stocks, including associated waste, it was decided to adopt a
    blended approach of disposal overseas and lower cost safeguarding in-country based on risk profiling
    of the inventoried pesticides and associated waste, and availability of satisfactory storage facilities
    (i.e. obsolete pesticides and higher risk stocks of heavily contaminated soils being disposed of
    overseas while lower risk stocks of associated waste being safeguarded in-country). In addition, the
    original PDO assumed no new accumulations of obsolete pesticides during the life of the project,
    which had been proven difficult to achieve in the context of agricultural intensification and food
    security concerns. Therefore, it was agreed that the project would instead focus on developing a
    strategy for management of future accumulations.

14. ASP-P1 Ethiopia PDO indicators were reduced in number and revised to focus on the revised project
    objective. In addition, a country-specific result framework was introduced for effective monitoring
    and evaluation of project progress (see Data Sheet).
15. ASP-P1 Ethiopia’s revised PDO Indicators: (i) Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides and
    associated waste disposed of and/or safeguarded by the end of the project; and (ii) a strategy for
    sustainable management of future accumulations adopted by the Steering Committee by the end of
    the project.

    components (outlined in Table 1.2). The table also shows revisions that were made through a Level I
    restructuring on June 30, 2011. 80

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
18. ASP-P1 Ethiopia was prepared between 2001 and 2007, as part of preparatory activities at the
    program-level. It took more than five years from GEF eligibility in July 2001, and more than four
    years from concept note in July 2002 to project approval by the Board in June 2007. 82
19. Soundness of background analysis: Project preparation was conducted in close collaboration
    between the government and the World Bank, FAO, and CLI, through joint missions, and knowledge
    exchange. Considerable background analysis was undertaken, including a procurement capacity
    assessment in 2004, which appropriately recommended a procurement capacity-enhancement plan
    and a comprehensive procurement–training program. A Financial Management (FM) capacity
    assessment was also undertaken at appraisal concluding that an FM system would need to be in place
    prior to effectiveness. Overall, the government had acquired substantial experience through
    implementation of the above-mentioned project; 83 and was considered well prepared for pesticide
    disposal by the World Bank at appraisal in 2004, and by FAO in 2005. 84
20. Key preparatory inputs such as the PAD and to a lesser extent the Operational Manual, however only
    broadly laid out the project’s plans; detailed country-specific information regarding Monitoring and
    Evaluation (M&E), risks and risk mitigation measures particularly regarding procurement, and FM,
    were missing. As noted above, the government had acquired substantial experience through
    implementation of a previous project, 85 but no lessons learned seem to have been integrated and used
    during preparation.

82
   The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy partnership building/negotiation process at the program-level resulting from
the complex implementation arrangement and project design (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR).

21. Assessment of project design: The project’s design (as for all ASP-P1 participating countries) was
    preconfigured at the program-level, and did not reflect any country-specific modifications or lessons
    learned from previous projects executed in Ethiopia. Design weaknesses at the program-level that
    translated into implementation delays at the country level, including ASP-P1 Ethiopia, are outlined in
    Section 2.1 of the program-level ICR.
22. Government commitment: The Government of Ethiopia had shown significant commitment towards
    the objectives of the ASP, particularly through the implementation of a previous similar project. In
    addition, the government had already established the institutional structures for coordinating the
    implementation of ASP-P1. MoARD, CPD, had already established a PMU in 2003.
23. Assessment of risks: Program-level risks were adequately identified and outlined in the PAD. They
    were presented in the form of a matrix and represented a summary of risk assessments undertaken
    during identification, pre-appraisal and appraisal missions to ASP-P1 participating countries. Even
    though the assessment of risks was comprehensive and included a broad range of mitigation measures
    in generic terms, an assessment of risks and mitigation measures specific to Ethiopia was lacking. At
    the same time, it should be noted that it was difficult to assess country-specific risks in the absence of
    inventories of obsolete pesticides and CESAs, which were only planned to be undertaken during
    project implementation.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
24. Throughout implementation, the project experienced long delays, eventually resulting in three
    extensions for a total of 24 months, and a Level 1 restructuring in 2011.
25. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes included:
     •   Poor project management and procurement capacity affected project implementation. The PMU
         staff that had managed the preceding pesticide project (FAO-II) was considered experienced and
         had therefore remained in place to take over the management of ASP-P1. However, FAO-II only
         closed in July 2008 and the transition period in which both projects were active was poorly
         managed; the PMU primarily focused on completing outstanding activities of FAO-II, and ASP-
         P1 start-up activities were delayed. Upon completion of FAO-II, key staff, including the project
         coordinator, unexpectedly left, resulting in significant additional delays as new staff had to be
         appointed and trained. The lack of adequate procurement staff coupled with cumbersome and
         lengthy procurement processes at the ministry-level, in particular, adversely affected the project’s
         progress throughout project implementation (see Section 2.4 for more details).
     •   Delayed and insufficient technical support affected implementation performance. The PMU was
         supposed to receive highly technical and specialized expertise (required for implementation,
         supervision and monitoring of project activities) from FAO’s Technical Support Unit (TSU);
         however, this support was not delivered to the extent originally planned. 86 This was mainly due to
         poor collaboration between the World Bank and FAO, resulting from a complex and loosely
         defined stakeholder implementation arrangement at the program-level, and FAO having
         exhausted its GEF funds before the disposal activities began (see Section 2.2 in the program-level
         ICR). Urgently needed operational support from the World Bank was not sufficiently provided

86
  In addition, equipment and vehicles intended to be provided by the TSU in the beginning of project implementation, were
delayed by 5 months.
                                                            55
          prior to mid-term review; however, increased supervision, operational and technical support
          thereafter, improved the level of support. For technical support during disposal activities, a
          Technical Advisor for Disposal (TAD) was eventually recruited and financed by CLI, which
          positively affected project implementation.
     •    Higher than estimated obsolete pesticide stocks caused a funding gap. The completion of the
          national obsolete pesticides inventory in May 2010 revealed additional 200 tonnes of obsolete
          pesticides and 850 tonnes of associated waste, which had not been budgeted. At restructuring, the
          project was therefore facing an estimated funding gap of US$4.1 million for the disposal of all
          inventoried stocks and associated waste. The World Bank and the government had agreed to
          reallocate GEF proceeds toward disposal, dispose of the highest risk stocks and safeguard stocks
          with a lower risk profile. A round table with possible donors to raise additional funds was
          organized in early 2012; however, at project closure no additional funds had been raised.
          Insufficient project funds eventually resulted in non-disposal and/or safeguarding of the
          inventoried associated waste including contaminated soils.
26. Restructuring: At mid-term review, achievement of the PDO was considered unlikely within the
    original timeframe and budget. The World Bank recommended revising the PDO and associated
    indicators, introducing a results framework, and extending the project’s closing date. However, it was
    agreed that the project would only be restructured once project implementation showed positive
    progress; the PMU was subsequently provided with increased technical and operational support by
    the World Bank.
27. In June 2011, following implementation progress, the project was restructured. 87 Revisions reflected a
    shift from complete elimination of all inventoried publicly held obsolete stocks and associated waste
    to elimination overseas of the highest risk stocks and lower-cost in country safeguarding of the
    stocks. However, the revised PDO remained ambitious as project funds continued to be insufficient,
    even in view of revised targets.

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)
28. Overall M&E – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory.
29. M&E design – Rating Unsatisfactory: Despite the lengthy preparation time, at appraisal, an M&E
    system specific for Ethiopia was not developed. A results framework, which was intended to be
    finalized by the TSU during project launch and included in the project’s Operational Manual, did not
    materialize. Only a set of PDO indicators linked to the different project components was developed in
    the PAD and the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, however, these did not allow for adequate
    monitoring of project implementation progress. The indicators focused on measuring outputs as
    opposed to progress towards project outcomes. In particular, results expected under the prevention
    component were not adequately considered by these indicators.
30. M&E implementation – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Until mid-term review, there was no
    M&E system in place. Eventually, in 2009, the TSU provided the PMU with and trained it in using a
    Disposal-Project Tracking Workbook to monitor and evaluate project-related activities. However, the
    tool was complex, and therefore not used by the PMU. Increased support provided by the World Bank

87
  Following the restructuring, two additional extensions were processed for a total of six months in order to compensate for
longer than anticipated disposal activities, and in particular to ensure reception of incineration certificates before project closure.
                                                                   56
     in 2010 included assisting the PMU with an 18-months component-based work plan and a simplified
     implementation progress-monitoring plan. In 2011, following the restructuring of the project, a results
     framework specific to Ethiopia was finally introduced and the PDO and associated indicators were
     revised to focus on the two main project achievements (disposal and/or safeguarding and reduction of
     future accumulations) which strengthened project M&E, albeit late in the process.
31. M&E utilization – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The inventory of obsolete pesticide stocks was
    conducted by using inventory forms and a manual provided by the FAO Environmental Management
    Toolkit (EMTK). 88 The inventory data was entered into a database of the FAO web-based Pesticide
    Stock Management System (PSMS) to record and monitor the pesticides and manage their usage, and
    subsequently validated. The data was used by the PMU for risk profiling of the stocks,89 and to
    prepare the CESA and disposal bidding documents/contracts. FAO also provided training to the PMU
    in how to best use the database, which took place in 2010. The PSMS together with the EMTK
    proved to be very useful tools in managing obsolete pesticides stocks.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
32. Safeguard compliance – Rating Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies: OP 4.01 on
    Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management.
33. Compliance with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment: A CESA identifying risks and devising
    mitigation measures to address potential negative environmental and social impacts was completed to
    the World Bank’s satisfaction in December 2012, albeit with significant delays. The assessment
    concluded that MoARD had the capacity to safeguard medium and low risk pesticide stores, and
    included an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) together with a Health and Safety Plan for
    safeguarding obsolete pesticides before disposal. The CESA’s late completion resulted from: i) the
    late completion of the inventory of obsolete pesticide stocks (only finalized in May 2010) which was
    needed for the CESA; ii) a complicated and time-consuming consultant procurement process; and iii)
    a lengthy World Bank review and clearance process (which ultimately caused eight months of delay).
    Subsequently, project activities involving storage, transportation, disposal, and site remediation were
    implemented in compliance with the recommendations and requirements of the CESA, the associated
    EMP, and the Health and Safety Plan.
34. OP 4.09 on Pest Management: Since project activities themselves met requirements of a pest
    management plan (i.e., through pesticide management, IPM, and capacity building), individual
    country projects, including ASP-P1 Ethiopia, were not required to prepare self-standing documents.
    See Section 2.4 in the program-level for more details.
35. Financial Management compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: During project
    implementation, quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports and annual audit reports were regularly
    prepared and submitted to the World Bank’s satisfaction, although the latter often delayed,
    particularly prior to 2010. The PMU encountered a shortage of staff, before in November 2009 a
    finance and administration officer and an accountant were recruited. Annual budgeting was being
    prepared, and its monitoring was satisfactory. Disbursement of total GEF funds was low throughout

88
   The tool kit provides a practical set of methodologies to assist countries in the risk-based management of obsolete pesticides,
including guidance on the management of collection/storage locations, based on international best practice.
89
   Sites were evaluated by risk category (high, medium, and low).
                                                                57
     implementation of the project, with only 26% in June 2011, when the project was restructured.
     Reasons were significant project implementation delays (often associated with procurement), and the
     project’s design having been back loaded in terms of expenditures with the more costly disposal
     activities programmed to take place only at the end of the project.
36. Procurement – Rating Unsatisfactory: Project implementation was significantly affected by
    continuous procurement-related delays, which were caused by low procurement capacity within the
    PMU and long authorization processes within the government. Following the departure of the initial
    procurement officer in June 2008, efforts were undertaken to recruit a replacement, however, with
    little success. 90 At project closure, the position still had not been filled. Procurement support from
    MoARD was equally cumbersome. The World Bank eventually mitigated the PMU’s weak
    procurement capacity through temporary technical assistance.91

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPEARTION/NEXT PHASE
37. Post-completion: To further strengthen the legal and regulatory framework, a Pesticide Registration
    and Control Regulation was developed in addition to and based on the Pesticide and Control
    Proclamation that was proclaimed in 2010 (Proclamation No. 674/2010). The new regulation was
    validated by a national workshop in April 2013, which was organized by a similar project with funds
    from FAO and the Netherlands. 92 The regulation was subsequently approved by MoARD and is
    currently expected to be submitted to the Council of Ministers for further approval and final
    enactment. At the same time, the MoARD is determined to fully implementing Proclamation No.
    674/2010.
38. Next phase: At project appraisal, the Ministry of Health was in possession of 450 tonnes of DDT that
    were stored near Addis Ababa. As Ethiopia was still relying on DDT for malaria control at appraisal,
    the stocks had not been declared obsolete and had therefore not been included in ASP-P1. 93 In 2012
    however, Ethiopia eventually suspended the use of DDT. The 450 tonnes of DDT near Addis Ababa
    were subsequently declared obsolete, albeit too late to be included in ASP-P1. The Ministry of Health
    is currently in the process of conducting a nation-wide preliminary inventory exercise, before the
    stocks are planned to be adequately inventoried through PSMS in collaboration with Ministry of
    Agriculture. Additionally, following the development of a container management strategy under ASP-
    P1 Ethiopia, the government is currently exploring the possibility of conducting a pilot project in
    selected areas with support from Crop Life Ethiopia.




90
   The general paucity of trained procurement specialists in Ethiopia and competition between projects caused a lengthy and
unsuccessful recruitment process In November 2009, an experienced procurement officer had declined the final offer due to an
unattractive remuneration scheme, and the following candidate resigned two months after his appointment in June 2010.
Procurement support received from the MoARD was also characterized by a lack of skilled staff.
91
   The World Bank provided temporary assistance in April 2010 by funding an international consultant team that conducted five
project management support missions between July 2010 and January 2011 to help the PMU update and refine project
management tools, and finalizing the bidding document for the disposal.
92
   The Pesticide Risk Reduction Program (PRRP) aims to contribute to a sustainable pesticide management system by focusing
on capacitating pesticide registration and post registration.
93
   DDT is being phased out internationally under the Stockholm Convention on POPs. It is no longer permitted for use in
agriculture. However, several countries, including Ethiopia, still rely on DDT for the control of mosquito vectors of malaria.
                                                                 58
3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
39. Relevance – Rating Substantial: Despite having been too ambitious, the project’s original objectives,
    design and implementation were relevant when the project was prepared, and consistent with the
    World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Ethiopia, which targeted to increase attention to
    environmental issues. 94 Even though they remained ambitious after they were revised, the project’s
    objective, design, and implementation remained and continue to be relevant to the national
    development priorities today. The Government of Ethiopia places strong emphasis on preserving the
    environment, reducing pollution, and supporting efforts to improve the quality of life in cities and
    rural areas, as evident from the country’s climate-resilient green economy strategy which focuses on
    achieving economic development goals in a sustainable way. 95 The project’s objective is also
    consistent with the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Ethiopia issued in 2012, 96 which
    supports a multifaceted approach addressing the challenges posed by climate change, including but
    not limited to interventions in the agriculture sector; better management of natural resources such as
    land, forestry, groundwater; and promotion of green technologies.
40. The project supported the Government of Ethiopia in complying with the Stockholm Convention on
    POPs, and the Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes
    and their disposal. In addition, the government has shown increasing commitment to eliminating
    obsolete pesticides and introducing measures to reduce future related risks, as demonstrated by its
    engagement in a similar project, the Pesticide Risk Reduction Program (PRRP – Ethiopia), which is
    planned to be completed by the end of 2013 (see Section 2.5).

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
41. Taking account of the project’s Level 1 restructuring, the project has been evaluated against its
    original and revised PDO by measuring achievements at the time of the project’s restructuring (June
    2011) and project closing (June 2013), respectively.
42. Original PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The assessment took the project’s
    seven PDO indicators into account, of which two were fully (100%), two partly (50%), and three not
    (0%) achieved. The three main project outcomes measured by indicators include: (i) sound disposal
    and management of obsolete pesticides; (ii) prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of disposal
    and management of obsolete pesticides; and (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of
    pesticide management. 97
43. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides. The level of risks emanating from publicly
    held obsolete pesticides and associated wastes to adjacent and wider communities or critical natural
    resources was determined and quantified through the completion of a national inventory in May 2010
    (PDO Indicator #1 – 100%). This information (geo-location of the storage sites, whether the storage

   Achievements were identified based on intended outcomes presented in Section B.1 and Annex I of the PAD (Report No:
39901-ET).
                                                             59
     sites were protected or not, identity of the contaminant, its quantity, and general condition of the
     stockpiles) allowed the government to risk profile the stocks and to prepare the CESA. However, at
     restructuring, the CESA was still being finalized and not yet completed (PDO Indicator #2 – 0%).
     Due to substantial project implementation delays, the disposal had not begun at restructuring. The
     bidding document for the disposal tender was completed and cleared by the World Bank, but no
     publicly held obsolete pesticides had been disposed of yet (PDO Indicator #3 – 0%).
44. Prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides. Better regulation and control of
    the registration, production, storage, and sale of pesticides was achieved by strengthening the legal
    and regulatory frameworks for pesticide management. A Pesticide Registration and Control
    Proclamation was approved in January 2010 by the Council of Ministers, proclaimed by Parliament in
    June 2010, and published in August 2010 in a federal newspaper. However, measures to strengthen
    compliance with the Basel Convention and the Rotterdam Convention had not been undertaken (PDO
    Indicatory #4 – 50%). Important steps had been made towards preparing a national pesticide
    management strategy, aiming to enhance the sustainability of MoARD’s organizational and financial
    provisions to deal with obsolete pesticide and associated waste; however, at restructuring the strategy
    had not been finalized yet (PDO Indicator #5 – 0%). In collaboration with WWF and in consultation
    with various ministries, NGOs and other stakeholders, a communication strategy was finalized in
    March 2009. 98 The strategy comprised an outreach program focusing on farmers and rural
    communities including a number of key events to support the prevention component. The project
    subsequently raised stakeholders’ awareness of the new proclamation, through a three-day workshop
    in May 2011. Awareness was not raised on the health and environmental hazards of pesticides and
    encouraging safe pesticide handling, as the envisaged radio, TV, and print media materials had not
    been distributed/aired by the time of restructuring.
45. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. Between 2010 and 2011,
    PMU members and representatives from MoARD participated in several pesticide management
    trainings. Capacity was strengthened as became evident through successful completion of the
    inventory, and adequate preparation of safeguard instruments (PDO Indicator #6 – 100%). However,
    procurement capacity at the time of restructuring remained low (see Section 2.4), which continued to
    delay project implementation (PDO Indicator #7 – 50%).
46. Revised PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The assessment took the project’s two
    revised PDO indicators into account, of which one was fully (100%) and the other partly (35%)
    achieved. In addition, seven Intermediate Outcome Indicators framed the evaluation. Two of these
    were not taken into account as they corresponded with Original PDO Indicators that had been
    achieved prior to restructuring; of those taken into account, four were fully and one was not achieved.
    Outcomes were slightly modified following the restructuring and included: (i) Sound disposal and
    management of obsolete pesticides and associated waste including safeguarding; (ii) reduction of re-
    accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated waste through regulations, pest management, and
    stakeholder involvement; and (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide
    management.



98
 The communication strategy was developed during a workshop in May 2008 involving participants from various ministries,
NGOs, and other stakeholders, and subsequently finalized during various consultative meetings.
                                                              60
47. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides and associated waste, including safeguarding.
    The inventory had revealed a total of 449 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and 842 tonnes of associated
    waste, consisting of empty containers and contaminated material, equipment, and soil99 across 103

    preparation of a CESA (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #2 - 100%). 100
48. The project reduced risks emanating from publicly held obsolete pesticides to communities, natural
    resources, and the global environment through the sound disposal of all inventoried obsolete
    pesticides. To maximize risk reduction and by recognizing that funds would be insufficient to dispose
    of and/or safeguard all inventoried obsolete pesticides and associated waste, the government and the
    World Bank agreed to give priority to disposing of obsolete pesticides over safeguarding associated
    waste as these were considered posing the larger risk.

    strategy was developed and endorsed by the Steering Committee on June 25, 2013 (Revised PDO
    Indicator #2 – 100%; and Intermediate Outcome Indicator #5 – 100%). The strategy focused on sound
    pesticide management based on a holistic, integrated, and systematic approach. Equally endorsed by
    the Steering Committee on June 25, 2013 were action plans for a national container management
    strategy (Intermediate PDO Indicator #3 – 100%), and pesticide management. The project completed
    awareness raising activities as outlined in its communication strategy. In 2012 and 2013, posters and

      similar materials were prepared and distributed to raise awareness on the harmful nature of pesticides
      to human health and the ecosystem; and a one-year TV and radio program was conducted in three
      local languages to raise awareness on pesticides use (Intermediate PDO Indicator #4 – 100%). The
      construction of a new storage warehouse for temporary storage of imported pesticides and thus better
      pesticide management, was not initiated as a result of time constraints (Intermediate PDO Indicator
      #7 – 0%). 104
51. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. In addition to the
    capacity building achieved prior to restructuring, the project did not achieve further institutional
    strengthening of pesticide management.
52. Weighted average PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: At restructuring in June
    2011, the project had disbursed US$0.5 million, representing 21.5% of total disbursed funds of
    US$2.32 million. On this basis and as illustrated by the table below, project achievements against the
    original PDO are rated moderately unsatisfactory, whereas project achievements against the revised
    PDO are rated moderately satisfactory. The weighted average of the project’s PDO achievement is
    therefore rated moderately satisfactory.

3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
53. The project aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effects of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities, by reducing
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement
    and, thus, is also rated moderately satisfactory based on the assessment above (see Section 3.2).

3.4 EFFICIENCY
54. Efficiency – Rating Substantial: This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic
    data to support this rating are scarce. At appraisal, an economic or financial analysis was not


104
    Its construction required the development of an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) which was only
completed in April 2011. The assessment’s late completion was caused by a lengthy public consultation process and data
collection and analysis, a lengthy procurement process, and the World Bank’s late advice on developing such assessment. In May
2012, it was agreed by the World Bank and PMU to cancel the store’s construction as the remaining project time was considered
insufficient.
                                                                62
      undertaken for ASP-P1 at either the program or at the country-level due to non-measurable benefits of
      reducing the risk of contaminating the environment.
55. Based on the fact that approximately 71% (US$1.70 million) of disbursed GEF funds (i.e., US$2.38
    million) went towards disposal activities under ASP-P1 Ethiopia, the project’s efficiency was
    primarily assessed by its investment in the disposal of obsolete pesticides and associated waste.
56. During appraisal, the unit cost for disposal was estimated at US$3,400 per tonne (based on
    approximately US$15 million spent on the disposal of 3,240 tonnes of obsolete pesticides between
    1990 and 2004 across Africa). (See Section 3.4 in the program-level ICR for details).
57. At project closing, 450 tonnes 105 of obsolete pesticides and associated waste had been disposed of at
    the cost of approximately US$3,778 per ton, which represents a slightly higher cost than originally
    anticipated. 106 Given the overall high cost involved, cleanup and safe disposal was prioritized on the
    basis of a detailed inventory of pesticide stockpiles and associated waste, determining the identity of
    the contaminant, its quantity, and its proximity to the people and environment. In comparison with the
    originally estimated US$3,400 per ton, the project achieved its goal with a slightly higher cost-benefit
    than originally estimated. However, the US$ depreciation since 2004 and an increase in the price of
    fuel, which has increased the cost of disposal in US$ terms, is not taken into account by this
    calculation; neither are varying distances from collection centers to harbors, varying distances of
    shipping routes, and responses to call of bid by different companies.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
58. Overall outcome - Rating Moderately Satisfactory: On the basis of the project’s efficiency
    (substantial), relevance (substantial), and PDO achievement (moderately satisfactory), the overall
    outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The rating takes into account that despite substantial
    implementation challenges prior to mid-term review (see Section 2), and a shortage of funds to
    dispose of and/or safeguard all inventoried obsolete pesticides and associated waste, the project
    successfully reduced risks to the environment and public health by disposing all inventoried obsolete
    pesticides. In addition, the project succeeded in significantly improving measures to reduce future re-
    accumulations by developing a national pesticide management strategy, including action plans for a
    national container management strategy, and pest management.

3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
59. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development: The disposal of obsolete pesticides and
    associated wastes had a direct positive impact on poor and farming communities, species and
    ecosystems, located in proximity to the sites carrying obsolete pesticide stocks and associated waste.
    Baseline data on affected populations, species, and ecosystems were not gathered at appraisal; exact
    impacts are therefore difficult to measure.
60. Institutional change/strengthening: The project strengthened the government’s institutional capacity
    on several levels: (i) The regulatory and legal framework for pest and pesticide management was
    improved; (ii) the logistics of hazardous waste transportation were internalized and the knowledge

105
   Not including the additional 395 tonnes of obsolete pesticides that were disposed of through parallel funding by CLI.
106
   Costs include costs associated with repackaging, transport, and incineration of obsolete pesticides and other related activities
such as for example the inventory, safeguarding efforts, associated studies, and advisory services.
                                                                63
    gained can be used to inform future disposal activities; (iii) the experience and skills gained in
    managing the project can be applied to other projects and subsequently contribute to success; and (iv)
    knowledge was also gained on sound pesticide management through the various training that were
    provided to governmental staff.
61. Other unintended outcomes and impacts: A positive outcome was the disposal of 395 tonnes stocks
    of obsolete pesticides under CLI funding in August 2011. The stocks represented legacy stocks from
    the earlier FAO-II project, and had been stored near Addis Ababa. An EMP and a Health and Safety
    Plan were developed, found satisfactory by the World Bank, and subsequently disclosed at the World
    Bank’s InfoShop and in country in April/May 2010. Disposal activities were subsequently
    implemented in compliance with World Bank safeguard policies, and in accordance with all
    necessary international protocols.

3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
62. An ICR mission, including a stakeholder workshop was conducted in the beginning of May 2013 in
    Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. For a detailed summary of the findings please see Section 8.6. A beneficiary
    survey was not conducted.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

63. Risk to the development outcome - Rating Moderate. The risk is confined to the re-accumulation of
    obsolete pesticides, and a potential weakening of government commitment to sustaining and building
    on the project’s outcomes, particularly with respect to prevention activities.
64. The project substantially strengthened pesticide legislation and national capacity, and together with
    the various activities agreed upon in the national strategy, the government is well positioned to
    sustainably manage and reduce future accumulations of obsolete pesticides. In addition, the
    government has shown continued commitment to reducing future related risks, as demonstrated by its
    engagement in a similar project, the PRRP, which is planned to be completed by the end of 2013 (see
    Section 2.5).

5. ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
65. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Project
    preparation of ASP-P1 Ethiopia was conducted in conjunction with preparatory activities at the
    program-level, which were lengthy (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). While considerable
    time was invested in overall preparation, key project preparation documents for ASP-P1 Ethiopia
    only broadly laid out project implementation plans, and lacked country-specific information. The
    project’s design was characterized by several weaknesses, which translated into substantial project
    implementation delays (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). FM and procurement assessments
    adequately outlined potential risks, however, corresponding resulting mitigation measures were weak.


                                                   64
66. Quality of World Bank supervision – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Until 2011, the project was
    supervised by the Task Team Leader (TTL) responsible for ASP at the program-level, who was based
    at the World Bank’s headquarters in Washington DC. In 2011, a co-TTL was assigned in Ethiopia.
    Supervision missions took place regularly, albeit only once a year (except in 2010 when a number of
    technical and operational support missions were conducted).
67. During the first three years, project implementation had been experiencing substantial delays; support
    from the World Bank was limited, and the project was affected by collaboration issues among
    partners, especially the World Bank and FAO, at the program-level (see Section 2.2 in the program-
    level ICR). 107 Following the mid-term review, the World Bank team took corrective action by
    significantly increasing its support to more effectively address the project’s implementation delays.
    These included funding of an international consultant team that conducted five support missions
    between July 2010 and January 2011 to help the PMU update and refine project management tools,
    and finalize the disposal bidding document. In 2011, the World Bank prepared a Level 1 restructuring
    involving revision of the PDO to better respond to sector realities and country needs; however, the
    PDO remained ambitious. Final disposal activities were effectively supported through: (i) more
    frequent and ad-hoc project implementation support from the co-TTL; (ii) reallocation of GEF funds
    to accommodate the disposal of higher than estimated obsolete pesticides; and (iii) timely preparation
    of two additional extensions of the closing date to ensure the safe arrival of already shipped obsolete
    pesticide materials at their destination, PDO achievement, and project funding eligibility of all
    disposal-related activities. FM review missions were conducted regularly to ensure the project’s FM
    arrangements remained acceptable to the World Bank.
68. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The project suffered from
    shortcomings in project preparation and design at the program-level. Following a resulting slow
    performance during the first half of the project, the World Bank team gradually improved its
    performance through corrective actions.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
69. Government performance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: Government commitment at entry
    towards the issue of obsolete pesticides was evident through the implementation of a similar previous
    project, described in Section 1.1. The government had therefore acquired substantial experience and
    was considered experienced and well prepared for pesticide disposal under ASP. In addition, the
    government had already established the institutional structures for coordinating the implementation of
    ASP-P1. MoARD through the CPD had established a PMU in 2003. However, during project
    implementation, MoARD’s cumbersome and long procurement processes significantly contributed to
    project implementation delays.
70. Implementing agency performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Overall, the implementing
    agency’s performance was moderately unsatisfactory, with gradual improvement throughout project
    implementation. Significant implementation delays were caused by a poorly managed transition
    period between the preceding pesticide project (FAO-II) and ASP-P1, and key staff that had
    unexpectedly left upon completion of the FAO-II project, as new staff had to be appointed and trained
107
   Significant delays were caused by lengthy World Bank review and clearance processes of project-related documents. It took
eight months to review and clear the CESA TORs, as FAO and the World Bank struggled finding an agreement on a format that
was in line with technical requirements; no objections were often provided with delays.
                                                                65
    over time. Particular delays were caused by the lack of adequate procurement staff throughout project
    implementation (see Section 2.4 for more details). However, the agency’s performance improved
    gradually, and particularly during the last two years of project implementation, it demonstrated strong
    commitment towards achieving the PDO.
71. The agency complied with all World Bank loan covenants, and executed its fiduciary duties. Delays
    were noted in submitting Financial Monitoring Reports, however, no issues in view of FM or
    procurement were noted during project implementation. The agency equally ensured safeguard
    compliance.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

72. The most significant lessons learned are outlined in Section 6 of the program-level ICR, as the
    experience they are based on was often reflected across all country-specific projects. Lessons learned
    that were particularly relevant to ASP-P1 Ethiopia include:
    •   Both, the implementing agency and the World Bank team need to be staffed with appropriate
        technical expertise, which is crucial for sound preparation and implementation of projects
        associated with pesticide disposal. As was evident during implementation, the disposal of
        obsolete pesticides and associated waste required highly specialized technical expertise,
        particularly for the preparation of disposal activities (i.e., procuring the specialized services). The
        technical support the project received, particularly from the TAD proved to be crucial for the
        project’s progress toward PDO achievement.
    •   Knowledge exchange between participating countries of a regional project can be value
        adding. CLI had provided support to ASP-P1 Ethiopia and ASP-P1 Tanzania by financing a
        TAD. The TAD was represented by the same person, which automatically facilitated the
        knowledge exchange between the two countries with respect to disposal activities. Both countries
        confirmed the value added through this knowledge exchange.
    •   Possible low procurement capacity should be adequately reflected when assessing risks. Project
        implementation was significantly affected by continuous procurement-related delays. The general
        paucity of trained procurement specialists in Ethiopia and competition between projects for
        procurement staff should be taken into account during preparation.

8.6 STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS
4. An ICR mission including a stakeholder workshop was conducted in the beginning of May 2013 in
   Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Stakeholders highlighted the following key points:
     •   The most important achievements that resulted from prevention activities included the
         preparation of a strategic plan, awareness raising among different target groups, the development
         of a legal framework that resulted in better utilization of the registration/purchasing system, and
         capacity building among government officials and users.
     •   The most important achievements that resulted from disposal activities included clearing up
         storage facilities, knowledge transfer from the international disposal company to national staff,
         identification of 850 tonnes of contaminated soils, and completion of a nation-wide inventory of
         obsolete pesticides.
     •   Key challenges included a shortage and high turnover of PMU staff, improper project
         management, weak procurement capacity, project design problems, project overlaps between the
         preceding and ASP project, slow response from different countries regarding the shipment, a
         lack of M&E, a lack of laboratories to determine the level of contamination, lack of awareness
         on dangers among end-users of pesticides, and lack of heavy trucks for transportation.
     •   The sustainability of project outcomes could be ensured through effective use of the gained
         opportunities, addressing the remaining associated waste, use of IPM and IVM, assessing
         alternative means for disposal, implementing improved legislation, increased and sustained
         government commitment, policies, strategies, and budget allocation, disposal and prevention
         strategies, continued awareness raising, and collaboration with the private sector.
     •   The institutional and partnership arrangement was lacking a harmonized implementation system,
         resulting in weak awareness and coordination among and between stakeholders.
     •   Key lessons learned were: (i) A pesticide management system needs to be in place; (ii)
         recruitment of local staff minimized costs; (iii) empty containers needed to be triple-rinsed

                                                       73
        before they could be reused; (iii) knowledge sharing with other countries was value-adding; (iv)
        local stakeholders had to be involved from the beginning on; (v) emphasis on training was
        important; (vi) a pesticides poisoning/testing center should be in place; (vi) pesticides safety and
        management should be covered by the media; (vii) a system for container management needs to
        be in place; (viii) personal protective equipment needs to be available; and (ix) technical
        requirements per year need to be assessed in advance.

8.7 SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR AND COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
5. The borrower submitted a completion report; messages contained therein were integrated into this
   document.
6. Comments received on the draft ICR were equally incorporated. Additional comments included the
   following:
   a. Inventory: We have satisfactorily complete inventory and therefore we do not accept the rating
      for inventory as Moderately Satisfactory. Please change this rating to Satisfactory.
       •   World Bank response: The data sheet notes that Original PDO Indicator #1 (Inventory
           database of publicly held obsolete pesticides stocks and associated waste in place and in use
           by the PMU and the recipient’s staff) was fully achieved (100%).
   b. PDO Indicator 1: ASP-P1Ethiopia has disposed of all inventoried obsolete pesticides (450 tonnes)
      though the original target was 250 tonnes. Moreover, the project didn’t have any plan and
      resources to fully safeguard and or dispose all inventoried associated waste. Hence we strongly
      disagree on the downgraded rating of our performance of this PDO Indicator and recommend it to
      be updated as Satisfactory.
       •   World Bank response: The Revised PDO Indicator #1 (as per the Level 1 Restructuring in
           June 2011) was: “Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste disposed
           of and/or safeguarded by the end of the project”. The inventory noted 450 tonnes of obsolete
           pesticides and 850 tonnes of associated waste. At restructuring, it was agreed to dispose of
           250 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and safeguard all other inventoried obsolete pesticides and
           associated waste. However, it was recognized that the Revised PDO Indicator #1 continued to
           be ambitious and funds insufficient. Therefore, the government and the World Bank agreed to
           give priority to disposing of obsolete pesticides over safeguarding associated waste as these
           were considered posing the larger risk. The Overall Outcome rating took these circumstances
           into account, because even though the Revised PDO Indicator #1 was only achieved 35%
           (i.e., 450 tonnes of obsolete pesticides disposed of against inventoried 1,300 tonnes of
           obsolete pesticides and associated waste), the Overall Outcome was rated Moderately
           Satisfactory.
   c. Efficiency: Our cost of disposal and safeguarding is about 3,011 US$/tonne but in the ICR it is
      stated that to be 3,778 US$/tonne. As our actual cost is less than the proxy (3,400 US$/tonne) we
      believe that ASP Ethiopia is cost effective and efficient.
       •   World Bank response: The ICR’s calculation took disbursed GEF funds that were spent
           towards disposal activities as basis. This included costs associated with repackaging,
           transport, and incineration of obsolete pesticides and other related activities.

                                                    74
   d. Performance of Implementing Agency: We would be grateful if the downgraded rating
      (Moderately Unsatisfactory) be upgraded to be at least Moderately Satisfactory as all efforts were
      made by MOA/APHRD for the successful completion of ASP-P1 Ethiopia.
       •   World Bank response: The rating is based on the discussion outlined in Section 2.2 and 5.2,
           and found adequate.
   e. Overall performance rating: We deserve to be evaluated as Satisfactory as we have disposed 450
      tonnes (almost double of the original plan), prepared pesticide mgt strategy, proclaimed pesticide
      registration and control proclamation, drafted pesticide registration and control regulation, raised
      awareness on pesticide issues, disposed additional 395 tonnes through CLI funding and
      implementing PRRP Ethiopia project, which mainly focuses on pesticide registration and post
      registration capacity building etc.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1. Country background: At project approval in December 2006, agriculture and livestock husbandry
   had long been the backbone of the economy, accounting (with related activities) for around 30-35%
   of GDP, as well as providing the bulk of export revenue until the advent of large-scale gold
   production in 2000. 112 Besides its importance in the overall economy, agriculture with main crops
   such as cereals and cotton had been the principal source of livelihood for a large segment of the
   Malian population.
2. Sector background: The agricultural sector had therefore accounted for the largest fraction of
   pesticides used in Mali, with pesticide imports having increased substantially during the 1990s. 113
   The use of chemical pesticides had been a crucial factor in controlling pests and improving
   agricultural productivity. About 80% of the total agricultural pesticide use in Mali had been in the
   cotton sector; of which 95% were insecticides, distributed by the parastatal cotton development
   agencies and the Ministry of Agriculture. Within the health sector, the Ministry of Health had been
   responsible for the execution of public health pest control (i.e., mosquito and black fly control). From
   1990 to 1992, about 630 tonnes of pesticides per year were imported annually for public health pest
   control, representing approximately 19% of total pesticide use. From 1993, data on pesticide use in
   the public health sector have become unavailable as a result of decentralization efforts and a shift in
   pest control responsibilities to the private sector.
3. Obsolete pesticides accumulation and soil contamination: Mali was considered a priority country to
   participate in ASP-P1 because of its large estimated volume of obsolete pesticides. 114 Accumulation
   of obsolete pesticides in Mali had been caused mainly by product bans due to their effects on public
   health and the environment, deterioration as a result of prolonged or poor storage, and poor
   procurement planning/uncoordinated donations of pesticides. Mali also had a number of sites with
   highly polluted soil as a result of spills and poor storage conditions. 115
4. Institutional context: Obsolete pesticides management is handled by the National Department for
   Sanitation and Pollution Control (Direction Nationale de l'Assainissement et du Contrôle des
   Pollutions et des Nuisances - DNACPN) within the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation. In 2002,
   a National Pesticides Management Committee (Comité National de Gestion des Pesticides - CNGP)
   was formed under government decision as the executive implementing body of existing pesticides
   management regulation. CNGP recently underwent review and resumed activities with support from
   the project.
5. Actions taken: From 2005 to 2006, and in the course of preparing the project, the Government of Mali
   carried out an inventory of obsolete pesticides, with support from the UN Food and Agriculture
   Organization (FAO). Close to 2,000 tonnes of the total inventory were considered having potential for

112
    The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Profile Mali, 2006
113
    Volumes grew from 1,800 tonnes in 1991 to 4,100 tonnes in 1999
114
    See ESMF Executive Summary (October 28, 2004). Pre-2005 estimates indicated that Mali possessed 500 tonnes of obsolete
pesticides spread in 76 storage sites, as well as 40,000 tonnes of contaminated soil.

      dangerous environmental impacts, with the majority of the stocks having been inappropriately
      stored. 116
6. Rationale for World Bank assistance: Please refer to Section 1.1 in the program-level ICR.
7. Higher-level objectives: The project intended to contribute to the third pillar of Mali’s Country
   Assistance Strategy (CAS) 117, which focused on developing basic infrastructure and productive
   sectors. It aimed to support the development of the agriculture sector by reducing inputs of pesticides,
   to promote the use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in the cotton sector, to strengthen natural
   resource management by supporting the enhancement of pesticide management, and the conservation
   of scarce water supplies through supporting the cleanup of sites where underground water had been
   contaminated by pesticide spillage. The project further aimed to assist the government in developing
   strategies for cleaning up soils that had been contaminated with pesticides. Contributing to
   international efforts to eliminate Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), improving management of
   toxic chemicals, and promoting alternatives to pesticide usage that include IPM and Integrated Vector
   Management (IVM) represented further objectives.

1.2 ORIGINAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND INDICATORS
8. The Project Development Objective (PDO), and components that are stated in the Project Appraisal
   Document (PAD), 118 slightly differ from those stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement. 119
   This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components outlined in the GEF Trust
   Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s
   implementation activities.
                                           Table 1.1: ASP-P1 Mali Original PDO

       To assist the Government of Mali to dispose of publicly         To assist the recipient in: a) eliminating inventoried publicly
       held obsolete pesticide stocks at priority-selected sites, to   held obsolete pesticide stocks and associated waste and
       support the cleanup preparation of contaminated soils of        preparing measures for the future decontamination of soils
       priority sites, and to support actions to help prevent the      in priority sites; and b) implementing measures to reduce
       future accumulation of new stocks of obsolete pesticides        and prevent future risks related to pesticides and waste.



9. At appraisal, only an overall ASP-P1 results framework had been prepared (see program-level ASP
   ICR); results frameworks for the individual ASP-P1 countries, including Mali, were intended to be
   finalized during the individual ASP-P1 country project launches. However, country-specific PDO
   indicators were developed at appraisal. For ASP-P1 Mali, these were as follows:




116
    Particularly the contaminated site Nanguila (Kati) in the Koulikoro region was identified as posing high environmental risks.

        prepared by the recipient.
     d. The legal and regulatory framework for pesticide management has been improved and includes measures to strengthen
        compliance with the Basel Convention and the Rotterdam Convention.
     e. The training program under Part C of the project has been implemented, and the knowledge so acquired is being used by
        the PMU and the recipient's government staff.
     f. The PMU is functional, and its operation is satisfactory to the World Bank.


1.3 REVISED PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND INDICATORS
10. Similar to ASP-P1 Ethiopia, ASP-P1South Africa, and Tunisia, ASP-P1 Mali was planned to undergo
    a Level 1 Restructuring to ensure the PDO and associated indicators were achievable and measurable.
    However, the restructuring of ASP-P1 Mali did not materialize due to delays in the processing of an
    additional GEF Grant for the project and the March 2012 coup d'état, which resulted in the temporary
    suspension of World Bank operations in the country in accordance with OP/BP 7.30 (Dealing with De
    Facto Governments).

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
13. ASP-P1 Mali was prepared between 2001 and 2006, as part of preparatory activities at the program-
    level. It took more than five years from GEF eligibility in July 2001, and more than four years from
    concept note in July 2002 to project approval by the Board in December 2006.120
14. Soundness of the background analysis: Project preparation was conducted in close collaboration
    between the government and the ASP partners, and it resulted in intputs of varying levels of quality.
    The government, the World Bank, FAO, CropLife International (CLI), French Global Environment
    Facility (FFEM), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Pesticides Action Network (PAN)-UK
    collaborated via joint missions and workshops, where each partner carried out a distinct role. 121
    National stakeholders became involved around appraisal (2004), when a broad National Steering
    Committee (NSC) was created under a ministerial decree.122 The key preparatory outputs were the
    PAD and the Operational Manual: the PAD contained mostly ASP-P1 level information and plans
    with limited amount of country-specific information. Exception to this was the additional focus on
    contaminated soil, which had been recognized by all parties involved as a serious problem needing
    special attention. The Operational Manual, on the other hand, included considerable amount of
    background detail and plans specific to Mali, including a stakeholder analysis, an M&E framework,
    an analysis of the national legislative framework, environmental impact assessment procedures, an
    analysis of risks, and terms of reference for key tasks and budgets. There was a general agreement
    amongst the partners that the 2005-2006 inventory data might be inaccurate, and that the stocks of
    obsolete pesticides could range anywhere between 400 and 800 tonnes. Similarly, the lack of reliable
    data led to the estimate that soil treatment costs could range anywhere from US$2-6 million.
    Therefore, it was agreed that the inventory data would be validated early in implementation.
15. Assessment of project design: The project’s design (as for all ASP-P1 participating countries) was
    preconfigured at the program level, and did not reflect any country-specific modifications or lessons
    learned from pervious projects executed in Mali. Design weaknesses at the program-level that
    translated into implementation delays at the country level, including ASP-P1 Mali, are outlined in
    Section 2.1 of the program-level ICR. In the case of Mali, it was also agreed 123 that additional
    attention would be given to the issue of contaminated soil as a result of pesticide spills and leaks.
    Consequently, ASP-P1’s generic PDO was slightly modified to include the preparation of measures
    for future decontamination of soils, and treatment of contaminated soil was included under
    component A (Country Cleanup and Disposal Activities). Studies were to be undertaken to assess the
    scale of soil contamination, identify the adequate technologies, and estimate the costs of treatment of
    the soils.


120
    The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy partnership building/negotiation process at the program-level resulting from
the complex implementation arrangement and project design (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR).
121
    During preparation, FAO provided technical support to the PMU and sponsored the temporary hiring of a national expert in
obsolete pesticides; WWF and PAN-UK conducted workshops for journalists and francophone NGOs, respectively; and the
World Bank Task Team focused its support on institutional arrangements, safeguard requirements, risks analysis, budgeting and
fund raising. CLI and FFEM participated in technical and budgetary discussions.
122
      Decree No. 04 /1516 of August 2, 2004, modified on September 8, 2006.
123
      See for example, the PDF-B completion report which summarized key country-specific points of focus.
                                                               91
16. Government commitment: DNACPN’s strong commitment at entry was evident from its engagement
    in the inventory of free-standing obsolete pesticides with the support of FAO and the interest in
    continuing pesticide cleanup activities. In 2004, the government established a PMU within the
    Ministry of Environment and Sanitation, and the NSC, which included broad representation of all key
    stakeholders. Another evidence of the government’s strong commitment was the concern it expressed
    (as reflected in the various mission reports) about the lengthy preparation time, especially in view of
    risks posed by some contaminated sites. The government committed to co-financing corresponding to
    standard disbursement percentages (SDP) and to financing two technical project staff.
17. Assessment of risks: The PAD and the Operational Manual presented brief and partial risk
    assessments, which focused mainly on crosscutting and program-level risks. The PAD included one
    risk specific to Mali, which was related to the government’s lack of capacity or experience in treating
    contaminated sites or soils. As mitigation, the PAD proposed to outsource these activities to
    professional contractors. The Operational Manual identified risks emanating from the health impact
    of pesticide handing, accidents during transport and public opposition to the project. Corresponding
    mitigation measures were proposed, which correctly highlighted the need to conduct accurate
    inventories, hire external expertise and continuously seek additional funding in case additional stocks
    were revealed. Neither the PAD nor the Operational Manual included risks of delays due to the
    sequential design of country projects and political instability. Appropriate mitigation of the sequential
    design could have significantly increased the project’s success, while the country’s political situation
    was outside the scope of the project.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
18. The project experienced long delays, mainly in the procurement of a disposal company. Positively
    affecting project implementation were government's strong commitment to the project and the
    recruitment of an experienced Technical Advisor for Disposal (TAD) by CLI in mid-2009. 124
19. Key factors affecting implementation included:
      •   Long disposal procurement process. The procurement of a disposal company took more than
          three years to complete due to: (i) low procurement capacity within DNACPN, which meant that
          some steps took longer to complete or had to be repeated; (ii) lack of clarity within the World
          Bank about the disposal procurement process (see Section 2.2 of the program-level ICR); and (iii)
          the long time it took to finalize the CESA, which had to be completed before the scale of
          interventions could be determined and shared with potential bidders.
      •   A disposal-funding gap and delays in securing additional financing. Disposal activities were
          allocated a budget despite the uncertainty around the amount of stocks to be disposed of and the
          cost of soil treatment. An inventory validation exercise carried out in June 2007 found higher
          obsolete pesticide stocks (1,100 tonnes), indicating a disposal budget gap. While the exact scale
          of the gap was never fully identified by either the World Bank or the project, it was clear to all
          early in implementation that additional funds were needed in order to dispose of all stocks and


124
   It should be noted, however, that the TAD was contracted with substantial delays (the ToRs were approved in September 2007
but the contract was signed in mid-2009) due to long discussions between CLI and the government about contracting procedures
and mobilization of the funding within CLI. Given the TAD’s positive impact on the disposal contracting and PMU capacity, it is
likely that an earlier recruitment could have shortened the disposal contracting period.
                                                                 92
          treat polluted soil. Additional financing was secured in March 2010 when the GEF Council
          approved a $3.19 million grant to ASP-P1 Mali, but this was only approved by the CEO in March
          2012. Project/mission reports and discussions with World Bank task team members highlight the
          following reasons for this substantial delay:
              o    Unsuccessful initial fund raising efforts. Until additional funds were sought from the
                   GEF, the project was unsuccessful in securing any funds. In fact, project and mission
                   reports do not confirm whether fund raising efforts were made.
              o    Delayed submission of additional financing proposal to GEF. Following the February
                   2009 mid-term review and recognition that additional resources could not be secured by
                   the government, the World Bank and the government decided to pursue additional
                   financing from GEF. However, more than two and a half years had passed before the
                   additional financing was approved (in March 2012).125 This was mainly the result of a
                   World Bank TTL change, as well as the World Bank’s decision to merge the additional
                   financing request with project restructuring and government’s reluctance to restructure
                   the project. 126
      •   Temporary unavailability of the MDTF funds. The US$3.98 million MDTF closed in July 2009
          (with an undisbursed balance of US$3.1 million) due to delayed donor agreement on an extension
          and amendment of the parent MDTF agreement. The process of establishing a new MDTF with
          the balance took 19 months to complete (on February 1, 2011). This delay was the result of
          internal processing delays, resulting, according to the PMU, in the delay of some project
          activities. It is unclear, however, to what extent this delay affected the project since the GEF
          funds were used during this period as backup, 127 and the disposal contract was only signed in
          October 2011, eight months after the new MDTF became available.
      •   The March 2012 coup d'état and suspension of activities: The Additional Financing/Level I
          Restructuring Paper was submitted for management decision in March 2012, days before the
          military coup, which halted all operations in the country.

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND
UTLIZATION
20. Overall M&E - Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory based on the following evaluation.
21. M&E design - Rating Unsatisfactory: The project’s M&E framework lacked the most important
    element – a project-level results framework. Although the appraisal mission developed a project-level
    results framework 128, it was not reflected in the PAD and the Operational Manual, both presenting
    only the overall ASP-P1 results framework (see program-level ASP ICR) and six country-specific


125
     The additional financing was titled “Africa Stockpiles Programme - Project 1 – Supplemental Funds for Disposal and
Prevention” (P118630). The Project Identification Form (PIF) included both Mali and Tunisia, while the CEO Memo included
Mali alone after Tunisia had decided to withdraw from the request.
126
     Discussion with the task team indicate the following two key reasons: (i) concerns about public criticism, and (ii) the
Technical Support Unit’s (TSU’s) conflicting opinion that a restructuring was not necessary if some disposal tasks were carried
by local staff, an option which was considered too risky and unacceptable to the World Bank.
127
    In April 2010, the World Bank authorized a reallocation of GEF proceeds between categories in order to facilitate this.
128
    See Africa Stockpiles Programme (ASP) Mali Country Project -Appraisal mission Aide Memoire (April 19 to 27, 2004), July
1, 2004
                                                                 93
    Performance Monitoring Indicators. These indicators did not permit adequate monitoring of project
    implementation progress because they focused on measuring outputs as opposed to progress towards
    project outcomes. Expected results under the prevention component, in particular, were not
    adequately considered by the indicators.
22. M&E implementation - Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The project was implemented without a
    country-specific results framework until the mid-term-review in February 2009, more than three years
    after effectiveness. Discussions with the PMU and the World Bank team indicate that the delays were
    caused by delayed recruitment of an M&E consultant and the dissatisfaction of the World Bank with
    the consultancy’s results. The PMU with assistance from a World Bank M&E specialist eventually
    developed an M&E manual and a project-specific results framework based on FAO guidelines and in
    agreement with World Bank instructions. The PMU was effective in collecting data and producing
    satisfactory progress reports. Performance evaluation was carried out internally by the disposal
    specialist who was also in charge of M&E, while external evaluation was carried by external
    consultants and an FFEM-assigned committee according to specific terms of reference. 129
23. M&E utilization - Rating Satisfactory: The inventory validation exercise and the national database
    that was created using this information were the key mechanisms for risk evaluation, site cleanup
    prioritization and resource allocation. The inventory data were also used to assess the disposal
    funding gap and dictated which safeguard instruments should be prepared and followed by the
    project. In order to enhance the usefulness of the national database, the project provided training on
    data management to key holders of pesticide stocks. Since the database was, and still is, hosted by
    FAO’s online Pesticide Stock Management System (PSMS), the government received training on
    data management offline to be periodically up-loaded back to FAO’s server.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
24. Safeguard compliance - Rating Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies: OP 4.01 on
    Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management.
25. ASP-P1 Mali complied with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment: The CESA was completed in
    December 2009 and disclosed in the World Bank InfoShop on April 8, 2010, more than three years
    after effectiveness. The long process was due to weak procurement capacity, lack of clarity of the
    PMU and the consultant on the scope of work, poor quality of the first drafts and a long authorization
    process within the World Bank. Stakeholders and concerned communities were consulted twice
    during the preparation of the CESA. The report outlined mitigation measures for the safe handling of
    hazardous substances during preparatory cleanup works, repackaging, intermediary storage, transport,
    and site rehabilitation. 130 The CESA highlighted the need to prepare separate EMPs for a number of
    highly contaminated sites and a RAP for one site where residents had to be temporarily relocated.
    While the CESA was never implemented (the disposal work had not commenced by project closing),
    the site-specific EMPs were implemented satisfactorily during site cleanup operations, as confirmed
    by World Bank reports prepared by a World Bank-hired safeguard specialist.
129
    The committee comprised representatives from MEDD France, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, French Development
Agency, French Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, PAN-Europe and Union of Plant Protection Industries. It oversaw FFEM-
funded activities. Agricultural Research for Development and two disposal companies (SYPRED and ADIVALOR) provided
technical expertise to the committee.
130
    The CESA did not include mitigation measures for the final disposal since incineration was to take place in an overseas
licensed facility, and therefore no impact was foreseen in Mali.
                                                                 94
26. OP 4.09 on Pest Management: Since project activities themselves met requirements of a pest
    management plan (i.e., through pesticide management, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and
    capacity building), individual country projects, including ASP-P1 Mali, were not required to prepare
    self-standing documents. See Section 2.4 in the program-level for more details.
27. ASP-P1 Mali complied with OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement to a satisfactory extent: A RAP
    was prepared for planned safeguarding and soil remediation works in Nanguila (Koulikoro region),
    which involved the temporary relocation of inhabitants during the cleanup operation. The RAP was
    approved, disclosed in November 2010, and subsequently implemented in full compliance with
    safeguard requirements, as confirmed by various World Bank implementation support missions.
28. Financial Management compliance - Rating Satisfactory: The project had in place appropriate
    financial management staffing 131 and software, and accounts were maintained properly. The project
    submitted Interim unaudited Financial Report (IFRs) and independent audits in a timely and overall
    satisfactory manner. Any ineligible expenditure was reconciled. Highlighted weaknesses were unclear
    distribution of financial management tasks between the Administrative and Finance Officer and the
    Accountant, and some deficiencies in record keeping, internal control system management and fixed
    asset management. The project undertook the necessary corrective measures. GEF disbursement was
    low during the first half of the project (14% at mid-term compared to a 66% disbursement estimate),
    but increased substantially during the second half of the project (95% disbursement at closing). The
    low disbursement rate at mid-term is mainly attributable to the project's design having been back
    loaded in terms of expenditures with the more costly disposal activities (over 66% of the GEF grant
    budget) programmed to take place only at the end of the project.
29. Procurement - Rating Unsatisfactory: Procurement undertaken by DNACPN suffered from
    substantial delays, particularly in the purchasing of personal protective equipment for the disposal and
    cleanup operations, selecting a consulting firm to conduct the CESA and selecting a disposal
    company. The delays were attributable to a number of factors, the main one being DNACPN’s weak
    procurement capacity and the lack of a dedicated procurement staff132, combined with unclear
    guidance from the World Bank. The PMU also used a procurement plan, which had not been
    approved by the World Bank, and finalized contracts without the World Bank’s prior to approval.
    World Bank suggestions for increasing the procurement capacity of the PMU, by either hiring a
    procurement officer or providing training to other PMU staff, were not accepted by the PMU,
    highlighting the lack of qualified specialists in the country, and the already overloaded work program
    of the PMU members. Procurement received some reinforcement in July 2011 when the Africa
    Emergency Locus Project’s (AELP’s) procurement specialist began providing cross-support to the
    project under a coordination agreement between the two projects.




131
    With the exception of a temporary absence of the administrative and financial manager (between March and June 2010) due to
personnel exchange
132
    Early in implementation the dual functioning of financial management and procurement was judged by the World Bank to be
problematic because it both slowed down procurement and constituted a conflict of interest within the PMU where purchasing
and payments were carried out by the same person. The World Bank repeatedly recommended hiring a procurement specialist but
none was hired due to lack of qualified candidates in Mali.
                                                               95
2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
30. Post-completion: During implementation, inventoried low risk stocks at the various sites were
    repacked in metal containers and centralized in a store 35 km outside Bamako by trained local staff.
    Higher risk stocks have remained untreated since the 2005-2006 inventory in more than ten stores
    across the country, including two stores in Gao and one store in Timbuktu. The condition of the
    stocks is overall unknown; however, discussions with the PMU indicate that it is likely that some
    stores are in poor condition, leaking and accessible by the public. Despite this situation, no post
    completion activities have taken place since project closing.
31. Next phase: Discussions between the World Bank and the GEF Secretariat confirmed that the
    approved US$3.19 million additional financing could be used in a follow-up disposal and prevention
    project in Mali, and a letter from government dated March 20, 2013 confirmed the government’s
    interest in pursuing this option. In April 2013, the World Bank conducted an identification mission,
    where it also sought additional sources of financing. The World Bank task team confirmed that if a
    follow-up project would be launched, most of the proceeds would be used to pay for the disposal
    and/or safeguarding of the 1,100 tonnes of obsolete pesticide stocks and treatment of sites with highly
    contaminated soil.
32. DNACPN had offered to create a permanent ASP unit, which would be responsible for updating the
    national obsolete pesticide and waste inventory, prepare for the disposal operation, oversee
    decontamination of polluted sites, and conduct various prevention activities. It is unclear at this point
    whether this unit will be formed by the government.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
33. Relevance – Rating Substantial: Pesticide management, and obsolete pesticide and site cleanup were
    and continue to be relevant to the country's current transitional and development priorities, but are not
    key priorities. The Plan for the Sustainable Recovery of Mali for 2013-2014 (May 2013) only
    includes a pesticide cleanup operation in Gao.133 The Plan is part of the country’s Transitional
    Roadmap of January 29th 2013 and the Strategic Framework for Growth and Poverty Development
    2012-2017 of December 2011. Obsolete pesticide management is relevant to the Interim Strategy
    Note (ISN) for Mali for the period FY14-15, 134 and its objective of increasing agriculture
    performance and improving resilience to weather-related shocks as a measure for resuming economic
    activity. The project supports the Government of Mali in complying with the Stockholm Convention
    on POPs, the Basel Convention on Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and
    their Disposal, and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain
    Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
34. The project has been evaluated against its PDO by measuring achievements at the time of the project
    closing (December 31, 2012).

133
      The document is presented in the IMF Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), (Country Report No. 13/111).
134
      Report No. 76233-ML, May 20, 2013
                                                               96
35. PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The assessment took the project’s six PDO
    indicators into account, of which four were fully achieved (100%), one was partly achieved (80%)
    and one was not achieved (0%). Indicator #2 (disposal of the stocks), which signifies the most
    important project achievement, received a higher weight in the rating calculation. The three main
    project outcomes measured by indicators include: 135 (i) Sound disposal and management of obsolete
    pesticides and contaminated sites; (ii) prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete
    pesticides; and (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management.
36. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides and contaminated sites. The level of risks
    emanating from publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste to adjacent and wider
    communities or critical natural resources was determined and quantified through the completion of a
    national inventory of publicly held obsolete pesticides in 2005-2006 and its validation in June 2007
    (PDO Indicator #1 – 100%). This information was used to prepare a CESA, conduct an assessment of
    contaminated sites (PDO Indicator #3 – 100%), safeguard low risk stocks, clean up a number of
    priority sites and contract a disposal company. It is estimated that over four million people (half of
    them are women) living in vicinity to the contaminated sites benefitted from soil cleanup operations
    and obsolete pesticide safeguarding activities.136 Inventoried stocks were not disposed of under this
    contract due to a very long disposal procurement process and the closing of the project before the
    disposal work commenced (PDO Indicator #2 - 0%).
37. Prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides. The project helped improve the
    legal and regulatory framework for pesticide management (PDO Indicator #4 - 100%) by conducting
    a legal review of Mali's legislative and regulatory framework for pesticide management, in 2007,
    followed by technical support for its improvement based on the results. The project supported the
    National Directorate of Agriculture in the development of procedures of obtaining approval for the
    importation/export and the sale of pesticides. It also supported DNACPN in the development of laws
    for empty container management and management of seized pesticides. Project objectives and
    activities were integrated into national policies for hazardous waste management (such as the
    Politique Nationale d'Assainissement, endorsed by the Council of Ministers in 2009), where an entire
    chapter was devoted to obsolete pesticides management at both the public and private sectors.
    Awareness raising and sensitization efforts were made to educate relevant governmental agents about
    the introduced changes. New accumulations of associated waste were addressed by the project by
    developing and implementing an empty container strategy in 29 rural communities from 2009 to 2012
    in the cotton zones of the Malian Cotton Company (Compagnie Malienne pour le Développement des
    Textiles - CMDT). The project also increased government and public awareness with respect to the
    harmful effects of pesticide mishandling and contact with obsolete pesticides. It developed, validated
    and implemented a communication plan, which included various communication tools, such as films,
    radio, newspapers, as well as through workshops for NGOs. It is estimated that over 1.4 million
    people were affected by project communication, either via face-to-face workshops or through radio
    programs.

    Achievements were identified based on intended outcomes presented in Section B.1 and Annex I of the PAD (Report No:

38. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. A total of 4,451
    governmental and non-governmental staff received training on various topics related to pesticide and
    waste management, communication and M&E (Original PDO Indicator #5 - 100%). These skills were
    used to validate the pesticide inventory, enter the data into the PSMS data base, and participate in
    successful safeguarding and site cleanup operations. The project also invested resources in
    reactivating the CNGP, the executive pesticides regulating body; however, it is unclear whether this
    strengthened the institutional settings for pesticide management.

3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
39. The project aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effects of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities, by reducing
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement
    and, thus, is also rated moderately unsatisfactory (see Section 3.2).

3.4 EFFICIENCY
40. Efficiency – Rating Low: This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic data to
    support this rating are scarce. At appraisal, an economic or financial analysis was neither undertaken
    for ASP-P1 at the program level nor at the country level due to non-measurable benefits of reducing
    the risk of contaminating the environment. A lack of reliable baseline data in combination with
    controversial aspects related to the valuation of human life and natural resources did not permit a
    cost-benefit analysis. In addition, efficiency of capacity building and prevention activities is difficult
    to quantify due to the temporal disconnect between project support and actual results. For GEF
    purposes, the ASP-P1 underwent an incremental cost analysis to demonstrate the incremental benefit
    associated with the participation of GEF in the program. The analysis demonstrated that GEF support
    would lead to the channeling of considerable additional resources to the program ($35 million in
    addition to the $25 million from GEF), as well as important domestic (safeguarding local populations
    and environments and having in place meaningful prevention mechanisms) and global benefits
    (removal of trans-boundary pollution threats).
41. Although 77% of the entire project budget was disbursed at the end of the project, it was not used to
    dispose of any obsolete pesticide stocks, demonstrating low project disposal efficiency. In view of
    safeguarding and site cleanup activities, the project was successful in decontaminated five polluted
    sites using low cost techniques (e.g., land farming) and employing trained local staff, as well as
    collecting low risk stocks from numerous sites, also by local staff at relatively low cost. . These cost
    savings, coupled with the fact that the project achieved substantial prevention and capacity building
    results, alleviate the overall project efficiency rating.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
42. Overall Outcome - Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: On the basis of the project's efficiency (low),
    relevance (substantial), and PDO achievements (moderately unsatisfactory), the overall outcome is
    rated moderately unsatisfactory. The overall outcome rating takes into account that even though the
    key result – disposal - did not take place, important environmental and health impacts expected of the
    project in view of POPs-related illnesses which are likely to have been prevented in some of the most
                                                     98
      polluted sites (through safeguarding and soil clean up). Prevention (improved legislation, awareness
      raising and improved container management practices) and capacity building activities conducted by
      the project have the potential of sustaining these achievements.

3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
43. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development: The safeguarding and site cleanup
    operations had potentially a direct impact on nearby poor and farming communities, species and
    ecosystems. Since baseline data on affected populations, species and ecosystems was not conducted at
    appraisal, exact health and environmental impacts associated with the removal of POPs from the
    environment, are difficult to measure. However, a project beneficiaries report calculated that close to
    1.5 million people were reached by the project’s communication and awareness campaigns, and that
    over 4 million people live in vicinity to the contaminated sites. These people’s health is likely to be
    positively affected by the removal of POPs from their environments (water, soil, crops, fish,
    livestock, etc.) through the site cleanup and safeguarding activities. 137
44. Institutional change/strengthening: The project strengthened the government’s institutional capacity
    on several levels: (i) the regulatory and legal framework for pesticide management was strengthened;
    (ii) the government gained experience in the preparation of social and environmental impact
    assessments and management plans; (iii) the experience and skills gained in carrying out inventory,
    creating and utilizing a database, participating in safeguarding and soil remediation activities, and
    managing a multi-stakeholder project, can be applied to other projects and subsequently contribute to
    success; and (iv) knowledge gained on sound pesticide management through the various training and
    courses, which were provided to governmental and non-governmental staff (the beneficiary report
    calculated a total of 4,451 governmental and non-governmental staff receiving training on various
    topics related to pesticide and waste management, communication and M&E).
45. Other unintended outcomes and impacts: ASP-P1 Mali had an additional focus on soil treatment due
    to a number of sites known for having been polluted by pesticide spills and leaks. This provided an
    opportunity for the program to explore the issue of soil remediation and offer solutions by conducting
    assessments and carrying out pilot cleanup operations. In July 2008, a site in the town of Molodo,
    which contained large quantities of highly toxic obsolete pesticides contaminating local ground water
    supplies, was successfully cleaned up using a 'landfarming' technique for the first time in the
    country. 138 The operation was carried out with strong support from the TSU and Wageningen
    University. The results of the Molodo operation and similar operations in Dialakoroba, Niogoméra,
    Sévaré, Gao and Nara were analyzed and disseminated to other ASP countries in a workshop
    organized by FAO in Mali in 2010 and in 2009 at an international soil decontamination conference in
    Baltimore, Maryland.

   Land farming is a soil decontamination technique which involves taking polluted soil and encouraging the biodegradation
activity of soil microbes
                                                             99
3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
46. A specific completion, and/or ICR mission was not carried out, and thus no stakeholder workshop
    was held. The project submitted a draft completion report in March 2013, 139 which according to the
    PMU and the World Bank team, had not been shared with national stakeholders. The report identified
    the following key factors as having a negative impact on project implementation: (i) delays in
    mobilizing the MDTF, FFEM and additional GEF funds, resulting in implementation delays and a
    disposal funding gap; (ii) inability of the project to disburse funds due to a three months absence
    (March to June 2010) of a financial manager to sign transactions; and (iii) complex World Bank
    safeguards and procurement procedures.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

47. Risk to the development outcome - Rating High: Given Mali's post-conflict and transitional situation
    and the relatively low priority obsolete stocks cleanup is receiving in the country's recovery plans, it
    is unlikely that the obsolete pesticide stocks will be disposed of by the country without a donor-
    funded disposal project. Furthermore, Mali has a number of identified polluted sites which need
    cleaning up, but the government does not have the budget or skills to carry out such operations
    independently. In terms of prevention of new accumulations of obsolete pesticide stocks, the
    improved legislation and regulation is unlikely to have significant on-the-ground effect unless the
    government dedicates adequate resources to enforce them, which is also questionable. Mali's strong
    focus on agricultural intensification as a measure for economic development is likely to overpower
    any such efforts in the long run.

5. ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
48. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry - Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: While
    World Bank performance during preparation was adequate, program-related factors negatively
    affected quality at entry. Considerable efforts were invested by the World Bank in preparing the
    project, which involved agreements on project scope, budget, implementation arrangements, results,
    M&E arrangements, project work plans, FM and procurement. The World Bank also invested
    considerable efforts in securing project co-financing by meeting with potential donors and seeking
    collaboration with ongoing projects. Nonetheless, the preparation of the project was conducted in
    conjunction with preparatory activities at the program-level, which were lengthy (see Section 2.1 in
    the program-level ICR). In addition, while some of the fund raising efforts were successful, the delays
    during preparation resulted in some co-financing becoming unavailable. 140
49. Quality of World Bank supervision - Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The project was supervised
    by the program co-TTL responsible for francophone countries (Mali, Morocco and Tunisia) who was

139
   MEA/DNACPN’s draft progress report for the period June 2006-December 2012
140
   Funds were secured from the Netherlands, FFEM and MDTF. Co-financing from PASAOP was no longer available since the
project had closed at the time ASP-P1 Mali was approved (on December 31, 2006).
                                                            100
    based in Washington DC and later in Dakar, and a Mali-based co-TTL. The two co-TTLs ensured
    knowledge exchange between Mali and other countries on one hand, and contact with stakeholders on
    the other. Supervision missions by both TTLs took place regularly, albeit only once a year, with
    additional technical support and fiduciary missions in between. Aide Memoires were detailed,
    providing candid description of issues and risks. However, significant delays by the World Bank in
    the processing of the restructuring/additional GEF financing and MDTF funds as explained above and
    the unclear guidance on the disposal procurement process negatively affected project performance.
50. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Based on the above-
    presented evaluation, the overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
51. Government performance - Rating Satisfactory: The government of Mali continued to show
    commitment to the project and supported it throughout implementation. Commitment was evident
    from a) the integration of project objectives and activities in national policies; b) the timely and
    adequate provision of counterpart financing; and c) the close collaboration between the PMU and
    government officials during implementation, which facilitated overall project management. A wide
    variety of government representatives participated in the NSC, the CNGP, and thematic groups
    created for the project 141, training sessions and safeguarding operations (e.g., a soil contamination
    forum). The government initial reluctance to restructure the project contributed to the delays in
    obtaining the additional financing. However, this was not the result of lack of commitment to the
    project but rather from an aspiration to accomplish the original, more ambitions PDO.
52. Implementing Agency performance - Rating Moderately Satisfactory: DNACPN demonstrated high
    level of performance in the areas of stakeholder mobilization, coordination of activities, awareness
    raising, safeguard implementation and FM. M&E was properly conducted and progress reporting was
    done in a satisfactory manner. DNACPN's performance was hampered by weak procurement capacity
    and the refusal to receive offered World Bank support, as well as the low efficiency in the use of
    resources. DNACPN complied with all World Bank legal covenants, and executed its fiduciary
    duties.
53. Overall Borrower performance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: Based on the above-presented
    evaluation, the overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

54. The most significant lessons learned are drawn at the program-level, as the experience they are based
    on was often reflected across all country-specific projects; they are therefore discussed in the
    program-level ICR. Lessons learned that were particularly relevant to ASP-P1 Mali include: 142

141
    Such as the soil decontamination group, which comprised eleven focal points of the main relevant institutions including
DNACPN, Crop Protection Office, National Center for Locust Control, Health Directorate, Food Safety Agency, the Air Force,
Laboratory of Toxicology and Environmental Quality control and the Central Veterinary Laboratory; this group provided
information, technical support and advice to the PMU on issues related to soil decontamination. In addition, a prevention working
group comprised 16 focal points of the main institutions involved in pesticides management in Mali. The group provided
information related to pesticides management to the PMU and met on a semi-annual basis to review and evaluate progress made
under the prevention component, including the National Prevention Plan developed by the project.
142
    The lessons learned are summarized from the ASP-P1 draft progress report for June 2006-December 2012.
                                                             101
    •        Soil decontamination activities should be tailor-made for each site. ASP-P1 Mali's unique
             experience in soil decontamination demonstrated that each site has its own characteristics and
             requires different implementation considerations. Land farming or sealing contaminated soil in
             concrete are affordable solutions if conditions permit.
    •        National strategies for container management should be developed through a community-
             based approach. Such an approach could guarantee the full involvement of associations and
             producer groups, administrative and municipal authorities, decentralized technical services and
             NGOs. Agreements should be signed on container centralization and collection, which clearly
             define roles and responsibilities.
    •        Developing and implementing a pesticide management communication plan is a prerequisite
             for the implementation of sound pesticide management. The audience of the communication
             plan should be defined by stakeholders and target groups.
    •        The importance of joint development of a national prevention plan. A participatory process
             could ensure the involvement of all stakeholders in the prevention of new accumulations of
             obsolete pesticide stocks.

                                                             105
6. Comments and edits received on the draft ICR were equally incorporated. Additional comments
   included suggested lessons learned:
   •   A national inventory should be a preliminary step during project preparation, particularly in the
       technical and financial arrangements for the component associated with the removal and cleaning.
       This could avoid the financing gaps and the necessity to seek additional funds for the elimination
       of additional stocks of obsolete pesticides and related waste.
   •   If the PMU consists of specialists who are directly recruited by the implementing agency, as was
       the case for ASP-Mali, it is useful and necessary to add counterparts to capitalize on experiences
       and to strengthen the capacity of these structures. The selection criteria of these counterparts
       should be based on the profile and long-term availability of applicants.
   •   National teams composed of technical pesticide management officers, who are well trained and
       equipped with adequate facilities and equipment, are able to secure a certain category of obsolete
       pesticides and related waste. This category includes stocks of small amounts (less than 500 kg)
       and low risk (not belonging to Classes Ia and Ib WHO). Using national teams can strengthen
       national capacities in securing stockpiles of obsolete pesticides and related waste. Once these
       capabilities are integrated into the missions and activities of the departments concerned, they
       could perform similar operations without input and external funding after the closure of the
       project. Using national teams can also shorten lead times and reduce the costs of security
       operations and disposal.
   •   With regard to decontaminated soils, each site has its own characteristics. The history of the sites
       and nature of contaminants determine the technical options available for cleanup operations.
       Land-farming and confinement techniques in the contaminated concrete layer allow for solving
       soil decontamination problems with local human resources and at lower costs.
   •   A national empty container management strategy using community-based approaches guarantees
       the involvement of associations and producer groups, administrative and municipal authorities,
       structured and decentralized technical services and NGOs. It also enhances sustainability. The
       signing of agreements on local collection/grouping of empty packaging, which define the roles
       and responsibilities of each other, would demonstrate the commitment of those concerned. It is
       also a prerequisite for a community management strategy targeting empty containers.
   •   Development and implementation of a specific communication plan on pesticides management is
       a prerequisite for the implementation of sound management of pesticides. This plan must take
       internal and external communication into account. The external communication plan should be
       defined by stakeholders and target groups.
   •   The national prevention plan represents a road map for implementing activities targeted at
       preventing the accumulation of obsolete pesticide stocks. Its development should be based on a
       coordinated and responsible approach involving all stakeholders.
   •   The working group that focuses on implementing the national prevention plan should include all
       stakeholders. Group members should be nominated focal points by their respective stakeholder
       group. As such, they would be responsible for collecting information and data relating to their
       respective stakeholder group and contribute the same to the group work in order to contribute to a
       comprehensive overview of national pesticide management.

                                                   106
   •   Involving NGOs in project implementation allows for training and raising the awareness of local
       producers. Priority activities should relate to: (i) the development of, translation into local
       languages, and dissemination of informational guides on the hazards and risks and good
       management of pesticides; (ii) the design and dissemination of micro programs on good
       management practices, pesticides and empty containers; (iii) community monitoring of hazards
       related to the use of pesticides; (iv) promoting Integrated Pest Management (IPM); and (v)
       independent monitoring of operations for disposal of obsolete pesticides and related waste.

1. Country background: After expanding significantly in the 1980s, agricultural production stagnated in
   the 1990s because of the increased incidence of drought, which damaged output of the drought-
   sensitive cereals that dominated Moroccan agriculture. The agricultural sector had been considered
   inefficient; modern, large-scale farms characterized certain parts of the country, elsewhere, however,
   farming suffered from the fragmentation of the land, low rates of mechanization and fertilizer use,
   and limited use of selected seeds. Locusts had been occasionally a problem in the far south, as in
   2003-04, although crop damage had been small.
2. Sector background: At project approval, Morocco had imported approximately 9000 tonnes of
   pesticides per year, with the majority having been insecticides and fungicides. Large-scale farmers
   primarily used chemicals in controlling pests and diseases, whereas small farmers often used
   alternatives such as applying soil management or crop rotation.
3. Actions taken: Recognizing the potential hazard obsolete stocks of pesticides were posing to people,
   animals and to the environment, the Government of Morocco had developed legislative measures as
   well as qualified structures (laboratories and services) to handle pesticide issues. Since 2002,
   Morocco had taken a series of measures allowing the country to become eligible for international
   donations to reduce and eliminate pesticide stockpile and toxic waste. The Government of Morocco
   had initiated activities under its National Implementation Plan (NIP). 146 In preparation of ASP-P1, a
   preliminary inventory had been conducted and identified 700 tons of obsolete stocks at approximately
   225 sites. These stockpiles had been largely stocked for combating locust infestations and were held
   largely by the Ministries of Agriculture and Health. Only a small portion of the stocks was held by
   private companies.
4. Rationale for World Bank assistance: Please refer to Section 1.1 in the program-level ICR.
5. Higher-level objectives: The project intended to contribute to Morocco’s national development
   strategy, in the areas of public health, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and
   strengthening the agricultural sector. In particular, the ASP-P1 Morocco aimed to (i) improve the
   quality of life in poor communities by reducing environmental health risks, (ii) improve
   environmental protection, and (iii) enhance the capacity of the agricultural sector to better manage
   crop pests. In addition, the project aimed to consolidate various approaches to obsolete pesticide
   cleanup, generate practical lessons and produce practical tools that would facilitate its replication in
   other countries and regions. Contributing to international efforts to eliminate Persistent Organic
   Pollutants (POPs), improving management of toxic chemicals, and promoting alternatives to pesticide
   usage that include Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Vector Management (IVM),
   represented further objectives.

1.2 ORIGINAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND INDICATORS
6. The Project Development Objective (PDO), indicators, and components that are stated in the Project
   Appraisal Document (PAD) 147 slightly differ from those stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant
   Agreement. 148 This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented in the
   GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s
   implementation activities.
7. ASP-P1 Morocco’s original PDO as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement: 149 To
   assist the recipient in: a) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and
   associated waste; and b) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.
8. At appraisal, only an overall ASP-P1 results framework had been prepared (see program-level ASP
   ICR); results frameworks for the individual ASP-P1 countries, including Morocco, were intended to
   be finalized during the individual ASP-P1 country project launches. However, country-specific PDO
   indicators were developed at appraisal. For ASP-P1 Morocco, these were as follows:

                                  as presented in the PAD and GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement
      a. Inventory database of publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks in place and being used by the Project Management Unit
         (PMU) and stakeholders.
      b. Completion of Country Environmental and Social Assessment (CESA) and implementation of the measures contained
         therein.
      c. Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides stocks disposed of, as a result of the completion of the disposal services
         contract(s) in accordance with national and international laws and regulations.
      d. Legal and regulatory framework for pesticide management upgraded, including measures to strengthen compliance with
         the Conventions.
      e. The training program under Part D of the project is implemented and the knowledge acquired is being used by the PMU
         and stakeholders. 150
      f. The PMU is functional and its operation is satisfactory to the Bank.

1.6 OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
12. No changes were made to ASP-P1 Morocco. The project closed as originally scheduled on June 30,
    2010.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

13. Project preparation took place between 2001-2006, as part of preparatory activities at the program-
    level. It took more than five years from GEF eligibility in July 2001, and more than four years from
    concept note in July 2002 to have the project approved by the World Bank Board in December
    2006. 151
14. Soundness of the background analysis: Preparation was conducted in close collaboration between
    the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), with CropLife International (CLI)
    joining around appraisal (April 2004); mission reports do not indicate the participation of the World
    Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Pesticides Action Network (PAN-UK/PAN-Africa) during preparation.
    The key preparatory inputs were the PAD and the Operational Manual with varying levels of quality:
    the PAD contained mostly ASP-P1 level information and plans with very little country-specific
    information, while the Operational Manual presented a considerable amount of country
    information. 152 It was based on country background analyses, which had been carried out by national
    working groups. The World Bank carried out comprehensive procurement and Financial Management
    (FM) assessments in September 2004. While it was recognized by the World Bank, FAO, CLI and the
    government that the inventory carried out in 2002 had to be updated in order to determine the disposal
    budget, 153 the new inventory was postponed to the implementation phase, most likely due to
    budgetary constraints. Consequently, a tentative disposal budget was agreed on. 154
15. Assessment of project design: The project’s design (as for all ASP-P1 participating countries) was
    preconfigured at the program level, and did not reflect any country-specific modifications or lessons
    learned from pervious projects executed in Morocco. Design weaknesses at the program level that
    translated into implementation delays at the country level, including ASP-P1 Morocco, are outlined in
    Section 2.1 of the program-level ICR. At the project level, design weaknesses were inherent in the
    complex implementation arrangements, where overall project management was with the Ministry of
    Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries (Ministère de l’Agriculture, du Développement Rural
    et des Pêches Maritimes - MADRPM), but it was one of at least two identified executing entities,
    with unclear definition of responsibilities and budget allocations. 155 Another key weakness was the

151
    The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy partnership building/negotiation process at the program-level resulting from
the complex implementation arrangement and project design (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR).
152
    Information included considerable detail onthe legislative framework for pesticide management, stakeholder analysis, national
disposal options, processes for establishing national prevention and empty containers plans, procurement and financial
management procedures, health and safety procedures and an M&E framework.

154
    US$2.265 million for component A, of which US$165,000 for inventory and US$2.1 million for disposal.
155
    Within MADRPM, the Direction de la Protection des Végétaux, du Contrôle technique et de la Répression des Fraudes
(DPVCTRF) was the main executing agency and host of the PMU; the Direction de la Surveillance et de la Prévention des
Risques (DSPR) within MATEE was the second executing agency. The Operational Manual also includes the Direction de
l’Epidémiologie et de la lutte contre les Maladies (DELM) within the Ministry of Health (Ministère de Sante) as a third executing
agency; however this is not mentioned in the PAD.
                                                                 127
      agreed disbursement arrangements, which relied on government’s central budgeting and disbursement
      system (see more under Section 2.2).
16. Government commitment: During preparation, the World Bank reported on strong government
    commitment as was evident from its proactivity in starting to analyze the baseline situation before it
    was formally agreed on. 156 In addition, in 2003, the government established multi-stakeholder
    thematic working groups and a steering committee. Finally, the government took the necessary
    actions to process the ratification of the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which was a condition for
    joining the program. The process was finalized in June 2004.
17. Assessment of risks: The PAD and the Operational Manual presented brief and partial risk
    assessments, which focused mainly on crosscutting and program-level risks; corresponding mitigation
    measures were proposed. The World Bank procurement and FM/disbursement assessments carried
    out during preparation identified respective risks, which were specific to ASP-P1 Morocco, and
    offered mitigation measures. The risks, which were also reflected in the PAD and the Operational
    Manual, correctly highlighted possible future delays in commitments and payment as a result of
    Morocco’s pre-financing system; 157 weak FM capacity of the implementing agency; and the joint
    responsibility of the executing agencies to produce Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs). The
    appraisal mission in April 2004 identified weak inter-ministerial coordination of prevention activities
    as a project risk; however, this risk was not included in the PAD or the Operational Manual.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
18. The implementation of ASP-P1 Morocco experienced significant delays throughout implementation,
    which ended with the closing of the project on June 30, 2010 as scheduled (with no extensions).
    During the December 2009 mid-term review, and in view of unsatisfactory project performance, the
    World Bank and the government agreed on an action plan of corrective measures; its timely
    implementation served as a minimum condition for a closing date extension. However, by June 30,
    2010 the action plan had only been partially implemented, leading to a World Bank decision to close
    the project.
19. Key factors that affected implementation included:
      •   Institutional challenges most notably an internal government restructuring, halted project
          implementation. Project management was substantially affected by an internal government
          restructuring process, which resulted in a lack of institutional leadership, a need to redefine a
          number of project aspects (such as disbursement arrangements and counterpart financing), and a
          need for repeated training. 158 In addition, project management was affected by (i) an unclear

préparation, Aide-mémoire, December 2003
157
    Whereby payments are made directly to suppliers, regardless of the source of funding, by the Moroccan Treasury (Trésorerie
Générale du Royaume) from the Budget funds upon submission of supporting documentation and payment orders by the project
unit. Reimbursement is made directly from the grant account.
158
    MADRPM underwent a significant restructuring process. In May 2009, the PMU was temporarily transferred from DPVCTRF
to the Department of Health Safety of Food Products (Direction de la Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits Alimentaires - DSSPA)
under MADRPM. In January 2010 the PMU was again transferred to the newly established ONSSA, which became the agency
responsible for pesticide management and for project implementation. In July 2009, the PMU was mainly composed of former
DPVCTRF staff who were assigned to DSSPA until ONSAA was established. These changes impacted the PMU because it had
                                                             128
         definition of roles and responsibilities of PMU members from both MADRPM and the Ministry
         of Spatial Planning, Water and Environment (Ministère de l’Aménagement du Territoire, de l’Eau
         et de l’Environnement – MATEE); (ii) a lack of full time staff 159 and the staff’s weak fiduciary
         and project management capacity; (iii) ineffective collaboration between stakeholders (most
         likely due to unclear definition of roles, responsibilities and budgets); and (iv) low-level
         representation in the Steering Committee. Challenging disbursement arrangements and a lack of
         flexibility in budget planning further affected project implementation.
    •    Lengthy procedures to mobilize GEF funds in absence of a project special account: The project
         was dependent on the government’s budget because designated/special accounts were largely not
         allowed in Morocco; in order to access the GEF funds, each executing agency had to develop and
         submit annual budgets to the government, to be approved as part of the national budget approval
         process, and once approved, changes to the budget were difficult to make. The lengthy process
         also caused project activities to only begin nine months after effectiveness. In addition, in order to
         effect payments, each contract had to go through the Ministry of Finance’s control in addition to
         the World Bank approval process, which took considerable time. 160
    •    Higher than estimated amounts of obsolete pesticides caused delays: It took seven months for the
         project to complete an inventory (December 2007-July 2008), and 22 months to enter all data into
         FAO’s Pesticide Stock Management System (PSMS) and have it validated (March 2008-January
         2010; originally 15 months were allocated for data validation). A data validation workshop took
         place in February 2010. The underlying reasons for these delays were: (i) increase in the number
         of sites (340 instead of 225 originally planned); (ii) difficulties in carrying out an inventory
         during the summer and Ramadan; (iii) repeated visits to some sites due to removal of stocks and
         poor quality of the collected data/photos as a result of insufficient training; and (iv) the large
         number of pesticides found at the sites, resulting in multiple data sheets to be entered into the
         PSMS. 161
    •    Insufficient and delayed technical support affected implementation performance: FAO’s
         Technical Support Unit (TSU) support was insufficient (e.g., inventory, PSMS management and
         M&E). In addition, while the recruitment of the Technical Advisor for Disposal (TAD) was
         initiated in January 2007, she was only recruited by CLI in January 2010. The valuable support,
         however, came too late and was not used by the PMU before project closing.




to relocate to a new facility with unreliable internet connection, which was necessary to maintain the PSMS and overall project
management.
159
    The coordinator, because of his other responsibilities as the Head of Division within the DPVCTRF, could not commit all of
his time to the project; the four technical officers were similarly involved in other activities in DPVCTRF
160
    Any budget allocation request, which had not been specifically included in the GEF Grant Agreement, such as MATEE’s and
NGOs’ budgets, was not approved, and activities were consequently not implemented. Sources: Programme Africain Relatif aux

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND
UTLIZATION
20. Overall M&E - Rating Unsatisfactory.
21. M&E design – Rating Unsatisfactory: The design of the M&E framework, as presented in the
    Operational Manual, was generally appropriate but lacked the most important element – a project-
    level results framework. Although the appraisal mission developed a project-level results
    framework, 162 it was not reflected in the PAD and the Operational Manual, both presenting only the
    overall ASP-P1 results framework (see program-level ASP ICR) and six country-specific
    Performance Monitoring Indicators.163 These indicators did not allow for adequate monitoring of
    project implementation progress because they focused on measuring outputs as opposed to progress
    towards project outcomes. Expected results under the prevention component, in particular, were not
    adequately considered by the indicators. The PAD further indicated that a country-specific framework
    would be finalized during project launch. Other key M&E elements, such as strategies and
    responsibilities, were detailed in the Operations Manual. The inventory was expected to provide
    baseline and target values for disposal, and overall M&E was expected to be carried out using
    standardized methodologies for data collection and quality assurance. The responsibility for data
    collection rested with the PMU with data provided by the various project stakeholders, assisted by the
    TSU and external consultants.
22. M&E implementation and utilization – Rating Unsatisfactory: A project-specific results framework
    was developed with the government during the February 2008 World Bank mission; however, it was
    not officially introduced to the project (through a restructuring or addition to the Operations Manual),
    and it is unclear whether the PMU used it to produce progress reports. The late completion of the
    national database (in January 2010) left little time to use these data for a CESA and disposal
    activities.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
23. Safeguard compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies:
    OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management.
24. ASP-P1 Morocco complied with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment: The project did not begin to
    prepare the CESA by the project closing due to considerable delays in the completion of data
    validation of the inventory as mentioned above, coupled with weak PMU procurement capacity. In
    terms of on-the-ground activities’, the World Bank observed at mid-term that some health and safety
    procedures had not been properly applied during the inventory process by the trained teams. No other
    field activities took place, which necessitated consideration of OP 4.01. Note that the safeguard rating
    applies to activities that took place before the project closed in June 2010. Activities not conducted
    by the project closing (i.e., preparation of a CESA and EMP) were not factored into the rating.

163
   Lengthy discussions between the partners during project preparation on whether to have an M&E system at the program-level
alone, or also at the country-level, may have contributed to the absence of an M&E system at the country-level at project launch.
However, no information was available on whether it was a deliberate decision not to have an M&E system in place at the
country-level.
                                                                130
25. OP 4.09 on Pest Management: Since project activities themselves met requirements of a pest
    management plan (i.e., through pesticide management, IPM and capacity building), individual
    country projects, including ASP-P1 Morocco, were not required to prepare self-standing documents.
    See Section 2.4 in the program-level for more details.
26. Financial Management Compliance – Rating Unsatisfactory: Despite training sessions provided by
    the World Bank, the PMU’s financial management capacity was insufficient to ensure smooth
    management of funds and timely preparation of reports. Financial management was further weakened
    by the above-mentioned disbursement arrangements and institutional changes. In December 2007,
    following considerable procurement delays, the PMU recruited an administrative, financial and
    procurement consultant, who was tasked to strengthen the PMU’s fiduciary capacity and to develop a
    financial management manual for the project. Poor performance of the consultant, partly caused by
    delayed payments by the government’s treasury department, resulted in the termination of the
    contract in June 2009. In December 2009, another fiduciary consultant was identified; however, the
    recruitment was not finalized due to the institutional changes and proximity to the closing date.
27. GEF disbursement was low throughout the project’s lifetime. The first disbursement was recorded in
    December 2008 (5.9%), two years after project approval, mainly on inventory equipment, inventory
    training, a vehicle and operating costs. In May 2009, disbursement increased to 7.4% and remained at
    this level until project closing. The low level of disbursement is linked to the above-mentioned
    implementation delays (the CESA and disposal contract, which together were allocated over 56% of
    the GEF grant amount, were not implemented by project closing), and cumbersome disbursement
    procedures.
28. Procurement – Rating Unsatisfactory: Project procurement was considerably delayed due to the
    PMU’s weak capacity and the centralized contract awarding system. A number of training sessions
    and the above-mentioned recruitment of a consultant did not strengthen procurement capacity.
    Despite the World Bank authorization to use ASP-Tunisia’s list of pre-qualified disposal firms, the
    disposal procurement process did not advance as expected, and at project closing, only a first draft of
    the tender document was available.

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
29. Post completion: After the project closed, two related activities were carried out by the government
    with donor support: (i) a national team composed of ten technical staff from the Ministry of Public
    Health received training by the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM)
    project, led by the Ministry of Public Health. Consequently, 50 tonnes of
    Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were packed and stored in Oued Zem. This DDT stock is
    expected to be disposed of under a GEF project titled 'Alternatives to DDT in the Middle East and
    North Africa', led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment
    Program (UNEP); (ii) in 2011, at the request of the government, FAO implemented a small project,
    which identified and qualified priorities for a national program on sound POPs and pesticides
    management. The following priorities were identified: (i) revising pesticide legislation; (ii)
    establishing a registration system for pesticides used in agriculture, public and animal health; (iii)




                                                   131
      technical and analytical support for pesticide quality control; and (iv) extension services and farmer
      field schools. 164
30. Next phase: In January 2012, the GEF approved a concept for a follow-up disposal and prevention
    project titled ‘Disposal of Obsolete Pesticides including POPs and Implementation of Pesticides
    Management Programme’, to be managed by FAO. 165 The project is designed to address the above-
    mentioned priorities, in addition to (i) disposing of the stocks and remediation of contaminated soil
    identified by ASP-P1 Morocco, as well as stocks of a recently banned pesticide (endosulfan); (ii)
    elimination of legacy empty containers and development of a container management system; and (iii)
    development of a network for information exchange within and among pesticide using sectors. The
    full project proposal is currently being developed by FAO.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
31. Relevance – Rating High: Even though the project’s objectives were ambitious, they were and they
    continue to be highly relevant to Morocco, especially in view of the implementation of the Green
    Morocco Plan, and its focus on increasing agricultural productivity through intensification of
    production systems. The project is similarly relevant to the most recent Country Partnership Strategy
    (CPS) 166 Program Area 2.6 (Agricultural Sector Reform), which looks to increase competitiveness
    and diversification of the agricultural sector; and Program Area 3.3 (Solid Waste Management) to
    support disposal practices complying with international social and environmental standards. Project
    objectives and components also support the Government of Morocco in complying with the
    Stockholm Convention on POPs, the Basel Convention on Control of Trans boundary Movements of
    Hazardous Waste and their Disposal, and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent
    Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
32. The project has been evaluated against its PDO by measuring achievements at the time of the project
    closing (June 30, 2010).
33. PDO achievement – Rating Unsatisfactory: The assessment took the project’s six PDO indicators
    into account, of which two were fully achieved (100%), two were partly achieved (50%) and two
    were not achieved (0%). The three main project outcomes measured by the indicators include: 167 (i)
    sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides; (ii) prevention of accumulation of new
    stockpiles of obsolete pesticides; and (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of
    pesticide management.

34. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides and contaminated sites. The level of risks
    emanating from publicly held obsolete pesticides and associated waste to adjacent and wider
    communities or critical natural resources was determined and quantified through the completion of a
    national inventory of publicly held obsolete pesticides in 2007-2008 and its validation in 2008-2010
    (PDO Indicator #1 - 100%). However, this information was not used to prepare a CESA (PDO
    Indicator #2 - 0%) or contract a disposal company by project closing. Inventoried stocks were not
    disposed of under a disposal contract due to considerable delays in the inventory and validation
    activities, and the lack of a CESA as a guiding document (PDO Indicator #3 - 0%).
35. Prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides. Project and parallel government-
    led activities taking place during the project lifetime helped improve the legal and regulatory
    framework for pesticide management (PDO Indicator #4 - 100%) by improving several
    pesticide/waste management-related legal texts and regulations. In 2008, the ASP NGO network
    conducted three workshops on pesticide and empty container management. In June 2009, both PAN-
    Morocco (established in February 2009) and the ASP NGO network collaborated to develop and
    disseminate a brochure on the proper management of pesticides. Other awareness raising tools were
    to be developed by the project but did not materialize due to procurement delays.
36. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. In October 2007, 21
    plant protection agents received inventory training from the TSU; and in March 2008, ten plant
    protection agents received data management training using the PSMS from the TSU. PMU staff
    participated in two World Bank fiduciary training workshops in 2008 and in 2009. The training
    sessions were not entirely effective in increasing the PMU and stakeholders’ capacities in the subject
    matters (Original PDO Indicator #5 – 50%).

3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
37. The project aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effects of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities by reducing
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement
    (see Section 3.2).

3.4 EFFICIENCY
38. Efficiency – Rating Low: This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic data to
    support this rating are scarce. At appraisal, an economic or financial analysis was neither undertaken
    for ASP-P1 at the program- nor at the country-level due to non-measurable benefits of reducing the
    risk of contaminating the environment. A lack of reliable baseline data in combination with
    controversial aspects related to the valuation of human life and natural resources neither allowed for a
    cost-benefit analysis. In addition, efficiency of capacity building and prevention activities is difficult
    to quantify due to time disconnect between project support and actual results. For GEF purposes, the
    ASP-P1 underwent incremental cost analysis of achieving global benefits to address the issue of
    obsolete pesticides in the participating countries.
39. The project was effective for over three years (February 2007 to June 2010) but in fact,
    implementation took place for about two and a half years (November 2007-June 2010). Within this
    time period little on the ground achievements were recorded although a fully staffed PMU was in
                                                     133
      place. Of the 7.4% total disbursement at closing, 56% were spent on operating costs while the rest
      was spent mainly on inventory equipment and a project vehicle, demonstrating low project efficiency.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
40. Overall Outcome – Rating Unsatisfactory: On the basis of the project’s efficiency (low), relevance
    (high), and PDO achievements (unsatisfactory), the overall outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The
    overall outcome rating takes into account the few project achievements and lack of any tangible
    environmental and health impacts.

3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
41. Not Applicable

3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
42. A three days mission took place shortly before project closing (June 7-9, 2010); however, it did not
    include a stakeholder workshop. The government did not prepare a completion report.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

43. Risk to the development outcome - Rating High: The government of Morocco is aware of the risks
    posed by obsolete pesticides, but lacks the capacity and resources to safeguard and dispose of the
    stocks. According to FAO, 168 without a donor-supported project, inventory and disposal would not be
    completed, and heavily contaminates sites could not be cleaned up. Pesticides management will
    continue to be addressed periodically without coordination and connection to a national strategic
    framework. FAO’s planned follow up project could fill these gaps.

5. ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
44. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The
    preparation of the project was conducted in conjunction with preparatory activities at the program-
    level, which were lengthy (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). The World Bank made
    considerable preparation efforts, which involved agreements on project scope, implementation
    arrangements, work plans, FM and procurement. However, it was not effective in clearly defining
    project implementation arrangements and embedding clear responsibilities and budgets in either the
    PAD or the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, causing significant implementation problems later on.
    In addition, the World Bank did not agree with the government on simpler disbursement
    arrangements. This worsened quality at entry, which was already adversely affected by problematic
    program-related design factors.

45. Quality of World Bank supervision – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The project was supervised
    by the program co-TTL responsible for francophone countries (Mali, Morocco and Tunisia) and a
    country co-TTL, both based in Washington DC. Five supervision and/or technical support missions
    (including the mid-term review mission) and a closing mission were conducted between February
    2007 and June 2010, averaging twice a year. Aide Memoires were detailed, providing candid
    description of issues and risks. Expertise brought in these missions (operations, pesticide
    management, procurement, FM and safeguards) were adjusted to meet the perceived project needs. In
    addition, World Bank fiduciary staff based in the Rabat office provided additional support to the
    PMU. However, the negative effect of repeated TTLs changes (four in total) is noted. In addition, the
    World Bank was not proactive in offering adjustments to the project, such as restructuring, in a timely
    manner.
46. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Based on the above-
    presented evaluation, the overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
47. Government performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The government of Morocco
    showed commitment to the issue of pesticide management by working to improve a number of legal
    and regulatory texts during the life of the project. However, the government did not provide the
    necessary high-level oversight to the project via the steering committee and dictated cumbersome
    disbursement procedures. While the national authorities were unanimous in confirming their high-
    level commitment to the World Bank, 169 this was clearly disconnected from project implementation
    performance.
48. Implementing Agency performance – Rating Unsatisfactory: The PMU’s management weaknesses
    were exacerbated by the restructuring of MADRPM and the shifting of the unit between
    directorates/agencies. Although the PMU demonstrated adequate technical capacity, its procurement,
    FM and planning capacities did not improve despite training and other support it received.
49. Overall Borrower performance – Rating Unsatisfactory: Based on the above-presented evaluation
    and the project’s unsatisfactory outcome rating, the overall borrower performance is rated
    unsatisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

50. The most significant lessons learned are drawn at the program level, as the experience they are based
    on was often reflected across all country-specific projects; they are therefore discussed in the
    program-level ICR. Lessons learned that were particularly relevant to ASP-P1 Morocco include:
      •   Activities and disbursement schedules should be realistic. Projects involving a number of
          executing agencies are inherently complex and should dictate realistic operational and
          disbursement timetables accordingly.
      •   Steering committees should ensure the sustained participation of decision-making staff. The
          participation of lower level staff in meetings greatly limits the effectiveness of such a committee

              to fulfill its role as a conduit between government priorities, operational progress and results
              achieved; further, it greatly limits its ability to dictate corrective measures.

F. Results Framework Analysis - At project approval, no country-specific result framework existed;
only six PDO Indicators were defined. Following a Level 1 Restructuring in June 2011, a country-specific
results framework was introduced. The original six PDO Indicators were revised and reduced to two PDO
Indicators, and in addition, four Intermediate Outcome Indicators were introduced.

Project Development Objective (PDO) - as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement: 172
To assist the recipient in: (a) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and
associated waste; and (b) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.
Revised PDO - as presented in the Level 1 restructuring of June 2011 (Report No: 62795-ZA): To assist
the Recipient in the development and piloting of a sustainable system to identify, collect and dispose of
obsolete pesticides and associated waste.

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) - as presented in the PAD (Report No: 32232-MNA):
Reduction of the effects of Persistent Pollutants (POPs) on the global environment.
Revised GEO – Not Applicable

(a) PDO Indicator(s) - Original PDO Indicators as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement
are assessed against achievements realized at the time of the project’s Level 1 restructuring in June 2011;
revised PDO Indicators are assessed against achievements realized at project closing in June 2012.

    The PDO, indicators, and components that are stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) slightly differ from those
stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement. This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented
in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s implementation
activities.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1. Country background: South Africa’s agricultural share of the economy has been outstripped by those
   of the mining and secondary industries. In the 1930s, agriculture contributed about 20% of the GDP;
   at project approval in 2005, the sector’s share of the GDP had dropped to 2.6%. 174 Despite the
   farming industry's declining share, it has remained vital to the economy, development, and stability of
   South Africa, with the industry employing approximately 30% of the workforce.
2. Sector background: To boost production, chemical pesticides had been widely used in the
   agricultural sector. These included large quantities of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
   between the 1950s and early 1980, before a 1983 ban on all uses of DDT as an active ingredient for
   agricultural purposes was introduced. The environment in which pesticides were applied, however,
   had been largely uncontrolled, as pesticides had primarily been used by unskilled farm workers with a
   low level of literacy and by households in domestic applications. The same was relevant for
   chemicals sold to the public or used in products. Chemicals sold to the industry, on the other hand,
   had been sold within a controlled environment where workers were skilled or semi-skilled and the use
   could be managed. Another use of pesticides concerned the health sector to prevent and control
   malaria. Since 1946, DDT had been used for malaria vector control in South Africa for indoor
   residual spraying. 175 In 1996, the government stopped the usage of DDT and relied on pyrethroid
   insecticides. However, DDT was re-introduced for indoor residual spraying in 2000, at the height of a
   malaria epidemic.
3. Obsolete pesticide accumulation: The accumulation of obsolete pesticides in South Africa had
   resulted from pesticide bans, insufficient control, and a lack of awareness of their efficient use. In
   general, government involvement in pesticide purchasing had been limited and the import and
   distribution was conducted mainly by the private sector, and large amounts of obsolete pesticides had
   been accumulated by private farmers. In addition, the industry had accumulated large amounts of
   pesticide stocks due to the unavailability of local destruction technologies, and the high scale of
   commercial farming throughout the country also resulted in significant amounts of obsolete stocks.
4. Institutional background: Between 1947 and 2010, management of pesticides was governed by the
   National Department of Agriculture (NDA, currently titled Department of Agriculture, Forestry and
   Fisheries - DAFF). 176 In 2010, DAFF approved and published the national Pesticides Management
   Policy, 177 which stated that DAFF would receive a statutory mandate to regulate pesticides in
   collaboration with other relevant departments through Memoranda of Understanding; and that

    The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Profile South Africa, 2005
175
    In 1996, DDT was replaced with pyrethroids before a subsequent increase in infection rates had forced the reintroduction of
DDT in 2000.

    Under the Fertilizers, Farm Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act of 1947.

South Africa. GG No 33899, GN 1120 of 2010. DAFF 2010.
                                                               152
      collection programs for obsolete pesticides would be instituted by DAFF. However, since 2008,
      pesticide waste has been managed by the Department of Water and Environmental Affairs (DEA). 178
5. Actions taken: In 1997, DAFF launched a National Retrieval Project (NRP) aimed at disposing
   unwanted pesticides nation-wide. With national funds, pesticides were centralized in 45 collection
   depots, and approximately 1,040 tonnes of obsolete pesticides, including 70 tonnes of DDT and other
   Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), were disposed of overseas and locally. 179 Different surveys
   undertaken in the Stellenbosch and neighboring areas in 1995, 2000, and 2003, however, concluded
   that since the NRP, new stocks had accumulated. In addition to government owned stocks that had
   been used to combat migratory pests, there were significant quantities scattered amidst the estimated
   55,000-60,000 commercial farms throughout the country. In 2004, the Association of Veterinary and
   Crops Associations of South Africa (AVCASA) and the Endangered Wildlife Trust (a local Non-
   Governmental Organization (NGO)) initiated a project, which collected pesticides directly from
   households. Obsolete pesticides were dropped off at participating nurseries countrywide, to then be
   collected and repackaged for disposal. The initiative collected approximately 12 tonnes of pesticides,
   including 2% of POPs, which were stored in a landfill facility. These stocks were subsequently
   integrated into ASP-P1 South Africa.
6. Rationale for World Bank assistance: Please refer to Section 1.1 in the program-level ICR.
7. Higher-level objectives: The project intended to contribute to South Africa’s national development
   strategies in the areas of public health, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and to
   strengthen the agricultural and rural development sector. In particular, the project aimed to (i)
   improve the quality of life in poor communities by reducing environmental health risks, (ii) improve
   environmental protection, and (iii) enhance the capacity of the agricultural sector to better manage
   crop pests. Contributing to international efforts to eliminate POPs, improving management of toxic
   chemicals and promoting alternatives to pesticide usage that include Integrated Pest Management
   (IPM) and Integrated Vector Management (IVM) represented further objectives.

1.2 ORIGINAL PDO AND INDICATORS
8. The Project Development Objective (PDO), indicators, and components that are stated in the Project
   Appraisal Document (PAD) 180 slightly differ from those stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant
   Agreement. This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented in the
   GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s
   implementation activities.

9. At appraisal, only an overall ASP-P1 results framework had been prepared (see program-level ICR);
   results frameworks for the individual ASP-P1 countries, including South Africa, were intended to be
   finalized during the individual ASP-P1 country project launches. However, country-specific PDO
   indicators were developed at appraisal. For ASP-P1 South Africa, these were as follows:

1.3 REVISED PDO AND INDICATORS
10. The PDO and associated indicators for ASP-P1 South Africa were revised through a Level 1
    restructuring on June 30, 2011. 183
11. ASP-P1 South Africa’s revised PDO: To assist the recipient in the development and piloting of a
    sustainable system to identify, collect and dispose of obsolete pesticides and associated waste.
12. ASP-P1 South Africa’s revised PDO Indicators: (i) A system for identifying, collecting and
    disposing of private and public obsolete pesticide stocks and associated waste developed through
    collaboration with the private sector association; and (ii) three pilot safeguarding and/or disposal
    operations implemented.

1.4 MAIN BENEFICIARIES
13. The original project design as described in the PAD targeted: (i) rural communities and individuals
    living in proximity to publicly held stocks of obsolete pesticides across the country, and (ii)
    government agencies, principally DEA and DAFF, which were expected to benefit from sustainable

181
    The GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement defined associated waste as materials that are contaminated by obsolete pesticides,
including inter alia containers, equipment, and heavily contaminated soils where the World Bank agrees that those soils are
within the project scope.

       mechanisms aimed at managing accumulations of publicly held obsolete pesticides, and targeted
       training. Following the expansion of the project's scope to include private stocks and reduction of
       activities to focus on the Limpopo, Western Cape and Free State provinces, the main beneficiaries of
       the project became: (i) small scale farmers in the three provinces, and (ii) the pesticide industry,
       which became an active player in both the cleanup of the three provinces and the development of
       long-term mechanisms for collecting and disposing stocks.

1.5 ORIGINAL AND REVISED COMPONENTS

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
15. ASP-P1 South Africa was prepared between 2001 and 2005, as part of preparatory activities at the
    program-level. It took more than four years from GEF eligibility in July 2001, and more than three
    years from concept note in July 2002 to project approval by the Board in September 2005. 186
16. Soundness of background analysis: While a considerable amount of background analysis was
    conducted during project preparation, key data were missing, which could have qualified and
    quantified needed interventions. The government's laboratory, financial and procurement capacity
    was assessed, existing IPM practices and relevant national legislation were analyzed, and previous
    clean up experience was taken into account. Although the World Bank team recommended carrying
    out a rapid inventory and an assessment of disposal technological options during preparation, 187 these
    and a number of other preparatory activities were postponed to the implementation phase. Key

186
    The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy partnership building/negotiation process at the program-level resulting from
the complex implementation arrangement and project design (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR).
187
    The appraisal Aide-Memoire also recommended carrying out a pesticides management baseline and a brief audit of the project
management capability of PMU staff.
                                                               157
      preparatory outputs such as the PAD and the Operational Manual were therefore lacking: (i) a precise
      estimate of the nature and amount of stocks to determine the focus (public vs. private stocks) and
      budget of the project; (ii) an assessment of disposal technological options (also to determine costs);
      and (iii) an analysis of pesticide use in the country, identifying the sources of stocks. They were
      further lacking a country-specific results framework and a disbursement estimate, and contained only
      preliminary work plans and cost tables. World Bank preparation mission reports demonstrate good
      collaboration between DEA, DAFF, the World Bank, FAO and CLI. Missions were carried out jointly
      and there was general consensus on the project design by the key stakeholders. 188 Representatives
      from relevant central and provincial departments, NGOs, the pesticide industry and research
      institutions provided recommendations on the design of the inventory. There is no indication,
      however, that communities were consulted during preparation. These consultations were planned to
      take place during implementation. DEA and DAFF agreed on their respective responsibilities for
      implementation in line with their departmental focus: DEA intended to focus on the inventory, the
      CESA, and disposal activities (Component A), while DAFF intended to lead prevention activities
      (Component B).
17. Assessment of project design: The project’s design (as for all ASP-P1 participating countries) was
    preconfigured at the program-level, and did not reflect country-specific needs and modifications.
    Using a broad generic program-level design affected project implementation performance of ASP-P1
    South Africa: (i) the project’s focus on publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks was not relevant to
    South Africa’s environment, as the majority of stocks was privately held, and a substantial amount of
    publicly held obsolete pesticides had already been disposed of in prior years; and (ii) the envisaged
    inventory and subsequent data maintenance through application of FAO’s Pesticide Stock
    Management System (PSMS) were not considered cost-effective in light of large quantities of
    obsolete pesticides being held privately and an already existing national register that was used by the
    government to maintain pesticide data.
18. No country-specific lessons learned were spelled out in the PAD, while some were highlighted in the
    Operational Manual. The key lesson learned for South Africa emerged from previous disposal
    initiatives that had been undertaken in the country, which demonstrated that prevention strategies
    were as important as the actual disposal of stocks. It should be noted that previous cleanup operations
    showed that in South Africa, unlike other ASP-P1 projects, government involvement in pesticide
    purchasing had been extremely limited and the import and distribution was conducted mainly by the
    private sector. 189
19. Government commitment: Government showed high level of commitment towards the issue of
    pesticide management throughout preparation. During project pre-appraisal, high-level government
    officials expressed their interest in launching the project; 190 at appraisal, the project was considered a
    priority for the government.191 It should be noted that at the time South Africa requested World
    Bank/GEF assistance through ASP-P1, the country was in the early process of preparing a new
    legislation to strengthen the regulation of chemical and hazardous waste; the project was intended to
    be a key instrument to implement this policy.

20. Assessment of risks: While country-specific risks were not discussed in the PAD, the Operational
    Manual included a comprehensive risk assessment. Risks within the control of the project were
    correctly associated with poor project planning, a possible lack of funds and public opposition against
    to project activities resulting from insufficient awareness. Risks outside the control of the project
    were also adequately identified and included changes in national priorities or government
    implementation arrangements, delays related to local bureaucracy/issuance of licenses and permits,
    seasonal weather patterns, and a lack of support from farmers and the pesticide industry. Correlating
    risk mitigation measures for controllable risks were identified in the Operational Manual.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
21. The project was subject to two extensions for a total of 31 months, and a Level 1 restructuring in
    2011.
22. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes included:
      •   Recognition of project approach not being appropriate for South Africa affected implementation
          of originally envisaged disposal activities. During the first year of project implementation, the
          envisaged project design was judged being inadequate by all partners involved, as it was not
          applicable to the South African context. The existing design that was applied to all ASP-P1
          participating countries, including South Africa, was based on the assumption that pesticide stocks
          were held by public agencies and that the private sector would be relatively underdeveloped;
          however, in South Africa the majority of stocks was held by private farmers and not by the
          government - public stocks were limited to controlling migratory pests and a substantial amount
          of publicly held obsolete pesticides had already been disposed of in prior years.192 To allow for a
          better assessment of the issue of obsolete pesticide stocks in the South African context that could
          inform the development of an improved project implementation approach, the World Bank and
          partners quickly reacted by agreeing to pilot the identification and collection of both public and
          private stocks in one province, Limpopo. 193
      •   The first phase of the pilot was completed in 2007, with CLI having played a key role in the
          planning and implementation. The pilot revealed higher than estimated stocks of obsolete
          pesticides, and the already presumed high proportion of privately held stocks. The pilot
          confirmed the need to adopt a different collection and disposal model for the project, limiting the
          project’s geographic coverage and encompassing both private and public stocks because: (i) a
          country-wide obsolete pesticide cleanup was not considered suitable as it was estimated to cost
          about US$3 million more than budgeted at appraisal; 194 and (ii) the cleanup of predominantly
          privately-held stocks using public funds would not have been supported by DEA, as South




192
    During the late 1990s, pesticides were centralized in 45 collection depots, and approximately 1,040 tonnes of obsolete
pesticides, including 70 tonnes of DDT and other POPs, were disposed of overseas and locally with national funds. See Section
1.1 for more information.
193
    Limpopo, a province in the north of South Africa, was considered well prepared for participation in the pilot, and was
characterized by a strong agricultural sector.
194
    Following the collection of approximately 102.5 tonnes of obsolete pesticides at Limpopo alone, 700-900 tonnes were
estimated to be scattered across South Africa, versus 250 tonnes estimated at appraisal.
                                                               159
          African law required the producer or generator of pollution to pay for the costs of avoiding
          pollution, cleaning up, or remedying its effects. 195
      •   Development of a different collection and disposal model, including the creation of a public-
          private partnership was a lengthy process. The government and the World Bank agreed to halt
          originally envisaged project activities until a better adapted project model for the disposal of
          obsolete pesticides in South Africa was identified. Instead, the focus was placed on facilitating a
          dialogue between the government and the private sector, to establish a partnership for collection
          and disposal of obsolete stocks, which the new approach could be based on; however, given the
          stakes involved, the process was lengthy and slow. The mid-term review, conducted in January
          2009, consequently resulted in a sharp downgrade of ratings and confirmed the need to
          restructure the project for better alignment with the country's setting. Eventually in March 2010,
          and informed by the Limpopo pilot and an Australian pesticide collection system that had been
          examined during a study tour, DEA and the private industry association, AVCASA were able to
          reach an agreement. It was decided to implement two additional pilot cleanup operations (with
          utilization of remaining GEF funds), intended to help inform the development of an industry-run
          scheme for dealing with existing and future accumulations of both public and private stocks in the
          country.
      •   Challenges associated with institutional arrangements delayed and eventually excluded
          implementation of prevention activities from the project. The implementation of prevention
          activities was planned to be implemented by DAFF. 196 However, the necessary co-operation
          between DEA and DAFF suffered from difficulties in advancing budgetary resources between the
          departments and a missing special account, and subsequently resulted in prevention activities still
          not having started in 2010. Upon review of activities included under this component, it finally
          became apparent that most prevention activities would be covered by DAFF under the newly
          gazetted National Pesticide Policy (2010), and by AVCASA under its stewardship program. The
          two entities subsequently informed the World Bank that GEF funding would no longer be needed
          as prevention activities would be integrated in DAFF's work program, and disconnected from the
          project.
      •   Restructuring to reflect the project’s modified disposal model was implemented late in the
          process. Only in June 2011, ASP-P1 South Africa underwent a Level 1 restructuring to correct
          the identified design flaws. In addition to the above-mentioned reasons, the delay also resulted
          from the World Bank’s preference to restructure ASP-P1 South Africa together with three other
          ASP-P1 participant countries. The restructuring included: (i) a revised PDO and associated
          indicators to reflect the changed focus and geographic coverage; (ii) a revised project description
          to reflect the modified PDO and the fact that prevention activities were carried out with DAFF’s
          own funds and no longer part of the project; (iii) endorsement of a country-specific results
          framework which met current World Bank/GEF requirements; and (iv) revised safeguard
          requirements including a shift from a CESA to independently reviewed Environmental
          Management Plans (EMPs).

195
    Including 12.5 tonnes of pesticides, which were collected in 2002 by the NGO Endangered Wildlife and safeguarded by CLI.
It was agreed to include these stocks for disposal.
196
    DEA and DAFF signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2006, to formalize the departments’ work relationship and ensure
joint responsibility for project outputs.
                                                               160
      •   Procurement issues associated with the disposal contract prevented disposal initiation at
          remaining two pilot areas. Following a failed bidding process due to inadequate procurement
          according to World Bank procedures for the disposal services in April 2011, disposal bidding
          documents were rejected again by the World Bank in April 2012 due to an improper technical
          assessment and non-adherence of procurement requirements as spelled out in the bidding
          document. Based on the experience gained in other ASP countries and previous procurement
          failures within the framework of the project in South Africa, the World Bank considered the
          remaining time frame too short to successfully contract a service provider, and asked DEA to
          consider requesting an extension of the project’s closing date. However, such a request was sent
          to the World Bank only three days before actual project closing, preventing the extension process
          to be completed in time. The project was subsequently closed without the service provider having
          been contracted.

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND
UTILIZATION
23. Overall M&E - Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory.
24. M&E design – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Despite the lengthy preparation time, an M&E
    system specific for South Africa was not developed at appraisal. 197 A results framework, which was
    intended to be finalized by the TSU during project launch and included in the project’s Operational
    Manual, also did not materialize. Only a set of PDO indicators linked to the different project
    components was developed in the PAD and GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, however, these did
    not allow for adequate monitoring of project implementation progress. Their design focused on
    measuring outputs as opposed to progress towards project outcomes. Expected results under the
    prevention component, in particular, were not adequately considered by the indicators.
25. M&E implementation – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: M&E staffing was adequate, and
    progress reports were submitted timely throughout project implementation. However, they only
    focused on describing implementation activities and lacked an evaluation or assessment of
    performance. Following revision of the disposal approach that had informally been initiated in 2007,
    several of the indicators agreed on at appraisal had become irrelevant; they were not modified
    accordingly. Only in 2011, the PDO and associated indicators were officially revised as part of the
    Level 1 restructuring; a results framework including intermediate outcome indicators was finally
    introduced. However, the amendments were introduced too late as the project closed a year later.
26. M&E utilization – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The identification and collection of obsolete
    pesticides during the Limpopo pilot in 2007, was conducted under application of the FAO
    Environmental Management Toolkit (EMTK). 198 The data was, however, only captured in an Excel
    spreadsheet, which did not represent an adequate M&E instrument. In 2011, a booking line, where
    farmers voluntarily declare stocks in their possession, was tested and established in the two pilot

197
    Lengthy discussions between the partners during project preparation on whether to have an M&E system at the program-level
alone, or also at the country-level, may have contributed to the absence of an M&E system at the country-level at project launch.
However, no information was available on whether it was a deliberate decision not to have an M&E system in place at the
country-level.
198
    The tool kit provides a practical set of methodologies to assist countries in the risk-based management of obsolete pesticides,
including guidance on the management of collection/storage locations, based on international best practice.
                                                                161
       provinces, Free State and Western Cape. The generated data was successfully used to determine
       waste collection points in these two provinces, which were subsequently assessed for suitability using
       the environmental assessment criteria outlined in the EMTK. However, a collection schedule was
       never developed as the disposal contractor was not recruited prior to project closing. The booking line
       and the government’s existing national register replaced the PSMS database, which was considered
       an unnecessary tool.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
27. Safeguard compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies:
    OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management.
28. During project implementation, the World Bank continuously assessed the requirement of a CESA in
    view of the planned modifications to the disposal approach. In 2010, it was agreed that in the absence
    of a nation-wide inventory, the assessment of environmental and social risks would be based on the
    obsolete pesticides data from the Limpopo pilot. An EMP for the disposal of the Limpopo stocks
    (conducted in 2011), was prepared and reviewed by two independent reviewers. The approach was
    cleared by the World Bank, and recommended for disposal activities in the two remaining provinces.
29. OP 4.09 on Pest Management: Since project activities themselves met requirements of a pest
    management plan (i.e., through pesticide management, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and
    capacity building), individual country projects, including ASP-P1 South Africa, were not required to
    prepare self-standing documents. See Section 2.4 in the program-level for more details.
30. Compliance with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment is summarized in the following:
       •    The collection and inventory of obsolete pesticides in Limpopo province was not in full
            compliance with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. The pilot operation in Limpopo did not
            make use of the inventory taking method proposed by FAO and the Environmental and Social
            Management Framework because it was not considered suitable for this specific case by the
            partners (i.e., obsolete pesticide stocks mainly held by private farmers). The pilot operation
            required a different approach consisting of close cooperation between pesticide distributors and
            farmer cooperatives to identify, package and deliver obsolete pesticide stocks to 24 existing
            pesticide distribution centers. Environmental assessments were carried out for each of the
            distribution centers. Farmers were instructed on safely transporting the stocks and a
            comprehensive communications and awareness campaign was implemented. 199 When the
            collected stocks were inventoried, it became apparent that some of the stocks were posing higher
            than estimated risks and that the proposed inventory procedure would not be adequate. By
            applying due diligence, an experienced national waste management company was subsequently
            recruited by DEA, to conduct the inventory and repackage the stocks for safe interim storage.
            Two no-objection letters were submitted to the World Bank requesting approval for the service
            provider; however, in an attempt to minimize exposure risks, DEA began conducting the
            inventory and repackaging activities before the World Bank responded to the requests.
       •    Disposal of obsolete pesticides from Limpopo province was conducted in compliance with OP
            4.01 on Environmental Assessment. In 2010, DEA initiated the disposal of the Limpopo stocks
            with CLI funding. A risk assessment report and an EMP were developed, peer reviewed by DEA,
199
      Awareness was raised through radio programs, press releases, publications and SMS alerts to all commercial farmers.
                                                                162
          an independent consultant and the ASP-South Africa NGO, and cleared by the World Bank on
          November 15, 2010. Disposal activities were subsequently implemented in compliance with
          safeguard policies, and in accordance with all necessary protocols, including the Basel
          Convention guidelines. Final incineration was achieved in August 2011. 200
      •   Disposal of obsolete pesticides in Western Cape and Free State was not conducted – therefore
          OP 4.01 did not apply. Following the successful independent review and implementation of the
          EMP during disposal activities at Limpopo, the World Bank and DEA agreed that the same
          approach would be used for disposal activities at the other two provinces. It was agreed that the
          selected disposal contractor would prepare the EMPs for the operations. However, eventually the
          EMPs were not prepared because the contractor had not been hired prior to project closure.
31. Financial Management compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The project submitted
    acceptable Interim unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs) and audit reports. However, several delays
    were noted, resulting from: (i) a small value of transactions at the beginning of the project, leading the
    World Bank to waive the first two audits (for FY07 and FY08); (ii) a long authorization process
    within DEA for audits; and (iii) the inability of DEA’s financial system to produce the agreed IFRs.
    The project did not fully comply with Financial Management (FM) arrangements; although it was
    supported by adequately qualified departmental staff, their availability to the project was lower than
    agreed.
32. Procurement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The key challenge for procurement above the
    shopping threshold was the reconciliation of South African procurement practices with the World
    Bank’s procurement guidelines. Changes in procurement staff at the beginning of the project, the lack
    of clearly identified procedures in the Operational Manual and the decision to start the Limpopo pilot
    before receiving procurement training, led the PMU to initiate procurement of services and
    consultants using government, rather than World Bank procurement procedures. The procurement of
    a service contractor for the disposal at Western Cape and Free State provinces failed twice.201
    Although the World Bank had recognized the weak procurement capacity (for World Bank
    procedures) at appraisal, additional procurement training was not provided during project
    implementation.

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
33. Post-completion: No information could be obtained on post-completion activities.
34. Next phase: No information could be obtained on future activities.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
35. Relevance – Rating Substantial: The revised PDO is relevant to South Africa's current development
    and global priorities. Objectives are in line with the 2010 National Pesticide Policy and the National

   As reported by CLI, disposal certificates indicate destruction of stocks on August 22, 2011.
201
   In April 2011, the bidding process failed due to inadequate procurement according to World Bank procedures for the disposal
services; in April 2012, disposal bidding documents were rejected again by the World Bank due to an improper technical
assessment and non-adherence with bidding document requirements.
                                                                163

      in complying with the Stockholm Convention on POPs, and the Basel Convention on the control of
      trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal. The objectives are also fully in
      line with the World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy, 202 which emphasizes the need to continue
      and support pollution management as part of a continent-wide program to dispose of obsolete
      pesticides. The engagement of the pesticide industry in discussions with government about long-term
      management of stocks is in line with the World Bank’s priority of supporting private-public
      partnerships in South Africa, and helping to remove constraints to the industry's engagement. 203

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
36. Taking account of the project's Level 1 restructuring in June 2011, the project is evaluated against its
    original and revised PDO by measuring project achievements at the time of restructuring (June 2011)
    and project closing (June 2012), respectively. Associated project achievements, which were not
    adequately reflected in the results framework are also factored into the evaluation of PDO
    achievement.
37. Original PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory. The assessment took the project’s
    six PDO indicators into account, of which one was fully (100%), three partly (7-80%), and two not
    (0%) achieved.
38. The three main project outcomes measured by indicators include: (i) sound disposal and management
    of obsolete pesticides; (ii) prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides; and
    (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management.
39. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides. The level of risks emanating from publicly
    held obsolete pesticides and associated waste to adjacent and wider communities or critical natural
    resources was not determined and reduced to the extent originally planned. The originally planned
    countrywide inventory of publicly held obsolete stocks (PDO Indicator #1 - 0%) was not carried
    out. 204 In the absence of the originally planned inventory, preparation of a CESA was neither
    completed (PDO Indicator #2 – 0%). Efforts were instead focused on developing an improved
    approach for sound disposal and pesticide management, encompassing both, privately and publicly
    held obsolete pesticides. To inform the development of this approach, a pilot operation was conducted
    in Limpopo province in 2007, where privately held obsolete pesticides were packaged and delivered
    to existing pesticide distribution centers in the province. All stocks were centralized to a main storage
    location in the province, and repackaged for interim storage. Approximately 17 tonnes of publicly

12, 2007.
203
    As explained, the original project design was not entirely relevant to the obsolete pesticides situation in South Africa, where
most stocks are held by private farmers rather than the public sector; nor was it relevant to the storage infrastructure and
government's existing capacity to manage obsolete pesticides. On the other hand, the revised design responded adequately to the
main origin of pesticide stocks, existing infrastructure and capacity of government, as well as to the industry's capability to
manage the stocks. Implementation closely followed the government's policies regarding the 'polluter pays' principle, and the
2010 Pesticides Management Policy's requirement from the industry to prepare an Integrated Waste Management Plan (IWMP).
204
    It was considered cost-ineffective in an environment where most stocks were held by private farmers, and not by the public
sector; in addition, application of the FAO PSMS for maintaining the inventory was not considered value adding as the
government was using an existing national register to maintain pesticide data.
                                                                164
      held obsolete pesticides were classified as non-hazardous waste and disposed of locally in 2009 (PDO
      Indicator #3 – 6.8 %), thus having reduced risks emanating from these stocks.205
40. Prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides. Prevention activities were not
    implemented as envisaged at appraisal. Instead, beginning in 2010, efforts to prevent future
    accumulation of obsolete pesticides were implemented under the respective work programs of DAAF
    and AVCASA. Activities were funded directly by these two entities and were therefore implemented
    independently from the project. The project strengthened pesticide management by improving
    pesticide registration, licensing, and enforcement of import controls. The legal and regulatory
    framework for pesticide management was strengthened in 2010, when DAFF adopted and published a
    national Pesticides Management Policy, which supported the objectives of the Basel and Rotterdam
    conventions. Direct project support was not needed due to the government's strong engagement (PDO
    Indicator #4 - 100%).
41. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. The PMU had received
    fiduciary training as well as training in project management. Training was also provided in preparing
    a CESA and using the PSMS. In addition, relevant government staff participated in a study tour to
    Australia, to examine the country’s pesticide collection system (PDO Indicator #5 – 80%). However,
    the procurement training did not strengthen the capacity of the PMU because procurement staff
    changed following the training, and no additional training was provided. The PSMS and CESA
    trainings were not useful, as these tools were not used during project implementation.
42. Revised PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory. The assessment took the project’s
    two revised PDO indicators into account, which were both only partly achieved (55% and 33%). In
    addition, four Intermediate Outcome Indicators framed the evaluation, of which one was fully
    (100%), and three partly (33-50%) achieved. Outcomes were modified following the restructuring
    and included: (i) improved ability to identify, collect and dispose of obsolete pesticides and associated
    waste, and (ii) gained experience in removing obsolete pesticides (public and private) and associated
    waste.
43. Improved ability to identify, and collect obsolete pesticides and associated waste. The project
    improved the government’s ability to identify, collect and dispose of obsolete pesticides and
    associated waste through the testing and establishment of a booking line, where farmers voluntarily
    declare stocks in their possession (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #1 - 100%). The booking line was
    operated by the private sector, supervised by the government, and was used to determine the scale of
    the collection and treatment operations. Following its successful piloting, the system was introduced
    to the remaining provinces in South Africa. The system was adopted from a model used in Australia,
    which the government was able to examine during a study tour that was financed by CLI
    (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #4 - 50%). As outlined further below, private and public obsolete
    pesticides and associated waste were identified in three provinces, however, only collected, and
    disposed of in one province (Revised PDO Indicator #1 – 55%). Moreover, the booking line and its
    application in the two provinces informed the development of an Integrated Waste Management Plan
    (IWMP), which intends to dictate a private sector-run scheme for collection and disposal as stipulated
    by national law. The IWMP is in line with the country’s National Environmental Management Waste

      Act of 2008, and was submitted to the DEA for adoption in June 2011. If approved, the plan is
      considered representing a sustainable prevention mechanism against re-accumulation of obsolete
      pesticide stocks; however, at ICR drafting, the plan had not yet been approved as reported by CLI. A
      privately run recycling scheme already existed for empty plastic pesticide containers. 206
44. Through the Limpopo pilot disposal operation, experience was gained in removing obsolete
    pesticides (public and private) and associated waste. However, the project failed to remove obsolete
    pesticides in the remaining provinces, due to procurement issues and a subsequent missed
    opportunity to extend the project. The project reduced the risks emanating from obsolete pesticides
    and associated waste to communities, natural resources, and the global environment in one of the
    three pilot provinces, Limpopo Province. In addition to the 17 tonnes of publicly held stocks that had
    already been disposed of prior to restructuring, 92.5 tonnes 207 of privately held obsolete pesticides
    were disposed of with funds provided by CLI. A risk assessment report and an EMP had been
    developed for this province, peer reviewed by DEA, an independent consultant and the ASP-South
    Africa NGO representative, and cleared by the World Bank on November 15, 2010 (Intermediate
    Outcome Indicator #2 – 33%). Stocks were shipped to the UK for disposal by following all necessary
    protocols, including the Basel Convention guidelines, and eliminated in August 2011. 208
    Approximately 120 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and associated waste were identified in the two
    additional provinces, consisting of about 70% privately held, and 30% publicly held obsolete
    pesticides. However, the project did not complete the disposal and/or safeguarding of these stocks as
    the disposal contractor was not hired prior to project closing due to the above-mentioned procurement
    issues and a missed opportunity to extend the project (Revised PDO Indicator #2 – 33%; Intermediate
    Outcome Indicator #3 – 33%, respectively).

3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
46. The project aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effects of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities, by reducing

206

207
    These included 84 tonnes of obsolete pesticides collected at Limpopo province, 2.5 tonnes collected at Gauteng Municipality,
and associated packaging materials.
208
    As reported by CLI, disposal certificates indicate destruction of stocks on August 22, 2011.
                                                                 166
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement,
    and, thus, also rated moderately unsatisfactory (see Section 3.2).

3.4 EFFICIENCY
47. Efficiency – Rating Low. This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic data to
    support this rating are scarce.
48. At appraisal, an economic or financial analysis was neither undertaken for ASP-P1 at the program nor
    at the country-level due to non-measurable benefits of reducing the risk of contaminating the
    environment. Based on approximately US$15 million spent on the disposal of 3,240 tonnes of
    obsolete pesticides between 1990 and 2004, it was estimated that 300-900 tonnes could be disposed
    of per annum at the cost of US$3,400 per ton. (see Section 3.4 in the program-level ICR for details).
49. Despite the modification of the project’s design following the recognition that most obsolete pesticide
    stocks in South Africa were being held privately, only a limited amount of pesticides was disposed of
    under GEF funds by the end of the project. Actual unit cost per ton disposed of does therefore not
    allow for an accurate cost efficiency assessment. The project’s low efficiency rating is therefore based
    on the limited use of resources for disposal of obsolete pesticides in relation to lengthy project
    implementation. Delays were caused by a lack of implementation progress resulting from the lengthy
    process that was associated with adapting the project’s design to the South Africa’s country-context.
    About 35% of the funds were spent on the storage of the Limpopo stocks (5 years at a monthly rate of
    $7,660) following the government's decision not to pay for the disposal of private stocks, and the time
    it took to reach a financing agreement with the private sector to dispose of the collected stocks.
    Prevention activities eventually showed significant results with development of the 2010 Pesticide
    Management Policy, and capacity building efforts demonstrated an important impact in view of the
    dialogue with the private sector; however, these were financed by the government directly, or mostly
    by the private sector, respectively.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
50. Overall Outcome – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: On the basis of the project’s efficiency (low),
    relevance (high), and PDO achievement (moderately unsatisfactory), the overall outcome is rated
    moderately unsatisfactory. However, it should be noted that the effective collaboration between the
    government and industry resulted in the development and submission of an IWMP. If the plan is
    approved by DEA as envisaged, the cleanup of obsolete pesticide stocks could be systematically
    guided in future; this would be a sustainable and strong outcome, which, however, goes beyond the
    revised objectives of the project.

3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
51. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development: The project had a direct positive impact on
    farming communities in Limpopo province, where obsolete pesticide stocks were collected and
    disposed of, thereby eliminating a prominent local development risk. Indirectly, the country’s
    population as a whole benefitted from a revised legal framework for pesticide management, which is
    expected to decrease the social burden pesticides pose on communities, females and males alike.
    Industry’s engagement in the dialogue ensured a more integrated approach toward future cleanup
                                                    167
       operations. While the impact of improved pesticide management legislation was foreseeable, the
       impact of the project on the private sector (farmers and industry) was not initially foreseen given that
       the original project design focused on the public sector.
52. Institutional change/strengthening: While the project did not have a major impact on government’s
    already adequate capacity to implement clean up and prevention activities as planned, it did have a
    catalyzing effect on government’s regulatory role concerning pesticide management through
    improved policy formulation and entering into constructive dialogue with industry.
53. Other unintended outcomes and impacts: Despite its design inadequacies and implementation
    shortcomings, the project had an unintended impact on the way obsolete pesticides are expected to be
    managed in South Africa in the future, and the roles government and industry will play. The
    development and utilization of a booking line, a system that was adapted from Australia,
    demonstrated the feasibility to identify private stocks countrywide with limited government
    involvement and funding. 209

3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
54. No beneficiary survey was conducted and no stakeholder workshop was held. An ICR mission was
    planned but could not be carried out within the implementation period. The government’s completion
    report contained limited information and World Bank’s request for additional information did not
    reveal any particular issues.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

55. Risk to the development outcome - Rating Moderate: DAFF and DEA, the governmental
    departments mandated with managing pesticides and pesticide waste, respectively, demonstrated
    existing good capacity to implement their mandates and continuous strong commitment to the issue.
    The project further increased the government's capacity by sensitizing key stakeholders to the
    Australian pesticide collection system, and by supporting the dialogue with the private sector
    industry. This experience led the pesticide industry association to develop the IWMP and submit it for
    approval to DEA. If approved, the IWMP will regulate responsibilities and lay out plans for future
    collection operations with the private sector industry playing a key implementing role.
56. However, despite the commitment and capacity of both industry and government, and the appropriate
    regulatory framework in place, the development outcome could be at risk if: (i) the IWMP is not
    approved by the minister or approved with considerable delay; (ii) industry and/or other responsible
    entities do not implement the IWMP or lack capacity to perform satisfactorily; and (iii) a financial
    mechanism is not set up or does not raise sufficient funds for a meaningful impact.

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
57. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Project
    preparation of ASP-P1 South Africa was conducted in conjunction with preparatory activities at the
    program-level, which were lengthy (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). While considerable
    time was invested in overall preparation, project documents for ASP-P1 South Africa only broadly
    laid out implementation plans, and lacked country-specific information (see Section 2.1). Most
    importantly, despite the lengthy preparation process, ASP-P1 South Africa was launched with a
    project design that turned out to be not applicable to the South African context, as recognized in the
    beginning of implementation. This resulted in considerable delays, and the need to redesign the
    project during implementation.
58. Quality of World Bank supervision – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Project supervision was
    carried out via missions, email and telephone exchanges. One launching mission and five supervision
    missions took place, averaging one mission per year. Until mid-2008 the project was intermittently
    supervised by the ASP Task Team Leaders (TTLs) in Washington DC and co-TTLs based in the
    Pretoria World Bank Office. Beginning mid-2008 until project closing, the project was not assigned a
    co-TTL (unlike all other ASP projects) and was supervised by the ASP TTL from Washington DC.
    This may explain the infrequency of World Bank missions to the project. Procurement and FM were
    supervised by World Bank staff based in Pretoria: FM supervision was carried out in all missions,
    while procurement supervision was conducted only in the first two missions (in June 2006 for
    training and March 2007). One official post procurement review was carried out in May 2011.
    Safeguards were supervised by staff from the Pretoria and Washington DC offices during all missions
    except the mid-term review in February 2009 (due to unavailability of a safeguard specialist to join
    the mission). During the lifetime of the project, the project was supervised by six different TTLs/co-
    TTLs.
59. Despite early recognition of the need to modify the design, the project was only restructured in 2011.
    During the first five years of the project, project activities were not implemented according to the
    provisions of the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement; amended activities such as the piloted collection,
    storage and eventual disposal of obsolete stocks in Limpopo province were conducted without the
    necessary M&E framework in place to monitor the activities’ performance or progress.
60. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Based on the above
    presented evaluation, the overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
61. Government performance – Rating Satisfactory: Government performance was overall satisfactory
    throughout implementation as reflected by its commitment to the issue. Government commitment at
    entry continued to be strong as was evident from its strong engagement during the Limpopo pilot.
    Both DEA and DAFF engaged in a close dialogue with AVCASA and CropLife South Africa, and an
    effective public-private partnership was formed. This relationship was later maintained and the
    government continued to engage South Africa’s private sector industry in agreed follow up activities.
    Government approval of the National Pesticide Policy in 2010 demonstrated continued commitment
    to the issue of pesticide management. DAFF’s decision to implement prevention activities
                                                   169
    independently from the project affected project performance; however, this seems to have been the
    result of administrative difficulties between the project and DAFF and not due to a lack of
    commitment.
62. Implementing Agency performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: During project preparation
    DEA collaborated well with the World Bank and other ASP partners. DEA prepared a comprehensive
    Operations Manual, which provided considerable information considering the lack of key baseline
    data. However, a staff turnover at the beginning and at the end of the project delayed project
    activities; in addition, the misplacement of legal documents in one occasion, lengthy authorization
    procedures within and outside the department affected timely submission of audits, and
    countersigning of amendments. DEA executed its fiduciary duties, however, not in full compliance
    with World Bank legal covenants. As previously described, the bidding process for disposal failed
    twice due to improper procurement. In addition, audits and IFRs were often submitted delayed.
    However, DEA provided co-financing and in-kind support to the project as planned.
63. Overall borrower performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Taking into account that the
    project’s overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory, and the implementation agency’s
    performance often delays implementation progress, overall borrower performance is rated moderately
    unsatisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

64. The most significant lessons learned are outlined in Section 6 of the program-level ICR, as the
    experience they are based on was often reflected across all country-specific projects. Lessons learned
    that were particularly relevant to ASP-P1 South Africa include:
    •   Future projects should place particular emphasis on tailoring individual country projects to the
        country-specific environments. The uniform approach ASP-P1 was applying to all participating
        countries was not appropriate for the South African context, and caused significant delays and
        transaction costs.
    •   Private-public partnerships are important for the collection and disposal of privately-held
        obsolete pesticides. In countries which hold significant amounts of privately-held stocks should
        seek to form private-public partnerships between the relevant governmental agency and the
        private sector, and include private stocks in the disposal and prevention components.

             Trust Fund Grant Agreement
     Part A – Obsolete pesticides inventory: Achievements under this component are rated Unsatisfactory
     Carrying out of a detailed inventory of the         Most of the originally envisaged project activities were not applicable
     recipient’s publicly held obsolete pesticides       to the South African context, and, therefore, could not be implemented
     stocks through:                                     as planned.
     a. Collection of data and compilation of a          a. Carrying out an inventory was considered cost-ineffective in an
        database;                                           environment where most stocks were held privately; in addition, the

                                                            CESA would not be the appropriate safeguard tool, as it required
                                                            inventory data for detailed analysis and prioritization (Original PDO
                                                            Indicator #2 – 0%).
     Part B – Disposal of obsolete pesticides: Achievements under this component are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
     Treatment and/or disposal of publicly held          a. The technological assessment study was launched. It was, however,
     obsolete pesticides stocks and associated waste        only finalized after the restructuring; therefore, this activity was not

F. Results Framework Analysis - At project approval, no country-specific results framework existed;
only six PDO Indicators were defined. Following a Level 1 Restructuring in June 2011, a country-specific
results framework was introduced. The original six PDO Indicators were revised and reduced to three
PDO Indicators, and in addition, six Intermediate Outcome Indicators were introduced.

Project Development Objective (PDO) – as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement: 213 To
assist the recipient in: (a) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and associated
waste; and (b) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.
Revised PDO – as presented in the Level 1 Restructuring of June 2011 (Report No: 62796-TZ): Assist
the recipient in: (i) disposing and/or safeguarding inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and
associated waste; and (ii) developing a strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations.

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) - as presented in the PAD (Report No: 36273-AFR): Reduction
of the effects of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) on the global environment.
Revised GEO – Not Applicable

(a) PDO Indicators – Original PDO Indicators as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement are
assessed against achievements realized at the time of the project’s Level 1 restructuring in June 2011;
revised PDO Indicators are assessed against achievements realized at project closing in May 2013.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1. Country background: Tanzania’s agriculture sector had been highly labor-intensive, employing an
   estimated two-thirds of the country’s workforce. At project approval in December 2006, the sector
   accounted for just under 50% of GDP, with considerable under-utilized land, and the land that was in
   use, had been dominated by small-scale subsistence farmers. 215
2. Sector background: Following their introduction in the 1940s and 1950s, pesticides in Tanzania had
   been primarily used in agriculture for crop protection, as pests accounted for more than 40% of crop
   losses annually. The launching of the economic recovery programs and liberalization of trade in
   Tanzania had resulted in a rise of the amount of pesticides imported into the country from 500 tonnes
   in 2000 to 2,500 tonnes in 2003. To a lesser extent, pesticides had been used in the public health
   sector and other areas including for protecting buildings from insect pests.
3. Obsolete pesticide accumulation: Tanzania had accumulated large stockpiles of obsolete pesticides as
   a result of incorrect needs assessment and procurement; uncoordinated donations of pesticides; poor
   storage conditions; and poor stock management.
4. Institutional background: Pesticide legislation was updated in 1997 to reflect international
   agreements. 216 The Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security, and Cooperative (MAFSC) was
   responsible for approval and registration of pesticides, while the National Environmental
   Management Council (NEMC) represented the principal agency in responsible for regulating the
   environment, including chemical waste and disposal. The Division of Environment (DoE) – Vice
   Presidents’ Office (under which NEMC was situated) had the overall function of formulating policies
   on environment, coordination and monitoring environmental issues, environmental planning and
   carrying out policy oriented environmental research. At approval, the importation and distribution of
   pesticides was handled by the private sector, while the Government concentrated on regulating and
   controlling the chain. Although some of the pesticides used in agriculture were similar to those used
   in public health, pesticides for animal husbandry and public health were regulated under the Ministry
   of Livestock Development and Ministry of Health, respectively. 217 The Office of the Vice-President,
   and the ministries had adopted legal and regulatory provisions to improve the management of
   pesticides and to prevent impacts on human health and the environment.218
5. Actions taken: Considerable efforts had been undertaken by the government to safeguard and dispose
   of obsolete pesticides,219 before in 1997-1998, the Government of the Netherlands supported

    The Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Profile Tanzania, 2006
216
    The Plant Protection Act was enacted in 1997, dealing specifically with plant protection and pesticide control. Regulations
were put in place in 1999 but enforcement of the Act was weak.

    These included the Environmental Management Act (2004), which included a provision for the development of a regulation
for hazardous waste management, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (2003), which ensured prevention to workers exposure
to chemical and pesticide substance, and the Industrial and Consumer Chemical Act (2003).
219
    In example, in 1986, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) provided assistance to repack large
quantities of pesticides at the coastal region; in 1995, the Government of the Netherlands funded the removal of hazardous waste
                                                                 190
    Tanzania in carrying out a nationwide inventory of obsolete stockpiles, which identified about 1000
    tonnes of obsolete pesticides. 70% of the pesticides were estimated to be publicly held and included
    large volumes of organ-chlorinated products, notably Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). 220 The
    majority of the stores did not meet the basic requirements for environmentally sound storage of
    hazardous chemicals as set by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations
    Environment Program (UNEP). Several other activities were subsequently undertaken. These
    included an inventory that was organized in collaboration with UNEP to assess status of specifically
    POPs in Tanzania, a capacity-building project on risk management decision-making undertaken by
    the Ministry of Health 221, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Vector Management
    (IVM) programs organized by the Ministry of Agriculture. 222 In recognition of the problem identified
    by this inventory, Tanzania made an official appeal for assistance to the international donor
    community during the FAO Third Consultation on Prevention and Disposal of Obsolete Pesticide
    Stocks, held in Rome in March 1998. Tanzania was subsequently considered for ASP participation,
    and a country workshop was held in August 2002 in Dar es Salaam to discuss and evaluate the scope
    of the pesticide problem.
6. Rationale for World Bank assistance: Please refer to Section 1.1 in the program-level ICR.
7. Higher-level objectives: The project intended to support Tanzania’s Country Assistance Strategy
   (CAS) 223 to help realizing an environmentally sustainable rural development strategy, and support
   commercial agriculture to become more dynamic and productive. The project further aimed to assist
   the government in implementing policies focusing on the conservation of natural resources and
   management of the environment, and raising awareness for the sustainable use of natural resources.
   Contributing to international efforts to eliminate POPs, improving management of toxic chemicals,
   and promoting alternatives to pesticide usage that include IPM and IVM represented further
   objectives.

1.2 ORIGINAL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND INDICATORS
8. The Project Development Objective (PDO), indicators, and components that are stated in the ASP-P1
   Tanzania Project Appraisal Document (PAD) 224 differ from those stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant
   Agreement. 225 This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented in the
   GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the guiding document for the project’s
   implementation activities.

9. At appraisal, only an overall ASP-P1 results framework was prepared (see program-level ICR);
   results frameworks for the individual ASP-P1 countries, including Tanzania, were intended to be
   finalized during the individual ASP-P1 country project launches. However, country-specific PDO
   indicators were developed at appraisal. For ASP-P1 Tanzania, these were as follows:
                                      Table 1.2: ASP-P1 Tanzania Original PDO Indicators
                       Original PDO Indicators as presented in the PAD and the GEF Trust Fund Agreement

         Team’s (PCT) and the recipient’s government staff.
      b. Completion of Country Environmental and Social Assessment (CESA) and implementation of measures contained
         therein.
      c. Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides stocks disposed of, as a result of the completion of the disposal services
         contract(s) in accordance with national and international laws and regulations.
      d. Legal and regulatory framework for pesticide management improved, including measures to strengthen compliance with
         the Conventions.
      e. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy is developed and implemented.
      f. The training program under Part D of the project is implemented and the knowledge so acquired is being used by the
         recipient. 226



1.3 REVISED PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND INDICATORS
10. The PDO and associated indicators for ASP-P1 Tanzania were revised through a Level I restructuring
    on June 30, 2011. 227 The original objective was based on the incorrect assumption that project funds
    would be sufficient to dispose of all inventoried stocks, and that demand for pesticides could be
    substantially reduced through project-funded prevention activities despite evidence of increasing
    demand for pesticides as a result of agricultural intensification. After it became evident that there
    were higher than estimated volumes of associated waste, particularly contaminated soils, and that
    future stocks could not be fully prevented, the original PDO, indicators and related components were
    revised to reflect a shift from complete elimination of all inventoried publicly-held obsolete stocks
    and associated waste to elimination overseas and lower-cost in-country safeguarding of the stocks.
    This also reflected a transition from prevention of accumulation of stocks to the development of a
    strategy to deal with future obsolete pesticides and associated waste re-accumulation, endorsed by the
    government.



226
   See Section 1.5 for the project’s Component D, here referred to as “Part D”.
227
   Revisions were approved on June 30, 2011, on the basis of: Restructuring Paper on a Proposed Project Restructuring of
Africa Stockpiles Program – Project 1 to the United Republic of Tanzania, (Report No: 62796-TZ), June 20, 2011

11. ASP-P1 Tanzania’s revised PDO: Assist the recipient in: (i) disposing and/or safeguarding
    inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and associated waste; and (ii) developing a
    strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations.
12. ASP-P1 Tanzania PDO indicators were reduced in number and revised to focus on the updated
    project objective. In addition, a country-specific results framework was introduced for effective
    monitoring and evaluation of project progress.
13. ASP-P1 Tanzania’s revised PDO Indicators: (i) Quantity of inventoried publicly held obsolete
    pesticides and associated waste disposed of and/or safeguarded; (ii) quantity of inventoried heavily
    contaminated soil disposed of and/or safeguarded; and (iii) comprehensive strategy for dealing with
    future stocks of obsolete pesticides and associated wastes adopted by the steering committee.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
16. ASP-P1 Tanzania was prepared between 2002 and 2006, as part of preparatory activities at the
    program-level. It took more than four years from GEF eligibility in July 2001, and more than three

                                                           195
      years from concept note in July 2002 to project approval by the World Bank Board in December
      2006. 228
17. Soundness of background analysis: Project preparation was conducted jointly by FAO and the
    World Bank. Preparation activities were further characterized by close collaboration with CropLife
    International (CLI) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), as mission reports show. 229
18. Background analysis was comprehensive. A preliminary procurement capacity assessment was
    conducted by the World Bank in July 2003. It was noted that no procurement specialist was envisaged
    to be part of PMU staffing; the World Bank correctly emphasized that procurement staff would be
    vital to avoid delays in project implementation. In May 2004, NEMC’s procurement capacity was
    assessed again, and considered inadequate. The World Bank recommended that NEMC hire a
    procurement specialist on a short-term basis for twelve months to support the day-to-day
    procurement. Regular procurement training to improve procurement skills was further recommended.
    Assessments of the project’s management arrangements and Financial Management (FM) capacity
    were equally undertaken. Key preparatory outputs such as the PAD and Operational Manual,
    however, were lacking detailed country-specific information regarding Monitoring and Evaluation
    (M&E), and risks and risk mitigation measures.
19. Assessment of project design: The project’s design (as for all ASP-P1 participating countries) was
    preconfigured at the program-level, and did not reflect any country-specific modifications or lessons
    learned from pervious projects executed in Tanzania. Design weaknesses at the program level that
    translated into implementation delays at the country level, including ASP-P1 Tanzania, are outlined in
    Section 2.1 of the program-level ICR.
20. Government commitment: The Government of Tanzania had demonstrated strong commitment to
    increasing pesticide management efforts, which was translated into the above-mentioned projects and
    operations (see Section 1.1). In addition, before project approval, the government had ratified the
    Basel (April 1993), Rotterdam (April 2002), and Stockholm (April 2004) Conventions.
21. Assessment of risks: Program-level risks were adequately identified and outlined in the PAD. They
    were presented in the form of a matrix and represented a summary of risk assessments undertaken
    during identification, pre-appraisal and appraisal missions to ASP-P1 participating countries. Even
    though the assessment of risks was comprehensive and included a broad range of mitigation measures
    in generic terms, an assessment of risks and mitigation measures specific to Tanzania was lacking. At
    the same time, it should be noted that it was difficult to assess country-specific risks in the absence of
    inventories of obsolete pesticides and CESAs, which were only planned to be undertaken during
    project implementation.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
22. Throughout implementation, the project experienced long delays, eventually resulting in three
    extensions for a total of 35 months, and a Level 1 restructuring in 2011.
23. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes included:

228
    The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy partnership building/negotiation process at the program-level resulting from
the complex implementation arrangement and project design (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR).
229
    Pre-Appraisal mission March 9-14, 2003 (NEMC, World Bank, and FAO); World Bank Appraisal mission April 25-30, 2004
(NEMC, World Bank, FAO, and CLI); and AfDB Appraisal mission July 15-20, 2005 (NEMC, AfDB, and World Bank).
                                                               196
      •   Low project management capacity affected project implementation in the beginning. The project
          was approved by the Board in December 2006 and became effective two weeks later. However,
          implementation started slowly due to a shortage of key personnel in the PMU, 230 substantial
          procurement delays due to the absence of a procurement officer during the first ten months of the
          project and a resulting lengthy procurement of personal protective equipment that was required
          for the inventory (see Section 2.4 for more detail). Ineffective communication within the PMU
          further contributed to initial project implementation delays.
      •   Complex and loosely defined implementation arrangement at the program-level affected project
          implementation. The loosely defined implementation arrangement at the program level had
          caused collaboration issues between FAO and the World Bank, which subsequently affected the
          effective and timely technical and operational support the agencies were foreseen to provide (see
          Section 2.2 in the program-level ICR). Equally affected was the involvement of the local Non-
          Governmental Organization (NGO) network, whose Terms of Reference (TORs) and methods of
          procurement were unclear. Efforts were subsequently undertaken by the PMU, the Pesticide
          Action Network (PAN-UK) and World Bank to better integrate these activities into the project’s
          plans, and to provide additional guidance on procurement. For technical support during disposal
          activities, a Technical Advisor for Disposal (TAD) was eventually recruited and financed by CLI,
          which (although considerably delayed) positively affected project implementation.
      •   Strong collaboration with the local NGO network positively supported project activities. A
          network of local NGOs with experience in health and environmental issues, formed in December
          2002. Once integrated into the project plans, it substantially supported the project’s efforts in
          raising awareness at the local level through sensitizing selected communities, and training
          community members in independently identifying and monitoring chemical effects at the local
          level.
      •   Discovery of large amounts of contaminated soils resulted in a funding gap. While the amount of
          obsolete pesticides inventoried was much lower than estimated at appraisal, large amounts of
          heavily contaminated soils had been discovered, which had not been budgeted for. In 2010, the
          project therefore faced an estimated funding gap of $2.4 million, for all inventoried stocks were
          disposed of adequately. The World Bank and the government subsequently agreed to dispose of
          obsolete pesticides and high-risk contaminated soils and safeguard low risk soil in country (as
          captured at restructuring).
      •   Restructuring. At mid-term review in October 2009, the project was considered delayed and its
          PDO unlikely to be achieved on the basis of the original indicators (see Sections 1.2 and 1.3). The
          World Bank recommended revising the PDO, introducing a country-level results framework, and
          extending the project’s closing date. The project was eventually restructured in June 2011, and
          subsequently facilitated PDO achievement. 231 Further, in response to issues discussed during the
          mid-term review concerning disbursement, the ceiling for the designated account was increased
          from US$100,000 to US$200,000 based on projected expenditures.


230
    The PMU coordinator position had only been appointed in January 2008. Until then, NEMC’s director had been coordinating
the project in addition to his role as director, which led to a heavy workload and subsequent project implementation delays.
231
    It took over two years to restructure the project, as ASP-P1 countries were planned to be restructured together and some of the
other countries were delays due to political reluctance to restructure the project.
                                                                   197
2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)
24. Overall M&E – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory based on the following evaluation.
25. M&E design – Rating Unsatisfactory: Despite the lengthy preparation time, at appraisal, an M&E
    system specific for Tanzania was not developed.232 A results framework, which was intended to be
    finalized during project launch and included in the project’s Operational Manual, did not materialize.
    Only a set of PDO indicators linked to the different project components was developed and outlined
    in the PAD and Operational Manual, however, these did not allow for adequate monitoring of project
    implementation progress. The indicators focused on measuring outputs as opposed to progress
    towards project outcomes. 233 Expected results under the prevention component, in particular, were
    not adequately considered by the indicators. Other key M&E elements, such as strategies,
    responsibilities, timelines, and budget were properly detailed in the Operational Manual.
26. M&E implementation – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Until the mid-term review, the PMU
    compensated the lack of an M&E system with using Excel sheets to monitor project implementation.
    Eventually in 2009, the TSU provided the PMU with a simplified M&E system, which was
    subsequently used by the PMU. Monthly and bi-annual progress reports were timely prepared and
    consisted of quantitative and qualitative information on progress. In 2011, following the restructuring
    of the project, a results framework specific to Tanzania was finally introduced, and the PDO and
    associated indicators were revised to focus on the two main project achievements (disposal and/or
    safeguarding and reduction of future accumulations), which strengthened the M&E of the project,
    albeit late in the process.
27. M&E utilization – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: All identified sites in the country together with
    their respective stocks of obsolete pesticides, were subjected to risk assessments based on the
    Environmental Management Tool Kits (EMTKs) 234 developed by FAO. Data from each site was
    entered into the Pesticide Stock Management System (PSMS), a FAO web-based database, to
    calculate risk factors related to the product and environmental conditions, to prioritize each site, and
    to record pesticides. For the preparation of the CESA, the PSMS prioritization criteria were used to
    rank all sites into high, medium, and low risk. The PSMS together the EMTK proved to be very
    useful tools in managing obsolete pesticides stocks.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
28. Safeguard compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies:
    OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management.
29. ASP-P1 Tanzania complied with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment: An environmental safeguard
    review that was conducted by the World Bank at mid-term review noted that during inventory
    activities, staff had not undergone health checks as required, and that contaminated soils had not been

232
    Lengthy discussions between the partners during project preparation on whether to have an M&E system at the program-level
alone, or also at the country-level, may have contributed to the absence of an M&E system at the country-level at project launch.
However, no information was available on whether it was a deliberate decision not to have an M&E system in place at the
country-level.
233

Memoire.
234
    The tool kit provides a practical set of methodologies to assist countries in the risk-based management of obsolete pesticides,
including guidance on the management of collection/storage locations, based on international best practice.
                                                                198
      adequately safeguarded at two high-risk sites (Vikuge and Morogoro). 235 However, shortly after,
      corrective measures were undertaken; awareness-raising activities were conducted, and contaminated
      soils were adequately demarcated at these two sites. 236 Local NGOs significantly supported
      consultation activities and independent monitoring of health and safety compliance during inventory
      activities.
30. A CESA identifying mitigation measures to treat possible negative environmental and social impacts
    that were considered likely to occur during implementation of the project was completed in October
    2011, with guidance of a World Bank safeguards specialist. The assessment had been found
    satisfactory by the World Bank, and associated Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) that were
    linked to a Health and Safety Management System were equally completed. The assessment’s
    delayed completion 237 was caused by: a) the sequential design of the project (the inventory was only
    finalized in November 2009); b) procurement delays; and c) a lengthy World Bank review and
    clearance process, particularly of the TORs. Project activities involving storage, transportation,
    disposal, and site remediation were implemented in compliance with the recommendations and
    requirements of the CESA, the associated EMPs, and the Health and Safety Management System
    which ensured that all workers were adequately protected against chemical hazards and using safe
    working practices. A World Bank safeguard specialist monitored and ensured compliance with
    safeguard requirements through participation in supervision missions and specific safeguard missions.
31. OP 4.09 on Pest Management: Since project activities themselves met requirements of a pest
    management plan (i.e., through pesticide management, IPM, and capacity building), individual
    country projects, including ASP-P1 Tanzania, were not required to prepare self-standing documents.
    See Section 2.4 in the program-level for more details.
32. Financial Management compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: Financial Monitoring
    Reports (FMRs) were prepared and submitted on a quarterly basis to the World Bank’s satisfaction,
    as were audit reports. Shortcomings included occasional variances that were found during financial
    management reviews but which were subsequently corrected; and a missing audit committee during
    the first year of project implementation, which was eventually established in March 2008 following
    World Bank recommendations. 238
33. Disbursement: Disbursement levels were low during the first three years of project implementation
    with only 13% disbursement at mid-term review. A six months delay in opening a special account and
    a low account ceiling (US$100,000) contributed to low disbursement rates as did general delays in
    effecting disbursements, and procurement shortcomings (see below). Disbursement levels only
    increased substantially towards the end of the project, attributable to the increase in the ceiling
    (US$200,000) and the beginning of disposal activities (which were allocated the majority of project
    funds).

Finance Act.
                                                                199
34. Procurement – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: All services were procured to the World Bank’s
    satisfaction; however, occasional delays and discrepancies in procurement plans delayed overall
    project activities, particularly during the first half of project implementation. Initial delays were
    caused by the absence of a procurement specialist during the first ten months of implementation. 239
    The subsequent arrangement, which included a procurement officer, supplies officer, and a part-time
    procurement consultant, did not prove to be effective; the consultant’s support was not sought by the
    PMU as intended, therefore poor procurement documentation and procurement delays continued. In
    particular, the lengthy procurement of the personal protective equipment (February - November
    2008), hindered project implementation to progress as the pesticide inventory and subsequent
    activities could not be started without the equipment. In 2009, the PMU received procurement
    training, 240 which substantially improved its procurement capacity.

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
35. Post completion: At project completion, two draft legislations had been formulated and were
    awaiting cabinet clearance; they included a Plant Protection Bill and a Pesticide Management Bill. 241
36. Next phase: A follow-on project is currently being prepared to focus on the remaining contaminated
    soils that continue to be in the country; ASP-P1 Tanzania only managed to address a portion of these
    contaminated soils. The envisaged project intends to focus on adequate hazardous waste disposal
    facilities including the establishment of an engineered bio-reactor landfill, capacity building, and
    enhancing institutional collaboration. A concept note is being prepared by the government for GEF
    funding consideration.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
37. Relevance – Rating High: Despite having been too ambitious, the project’s original objectives were
    relevant when the project was prepared. The project’s revised objective, design, and implementation
    are considered highly relevant to the current national development priorities. The Government of
    Tanzania places strong emphasis on preserving the environment and mainstreaming environmental
    concerns into all future policy measures, as evident from the country’s five year development plan for
    the period 2011/12-2015/16. 242 The project’s objective is also consistent with the World Bank’s
    FY12-15 Country Assistance Strategy for Tanzania, 243 which supports environmental capacity


239
    The project’s procurement officer left the project in January 2007, shortly after project approval. The procurement unit was
subsequently staffed with only one supplies officer, who had inadequate experience with World Bank procurement procedures.
240
    Two staff attended procurement trainings that were conducted by the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute in
cooperation with the World Bank.
241
    The Plant Protection Act intends to prevent the introduction or spread of plant pests, provide for phytosanitary control
measures, and facilitate trade in plants and plant products. The Pesticide Management Act intends to regulate the manufacture,
formulation, importation into and exportation from the country, transport, storage, distribution, sale, use, and disposal of
pesticides.

      The project has also been supporting the Government of Tanzania in complying with the Stockholm
      Convention on POPs, and the Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of
      hazardous wastes and their disposal.

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
38. Taking account of the project’s Level 1 restructuring in June 2011, the project has been evaluated
    against its original and revised PDO by measuring achievements at the time of the project’s
    restructuring (June 2011) and project closing (May 2013), respectively.
39. Original PDO achievement - Rating Unsatisfactory: The assessment took the project’s six PDO
    indicators into account, of which two were fully (100%), and four not (0%) achieved. The three main
    project outcomes measured by the indicators include: (i) sound disposal and management of obsolete
    pesticides; (ii) prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides; and (iii) enhanced
    capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. 244
40. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides. The level of risks emanating from publicly
    held obsolete pesticides and associated waste to nearby communities or critical natural resources was
    determined and quantified through the completion of a national inventory of publicly held obsolete
    pesticides in November 2009 (PDO Indicator #1 – 100%). All identified sites in the country together
    with their respective stocks of obsolete pesticides were subject to risk assessments based on the
    EMTKs. Data from each site was entered into the PSMS, which calculates risk factors related to the
    product and environmental conditions, and assists in prioritizing the different sites. These efforts were
    substantially supported by the local ASP NGO network through independent monitoring of inventory
    activities to ensure safety and health standards. The data informed the preparation of the CESA and
    the disposal and safeguarding of stockpiles. However, at restructuring, the CESA was not yet
    completed (PDO Indicator #2 – 0%). Consequently, disposal activities had not begun at restructuring
    (PDO Indicator #3 – 0%). 245 However, it should be noted that the project conducted an emergency
    safeguarding operation at a high-risk site in Morogoro 246 in October 2010. 247 The operation had been
    advised by the World Bank and was conducted under application of an approved Environmental
    Management Plan (EMP). The operation reduced the risk emerging from obsolete pesticides and
    particularly contaminated soil, and provided the project with experience in preparing a satisfactory
    EMP and carrying out safeguarding.
41. Prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides. Tanzania’s legal and regulatory
    framework for pesticide management had not been strengthened at restructuring (PDO Indicator #4 –
    0%); the envisaged IPM strategy was not developed (PDO Indicator #5 – 0%). It should be noted that
    in 2010, it was agreed by the World Bank and the PMU that such strategy would not be developed,
    but instead a national workshop on IPM would be held, however, the workshop had not taken place
244
    Achievements were identified based on intended outcomes presented in Annex 1 in Project Appraisal Document for the
Republic of Mali, the Kingdom of Morocco, and the United Republic of Tanzania in support of the Africa Stockpile Program –
Technical Annex 3, (Report No. 36273-AFR), November 7, 2006
245
    Only a draft disposal tender document had been prepared and submitted to the World Bank for review on May 26, 2011
246
    Morogoro is a municipality in the central part of Tanzania, 190 km west of Dar es Salaam.
247
    The emergency safeguarding operation included fencing off the contaminated site with a barbed wire fence, putting in place
danger signs and hazard tape to prevent people from entering. During disposal activities, 392 tonnes of contaminated soil were
excavated from this site.
                                                                201
      by the time of restructuring. The project raised awareness on the health and environmental hazards of
      pesticides and encouraging safe pesticide handling. A communication strategy was developed in
      collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and its implementation was launched in 2009.
      Activities included awareness raising visits to all agricultural zones (particularly to accompany the
      inventory), development of briefing materials, and press conferences. A network of local NGOs with
      experience in health and environmental issues and formed in December 2002, had substantially
      supported these efforts through sensitizing selected communities, and training community members
      in independently identifying and monitoring chemical effects at the local level. A National
      Stakeholders Advisory Forum (NSAF) 248 was established and held on July 31, 2009, to provide a
      forum of knowledge exchange and coordination of activities implemented by local NGOs.
42. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. Between 2005 and 2010,
    PMU members and representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) received training in
    project management, conducting a national inventory, entering data into the PSMS, preparing a
    CESA, safeguarding of hazardous waste, and procurement.. Capacity was strengthened as became
    evident through application of the acquired knowledge while conducting the inventory, and preparing
    safeguard instruments (PDO Indicator #6 – 100%).
43. Revised PDO achievement – Rating Highly Satisfactory: The assessment took the project’s three
    revised PDO indicators into account, of which two were fully (100%) achieved and one exceeded its
    target (131%). In addition, six Intermediate Outcome Indicators framed the evaluation. One of those
    was not taken into account as it corresponded with an Original PDO Indicator that had been achieved
    prior to restructuring; all others were fully (100%) achieved. Outcomes were slightly modified
    following the restructuring and included: (i) Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides
    and associated waste including safeguarding; (ii) reduction of re-accumulation of obsolete pesticides
    and associated waste through regulations, pest management, and stakeholder involvement; and (iii)
    enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management.
44. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides and associated waste including safeguarding:
    The inventory was effectively used to prepare the CESA (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #2 –
    100%). 249 The CESA led to important improvements in project design, such as the proposal to
    consolidate low-risk stores into main collection centers using country capacity. Such a strategy led to
    important cost savings, as it significantly reduced the disposal contractors’ fieldwork. A total of 665
    tonnes 250 of obsolete pesticides and 2,515 tonnes of associated waste including large amounts of
    contaminated soils were inventoried. Since the amount of associated waste (particularly contaminated
    soils) had turned out to be much higher than estimated and the required funding for disposal
    subsequently beyond the allocated budget, it was agreed at restructuring that the disposal contract
    would include all inventoried obsolete pesticides (665 tonnes), and of the inventoried heavily
    contaminated soils only those that were posing a significant risk to human and animal health (300
    tonnes). At project closure, all inventoried obsolete pesticides (575 tonnes) were disposed of overseas
    in an environmentally and technically sound manner (Revised PDO Indicator #1 – 100%). During
    disposal activities, it became clear that the total amount of obsolete pesticides was lower than

      anticipated; only representing 575 instead of 665 tonnes. As a result, even though the project disposed
      of fewer tonnes than originally targeted, the Revised Indicator #1 was fully achieved as all
      inventoried obsolete pesticides were eliminated. The generated cost savings were subsequently
      applied to the disposal of high risk contaminated soils to maximize the outcome. Eventually, the
      project disposed of 392 tonnes of the inventoried heavily contaminated soils (Revised PDO Indictor
      #2 – 131%), exceeding its target level of 300 tonnes.
45. Reduction of re-accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated waste through regulations, pest
    management, and stakeholder involvement. The project implemented measures targeted at sustainably
    managing and reducing the re-accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated wastes through the
    following activities: A comprehensive strategy to better regulate and control the registration,
    production, storage, and sale of pesticides in Tanzania was adopted by the Steering Committee on
    April 22, 2013 (Revised PDO Indicator #3 – 100%). The strategy intends to serve as basis and
    guidance for dealing with
    future stocks, and is based on a        Figure 3.1: Publicly Held Obsolete Pesticides and Associated Waste

    completion,       two       draft
    legislations had been formulated and were awaiting cabinet clearance; they included a Plant
    Protection Bill and a Pesticide Management Bill.252 In addition to the awareness raising activities
    highlighted before, the project raised awareness on the health and environmental hazards of pesticides
    and encouraged safe pesticide handling by having implemented four different communication actions
    (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #3 – 100%). These included the development of two TV and two

    These included an assessment of contaminated soil and buried pesticides, a study on pesticide management, and a review of
pesticide legislation.
252
    The Plant Protection Act intends to prevent the introduction or spread of plant pests, provide for phytosanitary control
measures, and facilitate trade in plants and plant products. The Pesticide Management Act intends to regulate the manufacture,
formulation, importation into and exportation from the country, transport, storage, distribution, sale, use, and disposal of
pesticides.
                                                               203
      radio spots, broadcasted in early 2013, raising awareness through participation in five exhibitions,253
      and outreach activities during disposal activities in three different zones of Tanzania (Intermediate
      Outcome Indicator #6 – 100%).
46. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. In addition to the
    capacity building achieved prior to restructuring, the project further strengthened the government’s
    capacity through additional training. Training was provided in International Maritime Dangerous
    Goods (IMDG) Code, safety and health, and preparation and implementation of national prevention
    actions plans.
47. Weighted average PDO achievement – Rating Satisfactory: At restructuring in June 2011, the
    project had disbursed US$1.96 million, representing 28.5% of total disbursed funds of US$6.87
    million. On this basis and as illustrated by the table below, the weighted average of the project’s PDO
    achievement is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
48. The project aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effect of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities, by reducing
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement,
    and, thus, is also rated satisfactory (see Section 3.2).

3.4 EFFICIENCY
49. Efficiency – Rating Substantial: This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic
    data to support this rating are scarce. At appraisal, an economic or financial analysis was neither
    undertaken for ASP-P1 at the program nor at the country-level due to non-measurable benefits of
    reducing the risk of contaminating the environment.
50. Based on the fact that approximately 74% (US$5.07 million) of disbursed GEF funds (US$6.87
    million) went towards disposal activities under ASP-P1 Tanzania, the project’s efficiency was
    primarily assessed by its investment in the disposal of obsolete pesticides and associated waste. The
    project spend all available funds, and succeeded in achieving its revised PDO by disposing all
    inventoried obsolete pesticides, and a larger amount of contaminated soils than targeted.


253
   Exhibitions included Farmers Day (August 2012), Earth/World Environment Day (June 2012), Public Service Week (July
2012), 50 Years Independence Anniversary event (December 2012), and Maji (Water) Day (March 2012).
                                                          204
51. During appraisal, the unit cost for disposal was estimated at US$3,400 per tonne (based on
    approximately US$15 million spent on the disposal of 3,240 tonnes of obsolete pesticides between
    1990 and 2004 across Africa). (See Section 3.4 in the program-level ICR for details). At project
    closing, 967 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and associated waste had been disposed of at the cost of
    approximately US$5,243 per tonne, which represents a slightly higher cost than originally
    anticipated. 254 However, the US$ depreciation since 2004 and an increase in the price of fuel, which
    has increased the cost of disposal in US$ terms, is not taken into account by this calculation; neither
    are varying distances from collection centers to harbors, varying distances of shipping routes, and
    responses to call of bid by different companies.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
52. Overall Outcome - Rating Satisfactory: On the basis of the project’s efficiency (substantial),
    relevance (high), and PDO achievement (satisfactory), the overall outcome is rated satisfactory. The
    overall outcome rating takes into account that despite substantial implementation challenges prior to
    mid-term review (see Section 2), the project successfully reduced risks to the environment and public
    health by disposing of all inventoried obsolete pesticides and a substantial amount of highly
    contaminated soils. In addition, the project succeeded in significantly improving measures to reduce
    future re-accumulations by establishing the prerequisites for a sustainable system of pest and pesticide
    management.

3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
53. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development: The disposal of obsolete pesticides and
    associated wastes had a direct positive impact on poor and farming communities, species and
    ecosystems, located in proximity to sites carrying obsolete pesticide stocks and contaminated soils.
    Baseline data on affected populations, species, and ecosystems was not conducted at appraisal; exact
    impacts are therefore difficult to measure.
54. Institutional change/strengthening: The project strengthened the government’s institutional capacity
    on several levels: (i) an improved regulatory and legal framework for pest and pesticide management
    was drafted and is awaiting final enactment; (ii) the logistics of hazardous waste transportation have
    been internalized and the knowledge gained can inform future disposal activities; (iii) the experience
    and skills gained in managing the project, particularly in the areas of procurement and FM, could be
    applied to other projects and subsequently contribute to success; and (iv) knowledge gained on sound
    pesticide management through the various training that were provided to governmental staff.
55. Other unintended outcomes and impacts: The mid-term review drew attention to 660 tonnes of
    unwanted sulfur stocks. The stocks could not be included in the project, but the World Bank offered
    specialist advice to the Government in finding a solution to the problem. 255 The CESA TORs were
    subsequently modified to include the sulfur as an annex to the main report, and eventually the stocks
    were repacked and used as input by a fertilizer manufacturer.

254
    Costs include costs associated with repackaging, transport, and incineration of obsolete pesticides and other related activities
such as for example the inventory, safeguarding efforts, associated studies, and advisory services.
255
    The sulfur stocks could not be included in the project as (i) the sulfur stocks were privately owned and not part of the publicly
held stocks the ASP was looking at, and (ii) it presented a much lower risk to the environment and human populations than the
soil contamination or obsolete pesticide stocks.
                                                                  205
3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDING OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
56. An ICR mission including a stakeholder workshop was conducted on April 29-30, 2013 in Morogoro,
    Tanzania. For a detailed summary of the findings, please see Section 8.6. A beneficiary survey was
    not conducted.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

57. The risk to the development outcome is rated moderate: The risk is confined to the re-accumulation
    of obsolete pesticides, and a potential weakening of government commitment to sustaining the
    project’s outcomes, particularly with respect to prevention activities. However, the project set the
    basis for strengthened pesticide legislation and national capacity; if enacted and together with the
    various activities agreed upon in the comprehensive strategy for dealing with future stocks of obsolete
    pesticides and associated waste, the government is well positioned to sustainably manage and reduce
    the re-accumulation of obsolete pesticides. The government’s commitment that has been visible
    particularly following the project’s restructuring is likely to continue as visible by a follow-on project
    that is currently being prepared to focus on the remaining contaminated soils that continue to be in the
    country.

5. ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
58. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Project
    preparation of ASP-P1 Tanzania was conducted in conjunction with preparatory activities at the
    program-level, which were lengthy (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). While considerable
    time was invested in overall preparation, key project preparation documents for ASP-P1 Tanzania
    only broadly laid out project implementation plans, and lacked country-specific information. The
    project’s design was characterized by several weaknesses, which translated into substantial project
    implementation delays (see Section 2.1). FM and procurement assessments and subsequent
    recommendations were adequate.
59. Quality of World Bank supervision – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The project was supervised
    by the Task Team Leader (TTL) responsible for ASP at the program-level, and a co-TTL specifically
    assigned to ASP-P1 Tanzania. Supervision missions took place regularly, albeit only once a year prior
    to 2009.
60. During the first three years, World Bank performance was affected by issues at the program-level that
    resulted in delays. 256 Following the mid-term review, the World Bank team improved its support and
    addressed more proactively the project’s implementation delays. Efforts included: (i) effective
    discussions with high-level representatives from the government on how to improve project

256
   World Bank performance had contributed to initial project implementation delays through: (i) The late opening of a special
account for the project, which delayed disbursements of first installments by six months; (ii) collaboration issues with FAO,
which had resulted in the PMU raising concern about differing guidance received from the two agencies; and (iii) lengthy review
and clearance processes for non-objections.
                                                             206
    implementation; (ii) more efficient project implementation support through local World Bank staff;
    (iii) an extension of the project’s closing date to compensate for start-up delays; and (iv) the
    preparation (with subsequent approval by the Board) of a Level 1 restructuring involving revision of
    the PDO to respond to sector realities and country needs, and to ensure PDO achievement. Successful
    disposal activities were ensured through: (i) the reallocation of existing GEF funds to maximize the
    amount of hazardous materials to be disposed of; and (ii) the timely preparation of an additional
    extension of the closing date to ensure the safe arrival of already shipped obsolete pesticide materials
    at their destination, PDO achievement, and project funding eligibility of all disposal-related activities.
61. FM reviews were regularly conducted by World Bank FM specialists. This included reviewing
    project FM arrangements (i.e., budgeting, accounting, reporting, funds flow, internal controls and
    external audit arrangements), and the implementation of internal and external audit queries.
62. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The project suffered from
    shortcomings in project preparation and design at the program-level, which caused substantial delays
    during project implementation. However, following slow performance during the first half of the
    project, the World Bank team improved its performance through corrective actions, which ultimately
    contributed to successful PDO achievement.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
63. Government performance – Rating Satisfactory: Government commitment at entry towards the issue
    of obsolete pesticides was evident through actions the government had already undertaken in view of
    the problem obsolete pesticides were posing. During project preparation and implementation, there
    was equally strong support for the project as demonstrated by active participation in preparatory and
    implementation activities.
64. Implementing Agency – Rating Satisfactory: Overall, NEMC’s performance was satisfactory, with
    gradual improvement throughout project implementation. Initially, the day-to-day management of
    project activities was hampered by NEMC’s project management capacity. The PMU coordinator
    position was only appointed in January 2008; a lack of specialized procurement staff further
    contributed to initial delays. However, following initial challenges, NEMC showed increasing
    capacity and commitment towards achieving the PDO. Project implementation was substantially
    improved, and a high level of effectiveness was maintained until project closure; performance was at
    a highly satisfactory level during the second half of project implementation. NEMC also complied
    with all World Bank loan covenants, and executed its fiduciary duties in a timely manner, including
    safeguards.
65. Overall borrower performance – Rating Satisfactory: Based on the above presented evaluation, the
    overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

66. The most significant lessons learned are outlined in Section 6 of the program-level ICR, as the
    experience they are based on was often reflected across all country-specific projects. Lessons learned
    that were particularly relevant to ASP-P1 Tanzania include:


                                                     207
    •        The project’s effectiveness and development impact can significantly benefit from correct
             application of World Bank safeguard instruments. The CESA identified suitable collection
             centers, to which obsolete pesticide stocks were transferred to for safer storage and convenient
             transportation. The collection centers eventually represented a significant cost-saving benefit
             when final disposal activities were undertaken.
    •        Participation of local NGOs in project activities can significantly enhance outcomes at the
             local level. The NGO network was substantially involved in project activities related to
             conducting the national inventory, and prevention. Awareness raising, independent monitoring of
             health and safety standards, and promotion of participatory community monitoring significantly
             improved the project’s impact at the local level. In addition, knowledge sharing platforms,
             implemented in form of the NSAF, proved to be a valuable venue to raise awareness for the issue
             of obsolete pesticides.
    •        Local World Bank presence was important to getting implementation on track. The client
             struggled with getting guidance and approvals for many day-to-day issues. The presence of a
             locally based co-TTL was helpful in expediting these processes.
    •        World Bank support for communications can be very useful. The country-based World Bank
             team provided important support to the client in communicating the important results obtained.
             The communications officer and co-TTL worked to convene key media outlets so that they could
             learn of the program's achievements.

8.6 STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS
4. An ICR mission including a stakeholder workshop was conducted from April 29-30, 2013 in
   Morogoro, Tanzania. Stakeholders highlighted the following key points:


                                                        214
    •   The most important prevention achievements included improved laws, strengthened capacity
        building, establishment of a pesticides management system, development of a communication
        strategy, development of IPM, pesticide and container management strategies, and establishment
        of a national NGO network.
    •   The most important disposal achievements included disposal of obsolete pesticides and
        associated waste, improved collaboration between NGOs, research institutions, and the private
        sector, identification of obsolete pesticides locations, completion of a nation-wide inventory, and
        establishment of main collection centers for obsolete pesticides.
    •   Key challenges included data verification, information gaps regarding obsolete pesticide stocks,
        high turnover of staff, short project timeframe, communities’ low awareness of obsolete pesticide
        issue, delay in disbursement of funds, and lengthy procurement processes.
    •   Sustainability of project outcomes can be ensured through enforcement of existing legal
        instruments, additional funding for well-equipped laboratories to ensure quality control,
        awareness raising for the proper use or management of pesticides, an effective system for empty
        container management including the creation of collection centers, triple-rinsing, recycling,
        partnership between government and recycling industries, the creation of a multi-purpose
        disposing unit to cut across pesticides and other chemicals and industrial waste (even through a
        multi-regional approach), and careful management of subsidies including safety nets.
    •   Unclear institutional set up at the program-level negatively affected project implementation in
        form of disbursement delays, a resulting bureaucratic arrangement that hindered timely decision
        making, and unclear procurement due to different procurement procedures conducted between
        World Bank and FAO.
    •   Key lessons learned included: (i) involving target group from the beginning on is important; (ii)
        obsolete pesticide disposal was costly; (iii) strong collaboration was needed among stakeholders;
        (iv) in-country incineration should be explored; (v) Tanzania needed regulatory tools for
        prevention of accumulation of pesticides; and (vi) prevention was a cheaper alternative to
        overseas obsolete pesticide disposal.

8.7 SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR AND COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
5. The borrower submitted a completion report; messages contained therein were integrated into this
   document.
6. Equally incorporated were comments received on the draft ICR. Additional comments included:
   a. It was suggested to upgrading the unsatisfactory rating for PDO achievement prior to the
      restructuring, as according to the borrower ASP-P1 Tanzania progressed well prior to the
      restructuring as was evident from PDO and IP ratings between February 2009 and November
      2010.
        •   World Bank response: The assessment took the project’s six PDO indicators into account, of
            which two were fully (100%), and four not (0%) achieved. Those not achieved included
            Original PDO Indicator #3 (Inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides stocks disposed of,
            as a result of the completion of the disposal services contract(s) in accordance with national
            and international laws and regulations), which was closest linked to the PDO.

F. Results Framework Analysis - At project approval, no country-specific results framework existed;
only six PDO Indicators had been defined. Following a Level 1 Restructuring in June 2011, a country-
specific results framework was introduced. The original six PDO Indicators were revised and reduced to
two PDO Indicators, and in addition, seven Intermediate Outcome Indicators were introduced.

Project Development Objective (PDO) – as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement: 259 To
assist the recipient in: (a) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and associated
waste; and (b) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.
Revised PDO – as presented in the Level 1 Restructuring of June 2011 (Report No: 62797-TN): To assist
the Government of Tunisia in: (i) eliminating and/or safeguarding inventoried publicly held obsolete
pesticide stocks and associated waste; and (ii) implementing measures to reduce future related risks.

Global Environment Objectives (GEO) - as presented in the PAD (Report No: 32232-MNA):
Reduction of the effects of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) on the global environment.

(a) PDO Indicators – Original PDO Indicators as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement are
assessed against achievements realized at the time of the project’s Level 1 restructuring in June 2011,
before revised PDO Indicators are assessed against achievements realized at project closing in June 2012.

    The PDO, indicators, and components that are stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) slightly differ from those
stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement. This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented
in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s implementation
activities; in addition, changes under a Level 1 restructuring were introduced to the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
AND DESIGN

1.1 CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL
1. Country background: Despite the change and diversification observed in the Tunisian economy
   (industrialization, growth of service sector and expansion of tourism), the agricultural sector had
   remained economically and socially important for achieving national objectives such as food security,
   employment, regional equilibrium and social cohesion. At project approval in September 2005,
   agriculture employed more than one-quarter of the country’s workforce, and accounted for around
   13% of GDP. 261
2. Sector background: Around 3000 tonnes of pesticides had been imported annually to boost
   agricultural production. The bulk was used on cereal crops to control insect pests, and diseases on
   food crops. The Ministry of Agriculture had been a major pesticide user during national pest control
   campaigns (e.g., locust and rodent control); in expectation of pest outbreaks, the Ministry had stored
   large quantities of pesticides. 262
3. Obsolete pesticide accumulation: Studies conducted in 1997 had revealed the existence of a number
   of stocks of obsolete pesticides, including Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). These stocks had
   mostly accumulated through massive overprovision in relation to actual needs for public health vector
   control and combating migratory pests such as locusts. Some of these stocks had been stored for over
   45 years. At appraisal, Tunisia had hundreds of sites containing obsolete pesticide stockpiles, which
   potentially posed serious health hazards to nearby populations. Product bans, uncoordinated
   donations, poor stock management, and inadequate storage had been the additional reasons for the
   stockpiling of pesticides in the country.
4. Institutional background: Prior to Tunisia becoming a party to the Stockholm Convention in June
   2004, a wide process of dialogue and information exchange had been initiated by the Ministry of
   Environment with other ministries and agencies, which were concerned about the management of
   dangerous chemicals and wastes; a number of high level meetings among all stakeholders were held
   to effectively collaborate on developing a National Implementation Plan (NIP) under the Stockholm
   Convention to ensure ecologically sound management of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). At
   appraisal, all pesticides imported or formulated in the country had to be registered with the Ministry
   of Agriculture. Pesticides used for public health purposes were subject to prior authorization by the
   Ministry of Health. However, the implementation of these regulations was not always rigorous,
   particularly the regulations that governed the labeling, conditioning, handling, transport and storage
   of these products. 263
5. Actions taken: At the time of project design, the Government of Tunisia had initiated preparatory
   activities under its NIP, 264 with the support of the United National Environment Program (UNEP) and

      the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). These activities included
      completion of a preliminary inventory of obsolete pesticides across the country, which had identified
      128 sites with estimated 1,200 tonnes of obsolete stocks. Subsequently, the inventoried obsolete
      stocks were pooled into 17 secured sites. In addition, the government officially established a Project
      Management Unit (PMU) within the Department of Solid Wastes at the National Environment
      Protection Agency.
6. Rationale for World Bank assistance: Please refer to Section 1.1 in the program-level ICR.
7. Higher-level objectives: The project intended to contribute to Tunisia’s national development
   strategies in the areas of public health, poverty alleviation, environmental protection, and
   strengthening the agricultural and rural development sector as outlined in Tunisia’s Country
   Assistance Strategy (CAS). 265 In particular, the project aimed to (i) improve the quality of life in poor
   communities, by reducing environmental health risks, (ii) improve environmental protection, and (iii)
   enhance the capacity of the agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. Contributing to
   international efforts to eliminate POPs, improving management of toxic chemicals, and promoting
   alternatives to pesticide usage that include Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Vector
   Management (IVM) represented further objectives.

1.2 ORIGINAL PDO AND INDICATORS
8. The Project Development Objective (PDO), indicators, and components that are stated in the Project
   Appraisal Document (PAD) 266 slightly differ from those stated in the GEF Trust Fund Grant
   Agreement. 267 This ICR bases its evaluation on the PDO, indicators, and components presented in the
   GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, which served as the principal guiding document for the project’s
   implementation activities.
9. ASP-P1 Tunisia’s original PDO as presented in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement: 268 To
   assist the recipient in: (i) eliminating inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and
   associated waste; and (ii) implementing measures to reduce and prevent future related risks.
10. At appraisal, only an overall ASP-P1 results framework had been prepared (see program-level ASP
    ICR); results frameworks for the individual ASP-P1 countries, including Tunisia, were intended to be
    finalized during the individual ASP-P1 country project launches. However, country-specific PDO
    indicators were developed at appraisal. For ASP-P1 Tunisia, these were as follows:

1.3 REVISED PDO AND INDICATORS
11. The PDO and associated indicators for ASP-P1 Tunisia were revised through a Level I restructuring
    on June 30, 2011. 270 The original PDO had implied that all inventoried obsolete pesticides would be
    eliminated in high temperature incineration facilities overseas. With the discovery of higher than
    estimated stocks, including associated waste, it was preferable to adopt a blended approach of
    disposal overseas and lower cost safeguarding in-country based on risk profiling of the inventoried
    pesticides and associated waste, and availability of satisfactory storage facilities (i.e. obsolete
    pesticides and higher risk stocks of heavily contaminated soils being disposed of overseas while
    lower risk stocks of associated waste being safeguarded in-country). In addition, the original PDO
    had assumed no new accumulations of obsolete pesticides during the life of the project, which had
    been proven difficult to achieve in the context of agricultural intensification and food security. A
    focus on developing a strategy for sustainable management of future accumulations was pursued
    instead.
12. ASP-P1 Tunisia’s revised PDO: To assist the Government of Tunisia in: (i) eliminating and/or
    safeguarding inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks and associated waste; and (ii)
    implementing measures to reduce future related risks.
13. ASP-P1 Tunisia’s PDO indicators were reduced in number and revised to focus on the updated
    project objectives, i.e., disposal and/or safeguarding and reduction of future accumulations (see Table
    1.4). In addition, a country-specific result framework was introduced for effective monitoring and
    evaluation of project progress (see Data Sheet).
14. ASP-P1 Tunisia’s revised PDO Indicators: (i) 100% of publicly held inventoried obsolete pesticides
    and associated waste disposed of and/or safeguarded by the end of the project; and (ii) a strategy
    and/or action plan to sustainably improve management and reduce accumulation of obsolete
    pesticides (including IPM) developed and endorsed by the Steering Committee.

   Revisions were approved on June 30, 2011, on the basis of: Restructuring Paper on a Proposed Project Restructuring of
Africa Stockpiles Program – Project 1 to the Republic of Tunisia, (Report No: 62797-TN), June 20, 2011
                                                              234
1.4 MAIN BENEFICIARIES
15. ASP-P1 Tunisia was designed to eliminate a major source of risk to human health and environmental
    resources. Primary beneficiaries of the project were as follows:
16. Local beneficiaries: Primary beneficiaries were intended to be poor and farming communities. The
    project aimed to improve their quality of life by reducing environmental health risks: (i) Poor
    communities: Since obsolete pesticide stockpiles were often located in poorer communities where
    people had low awareness regarding the consequences of exposure to contaminated sites and storage
    equipment, the intended primary beneficiaries were the urban and rural poor; particularly those living
    in proximity to the 205 identified obsolete pesticide stockpile sites, spread over 24 governorates. (ii)
    Farming communities: A wide range of pesticides had been used for pest management and vector
    control in agricultural areas, with pesticide distributors and small-scale farmers often having low
    levels of awareness for exposure risks, little knowledge of safe pesticide handling and alternative pest
    control, inadequate storage facilities and limited alternatives.
17. National beneficiaries: The government, in particular the ministries of health, environment, and
    agriculture, were intended to be institutional beneficiaries. Benefits were planned to include cost-
    effective pesticide management in terms of reduced loss in capital, or improved effectiveness in
    appropriate planning, management, and monitoring regarding obsolete pesticides.
18. Global beneficiaries: The global community of people, species, and ecosystems was considered as
    global beneficiaries. Taking into account that obsolete pesticides are often characterized by high
    persistence in the environment, 271 the environmental impact in the form of damaged ecosystems had
    been considered serious. Extensive cleanup and contamination-prevention activities were intended to
    allow for substantial global environmental health benefits.
19. Beneficiaries were not modified during project implementation.

2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND QUALITY AT ENTRY
21. ASP-P1 Tunisia was prepared between 2001 and 2005, as part of preparatory activities at the
    program-level. It took more than four years from GEF eligibility in July 2001, and more than three
    years from concept note in July 2002 to project approval by the World Bank Board in September
    2005. 273
22. Soundness of background analysis: Project preparation was conducted in close collaboration
    between the government and the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
    CropLife International (CLI), and FFEM, as was evident through joint missions, and pledged
    financial contributions from all partners. Key preparatory outputs such as the PAD and Operations
    Manual, however only broadly laid out the project’s plans; detailed country-specific information
    regarding M&E, risks and risk mitigation measures, Financial Management (FM) including
    disbursement plans, and procurement were missing. In addition, the political situation in Tunisia was
    not adequately reflected in the project’s design regarding Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)
    involvement, as became evident from the limited independence of local NGOs during project
    implementation.
23. During project preparation, Département des Déchets Solides (DDS) was identified as the
    implementing agency. DDS was anchored in the ANPE, whose overall capacity to implement the
    project was assessed adequate by the World Bank, particularly based on its experience in executing
    projects of similar magnitude. 274 However, it was noted that specialized staff would need to be
    identified before appraisal and that training and technical supervision in project management, FM,
    and procurement would be crucial. Shortly before negotiations, the DDS was separated from ANPE
    and reestablished as Agence Nationale de Gestion des Dechets (ANGeD) under the Ministry of
    Environment, resulting in a different legal status. A renewed assessment of FM and procurement
    capacity was subsequently necessary, but only conducted together with a procurement assessment a
    couple of months after project approval. The late assessment drew attention to some key FM elements
    that were missing. 275
24. Assessment of project design: The project’s design (as for all ASP-P1 participating countries) was
    preconfigured at the program level, and did not reflect any country-specific modifications. Design
    weaknesses at the program level that translated into implementation delays at the country-level,
    including ASP-P1 Ethiopia, are outlined in Section 2.1 of the program-level ICR.
25. Government commitment: Government commitment at entry towards the issue of obsolete pesticides
    was evident through preliminary steps the government had undertaken in view of the problem
    obsolete pesticides were posing. These included activities to reduce short-term risks through
    controlled storage, and activities targeted at reducing risks in the long-term through import regulation,
    legislation on registration of imported products, monitoring of wholesalers and retailers, and research

273
    The long preparation time resulted from a lengthy partnership building/negotiation process at the program-level resulting from
the complex implementation arrangement and project design (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR).
274
     ANPE had been managing several environmental projects in collaboration with donors such as the KfW (German
Development Bank), GEF, or the World Bank.
275
    Missing elements included the development of an organizational manual, clearly assigned FM and accounting responsibilities,
recruitment of an internal auditor, and presentation of a detailed budget plan.
                                                                 238
      and implementation of alternatives such as IPM, and organic farming. Further steps included the
      completion of a preliminary inventory of obsolete pesticides across the country with subsequent
      pooling of inventoried stocks into secured sites.
26. Assessment of risks: Program-level risks were adequately identified and outlined in the PAD. They
    were presented in the form of a matrix and represented a summary of risk assessments undertaken
    during identification, pre-appraisal and appraisal missions to ASP-P1 participating countries. Even
    though the assessment of risks was comprehensive and included a broad range of mitigation measures
    in generic terms, an assessment of risks and mitigation measures specific to Tunisia was lacking. At
    the same time, it should be noted that it was difficult to assess country-specific risks in the absence of
    inventories of obsolete pesticides and CESAs, which were only planned to be undertaken during
    project implementation.

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION
27. Throughout implementation, the project experienced long delays, eventually resulting in two
    extensions for a total of 33 months, and a Level 1 restructuring in 2011.
28. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes included:
      •   Delayed and insufficient technical support affected implementation performance. The PMU was
          supposed to receive highly technical and specialized expertise (required for implementation,
          supervision and monitoring of project activities) from FAO’s Technical Support Unit (TSU);
          however, this support was not delivered to the extent originally planned. Reasons were mainly
          collaboration issues between the World Bank and FAO, resulting from a complex and loosely
          defined stakeholder implementation arrangement at the program-level (see Section 2.2 in the
          program-level ICR). The limited support of procurement and M&E significantly affected the
          PMU’s project implementation capacity. The delayed recruitment of a Technical Advisor for
          Disposal (TAD), originally intended to be financed by CLI, further affected implementation.276
          To fill the gap, the World Bank temporarily recruited an experienced obsolete pesticide and
          hazardous waste expert in July 2009, and together with the TAD’s eventual recruitment in
          September 2010, good implementation progress was consequently achieved.
      •   Institutional challenges: The delayed institutional set-up had an effect on the project’s start-up
          activities. It took more than seven months before project activities began, because ANGed and the
          Ministry of Agriculture (DGPCQPA) had difficulties to agree on exact responsibilities. Their
          collaboration continued to be challenging thereafter and particularly affected implementation of
          prevention activities. Eventually in 2010, responsibilities associated with the management of the
          prevention component were handed over from ANGed to the Ministry of Agriculture.277
          Collaboration improved gradually in the following. Further initial delays were caused by the
          PMU’s lack of specialized staff; until the mid-term review, the project coordinator was handling
          most of the project’s administrative tasks, including procurement and M&E related tasks. In


276
    The recruitment of a TAD financed by CLI had been planned for February 2007. However, long negotiations between CLI,
the World Bank, and the PMU on the financing modalities, had not led to an agreement. The eventual recruitment in 2010 was
financed through reallocation of existing GEF funds.
277
    Prevention activities were co-financed in parallel by the FFEM. As a result of the above mentioned initial delays, FFEM
extended its financing after project closing by 12 months.
                                                              239
          2010, the transition associated with the recruitment of a new project coordinator put project
          implementation temporarily on hold.
      •   Higher than estimated obsolete pesticide stocks: At mid-term review in 2008, the project was
          facing a funding gap of around US$2.5 million as a result of higher than estimated obsolete
          pesticides, and an increase in unit cost for disposal.278 A subsequent estimate in 2009, determined
          the funding gap to be US$1.735 million. The government requested additional GEF financing in
          the amount of US$770,000, and possible co-financing by CLI was considered. However, in 2010,
          it was assumed that no additional funding would be needed as existing funds under the original
          GEF grant would be sufficient following ANGed’s decision to reallocate some of the funds. In
          addition, the competitive bidding process for the elimination contract had resulted in a lower
          disposal cost per unit in comparison to the one originally estimated. During disposal activities,
          nevertheless, further obsolete pesticide stockpiles were identified.
      •   Weak NGO integration: The participation of local NGOs in prevention and information activities
          (intended to be strengthened through crosscutting support provided by PAN-UK and WWF) was
          weak throughout the project. Main reasons for the low involvement were (i) Tunisia’s political
          environment in which local NGOs were not allowed except for those mandated by the
          government, and (ii) a lack of agreements determining the extent of responsibilities, roles and
          extent of support between the PMU, and the NGOs. By recognizing the deficit, and to improve
          collaboration with the local NGO community, in 2009, the World Bank recommended carrying
          out a national workshop in order to jointly develop a framework for an improved and more
          effective involvement in project activities. Eventually in October 2012, such workshop took
          place; it was delayed as it was embedded in the second communication strategy that had only
          been completed in June 2012.
      •   Restructuring: At mid-term review, the World Bank recommended revising the PDO, raising
          additional funding, and extending the project’s closing date. In addition and in view of the lack of
          technical support described above, the World Bank urged to strengthen the PMU with technical
          expertise during disposal activities, and administrative and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
          support. Even though it took over two years as a result of political reluctance in Tunisia to
          restructure the PDO, 279 eventually the project was restructured in June 2011. 280

2.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E) DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND
UTILIZATION
29. Overall M&E - Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory.



278
    The estimated unit cost for disposal had increased to US$3,500 as opposed to US$2,625 at appraisal, as a result of higher than
estimated stocks, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar, and higher energy costs.
279
    See Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) – Sequence #9
280
    Additional delays following the restructuring of the project resulted from a necessary three-months extension of the disposal
contract caused by: (ii) the Spanish authorities that took five months to issue the necessary authorizations which were required
for exporting the obsolete pesticides in accordance with the recommendations of the Basel Convention; (iii) changes to the
maritime itinerary imposed by the shipping company; and (iv) the events associated with the Tunisian revolution that began in
December 2010, and which were accompanied by various governmental strikes and blocked roads affecting accessibility of
several sites.
                                                                240
30. M&E design – Rating Unsatisfactory: Despite the lengthy preparation time, an M&E system specific
    for Tunisia was not developed before or during appraisal. 281 A result framework, which was intended
    to be finalized by the TSU during project launch and included in the project’s Operational Manual,
    did not materialize as well. Only a set of PDO indicators linked to the different project components
    was developed in the PAD and GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement, however, these did not allow for
    adequate monitoring of project implementation progress. The indicators focused on measuring
    outputs as opposed to progress towards project outcomes. Expected results under the prevention
    component, in particular, were not adequately considered by the indicators.
31. M&E implementation – Rating Unsatisfactory: Until the mid-term review in October 2008, there
    was neither an M&E specialist nor an M&E system in place, and several delays in submitting
    progress reports were noted. Eventually, in November 2009, the TSU provided the PMU with and
    trained it in using a Disposal-Project Tracking Workbook to monitor and evaluate project-related
    activities. However, the tool was complex, and introduced too late in the process to be used by the
    PMU as most of the activities the system should have monitored (e.g., the inventory) had already
    been completed. The PMU compensated for the lack of an M&E system by using self-created tables
    for progress monitoring. In 2011, following the restructuring of the project, a results framework
    specific to Tunisia was finally introduced and the PDO and associated indicators were revised to
    focus on the two main project achievements (disposal and/or safeguarding and reduction of future
    accumulations) which strengthened the M&E of the project, albeit late in the process.
32. M&E utilization – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The inventory of obsolete pesticide stocks was
    conducted by using inventory forms and a manual provided by the FAO Environmental Management
    Toolkit (EMTK). 282 The inventory data was entered into a database of the FAO web-based Pesticide
    Stock Management System (PSMS) to record and monitor the pesticide stocks, and subsequently
    validated. The data was used by the PMU for risk profiling of the stocks 283 and preparation of the
    CESA. FAO had provided training to the PMU in how to best use the database, which took place in
    2008 and 2012. The PSMS together with the EMTK proved to be very useful tools in managing
    obsolete pesticides stocks.

2.4 SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE
33. Safeguard compliance – Rating Satisfactory: ASP-P1 triggered two safeguard policies: OP 4.01 on
    Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 on Pest Management; ASP-P1 Tunisia triggered OP 4.12 on
    Involuntary Resettlement.
34. ASP-P1 Tunisia complied with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment: A CESA identifying risks and
    devising mitigation measures to address potential negative environmental and social impacts was
    completed to the World Bank’s satisfaction in February 2010, albeit with significant delays. The
    assessment included extensive public consultations, conducted between June and December 2009.


281
    Lengthy discussions between the partners during project preparation on whether to have an M&E system at the program-level
alone, or also at the country-level, may have contributed to the absence of an M&E system at the country-level at project launch.
However, no information was available on whether it was a deliberate decision not to have an M&E system in place at the
country-level.
282
    The tool kit provides a practical set of methodologies to assist countries in the risk-based management of obsolete pesticides,
including guidance on the management of collection/storage locations, based on international best practice.
283
    Sites were evaluated by risk category (high, medium, and low).
                                                                241
      EMPs and a Health and Safety Plan were equally completed. The assessment’s late completion
      resulted from: a) the project’s sequential design (the inventory was only finalized in 2007); b) a
      complicated and time-consuming consultant procurement process; and c) lengthy World Bank review
      and clearance processes. 284 Subsequently, project activities involving storage, transportation, disposal,
      and site remediation were implemented in full compliance with the recommendations and
      requirements of the CESA, the associated EMP, and the Health and Safety Plan. 285 With exception of
      the first two years (which were intended to focus on training local staff in conducting the inventory
      and risk assessment), World Bank safeguard specialists monitored and ensured compliance with
      safeguard requirements through participation in supervision missions and specific safeguard review
      missions. 286 Disposal operations were completed without reported incidents or accidents to personnel,
      or damages and/or pollution to the environment.287
35. OP 4.09 on Pest Management: Since project activities themselves met requirements of a pest
    management plan (i.e., through pesticide management, IPM, and capacity building), individual
    country projects, including ASP-P1 Tunisia, were not required to prepare self-standing documents.
    See Section 2.4 in the program-level for more details.
36. ASP-P1 Tunisia complied with OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement: Based on the CESA’s
    recommendations, OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was officially added to the list of
    triggered safeguard policies in June 2011 as part of the Level 1 restructuring. The policy was
    triggered for a storage site in Fathallah, a southern suburb of Tunis that was being used for business
    purposes by occupants. The high-risk site required a succinct Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the
    occupants of the site during disposal activities, as they were directly affected by the project. Despite
    smaller incidents and a difficult political environment resulting from the aftermath of the Tunisian
    revolution, the comprehensive resettlement action plan was implemented and completed to a highly
    satisfactory extent in June 2012. 288
37. Financial Management compliance – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The responsible finance and
    accounting department was adequately staffed. Financial Monitoring Reports together with annual
    audits (conducted by an external auditor) were regularly prepared and submitted to the World Bank’s
    satisfaction, however often delayed. In addition, recommendations made during World Bank missions
    were often implemented with delays, the PMU and the financial and accounting department poorly
    collaborated with each other on several occasions, and an ineligible expenditure was noted. 289

284
    The World Bank provided three sets of comments on the CESA over a period of 9 months (10/2008-06/2009), before it was
submitted for final World Bank clearance and disclosure.

288
    A consultant was hired in October 2011, who prepared and oversaw necessary safeguarding activities until their completion in
June 2012. Activities included a consultation campaign, financial compensation for the site’s occupiers, safeguarding activities,
decontamination of the site, and the final return of the occupiers. During safeguarding activities, a scale (used by the occupiers to
weigh the materials) and a metal gate owned by the occupiers broke but were subsequently compensated for by the World Bank.
Also, the discovery of higher than estimated obsolete pesticides at the site delayed the estimated time frame of two months by
four.
289
    An unexplained discrepancy in the amount of US$1,128 between the balance of the special account listed on the statement of
the Central Bank of Tunisia and the available balance shown in the counting records of ANGed in 2006 was considered as
                                                                 242
38. Disbursement was low throughout implementation, with only 26% in June 2011, when the project
    was restructured. However, this was mainly attributable to the project’s design, which included the
    most costly activity (disposal) to take place at the end of the project.
39. Procurement – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: Procurement undertaken by ANGed suffered
    from a number of delays, particularly in selecting consulting firms to conduct the CESA 290 and
    disposal of obsolete pesticides. The delay was attributable to a lengthy negotiation process between
    FAO and the World Bank regarding the CESA consulting firm’s Terms of Reference (TORs), the
    PMU’s weak procurement capacity, and insufficient technical support that the FAO-TSU had
    originally intended to provide on the pre-qualification, bidding, and execution of the specialized
    services associated with procuring the selection processes. However, it should be noted that despite
    these challenges and delays, all services were eventually procured to the World Bank’s satisfaction.

2.5 POST-COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE
40. Post-completion: Following the project’s closure in June 2012, the Government of Tunisia financed
    the elimination and safeguarding of 218 additional tonnes of obsolete pesticides and 44 additional
    tonnes of associated waste that had not been treated under ASP-P1 due to insufficient funds. The
    originally projected total of 1,280 tonnes had been exceeded by about 533 tonnes following the
    discovery of additional stocks during disposal activities; of those additional tonnes, only 315 tonnes
    had been eliminated under the project. The government’s commitment indicated the high priority
    given by the national authorities to address and resolve the issue of obsolete pesticides.
41. Next phase: FFEM co-funding of the prevention component was extended until March 2014
    following the project’s closure. Achievements since project closure and expected outputs planned to
    be achieved prior to March 2014 include the following:
     •    To raise awareness for sound pesticide management, two communication strategies had been
          drafted prior to project closing. The second draft was finalized in June 2012 and includes plans to
          raise awareness among approximately 4000 farmers located in five different governorates.
          Implementation is expected to be finalized by the end of 2013. Activities have been using
          communication tools such as posters, informational agricultural and scientific guide books, a
          video, three TV spots broadcasted on national television and three radio spots broadcasted on the
          local radio. To improve the collaboration with NGOs, ANGed called for proposals and, in May
          2013, selected nine NGOs to support awareness raising activities. Specifically, they target raising
          awareness among primary school pupils to transmit information to their farming parents.
          Activities are expected to be completed by March 31, 2014.
     •    Following the piloting of empty pesticide container collection in two governorates under the
          project, the government plans to establish a nation-wide network for the collection and
          processing of empty pesticide containers by 2015. A study on the network’s technical and
          economic feasibility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2014. Also planned by 2015
          and in collaboration with the National Agency of Sanitary and Environmental Control Products


ineligible expenditure at the end of 2011. The amount was subsequently refunded in March 2013, to the satisfaction of the World
Bank.
290
    An independent review of ANGed’s procurement procedures undertaken in June 2008 evaluated the processing time of 9.5
months for the selection of a consulting firm to conduct the CESA as too long.
                                                               243
          is the establishment of a national vigilance system to control the risks associated with pesticides;
          a study regarding the system’s implementation is expected to be finalized in the first half of
          2014.
      •   In addition to the two pesticide management regulations that were promulgated in 2010 and
          2011, the Ministry of Health is currently preparing an executive order for the establishment of a
          registration committee for the use of biocides and pesticides for public health purposes.
      •   Lastly, following the acquisition of a mass spectrometer, which allows the government's
          laboratories to better analyze pesticides, a second mass spectrometer for Inductively Coupled
          Plasma analysis has been ordered and its delivery is expected at the end of 2013. 291 The
          additional machine will allow for fast identification and detection of trace metals content in
          samples, and to eventually analyze all types of imported pesticides.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1 RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION
42. Relevance – Rating High: Despite having been too ambitious, the project’s original objectives were
    relevant when the project was prepared. The project’s revised objective, design, and implementation
    are considered highly relevant to the current national development priorities. The Government of
    Tunisia places strong emphasis on preserving the environment, reducing pollution, and supporting
    efforts to improve the quality of life in cities and rural areas, as evident from the country’s national
    development plan for the period 2010-14. 292 The project’s objective is also consistent with the World
    Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Tunisia FY10-13, 293 which supports efforts to reduce
    negative environmental and health impacts and to improve living conditions in urban areas; in
    particular, this includes consolidating improvements in solid waste collection, disposal, treatment, and
    management services with focus on cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability.
43. The project has been supporting the Government of Tunisia in complying with the Stockholm
    Convention on POPs, and the Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of
    hazardous wastes and their disposal. In addition, the government has shown increasing commitment
    to eliminating obsolete pesticides and introducing measures to reduce future related risks, as
    demonstrated by its post-project efforts (see Section 2.5).

3.2 ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
44. Taking account of the project’s Level 1 restructuring in June 2011, the project has been evaluated
    against its original and revised PDO by measuring achievements at the time of the project’s
    restructuring (June 2011) and project closing (June 2012), respectively.
45. Original PDO achievement – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The assessment took the project’s six
    PDO indicators into account, of which four were fully (100%), one partly (70%), and one not

      achieved (0%). The three main project outcomes measured by indicators include: 294 (i) sound
      disposal and management of obsolete pesticides; (ii) prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of
      obsolete pesticides; and (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide
      management.
46. Sound disposal and management of obsolete pesticides. The level of risks emanating from publicly
    held obsolete pesticides and associated waste to adjacent and wider communities or critical natural
    resources was determined and quantified through the completion of a national inventory of publicly
    held obsolete pesticides in 2007 (PDO Indicator #1 – 100%). The hereby-obtained information (geo-
    location of the storage sites, whether the storage sites were protected or not, identity of the
    contaminant, its quantity, and general condition of the stockpiles) provided the government with the
    knowledge necessary to inform the successful preparation of a CESA (PDO Indicator #2 – 100%),
    and eventual disposal and safeguarding of stockpiles. Due to substantial project implementation
    delays, the disposal of publicly held obsolete pesticide stocks under the disposal contract had only
    started preparatory activities by the time of the restructuring (PDO Indicator #3 – 0%). The project
    had therefore not yet reduced the risks emanating from the inventoried obsolete pesticides and
    associated waste.
47. Prevention of accumulation of new stockpiles of obsolete pesticides. Better regulation and control of
    the registration, production, storage, and sale of pesticides was achieved by substantially
    strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for pesticide management. The project fully
    achieved the enactment of two legal regulations by the Ministry of Agriculture, which reduced the
    number of products approved by the ministry from 1300 in 2010, to only 400 in 2012. 295 The
    regulations’ preparation was based on an analysis of the regulatory framework governing the sector of
    agricultural pesticides and its alignment with international conventions. However, measures to
    strengthen compliance with the Basel Convention were only initiated; the Rotterdam Convention had
    not been ratified (PDO Indicator #4 – 70%). 296 The project also achieved raising awareness on the
    health and environmental hazards of pesticides and encouraging safe pesticide handling by drafting
    and implementing one out of two comprehensive communication strategies.
48. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. Between 2006 and 2011,
    PMU members and representatives from the ministries of environment, agriculture, and health,
    participated in several pesticide management training courses. Capacity was strengthened as became
    evident through application of the acquired knowledge during the inventory, and when preparing
    safeguard instruments (Original PDO Indicator #5 – 100%).
49. Revised PDO achievement – Rating Satisfactory: The assessment took the project’s two revised
    PDO indicators into account, of which one was fully (100%) and one partly (85%) achieved. In
    addition, seven Intermediate Outcome Indicators framed the evaluation. Three of those were not taken

294
    Achievements were identified based on intended outcomes presented in Section B.1 and Annex I of the PAD (Report No:
32232-MNA)
295
    These include (i) Decree No. 2973-2010 which was enacted on November 15, 2010, and which established modalities and
conditions for registration, production and storage of pesticides; and (ii) the Executive Order No. 42/2011 which was issued on
June 10, 2011, and which set and revised modalities for tax collection related to phytosanitary control analysis, homologation and
provisional permit for sale of pesticides.
296
    70% achievement of PDO Indicator #4 consists of the following: Enactment of two legal regulations by the Ministry of
Agriculture achieved (100%); and only limited measures introduced to strengthen compliance with Basel Convention and non-
ratification of the Rotterdam Convention (40%).
                                                                245
      into account as they corresponded with Original PDO Indicators that had been achieved prior to
      restructuring; of those taken into account, one exceeded its target, and three were fully achieved.
      Outcomes were slightly modified following the restructuring and included: (i) sound disposal and
      management of obsolete pesticides and associated waste including safeguarding; (ii) reduction of re-
      accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated waste through regulations, pest management, and
      stakeholder involvement; and (iii) enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide
      management.

    associated waste. In 2007, a total
    of 2,036 tonnes of publicly held                Obsolete              Associated
                                                   Pesticides               Waste
    obsolete        pesticides      and
    associated waste was inventoried, consisting of 1,280 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and 756 tonnes of
    associated waste. At project closure, 1,730 tonnes (i.e., 1595 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and 135
    tonnes of associated waste) of the inventoried stocks had been disposed of overseas or safeguarded in
    country in an environmentally and technically sound manner (Revised PDO Indicator #1 – 85%). See
    Figure 3.1. The project had focused available funding towards eliminating obsolete pesticides and
    associated waste located at high-risk sites, while lower risk stocks of associated waste were
    safeguarded at a lower cost in-country. Specifically this included the disposal of (i) 1,595 tonnes of
    obsolete pesticides (including 18 tonnes that were safeguarded in country and 315 out of 533 tonnes
    that had been identified in addition to the inventoried 1,280 tonnes during disposal activities); 297 and
    (ii) 135 tonnes of associated waste. The remaining 621 tonnes of associated waste were
    safeguarded; 298 however, their final status could not be verified due to a lack of data verification and
    difficulties in measuring treatments. It should further be noted that the remaining 218 out of the 533
    tonnes of obsolete pesticides that had been identified in addition to the inventoried 1,280 tonnes and
    which were not disposed of under the project due to time constraints, were disposed of under the
    government’s own funding after project closure, together with 44 tonnes of associated waste.



297
  The additional 297 tonnes identified had not been inventoried in 2007 as a result of difficult site access.
298
   According to the PMU empty containers were rinsed, crushed and recycled, contaminated soils located in storage facilities
underwent superficial roughening or were delineated with restricted access, and contaminated building, equipment, and materials
were cleaned with high-pressure air/vacuum.
                                                              246
51. Reduction of re-accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated waste through regulations, pest
    management, and stakeholder involvement. The project implemented measures targeted at sustainably
    managing and reducing the re-accumulation of obsolete pesticides and associated wastes through the
    following activities: A national action plan including an IPM was adopted by the Ministry of
    Agriculture (Revised PDO Indicator #2 – 100%). 299 A diagnostic study on the management and use of
    pesticides in Tunisia was conducted beforehand and served as basis for the action plan.300 The project
    continued raising awareness on the health and environmental hazards of pesticides and encouraging
    safe pesticide handling by having drafted the second out of two comprehensive communication
    strategies (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #5 – 100%). Implementation of the second strategy is
    currently underway and focuses on training pesticide users and farmers in five different governorates
    (see Section 2.5 for details) in sound pesticide management. The project also improved the operations
    of collection centers through a piloting exercise of empty pesticide container collection in two
    governorates (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #4 – 100%). Plans to mainstream this pilot exercise are
    described in Section 2.5.
52. Enhanced capacity and institutional strengthening of pesticide management. In addition to the
    capacity building achieved prior to restructuring, the project further strengthened the government’s
    capacity in managing pesticides soundly. The government’s laboratory capacity was improved
    through the acquisition of a mass spectrometer which has allowed the government's laboratories to
    better analyze pesticides, and to improve the government's procurement capacity. Training courses on
    improved pesticide management practices were provided to government staff and national
    stakeholders (Intermediate Outcome Indicator #7 – 100%). Most notably, staff of the Ministry of
    Agriculture was trained in using and maintaining a container rinsing and crushing unit that was put in
    place and used for rinsing and crushing contaminated containers under the piloting exercise.301
53. Weighted average PDO – Rating Satisfactory: At restructuring in June 2011, the project had
    disbursed US$1.0 million, representing 26.3% of total disbursed funds of US$3.78 million. On this
    basis and as illustrated by the table below, the weighted average of the project’s PDO achievement is
    rated satisfactory. Annex 8.2 provides a comprehensive account of qualitative and quantitative
    information of outputs realized against both original and revised PDO and Intermediate Output
    Indicators.

    Trainings regarding use and maintenance of the container press were conducted by FAO in 2011 and 2012.
                                                                247
3.3 ACHIEVEMENT OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
54. The project aimed to directly contribute to the GEO of reducing the effects of POPs on the global
    environment through: (i) improving the quality of life in poor communities, by reducing
    environmental risks; (ii) improving environmental protection; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of the
    agricultural sector to better manage crop pests. GEO achievement is measured by PDO achievement,
    and, thus, is also rated satisfactory (see Section 3.2).

3.4 EFFICIENCY
55. Efficiency - Rating Substantial. This rating represents a broad estimate, as financial and economic
    data to support this rating are scarce. At appraisal, an economic or financial analysis was neither
    undertaken for ASP-P1 at the program nor at the country-level due to non-measurable benefits of
    reducing the risk of contaminating the environment.
56. Based on the fact that approximately 91% (approximately US$3.44 million) of disbursed GEF funds
    went towards disposal activities under ASP-P1 Tunisia, the project’s efficiency was primarily
    assessed by its investment in the disposal of obsolete pesticides and associated waste. During
    appraisal, the unit cost for disposal was estimated at US$3,400 per tonne (based on approximately
    US$15 million spent on the disposal of 3,240 tonnes of obsolete pesticides between 1990 and 2004
    across Africa). (See Section 3.4 in the program-level ICR for details).
57. At project closing, 1,730 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and associated waste had been disposed of at
    the cost of approximately US$1,986 per ton, which represents a much lower cost than originally
    anticipated. 302 Given the overall high cost involved, cleanup and safe disposal was prioritized on the
    basis of a detailed inventory of pesticide stockpiles and associated waste, determining the identity of
    the contaminant, its quantity, and its proximity to the people and environment. In comparison with the
    originally estimated US$3,400 per ton, the project achieved its goal with a much higher cost-benefit
    than originally estimated. In addition, Tunisia was the first ASP country that succeeded in disposing
    of its inventoried publicly held obsolete pesticides within allocated resources, and establishing a
    framework for sustainable pest and pesticide management. However, the US$ depreciation since 2004
    and an increase in the price of fuel, which has increased the cost of disposal in US$ terms, is not
    taken into account by this calculation; neither are varying distances from collection centers to harbors,
    varying distances of shipping routes, and responses to call of bid by different companies.

3.5 JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING
58. Overall Outcome - Rating Satisfactory: On the basis of the project’s efficiency (substantial),
    relevance (high), and PDO achievement (satisfactory), the overall outcome is rated satisfactory. The
    overall outcome rating takes into account that despite substantial implementation challenges (see
    Section 2), the project successfully reduced the risks that emanated from publicly held obsolete
    pesticides and associated wastes, and significantly improved measures to reduce future re-
    accumulations by establishing a sustainable system of pest and pesticide management.



302
   Costs include costs associated with repackaging, transport, and incineration of obsolete pesticides and other related activities
such as for example the inventory, safeguarding efforts, associated studies, and advisory services.
                                                                248
3.6 OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
59. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development: The disposal of obsolete pesticides and
    associated wastes had a direct positive impact on poor and farming communities, species and
    ecosystems, located in proximity to the identified 205 sites. Baseline data on affected populations,
    species and ecosystems was not collected at appraisal; exact impacts are therefore difficult to
    measure.
60. Institutional change/strengthening: The project strengthened the government’s institutional capacity
    on several levels: (i) the regulatory and legal framework for pest and pesticide management was
    improved; (ii) the logistics of hazardous waste transportation have been internalized and the
    knowledge gained can inform future disposal activities; (iii) the experience and skills gained in
    managing the project, particularly in the areas of procurement and FM, can be easily applied to other
    projects and subsequently contribute to success; and (iv) knowledge gained on sound pesticide
    management through the various training courses.
61. Other unintended outcomes and impacts: No unintended outcomes and impacts were noted.

3.7 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF BENEFICIARY SURVEY AND/OR STAKEHOLDER
WORKSHOPS
62. A specific completion, and/or ICR mission was not carried out, and thus no stakeholder workshop
    was held. However, the government provided a completion report, which did not specify any
    particular issues with stakeholders.

4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

63. Risk to the development outcome – Rating Low. The project substantially strengthened pesticide
    legislation and national capacity, and together with the various activities agreed upon in the national
    action plan, the government is well positioned to sustainably manage and reduce the re-accumulation
    of obsolete pesticides. The government’s commitment to enforcing these regulations and continuing
    to implement prevention activities has been demonstrated during the past two years of the project, its
    commitment to eliminating additional obsolete pesticides after project closure under its own financing
    is likely to continue.

5. ASSESSMENT OF WORLD BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
64. World Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: ASP-P1
    Tunisia was prepared in conjunction with preparatory activities at the program-level, which were
    lengthy (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). While considerable time was invested in overall
    preparation, key project preparation documents for ASP-P1 Tunisia only broadly laid out project
    implementation plans, and lacked country-specific information. The project’s design was
    characterized by several weaknesses, which translated into substantial project implementation delays
    (see Section 2.1 in the program-level ICR). FM and procurement assessments were adequate.
    Noteworthy is the World Bank’s quick reaction in conducting a second FM and procurement
                                                   249
      assessment, following the change in the legal status of the implementation agency late in the
      preparation process.
65. Quality of World Bank supervision – Rating Moderately Satisfactory: The project was supervised
    by the Task Team Leader (TTL) responsible for ASP at the program-level, and a co-TTL specifically
    assigned to ASP-P1 Tunisia – both based at the World Bank’s headquarters in Washington DC;
    supervision missions took place regularly, albeit only once a year.
66. During the first three years, World Bank performance was affected by a complex ASP-P1 program-
    wide supervision arrangement, which contributed to the project’s initial slow progress (see Section
    2.2 in the program-level ICR). It should, however, be noted that despite these initial challenges,
    World Bank performance contributed to Tunisia having been the first country to successfully carry
    out disposal activities. The World Bank’s collaboration with ASP-P1 partners was mixed. While the
    World Bank team effectively worked together with representatives from FFEM throughout
    implementation, 303 the collaboration with FAO and CLI prior to mid-term review was challenging,
    mainly as a result of the loosely defined stakeholder implementation arrangement at the program-
    level (see Section 2.2 in the program-level ICR). Collaboration with other partners such as PAN-UK
    and WWF was adequate, however, limited.
67. Following the mid-term review, the World Bank team gradually addressed more effectively the
    project’s implementation delays more effectively. To compensate for the insufficient support received
    from the TSU and CLI, and to ensure achievement of the PDO, the team took corrective actions when
    needed. These included: (i) timely reaction to the mid-term review through the preparation of an
    additional GEF financing request, extension of the closing date, and the temporary recruitment of a
    pesticide expert; 304 (ii) reallocation of GEF funds to accommodate the eventual recruitment of a TAD
    (originally supposed to be financed by CLI); and (iii) the approval of a Level 1 restructuringinvolving
    revision of the PDO to respond to sector realities and country needs, which contributed to PDO
    achievement.
68. Overall World Bank performance – Rating Moderately Unsatisfactory: The project suffered from
    shortcomings in project preparation and design at the program level, but following a resulting slow
    performance during the first half of the project, the World Bank team gradually improved its
    performance through corrective actions, which contributed to the achievement of the PDO.

5.2 BORROWER PERFORMANCE
69. Government performance – Rating Satisfactory: Government commitment at entry towards the issue
    of obsolete pesticides was evident through previous steps the government had already undertaken.
    During preparation there was equally strong support for the project as demonstrated by active
    participation in preparatory activities. The government’s decision to modify the institutional set-up
    shortly before negotiations, however, delayed the project’s start-up activities. It took more than seven
    months before project activities began, as a result of ANGed and the Ministry of Agriculture
    (DGPCQPA) having had difficulties in agreeing on exact responsibilities. Collaboration difficulties
    continued thereafter and particularly affected implementation of prevention activities. However, the
303
  Representative from FFEM joint all supervision missions.
304
  Long negotiations between CLI, the World Bank, and the PMU at the country-level on the financing modalities of a Technical
Advisor for Disposal (TAD) caused significant delay in recruiting a TAD. Eventually, negotiations did not lead to an agreement.
The TAD was finally recruited in 2010, albeit financed through reallocation of existing GEF funds.
                                                              250
    two entities recognized the importance of an effective partnership, and gradually improved their
    collaboration throughout implementation. Reluctance with respect to the World Bank’s
    recommendation to revise the PDO, contributed to the delayed restructuring of the project. However,
    thereafter, the government showed strong commitment towards achieving the revised PDO, and to
    sustain the project’s outcomes. This was evident through the government’s commitment to eliminate
    under its own financing after project closing 262 tonnes of obsolete pesticides and associated waste
    that had been identified during disposal activities, and that could not be financed by the project due to
    time constraints.
70. Implementing Agency performance – Rating Satisfactory: Overall, ANGed’s performance was
    satisfactory, with gradual improvement throughout project implementation. Initially, day-to-day
    management of project activities was hampered by the implementing agency’s lack of specialized
    staff. Until mid-term review, the project coordinator was handling most of the project’s administrative
    tasks, including procurement and M&E related tasks; the need for technical support was continuously
    raised. In 2010, the transition associated with the recruitment of a new project coordinator put project
    implementation temporarily on hold; a handover of responsibilities associated with the management
    of the prevention component from ANGed to the Ministry of Agriculture further contributed to
    delays. Particularly during the last two years of project implementation, ANGed demonstrated strong
    commitment towards achieving the PDO. ANGed complied with all World Bank loan covenants, and
    executed its fiduciary duties. Delays were noted in submitting Financial Management Reports and
    implementing World Bank FM recommendations, and the poor collaboration between the financial
    and accounting department in several occasions; however no mis-procurement was noted during
    project implementation. ANGed equally ensured safeguarding requirements.
71. Overall borrower performance – Rating Satisfactory: Based on the above presented evaluation, the
    overall borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

6. LESSONS LEARNED

72. The most significant lessons learned are outlined in Section 6 of the program-level ICR, as the
    experience they are based on was often reflected across all country-specific projects. Lessons learned
    that were particularly relevant to ASP-P1 Tunisia include:
    •   Both, the implementing agency and the World Bank team need to be staffed with adequate
        technical expertise, which is crucial for sound project preparation and implementation of
        projects associated with pesticide disposal. As was evident during implementation, the disposal
        of obsolete pesticides and associated waste required highly specialized technical expertise,
        particularly in preparation of disposal activities (i.e., procuring the specialized services). The
        technical support the project received proved to be crucial for PDO achievement.
    •   The project’s effectiveness and development impact can significantly benefit from correct
        application of safeguard requirements. OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was triggered for a
        storage site in Fathallah, a southern suburb of Tunis that was being used for business purposes by
        occupants. By complying with the policy, the project successfully promoted the participation of
        affected individuals in the planning and implementation of their temporary resettlement. The
        project compensated affected individuals financially for their loss in income during their

                                                    251
              temporary resettlement, and allowed for improved standards of living following the successful
              disposal of obsolete pesticides at the site.
       •      For projects classified as Category A, sufficient time and technical expertise need to be
              allocated for the preparation of required safeguards instruments. In the case of ASP-P1
              Tunisia, the preparation of the CESA involved complex procurement procedures and resulted in
              being a lengthy process. A realistic timeline that plans for the required procedures needs to be in
              place to not delay overall project implementation.

b. Staff time and cost – Staff time and costs associated with project preparation and supervision was not
   possible to determine as a result of poor recording in the system.

8.5 BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS
3. Beneficiary survey results are not available, as no survey was conducted. However, the government is
   planning an independent assessment of outcomes achieved under the prevention component,
   including an impact evaluation.

8.6 STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS
4. A specific completion, and/or ICR mission was not carried out before project closure, and thus no
   stakeholder workshop was held. However, the government is planning to conduct a stakeholder
   workshop in April or May 2014, following closure of the prevention component that is still being
   implemented under FFEM co-funding.

8.7 SUMMARY OF BORROWER’S ICR AND COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR
5. The recipient submitted a completion report; messages contained therein were integrated into this
   document.
6. Comments and edits received on the draft ICR were equally incorporated. Additional comments
   included the view that the World Bank performed better than moderately unsatisfactorily between the
   mid-term review and project closing. The implementing agency referred to the support the PMU had
   received and which had been mobilized by the World Bank. This included additional safeguards
   support, the temporary recruitment of a technical expert to help procuring the disposal contract, the
   eventual recruitment of a TAD, and continuous effective communication with the World Bank
   including fast responses regarding non objection letters.

8.8 COMMENTS OF CO-FINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS
7. Comments on the draft ASP-P1 Tunisia ICR received from FFEM include:
    a. The PDO # 4 indicator refers to the non-ratification of the Rotterdam Convention. Efforts are
       underway towards the ratification but Tunisia does not yet have the mechanisms to apply this
       Convention (particularly regarding its customs).
    b. Revised PDO Indicator #1 on the disposal of obsolete pesticides and associated waste: Due to
       budgetary constraints, Tunisia prioritized the disposal of obsolete pesticides, and adjourned the
       disposal of the associated waste (which were mostly buildings and contaminated soil). Tunisia
       achieved to treat 125% of obsolete pesticides that had originally been inventoried.
8. Comments of co-financiers and other partners/stakeholders on the program-level ICR are summarized
   in Section 8.8 in the program-level ICR.
