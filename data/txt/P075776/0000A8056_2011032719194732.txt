                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Africa Stockpiles Project is currently under-going a restructuring based on advice from the mid-term review of the World Bank.This will allow country projects to move forward
                         independently on disposal and prevention activities, while still allowing for coordination on over-arching issues. Five countries remain with active projects in ASP - Ethiopia, Mali,
                         South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia.

                         of "free standing"stocks and sampling and analysis of 22 identified sites with buried stocks. Tunisia has completed its inventory of obsolete stocks and awarded its contract for
                         disposal. South Africa has completed disposal operations in one state and will restructure its project to take into account private sector stock issue. In Mali, the selection of the
                         disposal company is ongoing and the contract should be signed in April 2011. Prevention activities are also progressing well.
