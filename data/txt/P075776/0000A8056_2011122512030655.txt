                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In June 2011, Ethiopia, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia were successfully restructured. The restructuring focused on updating the project development objectives, project
                         components and closure dates to ensure that the countries could meet the all important objective of disposing and/or safeguarding obsolete pesticide stocks. The Government of
                         Mali has requested Additional Financing from the Global Environment Facility to ensure that the highly contaminated soils in their country can be safely treated or contained. The

                         project will also be restructured in line with the changes made in the other 4 active ASP country projects as a part of this Additional Financing request.

                         Bidding on disposal operations is underway or completed in all countries. In Tunisia, more that 60% of some 1,280 tonnes of inventoried obsolete pesticides have been packaged
                         with over 400 tonnes already shipped to Europe for disposal and more that 120 tonnes already eliminated. South Africa has completed disposal operations in one state and is has
