                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In July 2011, ASP-Ethiopia, ASP-South Africa, ASP-Tanzania and ASP-Tunisia were successfully restructured. The restructuring focused on updating the project development
                         objectives, project components and closing dates to ensure that the projects' objectives and activities were aligned with available project resources given higher than originally
                         budgeted inventories of obsolete pesticides and associated wastes in all said countries. Importantly, the restructuring also formulated project-specific results frameworks to each

                         The remaining ASP projects are expected to close by December 31, 2012 after which an Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) will be prepared and disclosed. In

                         ASP-Tunisia is expected to close on June 30, 2012 after achieving its objective, having disposed of and/or safeguarded its inventoried obsolete pesticides and associated waste
                         stocks and having implemented an elaborated prevention program, ASP-Tanzania and ASP-Ethiopia are expected to close on December 31, 2012 with similar results. ASP-South
                         Africa may be extended until the end of calendar year 2012 to compensate for additional delays with the procurement of a disposal contractor. ASP-Nigeria, which was funded by a
                         CIDA grant without disposal activities, closed on June 30, 2012 after achieving its key objectives. ASP-Morocco also closed on June 30, 2012 after a long period of stagnant
                         progress.

                         The Government of Mali had requested Additional Financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to ensure that the highly contaminated soils and 300 additional tons of
                         obsolete pesticides compared to the amount originally inventoried in Mali could be safely treated or contained. The GEF approved the additional financing and almost all steps have
                         been taken internally in the World Bank to have a combined Additional Financing/Board Level Restructuring approved for submission to Board (PDO, results framework, addition of
                         OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement). Unfortunately, the World Bank Decision Meeting had to be cancelled due to the March 2012 military coup which led to the suspension of
                         operations in accordance with OP/PB 7.30 on Dealing with de facto Government.
