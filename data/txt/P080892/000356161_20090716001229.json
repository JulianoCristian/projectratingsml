the Land Administration\n            Project for West Bank and Gaza are as follows: outcomes of\n            the project were satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: given the importance of land in\n            West Bank and Gaza (WBG), there must be sustained support\n            for the land sector at the highest levels of the Palestinian\n            Authority (PA). Despite the commitment of the PA to the\n            reforms in the land sector, and the commitment of the donors\n            to support this important priority, substantial project\n            resources were not spent. A key lesson from this is that\n            without collective responsibility for implementation of WBG\n            land administration program amongst key agencies, and\n            incentives to instill and sustain that sense of collective\n            responsibility, the PA will be unable to create adequate\n            demand for registration, will be unable to establish a\n            critical mass in a land registry while there is donor\n            support, and loose an important opportunity."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
