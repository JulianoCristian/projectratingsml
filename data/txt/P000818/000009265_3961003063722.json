agricultural productivity and sustained growth of the\n            incomes of small farming families, through the strengthening\n            of support services in agricultural extension and research,\n            training and the promotion of self-reliance and empowerment.\n            The main components of the project are: (i) strengthening\n            sector analysis and planning capacity of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and the Ministry of Natural Resources and the\n            Environment; (ii) consolidating, improving and strengthening\n            agricultural extension services covering crop and livestock\n            production and natural resource management, and expansion of\n            functional literacy programs; (iii) improving and\n            strengthening the agricultural research system and modest\n            support to the Agricultural School of the Gambia College;\n            and (iv) promoting farmer self-reliance and empowerment\n            through pilot activities in one administrative division\n            (McCarthy Island Division - MID) that would test new\n            approaches involving farmer participation and\n            self-management in the areas of: irrigation water\n            management, rural savings and loans, training of rural\n            entrepreneurs, and rural social infrastructure."}, "docdt":
