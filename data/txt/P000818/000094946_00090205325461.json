and sustainability is unlikely. Lessons address primarily\n            the need for an in-depth institutional analysis, prior to\n            the establishment of new institutions, which require a\n            strong implementation assistance by the Bank, through an\n            appropriate skills mix in supervision, particularly when\n            faced with capacity weaknesses within the Government. In\n            addition, it is suggested that project design may be\n            jeopardized by key sector constraints, in the absence of\n            adequate assessment, and, likewise, the preparation of\n            annual work programs, and budgets is critical to guide\n            project implementation. Other administrative issues are also\n            addressed, such as the need to monitor supervision expenses,\n            and incorporate recommendations of the independent auditors\n            in future supervision."}, "docdt": "2000-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
