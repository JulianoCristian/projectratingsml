Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) During the financial crisis, dropout rates are\n            often low in primary school and transition to junior\n            secondary school is the most important attrition point in\n            the system, particularly for the poor; 2) During times of\n            financial crisis, or political change, projects should be\n            designed with a view toward maximum flexibility, and the\n            potential for rapid restructuring as the need arises; 3)\n            Within the framework of decentralization, the central\n            government (MONE) has a role in targeting strategies to\n            address the education needs of the poorest communities if\n            national goals for basic education are to be achieved; 4)\n            School rehabilitation using community participation method\n            costs an average of 25 percent less than the contractor\n            method, with at least similar quality; 5) While schools are\n            generally able to manage the block grant to purchase\n            learning input and materials, more assistance is required to\n            prepare them in organizing training; 6) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation Framework should be agreed during project\n            preparation which includes establishing the baseline data,\n            capacity building for district and province monitoring staff\n            and allocating sufficient resources for monitoring visits to\n            project beneficiaries; 7) School mapping can be useful to\n            education agencies at all levels; 8) The establishment of a\n            strongly staffed, and well managed central project\n            coordination unit (CPCU) must be considered a key\n            contributing factor to the successful implementation of any\n            project with widely disbursed operations; 9) Project\n            personnel from provincial and district agencies should\n            become more familiar with Bank guidelines and documentation\n            requirements; 10) When a project has widely disbursed\n            project sites, local administrators, coordinators and\n            teachers should be more fully briefed regarding the\n            advantages of participating in the project as well as their\n            responsibilities; and 11) Improving learning outcomes is a\n            complex task and it is best planned with the input from\n            local principals and teachers."}, "docdt": "2007-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
