Economic Recovery and\n            Social Sector Loan Project was assessed as satisfactory. Key\n            lessons include: 1) Country knowledge must be maintained\n            even if there is no lending activity. 2) Strong ownership of\n            the reform program by the Government is crucial to its\n            success. 3) The Bank should show flexibility in policy\n            stance in the face of uncertainty and rapidly changing\n            situation. 4) Fiscal flexibility requires increased\n            coordination between Ministry of Finance and line agencies\n            in order to implement the public sector programs. 5)\n            Appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, measures to\n            recapitalize the banking system, strengthening banking\n            supervision, and corporate debt restructuring have played a\n            key role in stemming capital outflows and returning\n            stability to the Malaysian economy. 6) The crisis in\n            Malaysia has brought out strongly the need to account for\n            contingent liabilities arising out of Government guarantees.\n            7) Some form of temporary regulatory easing may be\n            appropriate during crisis times if it can be clearly\n            demonstrated that these regulations are preventing banks\n            from focusing on their key business. 8) Some open economies\n            like Malaysia are vulnerable to boom and bust cycles and\n            therefore need mechanisms to manage them effectively. 9)\n            Economies like Malaysia need to develop a social sector\n            strategy to manage the risks arising from globalization,\n            especially mechanisms to reach the urban poor."}, "docdt": "1999-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
