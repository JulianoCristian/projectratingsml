downturn of economic activity; b) implement\n            policy reforms to resume robust and sustainable growth; c)\n            expand safety nets to protect the hard core and the near\n            poor from the adverse effects of the regional crisis; and d)\n            protect investments in the human resources base. The loan\n            will be disbursed in a single tranche of $300 million upon\n            Board approval and effectiveness. The Government's will\n            implement a series of structural reforms which are focused\n            on four key areas: 1) Maintaining sound macroeconomic policy\n            with flexibility in the light of uncertainties in the\n            economic environment. 2) Strengthening the financial sector\n            in the light of the regional crisis including consolidation\n            of finance companies and pre-emptive recapitalization of\n            viable banking institutions. 3) Improving competitiveness by\n            strengthening corporate governance, enhancing transparency\n            and disclosure of information. 4) Strengthening social\n            safety nets to soften the negative impact of the economic\n            crisis on the lower income and vulnerable groups. A key risk\n            to the program is if the downturn in economic activity turns\n            out to be greater than currently expected."}, "docdt": "1998-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
