Recipient                   Republic of Armenia
Implementing Agency         Ministry of Finance
Financing Data              IDA Credit of SDR 13.40 million (US$21 million equivalent) and IBRD Loan
                            of US$4 million.
                            IDA Terms: 20-year maturity including a 10-year grace period.
                            IBRD Terms: Flexible loan with interest equal to 6 months LIBOR plus
                            variable spread; 25-year maturity including a 10-year grace period.
Operation Type              Second Development Policy Operation (DPO-2)
Main Policy Areas           The DPO supports the Government's two strategic objectives: (i) addressing
                            vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital
                            development; and (ii) strengthening competitiveness for sustained post-crisis
                            growth by providing a more favorable private sector environment and
                            strengthening governance. To protect the poor, the operation supports spending
                            levels of pro-poor and social protection programs and strengthening the
                            management of education and health. To strengthen competitiveness for
                            recovery and post-crisis growth, the operation focuses on improving the
                            business climate for SMEs, modernizing the regulatory framework for mining
                            and telecommunications, reducing compliance cost for tax and customs
                            administration, and enhancing the enforcement powers of the State
                            Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition.
Key Outcome Indicators      The key outcome indicators (detailed in Annex 6 and the policy matrix)
                            include indicators to monitor: protection of the poor and vulnerable during the
                            crisis; strengthened management and financing systems in health and
                            education; lower costs of doing business; improved governance and the
                            investment environment for mining and telecom sectors; enhanced
                            competitiveness of Armenian firms; and eased compliance with tax and
                            customs administration.
Program Development         The program development objective (PDO) for the series is to address
Objective(s) and            vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater human capital
Contribution to CPS         development, while improving competitiveness by alleviating a selected set of
                            private sector and governance constraints.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The proposed operation is subject to several external and internal risks:
                            i) The underlying macroeconomic framework is vulnerable to global
                                developments. Slow global economic recovery or volatility in commodity
                                prices and remittances will result in a slow pace of recovery and medium-
                                term growth, making it more difficult to carry out expected fiscal and
                                external adjustments, which in turn would further increase the debt-to-
                                GDP ratio. High dollarization of deposits in the banking sector and
                                unhedged corporate exposure to foreign exchange borrowings also pose
                                potential currency risks;
                            ii) Commitment to continue implementing the program may falter if
                                opposition to key measures gains strong political support. The program's
                                outcomes may also be undermined if the key pieces of legislation that are
                                being submitted to Parliament are not approved or are changed
                                substantially during Parliamentary discussions; and
                                                  vi
               iii) Reform efforts could be compromised by weak implementation capacity
                  (particularly at mid-levels of the civil service), or if the legislative and
                  regulatory changes are not followed up by proper institutional building in
                  the implementing agencies.

               To manage risks to the macroeconomic framework, the Government is
               working with the Bank and the IMF to further analyze the country's
               vulnerability to external shocks. Corrective measures are expected to be
               identified and implemented if the global economic recovery is slower than
               anticipated. To enhance risk management in the banking system, the CBA has
               taken a number of measures, including issuing regulations in March and June
               2010 imposing higher risk weights (by 50 percent) in capital requirements for
               foreign exchange loans, and requiring increased loan-loss provisioning for
               foreign exchange loans. They have also required banks to further improve
               their crisis management framework and are closely monitoring NPLs and are
               ready to take further measures if required. The CBA also submitted a request
               for a full FSAP to the IMF and the World Bank.

               To mitigate the risk of vested interests undermining program implementation,
               and to secure passage of key program-supported legislation through
               Parliament, the authorities have increased outreach efforts to broaden the
               political support for the reforms, particularly among beneficiaries (i.e., the
               poor and the middle class). The Bank is actively supporting the authorities in
               these outreach efforts. The authorities are also engaging Parliamentary
               commissions responsible for key pieces of legislation (mining code,
               competition law, and conflict of interest chapter in the public service law), as
               well as interested parties in CSOs.

               The Government has mobilized Project Preparation Advance resources to
               support line ministries and agencies' reform efforts, and has set up a steering
               committee for the DPO program chaired by the Minister of Finance. The Bank
               (including IFC advisory services) has complemented these efforts by
               selectively providing technical assistance in key areas, such as social
               protection, public financial management (including revenue administration),
               and mining taxation; furthermore, several Bank investment projects or donor-
               supported programs are expected to continue in providing institution-building
               in key policy areas covered by the DPO.

                INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
        INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                        PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
             PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION
                       TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

                                        I.      INTRODUCTION

1.       This second Development Policy Operation (DPO-2), in the amount of US$25 million, is part of
a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Armenia. The DPO series is central to the
Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-13 for Armenia and contributes to the Government's
strategic developmental objectives and medium-term reforms described in its Sustainable Development
Program and supplemented by its Medium Term Expenditure Framework, 2011-13 (MTEF).

2.      Armenia was among the worst affected by the global crisis, notwithstanding its strong pre-crisis
performance on growth and poverty reduction. As exports, remittances and foreign direct investment
(FDI) fell, GDP contracted by more than 14 percent in 2009 due mainly to a precipitous decline in the
booming construction sector. Nearly 40 percent of households suffered from losses of wages, farm income
and remittances; incidence of poverty rose from 23.5 to 26.5 percent of the population after more than a
decade of continuing decline. The crisis impact also revealed the urgency of improving competitiveness,
especially in the tradable sectors, given that construction is unlikely to be the major growth driver as it has
been in recent years.

3.       The DPO series, initiated in 2009, supports Government efforts to address vulnerabilities
resulting from the crisis and strengthen competitiveness for post-crisis growth. In addressing
vulnerability, the DPO program protects the poor and sustains human capital development by safeguarding
social safety net spending and its effectiveness, as well as by continuing reforms in education and health. In
strengthening competitiveness, the DPO program alleviates private sector and governance constraints through
various measures to improve the business environment and to enhance efficiency and accountability in public
financial management.

4.       The first DPO focused more on addressing vulnerabilities with a view to protecting the poor
even as it laid the ground for strengthening competitiveness. To protect the poor, DPO-1 supported
increased funding for social safety net programs like family benefits, pensions and unemployment insurance,
restoration of funding for selected priority programs for the poor in health, education and agriculture as well
as completion of a review to remove ineligible households and improve targeting. The reform of education
and health, begun earlier, were continued. To enhance competitiveness, actions were taken to ease business
registration, provide liquidity and enhanced surveillance for banks and enact a Public Service Law.

5.      The proposed second DPO focuses more on measures to improve conditions for post-crisis
growth and recovery, even as it seeks to maintain social safety net spending. To strengthen
competitiveness, DPO-2 actions seek to improve the legislative framework and institutional capacity for
reducing anti-competitive behavior, continue reforms for facilitating business registration and operation,
submit a new mining code to Parliament for encouraging more mining investment, further modernize key
aspects of telecommunications in relation to the management of the spectrum, make progress towards
lowering firms' costs of tax and customs compliance and continue reform programs in education and health to
ensure better outcomes.

6.      The third DPO expects to continue the focus on post-crisis competitiveness and growth by
building on measures under earlier DPOs. DPO-3 actions will strengthen competitiveness further by
improving the environment for businesses in general and for mining and telecom sectors in particular.
Specific actions will include amending the Law on Inspections to reduce discretion and increase transparency,
establishing a one-stop shop for businesses, strengthening capacity for reducing anti-competitive behavior and
issuing regulations to implement the new Mining Law in a way that enhances its favorable impact.

7.      Implementation of the second and third DPOs is being carried out amidst significant fiscal
consolidation. In 2009, the fiscal deficit rose to 7.8 percent of GDP as the Government used stimulus to
shore up aggregate demand in the face of contracting private demand. During 2009 - 2012 Armenia plans to
reduce its fiscal deficit by 5 percentage points of GDP, with most of the adjustment taking place in 2010.
This adjustment is based on increases in revenue resulting from recently adopted administrative measures, as
well as from reduced public spending. Though Armenia entered the crisis with low public debt, hovering
around 17 percent of GDP, this ratio has risen to more than 40 percent in 2009 and is projected to rise to 50
percent in 2012 even with the above fiscal consolidation. Debt levels are projected to fall in subsequent
years.

                                     II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

8.      Armenia has been pursuing structural reforms for more than a decade. The reforms centered on
basic transition-related measures (i.e., price liberalization, land privatization and titling, enterprise
privatization, trade and investment liberalization) but they also introduced a sound regulatory framework for
the banking system and for a number of infrastructure sectors, including water and energy. There were also
reforms to improve the efficiency and quality of social services, and to attract FDI into services, including
tourism and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

9.       Armenia's income increased significantly over the past decade. After a severe recession in the
first half of the 1990s, the economy recovered gradually. Economic growth averaged 11 percent per year
between 2000 and 2008, driven by an increased inflow of remittances, diaspora-related tourism, foreign
investments, aid, and high international prices for mining products (especially copper and molybdenum).
Growth during this period was aided by the transition-related catch-up, a highly favorable external
environment, and Government's reform efforts. Per capita GDP at market exchange rates increased from
US$620 to US$3,700 during this period, which, together with improved safety nets, led to a sharp reduction
in poverty incidence from over 50 percent of the population in 1999 to about 23.5 percent in 2008 (Figure 1).

10.      However, export growth slowed after 2003 with GDP growth driven mainly by construction and
services sectors. Up to 2003, exports (Figure 2) drove most of the growth, including those from
manufacturing (e.g., textiles, diamond-cutting) and mining sectors, but subsequently exports stagnated due in
part to continuing real appreciation of the exchange rate and insufficient improvements in the business climate
to compensate for such appreciation. Construction and services continued to drive growth, fuelled mainly by
large inflows of remittances, and FDI (including from Armenian diaspora). As a result, the construction
sector grew at an average annual rate of 25 percent during 2000-2008 to reach a 30 percent share of the
economy.

11.       Armenia's closed borders in the east and west make exporting difficult though Georgia's
increasing openness and links with Russia have eased the situation. Open borders between Armenia and
Turkey would no doubt help to ease transport and transit links and reduce trading costs further; however, the
prospects for this remains uncertain. As a result, the country depends almost exclusively on the north corridor
to the Black Sea provided by Georgia and on relatively frequent air links with Europe and Russia. The
reliability of transit for Armenian goods has increased over time arising from Georgia's modernization of its
customs posts, police, roads, railways and ports. Also, businesses from Russia have invested in key
infrastructure and commercial sectors and helped in this regard. Nevertheless, export performance during the
first half of this decade suggests that higher export growth is possible in the future notwithstanding the
constraint of closed borders.

12.      Armenia's diaspora and migrant population help to ease external constraints. They continue to
play an important role in the country's growth through remittances, FDI and tourism. Total remittances
during 2007-09 were equivalent to 70 percent of the country's exports and 150 percent of FDI. Also, the
diaspora funded public works and invested in the country's infrastructure (e.g., airport), banking sector, ICT,
and, to a lesser extent, agriculture.

                       A.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN ARMENIA

13.      The global crisis brought Armenia's construction and services boom to a halt. The impact of
this crisis was transmitted mainly through reduced exports, lower remittances and a decline in FDI. As a
result, GDP fell by more than 14 percent in 2009. Services stagnated and construction fell by nearly 50
percent; on the tradables side, agriculture barely grew while manufacturing contracted by nearly 9 percent.

14.     The Government responded to the crisis with a counter-cyclical fiscal policy and by floating the
exchange rate. Armenia entered the crisis with low public debt as a result of years of prudent fiscal
management. This permitted the Government to borrow to finance a larger fiscal deficit and increase nominal
public spending, including spending on social protection programs and on infrastructure projects that
supported employment. This helped to minimize the adverse impact on the poor. In addition, the
Government returned to a floating exchange rate regime to provide more flexibility and strengthened financial
sector surveillance and liquidity support to maintain confidence.

15.      The financial sector withstood the crisis relatively well. The banking sector in Armenia has been
well regulated and had low external indebtedness, low exposure to the booming construction sector and
relatively high capital-to-asset ratio (CAR of 28 percent) before the crisis. Banks were also profitable prior to
the crisis, with a return on assets of 2.9 percent in 2007. The sector thus endured the crisis well, despite a
rapid increase in non-performing loans (above 90 days overdue) from 3.4 percent to 6.6 percent between 2007
and June 2010. More recently, dollarization of both deposits and loans increased sharply, reflecting in part
the risk perceptions about the post-crisis growth environment in Armenia. In particular, the share of foreign
exchange deposits in total deposits increased from a low of 40 percent in February 2008 to a peak of 77
percent in March 2010.

16.      The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) is monitoring NPLs and taking measures to further
strengthen banks' risk management, contingency planning and crisis management. While the banking
system in Armenia has witnessed a modest recovery during the first semester of this year, it remains exposed
to significant credit risk due to high NPLs and dollarization. The CBA has taken measures in 2010 to limit

                                                       3
vulnerabilities and enhance risk management in the banking system, including regulations imposing 50
percent higher capital requirements for foreign exchange loans (June, 2010) as well as regulations increasing
loan-loss provisioning for foreign exchange loans. The CBA is also helping the banks to improve their crisis
preparedness and contingency planning and has requested the IMF and the Bank to carry out a full-fledged
FSAP in 2011.

17.     The crisis highlights the fact that many of the pre-crisis drivers of growth are unlikely to
return. Remittances are unlikely to grow by double digits and the booming construction sector is likely to
remain depressed for years due to excess inventory. The world economy is expected to grow more slowly
than in the past. The reforms supported by the DPO are designed to encourage other sources of growth by
easing entry of new businesses, promoting fairer competition, reducing compliance costs in tax and customs
and improving incentives for investors in the mining and telecommunication sectors.

18.     The economy started to recover this year at a slow pace. During the first three quarters of this
year growth has been 2.8 percent largely due to the revival of mining (due to commodity prices), tourism and
to some extent, remittances. Agriculture fell by over 17 percent, affected adversely by weather, and
construction stagnated. On the external front the current account balance improved after a dramatic
deterioration in 2009, as remittances and other private inflows to Armenia increased with the recovery in the
Russian economy.

19.     The Government is targeting a reduction in fiscal deficit of 5 percentage points of GDP by 2012.
Early indications are that tax revenues are growing as a result of economic recovery and new administrative
measures. Tax revenues are projected to grow more than public spending and the fiscal deficit is projected to
fall from 7.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010. The need to restrain total public
spending in the face of rising interest payments has led to a vigorous search for improvements in efficiency
and quality of public spending and the Bank's ongoing programmatic fiscal work is contributing to that effort.
Despite these efforts, it is proving difficult for the Government to do much more than protect benefits for the
poor.

20.     The IMF moved from an SBA to a more concessional and longer term financing program which
will ease the short term debt service pressure. The 28-month Stand-By Arrangement for SDR 534 million
(580 percent of quota) approved by the IMF Executive Board in 2009 provided the Government the necessary
headroom to cope with the crisis. On June 28, 2010 the IMF Executive Board converted the
undisbursed balance of SDR 266.40 (US$395 million) into a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and an
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) on a fifty-fifty basis for the EFF and the ECF, respectively. This move both
lengthens maturities and reduces the charges of the Program and, hence, contributes significantly to ease debt
management.

                  B.       MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

21.      The outlook for the medium term depends on several external factors. While the external
outlook has improved relative to 2009, global and regional growth rates are not expected to return to their pre-
crisis levels for some time. This means that recovery and growth of remittances and credit remain uncertain,
as do international prices of metals all of which are important factors for Armenia's recovery.

22.      Armenia is projected to grow at around 4 percent annually over the medium term. Remittances
are projected to grow little, though they will remain important for domestic private demand. The construction
sector, which was nearly 30 percent of GDP in 2008, is unlikely to grow in the near term as it goes through a
major correction. The tradable sector will recover from the slump of 2009, but its sustained growth depends
critically on the private investment response to reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and incentives.
Mining and telecom will likely benefit from such investment earlier than manufacturing, as has been the case
in many emerging economies. Finally, the ongoing fiscal consolidation over the next three years could
dampen growth rates (Table 2).

23.     The reforms supported by the DPO series, when combined with increased access to markets,
are expected to create strong incentives for private investment in tradables. The reforms will not only
improve the overall business environment, but also make investments in mining and telecom easier and more
profitable. Similarly, continued progress in the Government's discussions with the European Union on the
deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA) will signal better future access to EU markets. This
combination of better investment climate at home and of potentially better market access abroad augurs well
for Armenia, and underpins our projections.

24.     To further consolidate growth prospects, the Government is keen to expand exports and is
developing an Export Promotion Strategy, building on the reforms supported by the DPO. This
strategy is expected to focus on: (i) growth in the volume and access to new markets for traditional Armenian
exports, for example, metals, processed diamonds, and alcoholic beverages accounting for 80 percent of
exports (ii) growth in tourism and ICT that currently dominate exports of services; and (iii) exports of new
products to existing or new markets.

25.      Given the countercyclical fiscal stance, the debt outlook has deteriorated. The public debt-to-
GDP level reached 41 percent in 2009 and is expected to reach 44 percent in 2010, largely driven by the fiscal
deficit. Given the initial low level of debt, this approach was warranted. But rising debt levels now demand
skillful debt management, and improved medium-term expenditure planning, including the introduction of a
sound public investment appraisal system.

26.       With continued recovery, and in the absence of major shocks, the public debt­to-GDP ratio is
projected to peak at around 50 percent in 2011 and decrease to 22 percent by 2030. Given that a part of
this debt is on concessional terms, its net present value is projected to peak at 40 percent by 2011 and then
decrease to 19 percent by 2030 (Figure 3). Assumptions for the baseline scenario are conservative, with real
growth projected to be 4 percent for 2010 and 4.6 percent for 2011 after which it will return to about 4
percent per year during 2012­15 and beyond (below the 10-year historical average of 8.7 percent). The RER
depreciation/appreciation is projected to range between ± 3 percent and the financing gap is expected to be
filled at historical average terms. Under the baseline assumptions, the debt service to revenue burden rises to
23 percent in 2013, due to bunching of repayments, but returns to manageable levels thereafter (Figure 4).
Smoothing the repayment spike is a key challenge for debt management.

27.      The debt situation is vulnerable to domestic and external shocks. Alternative scenarios and
bound tests indicate that Armenia's public debt would be most affected by a lasting shock to economic
growth. If medium term growth were around 2 percent rather than 4 percent, the debt to GDP ratio would
peak at 55 percent in 2015 and gravitate upwards thereafter. Also, a 30 percent real depreciation in 2011
would push the net present value of debt to 54 percent in 2011 before slowly moving back to 25 percent by
2030. This adverse scenario also worsens the liquidity situation with the debt service to revenue ratio
climbing to 33 percent in 2013 from 11 percent in 2010. These results reinforce the importance of prudent
fiscal policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability over the medium term.

28.      The Ministry of Finance is working with the World Bank and the IMF to further analyze
vulnerability to shocks and will adjust its debt management policy when required. The debt
management policy takes into account a likely transition to a less concessional debt structure. It also focuses
on first stabilizing debt levels then reducing them over the medium-term mainly via fiscal adjustment. The
strategy also envisages an improved selection process for public investments so that growth impacts are
maximized. Alternative scenarios to smooth out the debt service peak in 2013 are also being worked out, a
process already supported by the increase in concessionality of IMF resources.

29.      The Government's macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for this operation. Starting
from a strong position going into the crisis, the Government took appropriate and timely policy actions to
adjust to the global crisis. Following the rise in fiscal deficit and debt in 2009, the Government adopted a
program of substantial fiscal consolidation for 2010-12, and is reviewing its longer term debt management
strategy. More broadly the Government continues to focus on protecting the poor and strengthening
competitiveness for growth, both key for fiscal adjustment.

30.     As a result of the crisis, Armenia experienced the most severe economic contraction since the
early years of transition. The slowdown in growth, remittances, and domestic and foreign investment led to
job and income losses. According to the 2009 Armenia Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS), about
40 percent of Armenian households suffered from the direct impact of the crisis through loss of labor income,
remittances, or income from farm activities. Household expenditures on consumption goods declined by
about 10 percent between 2008 and 2009 with even more dramatic declines in healthcare expenditures (20
percent), transportation expenditures (21 percent), and in the purchase of durable goods (23 percent).

31.     The crisis disrupted the poverty reduction momentum that Armenians enjoyed for nearly a
decade. Between 1999 and 2008 poverty incidence declined from 56 percent to 23.5 percent, lifting over one
million Armenians out of poverty. However, the global economic downturn reversed this trend. The
incidence of poverty increased in 2009 by an estimated three percentage points (Figure 5), driven mainly by a
decline in growth and in remittances.

32.     The increase in poverty was substantially lower than what would have occurred in the absence
of public policy measures. The authorities made a concerted effort to lessen the impact of the crisis on the
poor and the vulnerable and to protect the gains Armenia made during the last decade in reducing poverty.
Government efforts to maintain public spending on social protection and to improve targeting of safety net
programs--both supported by the DPO--were the main factors that helped Armenia avoid worse outcomes
(Figure 6). Armenia was able to reduce the poverty impact of the crisis from a projected near seven-
percentage-point increase in overall poverty rates to just three percentage points.

33.     Armenia's social protection programs reached about 59 percent of all households in 2009, with
at least one member receiving one of the benefits--the Family Benefits (FB), pensions, or other cash
transfer programs. The coverage of the poor by all social programs was also high at 79 percent. Overall,
Armenia spent about 6.8 percent of its GDP on all social protection programs in 2009. It spent about 1.9
percent of GDP on social assistance programs, including the FB (Armenia's signature social safety net
program), public works, unemployment benefits, and social care. Armenia's spending on social assistance as
a share of GDP is slightly greater than the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) average of 1.7 percent, but less
than the 2.5 percent average for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries. The FB accounted for about 60 percent of total spending on social assistance programs. As a share

                                                                      8
of GDP and overall public expenditures, spending on pro-poor social protection programs increased during
the crisis. For example, spending on FB grew from 0.8 percent to one percent of GDP between 2008 and
2009.

34.      In response to the economic crisis, Armenian households employed several coping strategies,
including some which are potentially harmful in the long run. The main coping mechanisms were
reduced food consumption, less spending on healthcare, increased use of public transportation and less
spending on entertainment. Over 40 percent of affected households report cutting back on food consumption,
which has implications for nutritional adequacy for adults and children. Cuts in health spending in response
to the crisis have been large. While all income groups had to adjust their budgets, the crisis was more
challenging for the poor and the vulnerable. Over 50 percent of the poorest quintile reported consuming
poorer-quality food, reduced visits to health centers, and reduced purchases of medicines. While the crisis
did not lead to a noticeable decline in school attendance, the overall reductions in Government and household
budgets for education are likely to worsen education quality and learning outcomes.

     III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

                                    A.        GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

35.      The DPO series supports policies and strategies developed under the "Sustainable Development
Program" (SDP) approved by the Government in October 2008. The SDP has four goals covering the
period 2009­21 (with specific medium term targets set for the period 2009­15): (a) economic growth and
diversification aimed at deepening competition and fostering private sector development; (b) improve civil
servants' performance through better incentives and stronger management of conflict of interest issues while
strengthening core systems in the judiciary, public financial management, and e-government; (c) human
development through improved management and financing in health and education, as well as strengthened
social protection programs; and (d) better infrastructure services through higher public investment and
strengthened regulation of service providers.

36.      The DPO program is central to the implementation of the SDP. The DPO (see Section V below
and Annex 1) is considered essential to attract new investment and strengthen post-crisis recovery. The
authorities also requested the Bank to track, as part of the DPO-2 program, a set of complementary
benchmarks that are also part of the overall SDP. Some of the benchmarks are for DPO-3 Triggers while
others are actions that complement the Program. These benchmarks are summarized in Annex 2.

37.      As the authorities resumed the preparation of the MTEF in spring-2010, they made an effort to
ensure consistency with the DPO-2 program. The MTEF was suspended in 2009 as the authorities focused
on crisis management. The 2011-13 MTEF was shared with the Bank early on given the close collaboration
with the MTEF Working Group under the Bank's ongoing programmatic fiscal work. In this context, the
authorities discussed and proposed updates or changes in the actions supported by the DPO program aimed at
complementing (or further prioritizing) the SDP priorities already reflected in the program.

                                         B.      CONSULTATIONS

38.     The DPO program was jointly presented by the Government and the Bank to civil society
organizations that are members of the SDP Working Group in November 2009. The meeting was
chaired by the Deputy Minister of Economy and attended by about fifteen CSO members. CSO
representatives commended the Government for its continued reform efforts during the crisis and appreciated
the Bank's support to the program. The Bank's management and the DPO team conducted frequent direct
consultations with CSOs. In addition, the Government published all policy initiatives related to the DPO
program on its website and provided interviews with the media and the civil society when appropriate.

                                                     9
39.   More recently, focused communications efforts were made for specific policy measures.
Workshops were held on specific topics related to the program, including inter-alia, the public financial
management strategy, higher education finance, education quality assurance, and the Mining Code.

40.     In October of this year, the Ministry of Energy initiated consultations with a coalition of CSOs
on the proposed new Mining Code. These consultations built on the results of a workshop on the
environmental aspects of mining that had been previously organized by the Ministry of Environment. The
CSOs made the following useful comments: there is a regulatory vacuum since Armenia does not have an
Environmental Impact Assessment Law; there is need to incorporate into the Mining Code the monitoring
plans (in addition to an EIA at the time of licensing); and forestry and reserve areas regulations need
improvements to adequately safeguard natural forests and biodiversity rich areas, from the adverse impact of
mining. Many of these suggestions were incorporated either in the draft Law or in the Government's broader
program for legislation and regulations that will need to be enacted once the draft Code is approved.

41.     Communication has been proactive on the implications of fiscal consolidation. The budget
process in Armenia is transparent, with the media and the population at large able to review online monthly
revenue collections (aggregate and for the 1000 largest tax-payers) and spending. This helped manage
expectations for the budget last year, when resource shortfalls required tight control over new commitments.
During the preparation of the 2010 budget, cautious assumptions about growth and revenue levels were
discussed with parliament and the public at large, resulting in moderate expectations of spending increases for
this year. The same strategy was used during the preparation of the 2011 budget, which was submitted to the
National Assembly in early September.

                IV.        BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                      A.     LINKAGES TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

42.     The Bank's 2009 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the proposed DPO support the
Government's two strategic objectives of addressing vulnerability and strengthening competitiveness in
preparations for post-crisis growth. The CPS is strongly endorsed by the client. Both the Government and
the Bank recognize that the challenges to the country's development strategy posed by the uncertainties over
the duration of the global economic crisis, it will be essential to maintain flexibility in the design, timing, and
sequencing of interventions.

43.      The DPO series is a key instrument of Bank support under the CPS. A good deal of technical
work and policy dialogue focuses on the DPO prior actions and trigger areas. This work and dialogue cover
macroeconomic and fiscal stability, tax administration reform, improved social safety nets, increased
utilization of health and education services, especially for the poor and vulnerable, a strengthened public
financial management strategy, more credible conflict of interest management, enhanced regulatory regimes
for infrastructure, including telecommunications and public-private partnerships, and a more favorable
climate for the private sector, including mining. The CPS indicates that development policy lending
(comprising nearly 20 percent of new lending) will remain the core instrument in support of the SDP.

                B.         RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS

44.     The DPO program supports other Bank operations and at the same time is reinforced by them.
For example, for health, education, energy, e-society, public financial management, tax administration,
conflict of interest and wage policies, ongoing or planned investment projects provide continuity in the
reform dialogue and the needed institution building to ensure full impact of policy reforms. At the same time,


                                                        10
the DPO provides a framework for the authorities to monitor and move forward policy actions in areas where
there is public investment.

45.    In addition, the IFC advisory group supports areas of the DPO related to the business
environment. In particular, IFC Advisory Services provides implementation support to the Ministry of
Economy on the amendments to the Inspections Law on risk-based inspections in the three pilots supported
by the DPO2 (i.e. Fire Department, Standards and Food Safety), and on Tax Administration through the
ongoing Cost Compliance Survey.

46.     The design of the DPO program was based on wide-ranging economic and sector work done
jointly by the Bank and the Government. The DPO-1 program document reviewed the analytical
underpinnings of the series. The DPO also draws on the ongoing analytical work on poverty, on the results of
the Doing Business and BEEPS surveys and on the ongoing programmatic fiscal and PER work. In addition,
an Institutional and Governance Review analyzes competition issues as well as issues of state capture.
Finally, a South Caucasus regional trade program provides an analysis of the demand and supply side
constraints to export growth aimed at facilitating the authorities' ongoing discussions on a possible DCFTA
with the European Union.

                   C.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

47.     Armenia has an active relationship with the IMF. An IMF Stand-by Arrangement was approved
in March 2009 for SDR 544 million (of which only SDR 350 million were withdrawn). The IMF replaced the
Stand-by with an Extended Fund and Credit Facility in June 2010. The preparation of the DPO has been
coordinated closely with the IMF, including frequent consultations between the Bank and Fund teams. The
consultations have focused on the scope of the required fiscal adjustment, the financial sector policies, the
poverty impact of the crisis, and PFM reforms, including tax administration.

48.      The EU is rapidly expanding its program in Armenia to support the implementation of the
Eastern Neighborhood Partnership (ENP) Action Plan and preparations for a DCFTA. The feasibility
studies on the DCFTA were completed and in February 2009 the EU prepared a detailed matrix for the
Government highlighting the areas that need progress before the initiation of DCFTA negotiations. The EU
has placed over a dozen resident advisors in Yerevan to provide technical assistance (TA) on a wide range of
issues including customs and debt management.

49.      The Bank has been collaborating with other partners in a number of areas. The Bank
collaborates with ADB on the overall policy framework and infrastructure, with GTZ on the SDP and
program budgeting, and with USAID on tax administration reform. The Russian Government is providing
anti-crisis financial support to Armenia.

                                       D.      LESSONS LEARNED

50.    Between 2004 and 2007, the Government, with assistance from the World Bank, designed four
annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) to support reforms specifically directed at fighting
poverty. Based on the ICR for the PRSCs series, key lessons learned include:

    a. To ensure ownership, policy-based lending needs to be anchored in the Government's reform
       program. The reforms were successful largely because the PRSCs were rooted in the Government's
       poverty reduction strategy which was prepared with wide societal consultation and participation.

    b. Given the crisis, policy-based lending should retain flexibility. The PRSC series adopted a
       flexible approach that allowed for adoption of new measures identified as priorities in new analytical

                                                     11
        work. Likewise, the DPO series uses a flexible approach in a crisis context to modify actions if
        necessary to achieve goals or when exogenous factors require changes.

    c. The DPO program should reinforce intra-governmental coordination. The PRSC series helped
       further cooperation and thus increased the Government's capacity to implement reforms, and the
       DPO series should do the same. The Government established a Steering Committee, chaired by the
       Minister of Finance, to manage and monitor DPO reform measures.

51.      The implementation of the DPO-2, builds on initial lessons from DPO-1. In particular, the
Government requested a Project Preparation Advance (for about half a million US dollars) to secure needed
technical inputs for its policy program. With the advance it mobilized an excellent cadre of domestic and
international professionals to support policy developments under the leadership of each responsible
governmental agency. The Government and the World Bank also considered it essential to create a Steering
Committee focusing on the DPO, which is chaired by the Minister of Finance, and meets regularly to take
stock of the overall implementation of the program and the TA inputs. In addition, the Government team
continues to involve high level policy makers, to ensure that they provide guidance to the line ministries on
the strategic directions. For instance, the team preparing the draft mining code benefitted from several rounds
of discussions and brainstorming chaired by the Prime Minister.

52.     The measures included in the DPO series have also taken into account good practice lessons
(Box 1).

                                Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
This operation is based both on the Government's crisis response package and the Sustainable Development Program
(SDP) developed in 2008. The SDP was prepared with wide consultation, including parliamentary involvement. The track
record in the previous PRSC series (2004-07) is one of strong ownership and adherence to the PRSP. The MTEF and the
annual budget were derived from PRSP objectives and guidelines. The Authorities set policy choices with inputs from
public and civic institutions. Analytic work supported by the Bank feeds into policy analysis and debate (notably
economic reports, poverty assessments, tailored studies on governance, infrastructure reforms and sector reforms, as well
as comments on the annual MTEF, annual budgets and the SDP itself).

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
The policy matrix is the central accountability tool in conjunction with the Letter of Development Policy. The
environment is results oriented and progress is tracked using agreed monitoring indicators.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
Bilateral aid is provided for investment projects. Through dialogue with the Government and with donors, such aid is
designed to be complementary and tailored to country needs. TA from bilaterals and other IFIs is also well coordinated.
Policies reflect Government ownership in sensitive areas such as governance, as detailed in presidential speeches and
Government statements.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
All triggers in programmatic development policy lending take the form of agreed prior actions to reflect SDP priorities and
the Bank's CPS objectives. DPO-1 and DPO-2 are limited to ten triggers each.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
Reviews focus on actions and on their contribution to results within the accountability matrix and the draft CPS-supported
results framework. Performance reviews will be held quarterly, support will be provided within the annual budget cycle
and built into the budget financing estimate, and the level of Bank support are made known well in advance.



                                                           12
                             V.      THE PROPOSED ARMENIA DPO-2

53.      The proposed operation is the second in a programmatic series of three DPOs. The DPO
rationale and approach are still valid. The rationale of the DPO series is to strike the appropriate balance
between crisis management and structural reform, with DPO-2 supporting the transition between these two
stances.

54.      The first DPO, initiated in 2009, focused on addressing vulnerability and strengthening
competitiveness. To protect the poor in face of the global crisis the DPO-1 supported increased funding for
social safety net programs like family benefits, pensions and unemployment insurance; restoration of funding
for selected priority programs for the poor in health, education and agriculture; and completion of a review to
remove ineligible households from the Family Benefit Program and improve its targeting. The reforms of
education and health were continued. To enhance competitiveness, actions were also taken to ease the
process of business registration, provide liquidity and enhance surveillance for banks and enact a Public
Service Law.

55.      DPO-2 continues the reform through ten prior actions in addition to the prerequisite of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework. This is the same design envisaged at the time of DPO-1. Table 3
lists the prior actions supported by DPO-2. Annex 1 provides the Matrix of Policy Actions and Expected
Outcomes, while Annex 2 summarizes the set of complementary actions that the Authorities have asked the
Program to also monitor for DPO-2 and DPO-3 (i.e., Benchmarks).

56.      The policy matrix presented in this document updates the program presented in DPO-1. As a
result a few of the prior actions for DPO-2 and DPO-3 have been modified. For instance, the prior action on
preschool education was reformulated to ensure increased access to the one-year school readiness program for
children 4.5-5.5 years old through development of a financing mechanism to fund recurrent costs of the
program as part of per capita financing (capital spending is also covered from the state budget). Also, the
prior action on Tax Administration was revised to provide for several additional actions identified as essential
for full achievement of targets under DPO-3. Moreover, the envisaged Data Center (expected by DPO-3)
proved to be too costly in the current fiscal environment and the authorities decided to implement it later.
Finally, the prior action on the introduction of a Green Channel in the customs administration was re-written
to ensure that all key legal preconditions were put in place for its full operation (including legislation and
software). On this, the full introduction of the Green Channel proved to be too ambitious due to delays in
procuring the required software and had to be postponed for DPO-3. Changes to prior actions are
documented in Annex 3, while the corresponding updates to DPO-3 Triggers are documented in Annex 4.

57.      The Government has completed all prior actions for DPO-2. In fact in some areas Government
reforms exceeded requirements of the prior actions. For instance, the degree of harmonization of the mining
code with international best practice exceeded expectations, particularly in licensing, the environment, social
sphere and fiscal regimes. Given the multiple topics covered by the draft code, a concerted effort by almost
all the Cabinet was required to prepare this draft. Moreover, the Government is also making good progress in
meeting the eight triggers for DPO-3.

58.      The Government also implemented broader reforms around triggers for telecommunications,
one-stop shop, and tax administration--registering significant progress towards the expected outcomes.
For telecommunications, the DPO outcome on broadband penetration was surpassed as the expected spectrum
space was provided for new cell investments and complementary regulations on interconnection were issued.
The added spectrum and the interconnection regulations have facilitated transactions between fixed-line and
mobile companies and new investments into fiber optics. Although the one-stop shop has not yet opened, the
Ministry of Justice has already prepared draft amendments to the Civil Code, the law on State Duties and the
law on Limited Liability Companies that would simplify business registrations. The Ministry of Justice has
also set up registration centers in the city of Yerevan and other locations providing the basis for opening a
fully functioning one stop shop in early 2011. Regarding tax administration the process for electronic filing
                                                      13
of tax returns has been substantially improved, and, as of September 1, 2010, more than 22,500 tax returns
were received electronically (about 15 percent of total active tax payers).

              A.      PILLAR I: ADDRESS VULNERABILITY BY PROTECTING THE POOR
                         AND SUPPORTING HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT

59.      Poverty reduction and human capital development remain important goals for Armenia. The
poor and vulnerable rely on public social safety net programs for a large share of their income and on other
public programs for education and health services. The crisis made protection of funding for the safety net a
top priority. The reforms of education and health services have been going on for some time, and the
Government was keen to continue improving their effectiveness and coverage even in face of the crisis.
Preschool education and improved financing and quality of tertiary education were priorities in the SDP. In
health, the authorities envisaged improved copayment policies and the introduction of performance-based
contracting with health care provided for selected non-communicable diseases.

60.     Pillar 1 supports the following objectives in social protection, education and health

            Strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets and protecting sectoral
            programs for the poor and vulnerable;

            Improving the quality of education, by facilitating one-year preschool education for 4.5-5.5 year
            olds and strengthening the quality and financing of higher education; and

            Providing more affordable services for the poor and other beneficiaries by reforming health
            financing and expanding service delivery by strengthening non-communicable disease
            interventions.

61.     The above objectives are supported by the following four prior actions in DPO-2:

Prior Action 1: Ensured protection of social safety nets, pensions, and priority social spending
programs for the poor and vulnerable by maintaining their shares in the 2010 State Budget (as
compared to 2009) approved by Parliament on December 10, 2009 and by making available, via the
Government Decrees # 275-N and 276-N/ dated March 25, 2010 and # 1238/N dated September 9, 2010,
an additional 6.1 billion Armenian Drams for public spending for the poor and vulnerable.

62.      The 2010 budget maintained the funding for social safety nets and priority social spending
programs at 30 percent of total spending. Annex 5 tracks this information for 2009, 2010 (budget and
actual through June), and 2011 (based on the budget recently submitted to the National Assembly). The 2010
budget shows the following trends for the programs monitored under the DPO2 (see also Table 4 below):

            The share of protected health spending in total spending was stable between 2009 and 2010
            at 1.8 percent and is expected to increase in 2011. This spending level includes allocations for
            hospital services for vulnerable groups of the population, and for treatments of tuberculosis,
            cancer, and infectious diseases, medical care for the mentally ill people, and copayments for
            pediatric services.

            The share of protected safety net spending in total spending increased between 2009 and
            2010 from 3.7 percent to 3.9 percent and is expected to increase further in 2011. This covers
            spending on the poverty family benefit, public works and unemployment insurance.

            However, the share of protected education spending in total spending decreased from 8.7 to
            8.5 percent between 2009 and 2010. The focus is on the remuneration of textbook fees for
            children from socially vulnerable families, basic education allocation, pre-school education
            spending by municipalities, and the top up by the state for the readiness program for 4.5-5.5
            children. The decrease is due to demographic trends which are expected to continue in 2011.
                                                     15
           Pension spending has been maintained at about 15.8 percent of total spending. The DPO2
           monitors spending on old-age pensions.

                 a/ As submitted by the executive to the Parliament in September, 2010.

63.    DPO-1 helped to reinstate spending in the above social programs, while DPO-3 is expected to
maintain these funding levels. The authorities have already submitted a draft 2011 budget to the National
Assembly which maintains the allocation to the above set of priority social programs at 30 percent of total
spending. Over the course of the next year, allocations to selected programs are expected to be re-assessed
depending on progress in revenue collection and decisions that might be taken with respect to health
copayments.

Prior Action 2: Strengthened the management and monitoring of social safety net programs to improve
targeting efficiency and increase public awareness by establishing an inter-agency working group.,
through a Government Protocol Decree #23, dated June 17, 2010 and by the Order of the Minister of
Labor and Social Issues # N86-A/1 dated July 9, 2010.

64.     The Government has made significant progress in improving targeting of the Family Benefit
program to the poorest quintile. The FB's targeting accuracy improved substantially from 48 percent of
program resources going to the poor in 2007 to 63 percent in 2009. However, even though targeting
improved, coverage of the poor declined from 34 percent in 2007 to 25 percent in 2009. This decline is
largely explained by the increase in the number of poor during the economic crisis and the authorities'
decision to decrease the number of families in the FB Program from 121,000 in 2008 to about 114,000 in
2009 for budgetary reasons. Given the limited budget, coverage of the original target of 50 percent of the
poor by 2011 is not realistic. The outcome indicator for FB's coverage has thus been adjusted from 50 to 40
percent of the poor to reflect lower availability of fiscal resources. The lower target for 2011/12 still
                                                           16
represents an increase in coverage relative to 2007, which is noteworthy given the severe impact of the crisis
on GDP and on revenue. Also, the FB is only one of several social assistance programs and the overall
coverage of the poor by social programs including pensions remains substantial at 94 percent of the poorest
20 percent of the population.

65.     The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs continues to strengthen the monitoring of social safety
net programs, focusing on the FB and paid public works (PPW) programs. For the FB program the
ministry has thoroughly cross-checked information from several databases (e.g., cadastral register, utilities
consumption data, automobile ownership, and telecoms usage) to improve targeting. The ministry is also
working with marzes' social assistance councils, which have recently been given new powers, to identify
vulnerable families. Importantly, per May 2009 Decree on Public Works, CSOs have the authority to monitor
the program.

66.     A public awareness campaign was also initiated. Steps were taken to inform the public about the
benefits under the FB program so as to encourage participation. The authorities have secured donor funding
to expand the awareness campaign during 2011.

Prior Action 3: Issued Government Protocol Decree #38 dated September 30, 2010 adopting financing
mechanisms to cover recurrent costs for the one-year school readiness program for 4.5-5.5 years old
children.

67.      The expansion of access to preschool education is important for enhancing pro-poor outcomes
in the sector. This measure establishes a financing mechanism for the one-year school readiness program for
4.5-5.5 year old children (senior preschool age children). The focus is on preparing children in this age group
for elementary school, and creating equal baseline conditions for entering general education schools. The
authorities plan to gradually enroll all senior preschool age children into mandatory preschool education
programs, targeting a 90 percent enrollment rate by 2015.

68.      The proposed funding mechanism will come into force in 2011. Over time, this funding
mechanism will finance educational costs in all preschool facilities. But for the draft state budget for 2011,
an allocation of AMD 97.0 million has been made to cover recurrent costs of already created preschool
classes in four pilot marzes.

Prior Action 4: Issued a Government Protocol Decree #3 dated January 29, 2010 on Non-
Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and launched performance-based contracting at the primary health
care level, including defined NCD services.

69.     The MOH developed a NCD strategic framework, which provides an analysis of NCD in
Armenia and identifies the priority diseases to be addressed in the short and medium term. Based on
the framework, a concept note and action plan on NCD prevention were approved by a Government Decree.
The concept note includes strategies for cardiovascular disease and diabetes and identifies performance
indicators for health care suppliers.

70.      The MOH has taken critical steps to launch performance-based contracting at the primary
health care (PHC) level in two NCD areas--cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. With the assistance of
USAID, MOH has developed a computerized database (MIDAS III) to capture performance indicators for
which data collection has already begun. On the basis of this data, performance-based contracts will be
established and performance-related bonuses for health care suppliers in the above two NCDs will start in
2011. MOH has also developed an action plan for expanding performance-based contracting system for other
NCDs.



                                                      17
71.     The Government plans to introduce a comprehensive copayments policy which is a trigger for
DPO-3. The importance of introducing a full copayment policy is two-fold: (1) to eliminate informal
payments that the population, including those receiving the basic benefit package, has to make for almost all
services; and (2) to move the per-case funding of hospitals by the state to a more realistic level as recent study
shows that, on average, the state compensates hospitals for approximately 50 percent of the actual cost of
services. The introduction of a formal copayment is expected to offer more transparency and predictability to
household out-of-pocket payments compared to unregulated informal payments. This will need to be
accompanied by a larger state budget allocation given the low levels of public health spending.

           B.      PILLAR II: STRENGTHEN COMPETITIVENESS FOR POST-CRISIS GROWTH

72.      Though recovery is underway, Armenia's challenges are to foster entry and competition,
including in tradable sectors, and to diversify the sources of growth. Towards this end, Pillar II supports
the following objectives:

            Increasing economic competition through improvements in the financial sector, business
            environment, the competition agency and corporate governance; Addressing critical infrastructure
            needs and improving the regulatory environment in ICT;
            Improving competitiveness through sustainable use of energy and natural resources;
            Adopting best international management standards to improve efficiency and effectiveness in tax,
            customs, and public expenditure; and
            Preventing conflict of interest in public service and improve wage policy.

73.     An account of the status of the six Prior Actions under this pillar follows.

Prior Action 5: Submitted to the National Assembly through Prime Minister's letter # 01/23.6/14392-10
dated November 16, 2010 revisions to competition-related legislation which aims at strengthening the
autonomy and enforcement capacity of the State Committee for Protection of Economic Competition
(SCPEC), and harmonizing key elements of the legislation with international best practice.

74.     Fostering domestic competition is crucial. Armenia's international competitiveness ratings are
low, ranking 97th out of 133 in the 2009/10 Global Competitiveness Report with no change from the 2008
ranking. The main institutional shortcoming is the weakness of the current competition framework wherein
SCPEC does not have a clear mandate or the resources to ensure low barriers to entry.

75.      Amendments to the Competition Law and related legislation were endorsed by the Cabinet on
November 4, 2010, and submitted to the National Assembly. The amendments specify instances in which
the SCPEC should carry out inspections and clarify its ability to act in case of anticompetitive behavior.
They also introduce international best practices for anticompetitive agreements, abuse of dominance,
collusion, fines, leniency and state aid. While market share remains as one factor used to establish whether a
firm is dominant, it is no longer the predominant factor. The amendments also allow firms to supply evidence
of their lack of dominance even when their market share is high. They reduce emphasis on price fluctuations
as a mean to establish dominance or collusion, and also provide for larger budget allocations for the SCPEC.

76.     The authorities have also arranged for a capacity building initiative in SCPEC. The SCPEC has
prepared a Program for 2010-12 which outlines the capacity building initiatives, and identifies changes in
regulations and procedures that will be needed once the amendments are approved. The Program also
includes strategies for improved management of the human, financial and technical resources of the SCPEC.
Moreover, the Program includes efforts to improve public awareness of competition issues and policy. The
program will be underpinned by a twinning arrangement supported by the German Government.
                                                       18
Prior Action 6: Conducted an assessment of the improvement in spectrum management and
monitoring, discussed it with all spectrum stakeholders, and submitted to the Bank the minutes of the
Borrower's Board of the Broadband and IT Security meeting of October 27, 2010, which include key
next steps in this area.

77.     The telecom sector in Armenia has expanded rapidly since its liberalization in 2007. Mobile
penetration and numbers of broadband subscribers have increased significantly. The liberalization also
triggered large investments, including acquisition of the old monopoly, Armentel, by Russian Vimpelcom, the
purchase of local mobile operator, Viva Cell, by Russian MTS, and the entry of Orange (France Telecom).
Competition spurred investment in new technologies and better telecom infrastructure. Internet services are
also growing rapidly with several joint-ventures entering the market.

78.     The Government is committed to a more liberal allocation of the radio spectrum, which will
allow for the licensing of new telecommunications services providers. The Government completed a
report on the inventory of spectrum allocations and usage, the economic value of public sector spectrum
holdings, potential private sector demand and legal, regulatory, and institutional strengthening issues. The
report also explored options to increase efficiency of spectrum use. Consultations with the relevant
stakeholders were held and the Government endorsed the report's recommendations on October 26, 2010.
The enlarged allocation is intended to promote competition, reduce costs, and increase access for the
population and is consistent with the Government's objective to build an "e-society". Particularly relevant
will be the opening of the 450 MHz band, which will allow wireless broadband services in rural areas at
affordable prices.

Prior Action 7: Submitted to the National Assembly through Prime Minister's letter # 01/24.1/13011
dated November 10, 2010 a new Mining Code adhering to international best practice for fiscal,
environmental, social, and licensing standards.

79.     The current mining sector law and regulations are discretionary, conflicting and overlapping.
The fiscal regime is vague and complicated, as multiple agencies collect mining-specific taxes and the
regulatory and institutional set-up lacks transparency and public accountability. At the same time, the
licensing regime is inadequate. These factors deter investors and results in foregone jobs, foreign exchange
and fiscal revenues.

80.      To help revitalize the mining sector the Government has developed a new mining code, which
provides for appropriate licensing, fiscal, environmental, and social regimes. The Cabinet adopted the
final draft of the mining code for submission to the National Assembly that follows best practice for modern
mining legislation (Box 2). The regulations governing environmental issues are being revised to ensure that
appropriate environmental risk assessment, management, and impact mitigation measures are implemented.
At the same time, the fiscal regime for mining (a new chapter in the Natural Resource User Fee Law) was
significantly simplified to improve compliance and respond to changes in world commodity prices,
specifically for metallic minerals.

81.    Upon passage of the mining code, the Government will develop and enact the necessary
implementing regulations. This process will be supported by DPO-3, and includes related environmental
and social regulations. Also, the authorities are considering participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) to strengthen revenue management in line with international good practices.
The authorities also asked the Bank to keep track (as a benchmark) of efforts to prepare a new Environmental
Impact Assessment Law, without which the current Mining Code cannot be fully operational.




                                                    19
                                           Box 2: The Draft Mining Code
 The draft Mining Code is applicable to all minerals except oil and gas. It reflects good international practice and is a
 significant improvement over existing practices. The new Code is expected to encourage more mining investment for
 three reasons. First, the licensing process has been simplified, thereby reducing transaction costs for investors.
 Second, the new code clearly identifies the rights and responsibilities of mining investors/operators and makes the
 transition from exploration to production in case of a discovery more transparent, stable and predictable. Third,
 mineral taxation has been made simpler, more transparent and competitive. Also other changes in the Code ensure
 adequate environmental and social safeguards.
 The main changes are:
          Coverage ­ All minerals except oil and gas (to be regulated by separate law), radioactive minerals and
          underground drinking water (exploration only).
          Licensing Systems ­ The simplified regime provides for technical and financial qualifications of the potential
          investors, clearly specifies the rights and responsibilities of mining operators, and delineates a clear role for
          the Government as regulator and not operator.
          Environmental and social safeguards, including mining closure ­ Clear requirements for environmental
          stewardship (environmental impact assessment and management and monitoring plan), pre-development
          social planning (social impact assessment and mitigation plan), mine closure process (initial mine closure
          plan, covering physical, environmental and social closure aspects, financial surety for mine closure, and post
          closure monitoring plan).
          Information disclosure ­ The geo-information belongs to the state and remains confidential during the period
          of permit validity, but after that period the state has the right to use it for sector promotion and to share it
          with other interested parties without any financial obligations to the initial permit holder.
 The revised fiscal regime for mining introduced a clear and competitive royalty approach for metallic minerals and
 strengthens the natural resource user fee approach for non-metallic minerals. The changes consolidate different
 aspects of mining-specific taxation in a single law through amendment and supplements to the law "On
 Environmental and Natural Resources User Fees". Key features include: (1) Concept of natural user fee for non-
 metallic minerals and royalty for metallic minerals ­ to compensate for the depletion of mineral resources; (2) Base
 for royalty calculation - applied to the sales value of ore or a product from it, specified as a turnover (excluding the
 VAT) as for profit and sales taxes; (3) Procedure for setting royalty rates ­ profitability-triggered mechanism; and (4)
 Implementing agency ­ the State Revenue Committee. The proposed royalty mechanism simplifies administration by
 using concepts such as turnover and profitability, which companies report for regular taxation purposes.
 Consequently, the State Revenue Committee can verify royalty easier than before, but SRC will require significant
 capacity building to properly implement the regime.
 The main features of the draft Mining Code were presented to the representatives of CSOs and academia during the
 meeting chaired by the Deputy Ministers of Energy and Natural Resources and Environment on October 8, 2010.


Prior Action 8: Achieved satisfactory progress towards business process reengineering (BPR) by:
 a) Contracting an external firm to advise on the BPR (contract # 09/101) with KPMG dated February
    26, 2010 and submitting to the Bank on November 1, 2010 the full draft report after formal
    discussions within the State Revenue Committee;
 b) Issuing a Government's Protocol Decree # 36 dated August 26, 2010 on the Relevant Legislative
    Changes to Streamline Tax Registration Procedures and sending to Parliament by the Government
    letter # 01/23.2/1899-10 dated September15, 2010;
 c) Developing a Concept Note on Risk-based Audit Selection and adopting it through Government
    Protocol Decree # 23 dated June 4, 2010; and
 d) Submitting to the National Assembly through a Government letter # 01/23.2/3412-10 dated March
    31, 2010 Amendments to Legislation or Procedures on the Review of high risk value added tax
    refund claims.

82.    Given Armenia's relatively low revenue to GDP ratio, and the envisaged fiscal adjustment,
revenue administration reform is a key Government priority. In the past, tax administration reform was
slow compared to neighboring and middle-income countries. As a result, tax evasion is high and voluntary
                                                20
compliance low because of the high compliance costs due to weaknesses in audit, processing third party
information, and detecting tax fraud. Improvement in revenue performance needs to be accomplished by
measures to encourage voluntary compliance and detect tax evasion, but these need to start with a proper
review of the way processes are being conducted.

83.     Progress towards the specific actions is as follows:

            Business Process Reengineering: KPMG, a large international accounting and audit firm, served
            as the contractor for the BPR and the Bank received from the SRC their full assessment on
            November 1, 2010. The report contains a schematic description of existing processes, and
            recommendations for re-engineering 15 processes, including what needs to be done, cost
            estimates, expected results, and suggested indicators for measuring results.

            Tax registration procedures: SRC has developed a legislative package for tax registration which
            was approved by the Cabinet and submitted to the National Assembly. It sets a unified deadline
            for all tax declarations and eliminated three declarations as duplicative. It also specified that
            individual entrepreneurs with turnovers up to 6 million drams would only need to pay a license
            fee.

            Risk-based audit selection: The concept note for risk based audit selection was approved by the
            Cabinet on December 17, 2009. The working group has been set up and assistance is being
            provided by USAID for developing the risk criteria. The TOR for the software has been
            developed.

            VAT refunds: The National Assembly passed a law on automated refunds, allowing refunds
            without review for low risk taxpayers. The automated refund system has been developed for
            exporters only. According to SRC, over 90 percent of VAT refunds go to exporters of minerals.
            Refund claims under AMD 3 million are processed in regional offices, with headquarters
            processing higher claim amounts. This threshold will increase to AMD 5 million in 2011 and
            AMD 10 million in 2012. The TOR for the software for automated refund was developed with
            the help of USAID.

84.    The SRC and the Ministry of Finance also have taken significant steps (outside the DPO
program) to improve tax policies and administration (Box 3). To maintain the continuity of this important
agenda for fiscal consolidation and business environment, DPO-3 includes a trigger on continuing tax
administration reforms.

Prior Action 9: Approved by a Government Protocol Decree # 36 dated August 26, 2010, the necessary
legislative framework for improving functioning of Green-Channel operation, including allowing the
incorporation of the e-signature module to the trade world manager software.

85.     Armenia has recently improved its ranking in the indicators on "Trading across Borders" in
the Doing Business Report, but further progress is needed. Armenia ranked 143 out of 183 countries in
the "Trading across Borders" indicator in 2008, but improved to 102 in 2009 and 82 this year. The improved
rankings resulted from introduction of self-declaration desks at customs houses and warehouses, investments
in new equipment to improve border operations and introduction of a risk management system. The country,
however, still ranks low in the Logistic Performance Index (#111 of 155 countries) due to inefficient
clearance process (speed, simplicity and predictability of formalities) in border control agencies including
customs. Further modernization of customs administration and other border management organizations could
thus help facilitate cross-border trade.



                                                      21
86.     This prior action introduces a Green Channel for easier customs processing. Amendments to the
Customs Code to include a Green Channel were approved by the Government on August 26 and submitted to
the National Assembly. The Assembly is expected to discuss them before year's end so they can become
applicable from January 2011. All declarations, except for small cases, will be electronic and risk
management principles will be used. The MOF will define risk methodology. The authorities approved
funding in October for required software upgrades and contracting has been completed. The upgraded
software should be fully operational in about six months.


                       Box 3: Tax Policy and Administration Improvements in 2009-10
 Armenia ranks very low on paying taxes indicator of the Doing Business 2011 survey (#159 among 183 countries in this
 year publication). For this reason and the urgent need to improve collection rates the Government undertook several
 reform measures in key areas of tax administration outside the DPO program as described below.

         Collection and Information Systems -- Introduced electronic submission of tax returns and enacted a law on e-
         Signature with more than 2,800 companies using e-signature (all the large tax payers and many of the medium
         tax payers are included in this number);

         Tax payer service and education -- Introduced a hotline for feedback, complaints, and suggestions, (25,000
         calls received in 2009, including about 4,000 suggestions to improve existing practice); submitted amendments
         to relevant legislation to National Assembly to introduce new function at SRC to serve start-up businesses
         during the first six months of operation; published monthly periodicals on the "Taxpayer" and "Customs House"
         to inform the public about recent legislative changes and the list of large taxpayers; posted frequently asked
         questions on the SRC webpage on tax policy/administration and responses (currently about 200 Q&A are
         posted); introduced Taxpayer Service Centers, and posted taxpayer guidelines for SMEs posted on the SRC
         website;

         Legal and Appeals -- Submitted amendments to relevant legislation to National Assembly to introduce new
         procedure for provision of official interpretations on tax legislation; Decided to create an independent tax
         appeals unit in the Prime Minister's Office; and

          Audit and Inspections -- Prepared concept, methodology, and functional specifications for the Risk-Based
          Audit Selection System; developed Software to manage risk profiles and base audit decisions on risk criteria;
          approved audit manuals approved for tourism, real estate, transport and retail trade sectors.

 While the above changes does not address every area (e.g., organizational structure, human resources management, and
 anticorruption), they represent a good starting point. The recently concluded BPR provides a structure for the further
 deepening and broadening of tax administration reforms.


Prior Action 10: Approved by a Government Protocol Decree #42, dated October 28, 2010, a Public
Finance Management (PFM) Reform Strategy.

87.     Like most other FSU countries, Armenia created a Treasury Single Account early on, improved
cash and debt management, and streamlined budget planning via MTEF and program-based
budgeting. Key sectoral reforms including per-pupil funding for basic education and means tested family
benefits and increased public investments helped improve the composition and efficiency of public spending.
Armenia's current challenge in PFM is to improve upon these reforms by crafting an integrated program--
hence the need for the PFM Reform Strategy supported by the DPO-2--and address some issues left behind
in key areas (e.g., integration of accounts for externally funded public investments into the treasury single
account).

88.    The PFM Reform Strategy aims to improve the budget's performance orientation while
strengthening fiduciary accountability and revenue management. Improving performance orientation

                                                        22
will focus on measures to strengthen the MTEF and planning processes and further reform program
budgeting. Measures to strengthen fiduciary accountability focus on reporting and monitoring (including for
non-commercial organizations), internal audit, external audit, and National Assembly oversight. Many
reforms are already underway and the challenge is to continue implementation while closely monitoring
impact. The Government's PEFA Report (October 2008) provides an important baseline for measuring future
progress. Though previous reforms yielded solid results, it is now critical that the reform of core functions
(macro/budget, control, and accounting/reporting) move in parallel toward agreed strategic objectives.

89.      The authorities drafted a PFM strategy following extensive consultations with the Bank, EC,
and other donors, and discussed it publicly with other line ministers and agencies last June. The PFM
Strategy aims to increase the efficiency of public expenditure management and improve the quality of
policies and services, by: (i) ensuring fiscal discipline, which will contribute to macroeconomic stability and
predictability of budget system; (ii) guaranteeing the linkage of funds used with main policies and priorities;
and (iii) ensuring efficient use of funds and accountability in public spending. Regulation of the PFM system
will be centralized, but decision making will be decentralized to the sub-national level where possible with
clear lines of accountability established.

90.     To assist the Government finalize the PFM strategy, the Bank co-sponsored with the EU and
the Ministry of Finance a brainstorming session on PFM reform challenges in June, 2010. Bank staff
also prepared a working paper on PFM Priorities in September 2010.

                             VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                 A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

91.     The policies and the programs supported by the DPO series are expected to help the poor and
vulnerable. In the short term, the DPO series aims to support the Government to withstand the social impact
of the global economic crisis. Over the medium term, the DPO series will assist the authorities in removing
key binding constraints to more rapid and diversified growth in the post-crisis period, and promote poverty
reduction. There are three sets of DPO measures which are directed towards protecting the poor.

92.      First, DPO-2 prior actions protect funding for key social programs--the FB program,
unemployment and pension insurance--in the face of a major fiscal crisis. It also supports improved
targeting of the FB program. About 90 percent of the poor are covered by one or more of the social programs
supported by the DPO2. The FB, in particular, targets the extreme poor (see paragraph 33). Ongoing poverty
and inequality analysis intends to provide a full analysis of the poverty mitigation impacts of these programs
for the DPO period.

93.     Second, the introduction of funding for 4.5 to 5.5 year olds is targeted to start in the poorest
regions of the country. This measure seeks to prevent inter-generational transfer of poverty in addition to
increasing education access for all.

94.      Third, the DPO supports measures to help support medium-term growth. This will have an
indirect effect on poverty reduction over time. Some of the measures supported by the program--such as on
the mining code and telecom reforms--address binding constraints to Armenia's growth prospects and hold
promise of new job creation.




                                                      23
                                       B.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

95.     The Bank's assessment is that the overall foreign exchange and public financial management
risks are acceptable for this operation. The Bank's knowledge of the country's PFM system was
summarized in the DPO-1 program document. The Government's PEFA assessment was published in 2008.
DPO-2 supports adoption of an integrated PFM reform strategy which will bring all the PFM reforms under a
single umbrella in a sequenced manner. The IMF's 2005 central bank safeguard assessment found that the
procedures used by the CBA for sales of its foreign exchange are transparent and its safeguards are adequate.
The CBA adopted the IAS (now IFRS) in 1996 and has been audited by internationally recognized auditing
firms. Independent auditors have issued unqualified opinions on recent CBA financial statements.

                       C.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING ARRANGEMENTS

96.      The Borrower/Recipient of the Loan/Credit will be the Republic of Armenia. Upon
effectiveness of the Loan/Financing Agreement, expected in January 2011, the proposed single-tranche
loan/credit (loan amount of US$4 million and credit amount of US$21 million equivalent) will be made
available to the Republic of Armenia, represented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The IDA Single
Tranche will be released after the Bank has withdrawn the amount for the refinancing of the Project
Preparation Advance of USD 590,000 equivalent (SDR 380,000). Provision of a legal opinion by the
Republic of Armenia that it has followed its laws and procedures for the ratification of the loan/credit
agreement will be the effectiveness condition. The proposed operation amount will be on standard IDA
terms, with a 20 year maturity including a 10 year grace period, and on IBRD terms with a flexible Loan
denominated in US Dollar with an interest rate equal to 6 months LIBOR, plus variable spread, with a final
maturity of 25 years including a grace period of 10 years. The front-end fee is equal to 25 basis points and
shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan.

97.     The Bank/Association will disburse the single tranche (s) as follows: the IDA and IBRD tranches
will be disbursed in US dollars and the amounts deposited in a dedicated account of the Treasury at the
Central Bank of Armenia. The Borrower/Recipient shall ensure that upon deposit of the proceeds into the
said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the Borrower's/Recipient's budget management
system, in a manner acceptable to the Association, that is, the MOF's budget account will be credited with the
dram equivalent at the official exchange rate within 30 days of disbursement. The foreign exchange proceeds
of the proposed DPO-2 will be sold by the CBA or held in reserves, in accordance with the objectives of
monetary policy. The MOF will be responsible for the operation's administration and for preparing the
withdrawal application, maintaining the deposit account at the CBA, as required. The MOF, with the
assistance of the CBA, will maintain records of all DPO-related transactions in accordance with sound
accounting practices.

98.      Reporting, auditing and closing date: The audits of deposit accounts under the previous Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) were unqualified and revealed no issues of concern. Considering the
Bank's/Association's knowledge of the public finance management systems and the ongoing improvements
of these systems, the positive assessment of the CBA made by the IMF, previous unqualified audits of deposit
account under PRSCs with no audit required under DPO-1, and clean opinions issued by the CBA's auditor
on the recent years financial statements, no additional fiduciary arrangements (including audit) will be
required for the deposit account. The closing date of the proposed credit is June 30, 2011.

99.      Confirmation and eligible expenditure: The Borrow/Recipient will provide to the Bank/Association
a confirmation that the amounts of the DPO-2 have been credited to the account that is available to finance
budget expenditures (the format of the confirmation letter should be acceptable to the Bank/Association). If,
after the proceeds are deposited in the CBA account, the proceeds of the loan/credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Loan/Financing Agreement, the Bank/Association will require the
Borrower/Recipient to promptly, upon notice from the Bank/Association, refund an amount equal to the
                                                     24
amount of said payment to the Bank/Association. Amounts refunded to the Bank/Association upon such
request shall be cancelled. The administration of the loan/credit will be the responsibility of the MOF.

                                   D.       ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

100.    It is expected that the DPO series will result in positive effects on the environment, which is
discussed in the DPO-1 program document. The DPO builds on the extensive analytical framework of the
Armenia Country Environment Analysis (CEA, FY10) and addresses some of the specific shortcomings in
environmental policy. .Furthermore, the requirements of OP 8.60--to strengthen national environmental
regulatory capacity--are addressed through the operation's support of improved mining and EIA legislation.
Other policy actions supported by the DPO are not likely to result in significant environmental effects. These
include, inter alia, education, health, and telecommunications measures.

101.    Special attention was given to ensuring that the new Mining Code includes good practice
requirements for environmental stewardship. Consequently, the draft Mining Code includes requirements
such as Environmental Impact Assessment and Management and Monitoring plan for both exploration and
exploitation stages. The Code also includes requirements on pre-development social planning (social impact
assessment and mitigation plan), and mine closure process (initial mine closure plan, covering physical,
environmental and social closure aspects, financial surety for mine closure, and post closure monitoring plan).
Unfortunately, Armenia does not have a proper legislation on Environmental Impact Assessment, which is
necessary to make effective the provisions included in the Mining Code. In this regard, the Authorities have
committed to prepare and submit to the National Assembly such piece of legislation and requested the Bank
to monitor progress as a Benchmark for DPO-3.

                     E.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

102.     The Government has tasked the Ministry of Finance as the main counterpart for the DPO
series. The Government has established a multi-ministerial steering committee to take responsibility for DPO
implementation and monitoring, under the chairmanship of the Minister of Finance. At the working level, the
Deputy Minister of Finance (Macroeconomics) is the counterpart responsible for policy coordination and
overall program implementation, together with assigned contact officials in each respective agency. As the
overall coordinator, the MOF tracks results as summarized in Annex 6.

103.   The PPA for DPO-2 was partially used to support policy development and implementation in
key areas of the program. The authorities have also mobilized their own support towards the
implementation of the DPO program from GTZ, USAID, and the EU.

104.    The DPO includes a detailed matrix of expected outcome and monitoring indicators aligned
with the goals of Armenia's SDP and deliverables of the Government's action plans (Annex 6). The
Government is committed to monitor DPO project implementation on the basis of the agreed results
framework. DPO implementation, monitoring, and evaluation will rely on existing institutional arrangements
(namely, the social partnership agreement for participatory implementation of the SDP and the steering
committee chaired by the minister of Finance) already in place. The Bank is represented in the SDP Working
Group and is invited to the meetings of the MOF steering committee. The Bank will rely on the Ministry of
Finance, the DPO Steering Committee, and the Ministry of Economy (which coordinates SDP
implementation), to provide regular, consolidated reviews of DPO implementation, using performance
indicators and data derived from the SDP monitoring process.

105.    A small set of indicators have been adjusted from DPO-1 to DPO-2 mainly to reflect the
development of the economy/sectors and prior actions. In particular, the target indicator for coverage of
the Family Benefit program was reduced from 50 to 40 percent of the poor to reflect realities with respect to
budget resources as well as the (slower than expected) pace of recovery. Moreover, there were several SDP
                                                    25
priority areas for which existing reporting arrangements were inadequate to provide sufficient information,
demanding modifications or the collection of supplementary information. Changes to indicators are
documented in Annexes 3 and 4.

                                   F.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

106.      The DPO objectives and its implementation are subject to three types of risks. First, the
underlying macroeconomic framework is vulnerable to global developments, and banking sector
dollarization. Second, the country's commitment to fully carry out the reforms supported by the DPO is also
a risk, to the extent that key measures might be politically resisted or undermined, or even reversed. And
third, there are risks related to the ability and capacity of the authorities to fully implement the reforms given
the parallel demands for difficult macro-management and demanding reforms, in some cases the ability to put
in place the necessary institutional framework to implement a law supported by the operation maybe the
issue. While a number of risk-mitigating measures are expected to be taken to address these risks, there will
still be residual risks in each of the above areas that cannot be fully mitigated.

107.    The underlying macroeconomic framework is vulnerable to global developments, high
dollarization levels in the banking sector, and a slower pace of reform implementation. Slow global
economic recovery or volatility in commodity prices and remittances will result in a slow pace of recovery
and medium-term growth. High levels of foreign currency loans by the corporate sector (56 percent in 2010)
expose unhedged borrowers to potential currency risk. At the same time, currency mismatches undermine the
balance sheets of the banks.

108.     If growth is slower than envisaged, because of slower regional and global recovery or banking
sector setbacks, continuing reforms, as well as macroeconomic management, may be difficult. At the
aggregate level, the envisaged fiscal and external adjustments might not be feasible, which in turn would
increase further the debt-to-GDP and debt service ratios and require larger fiscal adjustment than planned or
additional concessional financing. And given that lower growth implies lower revenue collections, a number
of DPO measures--particularly those related to the maintenance of public spending in priority social sectors,
or the introduction of a comprehensive policy on copayments--could become unattainable.

109.     While Government's commitment to continued reform implementation remains strong,
political opposition to a sub-set of measures could undermine the program's impact. The program's
outcomes heavily depend on key pieces of legislation being ultimately enacted--without substantial
changes--by Parliament. The risk, however, is that there could be pressures to introduce significant changes
to the draft legislation undermining the goals of the program, though this risk is assessed to be small because
there has been significant consultations with private sector and the public on these drafts in the process of
developing them, for example, draft Mining Code and the amendments to the Competition Law.

110.     The Government's implementation capacity is stretched by demands of a difficult growth and
fiscal situation as well as challenging reforms and there is a risk that implementation will be delayed.
So far the Government has done a remarkable job, as evidenced by the comprehensive way in which they
implemented the Prior Actions of DPO-2, as well as various other measures. Nevertheless, the authorities
have faced difficulties in keeping to original timeline. Thus, the risk of delays in implementation remains.
This is also true in cases where the impact of a reform measure depends on appropriate improvements in
capacity, for example, to get the full benefit of the Mining Code and its regulations, technical capacity of
certain agencies needs to be expanded and a risk exists that this may not happen as quickly as planned.




                                                       26
111.    Risk mitigation measures are described below.

            The Government and the World Bank in coordination with the IMF are monitoring the
            macro situation. Thus, corrective measures are expected to be identified and taken in a timely
            way in response to changes in global economic recovery, in revenue or in external financing. The
            debt management strategy--an integral part of the MTEF--is currently narrowly focused on
            smoothing out the debt service spike of the 2012-/14 period. While the risk of a slower global
            recovery cannot be mitigated, regular monitoring and dialogue will help to take appropriate
            actions to minimize impact of this risk.

            To enhance risk management in the banking system, the CBA has taken a number of
            measures to address this risk. This includes issuing regulations in March and June 2010 to
            impose higher risk weights (by 50 percent) in capital requirements for foreign exchange loans,
            and to require increased loan-loss provisioning for foreign exchange loans. They have also
            required banks to further improve their crisis management framework and are closely monitoring
            NPLs and are ready to take further measures if required. The CBA has submitted a request for a
            full FSAP to the IMF and the WB.

            To avoid vested interests from undermining program implementation, the authorities have
            revamped their communication strategy. To secure passage of key program-supported
            legislation through Parliament, the authorities have enhanced their efforts to communicate
            reforms aiming at broadening the political support particularly among those meant to benefit
            from the reforms (i.e., the poor and the middle class). The Bank is supporting these outreach
            efforts actively, when appropriate. The authorities are also actively engaging key commissions in
            Parliament responsible for key pieces of legislation (mining code, competition law, and conflict
            of interest chapter in the public service law) and has launched consultations and alliances with
            key stakeholders (civil society organizations).

            Several measures have been taken to enhance implementation capacity. The Government
            has mobilized PPA resources to support line ministries and agencies in developing and
            implementing their reform efforts. It has also set up a steering committee for the program chaired
            by the Minister of Finance which is able to allocate resources to agencies in need. At the same
            time, the Bank (including IFC advisory services) has complemented these efforts by selectively
            providing technical assistance in key areas, such as social protection, public financial
            management (including revenue administration), and private sector development. More
            fundamentally, several Bank investment projects or donor supported programs are helping with
            thorough institutional capacity building for key policy areas covered by the DPO.

112.    However, despite the above risk-mitigating efforts, residual risks remain, and if they
materialize Armenia may experience lower growth with particularly adverse effects on the poor. Given
the vulnerability of Armenia to external shocks, and uncertainty about the pace of regional and global
recovery, risk of lower growth cannot be fully mitigated. In the event of these downside risks materializing,
Armenia could require more concessional assistance to manage the situation.

    Note that coverage of all social programs and pensions combined is very high in Armenia (79% of the poor and 94 for the lowest quintile), so this is still a challenging target and it might
   not be required to be fully fulfilled as long as coverage by all social and social insurance programs remains high.

        The monthly cost of broadband internet access for 1 Mbps for both the ADSL technology and a basket of available broadband technologies is calculated as the average of prices for
      service offerings by different ISPs (taken from the company websites as of January 2010). The recent significant decline in the retail prices for the mobile broadband and ADSL services is
      likely to imply a very large reduction of these prices in 2011 (i.e., target will likely be more than fulfilled).

        The number of broadband users have increased from 6000 in 2008 to 64,890 (2.1 per 100 inhabitants) as of July 1, 2010 if users via USB modems and routers are excluded (and to
      124,00 if they are included). Either way, this indicator has increased by at least ten-fold during 2010.

                                                                           President, the World Bank
                                                                                Washington DC, USA


        Dear Mr. Zoellick,


1.      The Government of the Republic of Armenia (hereinafter, the Government) embarked on a
series of second generation reforms in 2008 with the objective of increasing Armenia's global
competitiveness. Long-term reform targets and policy priorities were laid out in the Sustainable
Development Program (SDP) aiming at improving economic development and increasing prosperity
and human development through a series of pro-active policies. Effective public and private sector
governance, even regional development, an efficient tax and customs system, and the development of
an information society were at the core of our reforms.

2.       Unfortunately, the global financial and economic crisis brought the implementation of the
reforms and development policies to a halt. Our Government had to focus on mitigating the social
consequences of the global crisis and stimulating businesses to avoid the threat of a social and
economic crisis. In the current post-crisis situation, we are now focused on implementing explicit steps
conducive to a quick rebound, and have fully implemented a number of the previously envisaged
reforms. This means that the long-term targets and policies have not lost their relevance, but will be
achieved with some delays. But in many cases we now consider them as more urgent and imperative
than before for an efficient operation of our economy in the post-crisis situation. This is certainly the
case for the set of policies supported by the DPO series, which we regard as a key roadmap for both
the crisis and the post-crisis periods.

3.      Our development strategy continues to have two pillars. On the one hand, we are
strengthening policies targeted to offer social protection to the poor and foster human capital
development. On the other hand, we are very focused on increasing the competitiveness of the
country, and ensuring a quick return to a more sustainable income growth than the one experienced
during the pre-crisis. In both cases, we are focused on policies that will help us achieve the intended

                                                   44
long-term targets we have set for our country, and at the same time help us improve the current
imbalances in the structure of our economy, such as its excessive reliance on construction and
remittances rather than on exports of goods and services.

4.      The support from the World Bank is critical to mitigate the impacts of economic crisis, as well
as to pave the road for further sustainable development. The proposed Second Development Policy
Operation is the second of a programmatic series of three operations designed to support key elements
of our policy reform agenda. The proposed DPO-2 is supporting an orderly transition from a focus
from immediate mitigating measures towards preparing conditions for post-crisis growth.

                     Implementation of the Sustainable Development Program

5.      The Sustainable Development Program (SDP) is the country's key socio-economic planning
document covering key agreed-upon development directions and policies. The approved document has
a long-term nature and is based on pre-crisis global and domestic development projections.

6.      Since the SDP targets were set before the crisis, they were very ambitious for the short to
medium term. For this reason the Government developed a short-term action plan of SDP policies for
2009-2011, which was adopted during the meeting of the SDP Steering Committee that I chaired on
August 21st, 2009. The framework of longer-term SDP objectives and structural reforms was decided
to be maintained nonetheless, even if the speed of implementation is going to be slower than
envisaged in the post-crisis. Priority reforms and anti-crisis measures for a quicker return to pre-crisis
income levels were also guided by the 2011-13 MTEF prepared by the Ministry of Finance and
approved by the Government on July 8th, 2010. The MTEF also guided the preparation of the DPO-2
operation.

                                     Post-Crisis Economic Policy

7.       Armenia's economy was heavily impacted by the downturn in global markets and partner
countries during 2009. In contrast to the double-digit growth of previous years, Armenia's economy
shrank by 14.2 percent. Mining exports were the first to be declined, followed by a contraction in
exports of other types of products and remittances from abroad. As remittances and the related capital
inflows were drying up, investments dropped and ultimately the construction sector paralyzed ­ the
main driver of our growth in recent years. The fall in the income of our population and their change in
consumer behavior, coupled with the reduced external demand, led to a sharp fall in economic activity
in a number of sectors of our economy. Growth vigorously resurged during the first quarter of 2010,
but it slowed down during the third quarter due to bad weather conditions in agriculture, and was only
2.8 percent between January and September. Our projections for this year are that growth will stay in
the three percent range, while it is projected to be slightly higher in 2011 at 4.6%.

8.       Armenia avoided the financial impact of the global crisis due to our small but strong banking
system. However, avoiding the impact on our real sector was impossible. The Government, however,
was able to safeguard macroeconomic stability due to implementation of a set of well coordinated
fiscal and monetary policies. The first wave of the crisis threatened our macroeconomic stability and
could have led to an unmanageable situation had the Government not implemented the anti-crisis
policy in a timely and consistent manner.

9.     Our anti-crisis policy framework was four-pronged: (1) Coordinated Macro-economic policy
aimed at maintaining stability of the financial system (2) fiscal stimulus to protect priority social
spending and to increase job creation via infrastructure investments; (3) further improving the tax

12.11.2010
                                                   45
administration and the business environment (particularly, for the SMEs, mining and telecom sectors),
and (4) providing financial cushions to the enterprises with export potential and import substitution.

10.     Coordinated macroeconomic policy aimed at maintaining stability of the financial
system. We were able to avoid unmanageable situations in the banking system through temporary
regulation of the exchange rate. Though this approach resulted in some losses of foreign reserves,
nevertheless in the background of financial panic in partner countries, Armenia succeeded to manage
expectations and to allow some time for financial agents for adjustment, after which the Central Bank
announced the return to the free floating exchange rate policy. As a result, after one-time depreciation
the national currency stabilized around market equilibrium price, leaving behind the threats of the
financial crisis.

11.     The fiscal stimulus focused on social protection and infrastructure investments. We
maintained budget allocations for a priority set of social protection programs (including pensions,
family and unemployment benefits, and selected set of health and education programs) while at the
same time worked on improving the targeting of our Family Benefit Program. These measures, which
were supported by the DPO, helped the most to steer Armenia away from a calamitous social and
poverty outcome. The actual increase in poverty rates has been estimated to be substantially lower
than what could have occurred in the absence of this public policy measure. Job generation was the
other essential aspect of our fiscal stimulus package. The Government used unprecedented instruments
to support public investment projects enhancing our economic development prospects in sectors such
as energy, transport, irrigation, and urban development in earthquake zones and Gyumry.

12.      Revenue administration and business environment reforms always have been always in
the Government's agenda. The economic crisis further underscored the importance of their
reinvigorated implementation to improve the incentives for private investment in general and for
tradables investment in particular, something that we have also anchored in the DPO program. The
particular measures include (1) reducing costs of business registration, reducing inspections and
discretionary powers, and establishing a one-stop shop; (2) strengthening competitive practices and the
relevant institutions, as well as facilitating customs processing; and (3) bringing the legislation in key
sectors (such as mining and telecom) in compliance with the best international practice.

13.     We also offered a cushion to enterprises with growth potential and contribution to
employment. Qualifying enterprises were offered the opportunity to access budget loans, guarantees,
subsidies, equity participation, and technical assistance. The Government is phasing out these direct
instruments in line with the recovery of economic growth. In fact, as of November 1, 2010, we have
not issued any new direct loans and already 18.2 percent of the loans have been fully or almost fully
recovered.

14.     As a result of implementing the above three sets of measures, our fiscal deficit widened to 7.7
percent of GDP in 2009 and our total debt is expected to reach 48 percent (of the previous year's
GDP) this year. The deficit was financed mainly by foreign sources to avoid drying up domestic
savings. The counter-cyclical fiscal policy pursued by the Government was reinforced by an
expansionary monetary policy that decreased the monetary policy rate and expanded the monetary
base for liquidity. As a result, the Central Bank of Armenia injected sizeable financial resources into
the economy.

15.     The anti-crisis and long-term development policies in Armenia were and will continue to be
implemented in line with Armenia's traditional best public finance management practices. In
particular, all the investments financed with public funds have been reflected in the state budget,
ensuring a high level of accountability and transparency. Non-traditional state support to the private

12.11.2010
                                                   46
sector has been limited and temporary. As a complement to our medium term expenditure and
program budgeting frameworks, we would like to introduce a proper public investment project
appraisal system. The Government has respected the commitments undertaken with the WTO and
other international organizations. In short, specific policy measures required during the crisis have not
compromised our commitment to market-driven reforms.

16.      Our current fiscal and economic policies focus on shifting the anti-crisis policies towards
achieving sustainable economic growth--and the DPO-2 program has been a key instrument for us in
this respect. Since inflation levels this year has been higher than expected, and the pace of growth
slowed down mid-year, our fiscal policy would need to be carefully balanced. We need to avoid
undermining the recovery, but at the same time our fiscal stance should not contribute to an
inflationary environment.

17.      The main target of our anti-crisis economic policy is to achieve sustainable economic growth
by improving business entry and competition in all sectors of our economy, with special attention the
mining sector where we clearly have a comparative advantage. My economic team has also started to
develop additional measures to deepen the diversification in the economy and expand our export
orientation. On this, following a brainstorming session we conducted with the support from the World
Bank, I have tasked the Ministry of Economy to develop an export promotion strategy that should be
part of our SDP for 2011-15. Identification and introduction of additional incentives for achieving
economic growth and steer the economy towards diversification is an important objective, while in
parallel we have continued to implement the already launched reforms and priority development
policies.

                               Macroeconomic and Fiscal Framework

18.     The year 2009 was the first in over fifteen years in which we experienced a deep economic
contraction of -14.2 percent. The results of the first three quarters in 2010 have already indicated a low
annual economic growth of 2.7 percent. Despite the anti-crisis measures, three-to-four years will be
required for bringing the overall level of economic activity back to the 2008 level.

19.     Armenia is projected to grow at around 4 percent annually over the medium term, in part
because construction is unlikely to grow much in the future given the required stock-adjustment. The
existing services and tradable sub-sectors are likely to grow given the decline in 2009, but their
recovery will depend on how fast Europe and Russia recovers. Nevertheless, implementation of our
domestic reform agenda, especially in mining, telecoms, competition, and tax and customs
administration, as well as Government discussions on the deep and comprehensive free trade
agreement (DCFTA) with the European Union should send a strong signal of our will to improve the
investment climate in Armenia. We hope these measures will offset the possible dampening effect of
our ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts.

20.     The main burden of the economic crisis has fallen on the external balance and the fiscal sector.
The transition to a flexible exchange rate policy has allowed a significant mitigation of concerns over
the external balance, but we are closely monitoring the pace of our external adjustment and in
particular the response of our exporting sector to the structural measures we are taking. The external
sector experienced a tremendous rebound at the beginning of 2010 due to the increased global demand
for commodities and the Government's support to the tradable sector as part of the anti-crisis
measures.

21.    Our tax revenue fell dramatically in 2009 against the background of increased risks of poverty
and social tensions--which limited our ability to constrain public spending. As a result, our fiscal

12.11.2010
                                                   47
deficit increased to 7.7 percent of GDP. Our fiscal policy is now solely focused on reducing the state
budget deficit to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2011. The anti-crisis fiscal policies adopted by the
Government led to an increase in the level of total public debt compared to previous years to 39.4
percent of GDP by end-2009. Loans from the WB, IMF, ADB and the Russian Federation account for
the bulk of the debt and were used for both closing the fiscal deficit resulting from the shrinking
revenue and the implementation of highly effective countercyclical programs in infrastructure and
other sectors.

22.     Our external public debt indicators for 2010-2011 will be within the range of indicators of less
indebted and moderately indebted countries. According to our three-year Debt Management Strategy,
the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain below the debt distress threshold of developing
countries over the medium term, but the Government will nonetheless exercise caution in attracting
new debt.

Note: VAT refunds are shown as current expenditure rather than netted out from revenues.



23.     Under these circumstances acceleration of tax and customs policy and administration reforms
is seen as highly important for securing fiscal stability by means of easing compliance for all
enterprises. The Government will continue to improve tax and customs administration, which will
increase the possibilities for identifying new domestic tax revenue. We have also focused on
improving key tax policies, such as the taxation regime for the mining sector and the elimination of
loopholes in excises.

                              Managing Social Risk and Human Development

24.     The priority of the Government social risk mitigation policy in the coming years is to
safeguard the envisaged key social transfers and investments, but we will manage allocations carefully
given the existing tensions in our budget. In the meantime, given the potential increase in social
vulnerability amid the crisis, we plan to increase the number of needy beneficiaries to the extent
possible initially through improved targeting of social transfers and an improved overall efficiency in
our programs. The policies envisaged in this sphere under the Sustainable Development Policy will
remain relevant for the longer term.

25.     Social Safety Nets: Coverage and targeting for our flagship poverty reduction program, the
Family Benefit, and for other social safety net programs such as unemployment insurance and public
works have been the focus of our interventions over the past several years. In particular, during 2009
and in 2010, and with support of the DPO series, the Government has maintained the share of
priority social spending programs in our budget--with emphasis on programs that benefit the

12.11.2010
                                                           48
most the poor and the vulnerable, including safety nets, pensions, and priority health and
education programs. We have also made available in September an additional 6.1 billion AMD
(around 0.2 percent of GDP) to the Family Program and Pensions aiming at offsetting the negative
effect of gas tariff increase we implemented this year. As a result, the priority social spending has been
maintained at a level of around 30 percent of total spending.

26.      We have also focused on strengthening the management and monitoring of social safety net
programs to improve targeting efficiency. The Government issued a protocol decree on June 17,
2010 to establish an inter-agency working group focused exclusively on strengthening the
management and monitoring of social safety net programs to improve targeting efficiency and
increase public awareness. As a result of these efforts, we excluded about 3100 non-deserving
families from our Family Benefits, thus creating possibilities to involve a greater number of those
most affected by the crisis. But our financial resources did not allow us to expand this program
significantly--with an overall reduction in beneficiaries from 121,000 to 114,000 families between
2008 and 2009, and to further 110,000 families this year according to the 2010 budget program (actual
number as of October was 105,500). We would however aim at increase the coverage of the poor in
the family benefit scheme to reach about 40 percent by end of next year. In the medium-term, high
importance will be attached to increasing the efficiency of the Social Security Administration and the
system of monitoring and evaluation of social works. The latter will be improved year by year by
means of establishing social safety management information system and integrated social services
centers in 2011 with support from the World Bank Social Protection Administration Project.

27.      Education: Our focus has been on maintaining funding our basic education programs, on
expanding access to the system for senior preschool children, and on developing ways and approaches
to increase quality and effectiveness of our financing of tertiary education.

28.      On pre-school education, we are committed to implement the goals set in the Strategic
Program for 2008-2015 Reforms in Preschool Education. Towards that end, we established a
financing mechanism for the central Government to cover the recurrent costs of the one-year
school readiness program for 4.5-5.5 year olds. In fact, we have already included 97 mln AMD
(about US 270,000) in the draft law on the budget for 2011 for this purpose--something we had
committed to do only in 2012. For children in this age group and stage of regular development, our
focus is on preparing them for elementary school, creating equal baseline conditions for entering
general education schools, ensuring continuity education, and socializing children into mainstream
society. This is a very important second step (the first step was to start rehabilitating facilities for
villages in greatest need) to implement a policy of gradually enrolling all senior preschool age children
into mandatory preschool education programs. We are targeting a 90 percent enrolment rate by 2015,
and we plan to further institutionalize the proposed financing mechanism in the budget process next
year, to ensure it is systematic and sustainable.

29.     While our main focus has been on basic (primary and secondary) and senior pre-school
education, we have initiated work on ways to improve quality and financing for tertiary education. We
see the improvement of financing mechanisms for vocational and tertiary education as highly
important for the long-term development of education and for the development of our economy. In this
regard, we are working on introducing flexibility and competitiveness to the financing of tertiary
education, and plan to introduce it in 2011/12 by putting in place the legal framework and hopefully
also implementing some pilots. To this end, the Government initiated the preparation and discussion of
draft higher education financing strategy, as well as development of procedures and guidelines for
indicators of standards and quality education.

30.      Health: We plan to increase our low level of spending (currently at around 1.7 percent of
GDP), in parallel with the introduction of measures to improve its efficiency. To this end, our focus is
on ensuring coverage for the poor for the treatment of Non-Communicable Diseases. We are also
studying and piloting ways to improve our cost estimates for basic hospital treatments (currently well
below what people pay at market rates) in coordination with a reform to our co-payment policy. These
are difficult reforms as they affect incentives for health care providers and the rights, or the perceived
rights, of the population.

31.     On Non-Communicable Diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, we hired McKinsey to
help our Ministry of Health carry out an unbiased analysis of the situation, identifying the priority
diseases to be addressed in the short and medium term, which has already been completed. Based on
this, we launched this year a performance-based contracting for hospital and primary health
care level centers for a defined package of non-communicable disease services.

32.      The Government has also completed the preparation of a Copayments Strategy aiming at
increasing hospital service reimbursement, introducing copayments, and achieving a lower overall
cash spending for the poorest households. We have also started to pilot this initiative for a selective set
of treatments in Yerevan.

                       Improved Business Environment and Competitiveness

33.      We have a comprehensive set of measures in this area. Naturally not all of them are directly
supported by the DPO-2, although we are using the DPO as a framework to either enforce or monitor
several initiatives in this area. We have included as prior actions the reforms we consider will have the
greatest impact on our objectives.

34.     Financial Deepening and Banking Sector Monitoring. We are aiming at expanding SME
and household access to credit (both in Yerevan and in marzes), with the WB-supported USD 50-
million project for SME line of credit and through the interstate credit funds provided by Russian
Federation. All these lines are of course channelled through the banking sector, with only a few
exceptions for large companies (ArmRusGazProm, Zangezur Mining, Armenian Molybdenum
Production and the Agarak Copper and Molybdenum Factory that are financed from the funds of
Russian loan). The resulting lending to the real sector amounted to AMD 112 billion. However, we are
phasing out these projects as the economy recovers and Armenia's viable banking sector re-start
serving the needs of the economy from independently generated resources (through increased deposit
base and integration into international financial markets).

35.      These policies were complemented with comprehensive diagnostic of banking sector
vulnerabilities and corresponding recommendations. In this regard our Central Bank is closely
monitoring non-performing loans and taking measures to further strengthen banks' risk management,
contingency planning and crisis management frameworks. As the rapid pace of dollarization is of
concern, our Central Bank has also issued regulations aimed at making foreign exchange denominated
transactions more expensive. In this latter respect, we have imposed higher risk weights for foreign
exchange loans and increased loan-loss provisioning for these as well. Next year, we plan to carry out
an extensive financial sector assessment with support from the IMF and the World Bank.

36.      Competition: We are aware that the strength of competition in product markets is a key
element for our economic performance, and one at which we score very low in international conducted
surveys such as those by the Global Competitiveness Forum. Our aim is to introduce a level playing
field for all firms, and eliminate all possible formal and informal barriers to entry, so that firms in
Armenia start to compete on the merits of its own competitiveness. For this, the strengthening of the

                                                    50
institution for the protection of competition is the key. We want SCPEC, our Competition Agency, to
be able to verify that market agents play by the rules, that the Government agencies or officials do not
impose anti-competitive regulation or unnecessary barriers to entry and expansion, and that firms do
not cartelize and abuse any dominant position. In this regard, we have prepared and submitted to
the National Assembly revisions to competition-related legislation which aims at strengthening
the autonomy and enforcement capacity of the State Committee for Protection of Economic
Competition (SCPEC), and harmonized, to the extent we considered feasible given our country
circumstances, key elements of the legislation with international best practice. The draft law we
have prepared, and that we are aiming to adopting in 2011, defines the definition of dominance and
provides greater enforcement capacities to the SCPEC.

37.      Business Entry and Business Environment: The above efforts would not be effective if at
the same time we do not eliminate our bureaucratically imposed barriers to entry. In this regard, we
are taking considerable steps to reduce the costs of business registration. In January 2010 the
Government approved the Action Plan on Improving Armenia's Business Environment based on the
memorandum of reforms on Doing Business in Armenia, and a number of reforms are being
undertaken as part of it. First, we plan to introduce in the first part of 2011 a one-stop-shop principle
for business registration by the state registration authority in Yerevan City, and then will also improve
the connection for business registration in marzes. With this, we anticipate an increase in the number
of registered businesses and reduced registration costs and time.

38.     But our reforms are much more ambitious. We are also currently aiming at streamlining and
reducing the tax reporting, documentary requirements for import and export, introducing an e-filing of
returns to tax authorities, reducing the documentary requirements and permits for foreign trade and
introducing a green channel by default, amending the Labor Code, introducing an action plan for
electronic procedures for state registration of property rights with the real estate cadastre, circulation
of credit information and improving the activities of credit bureaus, ensuring access to credit funds,
shortening the time of court procedures (initial filing of a lawsuit and reduced time for notification of
defendants from the current average of 40 days to 7), drafting of new legal acts regulating the urban
development sector based on the best practice in the world, developing a corporate governance code
and introducing this culture and reducing the time for bankruptcy procedures.

39.      In this overall set of efforts, we made some progress this year in the area of reforming the
business inspections, by developing methodologies for business inspections in the fire department, the
tax administration and two other pilot bodies, and by drafting a new law on inspections that will
clearly spell out as mandatory requirement the introduction of risk-based approaches for inspections.
We expect to achieve tangible progress in at least the full establishment of the one-stop shop and the
submission to Parliament of the new draft law on business inspections in early 2011 as part of DPO-3.

                                Improved Public Sector Governance

40.      Improved public sector governance is a key Government priority. Reforms in this area will
yield significant fiscal and economic gains related to government revenue and spending efficiency as
well as improved conditions for business and competition. These are highly important resources for
overcoming the crisis and ensuring post-crisis growth. Squarely, our focus is on improving the
legislative base for key sectors of our economy (telecommunications and mining), and to improve the
behaviour of public officials. By increasing transparency and clarifying roles and responsibilities of
the public and the private sector in the fields of telecom and mining, we expect to increase private
investments and jobs in these two key sectors of our economy.

41.     Telecommunications: The telecom sector in Armenia has been improving rapidly after a long
period of stagnation caused by monopoly. So the reform we carried out this year in the areas of
interconnection policies and the management of the spectrum provide further underpinnings to this
agenda. The Government has completed an assessment on the spectrum allocations and usage;
the economic value of public sector spectrum holdings; potential private sector demand; legal,
regulatory, and institutional strengthening; and options to increase efficiency of spectrum use.
Public consultations have been held and the Government has adopted this strategy and an action
plan on October 26, 2010. In addition, the Public Services Regulatory Commission adopted eight
decisions on interconnection policies aiming at clarifying access and associated charges for transaction
between mobile and fixed costs operators.

42.      Mining: Mining regulation, including the taxation regime and procedural matters, are among
the challenges requiring reforms in public sector governance. The activities in this area are focused on
developing and introducing a legal and regulatory framework for mining in line with international
standards. In particular, we have developed and submitted to our National Assembly a new
Mining Code that adheres to best international practice for fiscal, environmental, social and
licensing standards. The draft incorporates our own internal discussions within the Government, as
well as the views of a series of stakeholders including environmental CSOs, and potential and actual
investors. Not all the suggestions that were made were fully incorporated in the Mining Code, as a set
of these are to be addressed by the regulations that the Government will need to enact once the mining
code is adopted, as well as by ancillary legislation. For instance, our CSOs have rightly pointed out
that we do not have a proper Environmental Impact Assessment Legislation, which our Ministry of
Environment will need to develop over the next several months. We also need to prepare and enact,
inter-alia, a government decree to clarify in detail the rates to be applied for the purpose of the
proposed royalty.

43.      We expect a lot from our efforts to reform our mining sector. From the growth and
employment generation perspective, we hope that the improved licensing and taxation regimes--
together with the greater clarity we have offered for in the areas of environmental and social
management, as well as on mining closure--will result in a renewed interest in discovery and
exploitation of metal minerals. From the transparency point of view, we would like the mining
operations adhere to best world practices. In this sense, we would be working on developing an
internal consensus to join the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.

44.     Tax Administration: Drastic reforms in revenue collection require investments in
modernizing our procedures and management. This will take time and with support of DPO-1, our
Revenue Committee adopted a time-bound action plan of priority reforms with key outcome indicators
for 2009-2011. While the initial plan was clearly overambitious in the targets it set for the Revenue
Committee, however the implementation of this plan has been satisfactory.

45.      As a first step under the Action Plan satisfactory progress towards preparing a business
process re-engineering was recorded. The KPMG firm was contracted by the Revenue Committee to
assess the efficiency and effectiveness of our core business processes and a draft report has already
been completed. The Government has also issued a set of protocol decrees on relevant legislative
changes to streamline tax registration, risk-based audit selection, necessary legislative framework, and
have submitted to the National Assembly the amendments to legislation or procedures on the review
of high risk value added tax refund claims. At the same time, we have also successfully introduced e-
filing for enterprises.

46.    We have also made progress towards the functioning of Green-Channel operation in the
customs administration. This should improve the efficiency of goods crossing our borders, and

                                                  52
avoid discriminatory treatment. In this context, the e-signature module is now legally available within
the Trade World Management Software that our institution uses, and a contract is going to be signed
this month with the provider to enhance the green channel by default function.

47.     Public Financial Management: We would like to continue strengthening the PFM system's
basic processes; in particular towards deepening the budget's performance orientation while at the
same time strengthen managerial accountability and revenue management. On this, we have embarked
on public finance management reforms in cooperation and with the support of the WB, EU, GTZ and a
number of other organizations. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report
was prepared and published in 2008 as part of DPO-1, and in September of this year we completed
the preparation of a PFM reform strategy, thoroughly discussed with stakeholders including line
ministries, that was approved by the Government in October 2010. Implementation of this
strategy will be in phases and we have already started to develop a blue print for its implementation
with EU and World Bank support.

48.     Public Investment Appraisal System: During the implementation of our anti-crisis policies,
it became clear that we need mechanisms that help select public investment with the greatest potential
economic and social impact. For this reason our Ministry of Economy, in close collaboration with the
Ministries of Finance and Transport, among others; we developed in 2010 a position paper on a Public
Investment Appraisal System (PIAS). This will be followed the enactment of a regulatory framework
to enabling us to implement our capital budgeting on the basis of sound cost-benefit analysis starting
with new projects that are to be included in 2012 budget.

49.      Public Private Partnerships: Earlier in the pre-crisis period we have declared that it is
necessary to consistently deepen the public-private partnership (PPP). We have several PPPs already
in place, such as for the water company in Yerevan and the Airport, and we are aiming at introducing a
basic framework for PPP that allows up to leverage Government managerial and financial resources in
these and other sectors such as roads. We also need to strengthen our ability to monitor/supervise our
existing PPPs. To this end, our Ministry of Economy is developing a draft PPP Law, which is in final
stage of preparation. While still a priority, these efforts would only be monitored in the DPO
framework but we would not like to set a firm deadline as consultations and a thorough assessment of
what we can really achieve in this area requires certain time period.

50.       Conflict of Interest: Our reforms in the areas of competition, business environment, and the
introduction of a rule of law will be incomplete if we do not develop a proper institutional system to
clarify, investigate and, when appropriate enforce violations of conflicts of interest. Since our nation is
small, individuals often move between private business activities and high-level state positions, either
within Government, Parliament, or the judicial system. While this movement is both natural and
healthy, to assure citizens that it is consistent with the highest ethical principles and to help officials
and former officials manage any potential conflicts of interest that might arise, the Government will,
in accordance with international best practice, establish a system requiring senior officials to publicly
disclose their income, assets, and other economic interests. This system will ensure that those holding
high ranking public positions are held to the highest standards of ethical behavior--a fundamental
principle contained in the Armenian Constitution.

51.     To start addressing these issues, we collaborated closely with Parliament to introduce
amendments to Chapter 6 of the Law on Public Service (which was submitted with support of DPO-1
to the National Assembly, but was and still is subject to consideration and debate within our legislative
power) aiming at addressing issue of Conflict of Interest for high level officials. It is proposed to
create a high-level ethics commission and expand the requirements of the chapter on conflict of



A-119
12.11.2010
                                                    53
interest for high level officials by focusing on high-ranking officials and requirements for posting the
disclosed information on-line.

52.      We have maintained close exchanges among three political parties representing the powers,
which we hope to conclude satisfactorily in 2010. Nonetheless, the proposed ethics-related
amendments to the Law on Public Service touch upon issues on the separation of powers and,
therefore, careful consensus building efforts are of importance. The handling of this issue is
complicated by the fact that vested interests might be affected by the proposed amendments to this
legislation.

53.      Civil Service Compensation Policies: Tackling the economic crisis and fostering a
sustainable recovery would require that we be able to attract and retain the best human capital
available. This will improve communication between the private and the public sector, and through the
channel of improved regulations the Government can foster rather than inhibit the competitiveness of
Armenia's economic system. While the introduction of a competitive remuneration and compensation
policy is a long-term objective--much depending on our fiscal capacity--we decided to provide one
tool in the short-term by drafting a decree on performance­based remuneration for the civil service
that will be enacted once the Law on the Public Sector is approved. Under this legislation, budget
managers in spending units will be able to link compensation to performance based on the results
coming from the existing evaluation system.

                                 Project Monitoring and Evaluation

54.      The Ministry of Finance is the main counterpart for implementation of the DPO series. To
facilitate overall coordination of both policies and the implementation of the Project Preparation
Advance in support of technical assistance, the Management Board was set up by the Prime Minister's
Decree 1078-N dated December 25, 2009, which is chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance in
charge of macroeconomic policies. The Board has met regularly over the past several months since its
establishment and contributes to effective performance monitoring on our overall program, as well as
served as a vehicle to fine-tune our measures. The Government also issued a decree on May 13, 2010
to set a time-table for implementation of the DPO-2 and DPO-3 prior actions with clear responsible
government bodies for each prior action. The Policy Matrix of the project has been updated and
discussed with the Bank during supervision missions. The matrix adopted by Government Decree is
attached below, and the latest matrix of the project is a part of the Project Document.

55.    The Ministry of Finance has also regularly collected key monitoring and evaluation indicators
on the results of reforms planned under DPO-s--some of which comes from the existing SDP
monitoring and evaluation framework.
