On the basis of the selection criteria, the\n            approach to be taken regarding the construction of the sea\n            waterway, would be a hydro-technical development, with\n            specified depths for navigational canals. This in turn will\n            require the construction of a new breakwater system at the\n            entrance to the Piastowski Canal from the Szczecin Lagoon,\n            to improve water flows, and allow natural removal of\n            depressions. Concerning the modernization of the port\n            infrastructure, mitigation measures include stationary\n            monitoring posts, and monitoring ships, to conduct\n            environmental tests regarding land, water, and air\n            pollution. Strict monitoring will control the aquatic\n            environment against degradation, due to effluent flows from\n            land dredging spoil deposits, to be undertaken by the\n            Environmental Protection Inspectorate, and Port Authority.\n            Specialized laboratories in Szczecin will conduct sanitary,\n            and epidemiological tests on water, and bedrock conditions."}, "docdt": "1999-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
