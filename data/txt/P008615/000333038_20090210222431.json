"Ratings for the Szczecin-Swinoujscie\n            Seaway and Port Modernization Project for Poland were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: changing\n            external economic, politic, institutional, legal and social\n            circumstances could end up diluting the relevance of the\n            development objectives, or place them at cross-purposes with\n            real life developments. Turnover of key staff on the\n            Borrower's side, including major stakeholders, can\n            undermine the project's success, and lead to a loss of\n            continuity. If the Bank is going to finance facilities which\n            are intended for public-private partnerships, such as a\n            container terminal, it should try and be certain that the\n            capacity exists in the Government to carry it out. If the\n            capacity does not exist, the Loan should finance technical\n            assistance for that purpose."}, "docdt": "2008-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
