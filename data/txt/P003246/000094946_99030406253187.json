          satisfactory. The key lessons learned are: 1) A satisfactory\n            outcome for a technical assistance project is most likely\n            where policy reform is effectively linked to investment\n            support. 2) The experience of this project underlines the\n            value of flexibility in the development of project component\n            to achieve project objectives. 3) Sector policy and\n            institutional reforms require political commitment, a clear\n            timetable, and a set of realistic and achievable steps in\n            order to be successful as well as to be based on sound, well\n            argued analysis of alternative approaches. 4) The\n            effectiveness of International Development\n            Association's performance was enhanced by the synergies\n            between the preparation and implementation of the project\n            and the development of the Road Maintenance Initiative\n            program in Zambia. 5) Early attention to project management\n            and coordination arrangements in project processing and\n            early remedial action where such arrangements are not\n            performing for whatever reason may lead to considerable\n            benefits in terms of more timely and effective\n            implementation performance."}, "docdt": "1998-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
