objectives.\n            The first is to design and implement transport sector policy\n            reforms, in particular through: (a) a program of regulatory\n            and institutional reform to improve the management of the\n            national road network and to put the financing of roads on a\n            sustainable long-term basis, and (b) enhanced opportunities\n            for private sector participation in the rehabilitation and\n            maintenance of roads.  The second objective is to strengthen\n            the government's capacity to plan and coordinate public\n            expenditures for roads, and to monitor sector performance.\n            The third is to carry out the preparatory engineering work\n            for the first year program of a proposed multi-year Roads\n            Rehabilitation Project (RRP).  The project will finance\n            technical assistance and studies which, taken together,\n            will:  (a) provide the elements required for creating a\n            sustainable, efficient system for managing roads; and (b)\n            prepare the first year of the proposed RRP.  The project\n            contains the following components:  policy support; project\n            preparation; and institutional development."}, "docdt": "1993-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
