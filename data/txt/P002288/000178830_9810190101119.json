For analyzing the Engineering\n            Project's experience, the following points are\n            highlighted in the PCR: through the Engineering Project, the\n            Bank assisted the Senegalese Government in its negotiations\n            with the private sponsors on the conditions of their\n            participation in the dry dock project aiming at an equitable\n            sharing of risks and benefits between the Government and the\n            foreign sponsors The Bank's experience in the subsector\n            of maintenance and repair of very large ships was limited,\n            but sufficient to select and supervise experienced and\n            competent consultants for execution of the studies deemed\n            necessary to establish the feasibility of the dry dock\n            project and to reduce the risks foreseen in its\n            implementation and operation During the execution of the\n            studies, several, developments took place in the\n            international large vessel sector, which reduced the chances\n            for the commercial viability of the proposed dry dock\n            project. Those developments had already been identified as\n            potential risks during the Balk's appraisal. The\n            Bank's views did not prevent, however, the Government\n            from pursuing the idea of building some ship repair\n            facilities and from ordering a 60,000 dwt floating dock."}, "docdt": "1982-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
