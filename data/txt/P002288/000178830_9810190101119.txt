PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL - DAKARMARINE ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN S 3-SE)
PREFACE
This report covers the Dakarmarine Engineering Project sup-
ported by Loan S 3-SE. The Engineering Loan of US$0.6 million was
approved in September 1973. US$0.49 million of the Loan (82%) was
disbursed by the first quarter of 1976, three quarters behind schedule
and the balance was cancelled.
The loan was made to Dakarmarine, a joint venture company
between the Government and several local and foreign private companies
interested in the shiprepair business. The Engineering Project con-
sisted of several studies to assess the feasibility of a dry dock
project for repair of large vessels proposed by the Senegalese Govern-
ment. The proposed dry dock project was not considered feasible as
a result of these studies.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the
Industry Department of the Bank on the basis of information from Project
files, from the Bank's staff involved, from co-lenders, and from the
Borrower. Subsequently, comments on the draft report, received from
the Borrower have been taken into account in finalizing the report.
The Senegalese Government and/or Dakarmarine approached the
Bank and IFC in 1977, 1978 and 1979, requesting them to consider
alternative proposals of dry dock and floating dock projects. However,
after further studies none of these projects was considered sufficiently
economic to warrant further Bank group support. The government finally
decided to go ahead with a smaller size floating dock with the assistance
of bilateral aid.
Comments from Government institutions on the draft report are
attached as Annex 3.
This report has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL - DAKARMARINE ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN S 3-SE)
HIGHLIGHTS
In the Fall of 1971 the Bank was approached by the Senegalese
Government to participate in the financing of a dry dock project for
ship repair which could comprise: (1) construction of dry docks for
repairing ships up to 500,000 dwt; (2) construction of the breakwater,
two repair berths and ancillary buildings; (3) dredging of the required
basin and entrance channel. The project was estimated to cost US$100
million in 1973 terms. The Bank perceived substantial risks in the
project, as proposed, and recommended further studies to establish its
feasibility with the dry dock project to be considered in a second phase
based on satisfactory results of these studies (paras. 1.01, 1.02, 1.05
and 1.06).
The Project under review was an Engineering Project to study
the feasibility of the proposed dry dock project and consisted of three
categories of studies: (a) technical studies, to determine: the
geological, physical and environmental soundness of the proposed site
and layout and the optimal scope and size of dry docks which would be
technically feasible as a basis for developing sound capital cost
estimates; (b) market and economic studies, to develop financial and
economic forecasts for the dry dock project based on the supply-demand
situation in the shiprepair industry and to establish its financial and
economic feasibility; and (c) manpower and training studies, to determine
the need for personnel as well as the required qualifications for
management and operating personnel for the proposed dry dock project
(para. 3.04).
Implementation of the studies under the Dakarmarine Engineering
Project was satisfactory, mainly as a result of the relatively stable
and experienced management of Dakarmarine assisted by the technical
sponsor, Beliard Murdock (paras. 2.03 and 3.09). The total cost of the
studies (including Dakarmarine's operating expenditure with respect to
supervision and coordination of the studies) was US$2.52 million, 18%
below appraisal estimates, due to cancellation of some components in the
technical studies, i.e., design work and preparation of tender documents
(para. 3.10); the cancellation resulted from the conclusion by the Bank
that the proposed dry dock project was not economically or financially
viable. The Government never fully accepted the Bank's views and con-
tinued studying alternative proposals, some of which were subsequently
discussed with the Bank and IFC. One of these eventually led to the
decision by Senegal to order a 60,000 dwt floating dock supplied and
financed under bilateral assistance and operating since 18 months.



- iv -
The Bank loan was disbursed to an amount of US$0.49 million,
of which US$0.40 million was to finance the studies and US$0.09 million
to finance the interest on Bank loan during the implementation (paras.
3.12-3.13). The Engineering Project was completed about six months
behind schedule, due to a substantial change in the shiprepair market
which required the carrying out of additional market and economic
studies (para. 3.08).
For analyzing the Engineering Project's experience, the
following points are highlighted in the PCR:
- Through the Engineering Project, the Bank assisted the
Senegalese Government in its negotiations with the private
sponsors on the conditions of their participation in the
proposed dry dock project aiming at an equitable sharing
of risks and benefits between the Government and the
foreign sponsors (paras. 3.01 and 3.02).
- The Bank's experience in the subsector of maintenance and
repair of very large ships was limited, but sufficient to
select and supervise experienced and competent consultants
for execution of the studies deemed necessary to establish
the feasibility of the dry dock project and to reduce the
risks foreseen in its implementation and operation (paras.
1.03, 2.04, 3.01, 3.05 and 3.06).
- During the execution of the studies, several,developments
took place in the international large vessel sector, which
reduced the chances for the commercial viability of the
proposed dry dock project (paras. 4.01-4.03). Those devel-
opments had already been identified as potential risks
during the Balk's appraisal.   By recommending mui:e de,ailed
studies prior to investing in a large capital intensive
project, the Bank prevented Senegal from launching an
industrial venture which would have resulted in serious
financial and economic consequences for Senegal. The Bank's
views did not prevent, however, the Government from pursuing
the idea of building some shiprepair facilities and from
ordering a 60,000 dwt floating dock (paras. 5.01-5.03 and
6.04)



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL - DAKARMARINE ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN S 3-SE)
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01    For the purpose of this project completion report, we need to
distinguish between two projects: (i) the Engineering Project, which refers to
the execution of the studies required to establish the feasibility of a dry
dock project proposed by the Government of Senegal and is the object of this
completion report; and (ii) the dry dock project for ship repair, which was
proposed to comprise: (a) construction of two dry docks, one for repairing
ships up to 300,000 dwt and another for ships up to 500,000 dwt; (b)
construction of the breakwater and two repair berths; (c) the dredging of the
required basin and entrance channel; and (d) necessary buildings. The Bank
provided a loan of US$0.6 million for the Engineering Project.
1.02    The dry dock project, then estimated to cost US$100 million in 1973
terms, was one of the main industrial projects considered by the Senegalese
Government in the early 1970's. In the fall of 1971 the Government of Senegal
approached several financial institutions to consider financial assistance for
the project and asked the Bank to take the lead in this respect. At the same
time, the Bank was presented with a similar project by the Malagasy
Government. The Senegalese project was to be located in Dakar, 15 km East of
the Dakar port, with existing small ship repair facilities, while the Malagasy
project was to be placed into Narinda Bay, an undeveloped area in the
Northwest of Madagascar.
1.03    During the spring and summer of 1972, Bank staff carried out an inten-
sive study, assisted by two marine consulting firms, Shipping Consultants of
Oslo, which conducted a market survey and Shipping Research Services, also of
Oslo, which looked into the technical and operational aspects of the two dry
dock projects. The findings of the study suggested that (i) a high risk was
associated with this type of project, and (ii) if both projects were to
proceed at the same time, each would create market difficulties for the
other. Dakar was in a better position because: it had technical sponsors,
Beliard Murdoch I/ and SCAC, 2/ who were committed to the project; it had an
excellent geographic location with some experience in shiprepair business; and
some of the on-shore industrial and social infrastructure was already
available. Upon completion of the preappraisal of both projects in September
1972 it was therefore decided to consider only the Dakar project.
1.04    Under the proposed dry dock project, a Government financed infra-
structure company would construct and own the dry docks, breakwater and other
infrastructure, and lease these facilities to a second superstructure company,
to be owned and financed largely by the private partners and experienced ship
repair firms who would be responsible for providing the superstructure
(cranes, equipment, wareho'ses) and for operation of the dry docks. The Bank
1/   A private Belgian group owning five shipyards in Belgium and France, who
was seeking to set up a center for the repair of supertankers and ore
carriers. The existing facilities of the group could only accomodate
tankers/carriers up to 300,000 DWT.
2/   Societe Commerciale d'Affretement et de Combustibles, a French private
company, owner of a small shipyard at Dakar, who had similar interests to
Beliard Murdoch.



- 2 -
considered this enclave character of the project as highly risky for the
Government, unless appropriate arrangements were made to share the project's
risks between the two companies.
1.05    The Bank also foresaw a high degree of market-, technical, and
resulting financial risk for the Dakar dry dock project. The market risk
combined with uncertain technical conditions 3/, which could substantially
increase capital costs, and possible problems with productivity, could
jeopardize the project's viability. Failure of such a large investment would
represent a serious burden for the Senegalese economy.
1.06    The Bank recommended phasing of the project.     The initial phase would
comprise required studies as well as minor investments to be made almost
immediately in order to rehabilitate and expand the existing small ship repair
facilities.   The Bank would assist in financing the required studies.    The
performance of the existing facilities would demonstrate the ability of
Dakar to build up clientele for ship maintenance and repair, and would enable
prospective investors to see whether the existing yard could build up a good
reputation. Only after completion of the studies, a decision would be made on
whether to proceed. The next phase would involve execution of the large dry
dock project, after the required studies would have (i) demonstrated its
market potential, (ii) provided detailed capital cost estimates, and (iii)
established the project's feasibility; and after new financial arrangements,
acceptable to the Bank, had been negotiated.
II. DAKARMARINE 4/ - THE COMPANY
A. Ownership
2.01    Dakarmarine was founded by the Government of Senegal, in 1971, to
carry out the pre-feasibility studies for and to promote the dry dock
project. Originally, the Company was established with a capital of CFAF 100
million (US$0.44 million) of which 90% was provided by the Government of
Senegal, 5% by Beliard Murdoch and the remaining 5% by SCAC. Practically all
of the original capital was used for pre-feasibility study work undertaken
prior to the Bank's involvement.
2.02    To participate in the financing of the required studies proposed by
the Bank, Dakarmarine increased its share capital to CFAF 210 million (US$0.9
million). The Senegalese Government provided CFAF 16 million (US$0.07 million)
of the capital increase, with the balance taken up by Beliard Murdoch, SCAC,
SENEMATEL (a subsidiary of a French industrial group), FINCANTIERI (a subsi-
diary of the Italian group IRI), A.G. Weser (a German shipbuilding and repair
facility and subsidiary of a German industrial group), two Senegalese Banks
(Union Senegalaise de Banque and the Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et
l'Industrie au Senegal) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). As a result,
the Government's shareholding decreased to about 51%.

Subsequently, EIB transferred its share of the equity to the Government as a
grant. The shareholding structure of Dakarmarine at inception, at appraisal,
and subsequently is shown in the following table.

B. Organization and Management
2.03    Until the Bank's Engineering Loan was made, Dakarmarine had little
operating staff. Its Chairman and Chief Executive was Mr. Issa Diop, a
Senegalese with extensive administrative experience and the head of several
Senegalese corporations. The technical director responsible for project
promotion and execution of the studies, was Mr. Dinechin, a dynamic expatriate
engineer who had been associated with the project since its inception.      Under
the financing plan for the Engineering Project, funds were included for the
employment of two engineers, a financial and accounting officer, and the
necessary secretarial and accounting staff, as well as for offices and
communication facilities required for coordination of the studies.
C. Technical and Financial Support
2.04    The original feasibility report presented to the Bank in November 1971
was prepared by Beliard Murdoch and its consultants. The Bank suggested that
it was essential that the dry dock project included sound technical and
commercial assistance to ensure a full service capability competitive with the
European yards, which was deemed to be critical. Beliard Murdoch, the
technical advisor and main sponsor, was capable of providing technical
assistance and operating the dry dock project. Further, the Bank proposed to
Dakarmarine that it also associate itself with other financial or industrial
firms who would be able to help provide the financial resources needed for the



- 4 -
ultimate realization of the dry dock project.    This prompted participation of
the above mentioned firms in the company's shareholdings (para 2.02).
III. DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENGINEERING PROJECT
A. Background
3.01    In Spring 1973, following the Bank's proposal to the Senegalese
Government for a phased approach (para 1.06), the Bank held meetings with the
Government, private sponsors and co-lenders such as FAC, EIB and Fond Europeen
de Developpement (FED). The Bank decided to participate in financing the
studies because of its leadership in organizing and supervising earlier
technical work, its objective of ensuring the quality of the studies, as well
as its desire to help secure more equitable risks-and-rewards sharing
arrangements between the Government and the private partners. Preliminary
agreement was reached on the estimated cost of the necessary studies (U.S.
$3.09 million equivalent), the scope and terms of reference for the
Engineering Project, the financing plan (including guaranteed reimbursement)
and the disbursement arrangements. These arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations which took place in Washington from August 6 to 10, 1973. The
following points were agreed:
(i)    A Bank loan of US$600,000 would be provided to Dakarmarine for
partial financing of the studies;
(ii)   Beliard Murdoch would guarantee, jointly and severally with the
Government of Senegal, for repayment of the Bank loan, in case
the dry dock repair project did not go forward;
(iii)  Equitable financial arrangements between the Government and the
sponsors on the dry dock project were necessary including
provision of a significant share of the capital by private
sponsors; and
(iv)   Arrangements for adequate technical backing by private sponsors
would be worked out.
3.02    It was also agreed, prior to negotiations, that the existing
shiprepair facilities at Dakar would be expanded and improved to serve ships
up to 30,000 dwt and be operated during the study execution to build
experienced manpower, a client base and a good reputation. The success of
this expansion and operation was to be a condition for Bank participation in
the financing of the large dry dock project.
B. Objectives, Scope and Description
3.03    The objectives of the studies were to:
(i)    assess the market for ship repair in order to reduce the market
risk through the formulation of an appropriate scope for the
ship repair facilities to be built in Dakar;



- 5 -
(ii)   provide technical and design information, such as exact
location, type of foundation, size of dry dock and scope of
necessary maritime infrastructure leading to a reliable
capital cost estimate for the ship repair facilities;
(iii)  establish the feasibility of the dry dock project, based on (i)
and (ii) above; and
(iv)   suggest more equitable arrangements to share the risk and
rewards between the infrastructure and superstructure
companies.
Through this Engineering Project, the Bank would have an opportunity to assist
the Government in its negotiations with the private sponsors on the conditions
for their participation, technical assistance and operations of the proposed
ship repair facilities.
3.04    The studies were divided into three components:
(i)    Technical Studies included drillings and ultrasound tests
necessary to investigate the geological and physical
characteristics of the soil to determine the possible site,
layout and dimensions of the dry dock, repair yard and
breakwater. These studies also included the preliminary design
of the docks and yard, based on the optimal scope and size of
dry docks resulting from the economic study. Detailed cost
estimates were to be calculated on the basis of the selected
project scope;
(ii)   Market and Economic Studies included a survey of the world
fleet of large vessels and demand for repair facilities, a
forecast of the evolution of the world fleet and traiffic likely
to pass the West African region to determine the likely demand
for services at the proposed dry dock as well as an
investigation of actual and planned dock capacity to determine
the supply of competitive services. Based on the above,
financial and economic forecasts were to be developed for the
dry dock project; and
(iii)  Manpower Development and Training Requirement Studies included
determination of the requirements for management and
operational personnel as well as the required qualifications.
Technical assistance for management and coordination of these studies was
provided by Beliard Murdoch throughout the execution of the Project.
C. Use and Performance of Consultants
3.05    The procedures followed for the selection of consultants were
acceptable to the Bank.5/ The main consultant for the technical studies was
J.C. DeWeger International, B.V., of Holland, who also coordinated and
5/   At that time there were no published guidelines on the use of
Consultants.



- 6 -
supervised other engineering firms (drilling, hydrographic studies) and
prepared the preliminary design of the layout and structure of the ship repair
facilities. Drillings were carried out by INTRAFOR-COFOR of France in
association with a Senegalese company SASIF (Societe Africine de Sondage,
Injections et Forages). Hydrographic studies were carried out by Delft
Hydraulic Laboratory (DHL) of Holland, acting as a subcontractor to DeWeger.
DHL covered the mathematical and physical models to determine the most
effective location of the dry dock and the shape of the breakwater.
3.06    The main consultant in the market and economic studies was SEMA of
France, which also coordinated the work of Lloyds Shipping Company of England
and Shipping Consultants of Norway. Lloyds investigated frequency and
duration of vessels staying for maintenance and repair, including frequency of
vessel accidents and resulting repair requirements. Shipping Consultants
prepared the forecast for the evolution of the World Fleet and the
corresponding traffic relevant to Dakar. Input of information from one
consultant to another about the optimum size and number of dock and quay
facilities based on the market situation was not produced in time and resulted
in a delay of one month of the report on yard layout, preliminary drawings and
the detailed cost estimates. Investigations on the necessary training and
recruitment for the management and operating personnels of the ship repair
project were done by EUREQUIP of France, under the supervision and
coordination of SEMA.
3.07    The technical studies were satisfactory and established that the soil
conditions at the selected site were suitable for the construction of a dry
dock. The Bank considered the conclusions of the market and economic reports
to be optimistic; the impact on the dry dock project's viability of (i) the
possibility of the widening and reopening of the Suez Canal, (ii) the
constructions of new dry dock projects in several parts of the world, notably
in OPEC countries, and (iii) most importantly, the low growth in oil con-
sumption with the resulting stagnation of the world tanker fleet, was
considered underestimated. The training and recruitment studies were
judged to be satisfactory in their content.
D. Implementation of Engineering Project
3.08    Drilling at the proposed site was started as early as June 1973 based
on a contract between Dakarmarine and INTRAFOR-COFOR and SASIF, signed in July
1973, prior to the presentation of the Bank loan to the Board. The Bank
agreed to financing initial payments of up to US$25,000 under the contract
retroactively. The technical studies were completed by DeWeger within
schedule and submitted to the Bank in September 1974, whereas the market and
economic studies were submitted in April 1975, six months behind schedule due
to requests for additional information in the light of a changing market
situation. This also delayed the final submission of the manpower and training
studies which were combined with the market studies in a single report.      The
realized schedule, as compared to appraisal projections, is shown in the
following table. Recruitment of staff under the Engineering Project (para
2.03) proceeded satisfactorily.

3.09    Beliard Murdoch was effective in its role as Project promotor,
coordinator and the firm providing technical assistance and facilitated
Project implementation. It was responsible for relations with the co-lenders
and was effective in gaining their approvals etc. expeditiously.
E. Project Cost, Financing and Disbursement
Project Cost
3.10    The total financing required for the Project was estimated at CFAF 710
million (US$3.09 million) including: (i) an estimated cost of the studies of
CFAF 540 million (US$2.36 million), (ii) CFAF 75 million (US$0.31 million) for
local expenses of the studies and operating cost of Dakarmarine to coordinate
the studies and (iii) a provision of CFAF 95 million (US$0.42 million) for
price escalation and contingencies. The actual costs of the studies amounted
to CFAF 475 million (US$2.07 million) or about 75% of the original estimate,
including contingencies. Co-lenders had concluded based on the studies and
their own assessment that the dry dock project was not financially and
economically viable and therefore there was no need to go ahead with design
and tender document preparation included in the original scope of the
Engineering Project. This resulted in a cost underrun in the technical
studies. The actual cost of the economic studies was higher than the
appraisal estimate due to the additional work done in response to the changing
market condition. The detailed Project costs are shown in Annex 1 and
summarized in the following table.

expenses. The appraised and actual financing plan are contrasted below:

and 21 million CFAF (US$0.09 million) of interest charges during the two years
of implementation.

Disbursement
3.13    Disbursement was arranged based on an agreed "lenders protocol",
whereby all lenders received evidence of expenditure from Dakarmarine. US$.49
million of the Bank's loan was disbursed and $.II million cancelled. The
first disbursement was one quarter behind the appraisal schedule, due to
delayed effectiveness, and the last disbursement of US$.08 million was made in
the first quarter of 1976 or about two quarters behind schedule, mainly due to
the delay in the execution of the economic study. The disbursement schedule
for the Bank loan is shown in Annex 2.
3.14    The closing date of the loan was extended by 18 months, from the
originally agreed date of March 6, 1976 to September 6, 1977, mainly because
the Senegalese Government was still considering a reformulated ship repair
project and reappraising the ship repair market (para 5.01).
IV. MARKET FOR SHIP MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR-FACILITIES
4.01    Demand:   Dakarmarine's dry dock project was originally aimed at the
construction of two dry docks for repair and maintenance of large oil tankers
and ore carriers of 100,000 dwt and up to 300,000 dwt (VLC's), with a
capability of handling vessels up to 500,000 dwt. During 1968-1973, the
growth of the vessels with capacity between 100,000 - 300,000 dwt had been
rapid, with over 200 VLC's in use in 1973. During the time of appraisal, the
growth of these large vessels was projected to continue to be high leading to
an estimated 600 VLC's in service in 1975. However, a stagnation in world oil
consumption and imports as a result of drastic fuel price increases starting
in late 1973, the reopening and widening of the Suez Canal in 1975, and the
construction of the SUMED pipeline in Egypt in the mid 1970s led to a
stagnation and even a partial mothballing of VLC fleets. Moreover, new
technology in tanker repair and maintenance also contributed further to
drastically reducing the demand for repair facilities. Because of these
developments, and the corresponding reduction in demand for ship repair
facilities, co-lenders asked Dakarmarine in Spring 1975 to investigate the
possibility of seeking a "captive" market, i.e. of obtaining firm assurance
(contracts) from oil producing countries to send their fleets to Dakar for
repair. This measure was intended to reduce the substantially increased
market risk; without it the dry dock project was perceived to be unacceptably
risky.
4.02    Supply:   A report on "Repairing and Dry Docking Large Carriers" by
Drewry 6/, of July 1974, suggested that a potential over-supply in dry dock
facilities would result if only 12 of the 30 large carrier repair docks,
planned at that time, materialized. At the same time, some OPEC countries who
had been approached by Senegal to consider investing in the proposed dry dock
project and commit repair of their tanker fleets to the Dakarmarine project
were starting ship repair projects of their own, i.e. in Dubai, Bahrain and
Iran, and therefore showed no interest. Japanese yard owners, because of
empty order books, converted existing yards for VLC construction to repair
facilities. Moreover, Dakar would have to compete against yards in Europe and
Japan which had definite advantages over Dakar through the ready availability

- 10 -
of repair materials, the ease of obtaining sophisticated parts, the
availability of highly qualified labor forces and an established reputation
for expertise, reliability and speed.
4.03    Demand-Supply Balance:     The residual demand for dry docking
facilities, which had been projected mainly based on the fast growing demand
of VLC's had turned out to be non-existent: on the contrary, the stagnant
number of VLC's coupled with several new dry dock facilities to meet the
earlier optimistic forecast had created an oversupply situation in the repair
market.
V. NEW PROJECT CONCEPT IN LIGHT OF MARKET DECLINE
5.01    In spite of the developing oversupply situation in repair facilities
for VLC's, the Senegalese Government continued to consider a VLC repair
project.7/ In late 1977, the President of Senegal requested the Bank to
evaluate a reappraisal of the ship repair market and to consider another
project concept, considerably scaled down and reformulated in response to a
revised market study. The Government also requested the Bank to finance
the final engineering studies necessary for the new scaled-down project. The
market study prepared by A & P Appledore, a shipping consultant of England
(published in August 1977 and presented to the Bank in April 1978), had been
financed by the Senegalese Government and suggested existence of demand for
ship repair facilities in the Dakar region, capable of receiving ships up to
60,000 dwt. The project cost for the shipyard itself, its docks and its
equipment was estimated at US$60 million in 1977 prices, the rate of return at
around 15-20%. The project was proposed to be implemented in two phases: a
floating dock capable of taking ships up to around 30,000 dwt in the first
phase, followed by a 60,000 dwt dock in the second phase.
5.02    Since the financial viability of the project would still hinge on the
establishment of a sufficient market share, the Bank was in favor of first
establishing Dakarmarine's ability as a competitive ship repairer in Dakar's
existing facilities. The Bank again recommended a phased approach. The first
phase would be upgrading and expanding the existing facilities, serving ships
up to 30,000 dwt and establishing training programs for marketing management
and technical operation of the project. The acquisition of a facility to
handle vessels exceeding the capacity of the existing dry dock, was suggested
to go ahead only in a second phase when the operations were proven to be
efficient and financially viable and the future market was assured.
5.03    Nevertheless, the Senegalese Government went ahead with the order of a
60,000 dwt floating dock assisted by a bilateral aid program. The dock, was
installed in the port of Dakar in 1980, and- began operation on March 18,
1981. At this point, it would be difficult to make a fair judgment on its
performance since the project has been in operation for not even two years.
7/ Several alternative project scopes were considered by Dakarmarine and its
consultants subsequently, but none of them was considered feasible by the
colenders.

VI. BANK ROLE AND CONCLUSIONS
6.01    The Engineering Loan for this Project was the Bank's first involvement
in the large scale ship repair subsector. The Bank obtained significant
inputs of know-how early on by making use of experienced consultants in the
field, such as Shipping Consultants of Oslo (Norway) and Shipping Research
Institute (Norway). This enabled the Bank subsequently to take a decisive
lead in project preparation, coordination of lenders, the identification of
some equity partners and the selection of consultants.
6.02    The Bank played a very valuable role in the preparation of the
project. It recommended strongly that the large dry dock project, although
potentially viable, might face very serious risks which would have to be
reduced to acceptable levels before the dry dock project could be supported.
It prompted the participation of several industrial and financial institutions
in Dakarmarine's equity. It also motivated the development and acceptance of
an equitable formula for sharing risks and benefits between foreign project
sponsors and the Senegalese Government. The Bank had foreseen the potential
risks of the proposed dry dock project. Since Beliard Murdoch, the private
sponsor, was to guarantee repayment of the Bank's engineering credit (para
3.01), in case the project would not materialize, legal documents stipulated
that Beliard Murdoch was to be liable for debt service as a primary obligor
jointly and severally with the Government and Dakarmarine. When the foreseen
ship repair project, in fact, did not materialize, Dakarmarine was billed by
the Bank for repayment of the credit with copies to all guarantors (Government
and Beliard Murdoch) as per usual procedure; the Government/Dakarmarine are
repaying the Bank loan.
6.03    During the execution of studies for the dry dock project, several
developments took place in the international large vessel sector which reduced
chances for the commercial viability of the proposed dry dock project below
acceptable limits. It was precisely those developments, which had already
been identified as potential risks for the project as part of the Bank's
appraisal.   Thus, through its recommendation of proceeding with detailed
market, engineering, financial, and economic studies prior to a full
commitment to the large capital intensive project, the Bank prevented Senegal
from launching an industrial venture which would have resulted in serious
financial and economic consequences. Through brief but relatively frequent
supervision missions the Bank was able to maintain an effective dialogue with
the Government and Dakarmarine.
6.04     In the subsequent dialogue with the Government on potential ship
repair facilities in Dakar, the Bank did point repeatedly to the oversupply in
the ship repair market for vessel sizes above 30,000 dwt, and proposed instead
that Senegal concentrate on the rehabilitation and improvement of the existing
repair facilities in the port of Dakar for vessels up to 30,000 tons which
would enable the service and repair, predominantly of local and coastal
vessels. However, the Bank's proposal was not accepted; the Government
proceeded with the investment in a floating dock installation for vessels up
to 60,000 dwt (para 5.03).

BORROWER'S COMMENTS
A. Translation of technical part of Mr. D. Diallo's 1/ letter of October 1, 1982
(1) The new draft that we have carefully reviewed does not call for any
particular comment from our part. However, we would like to provide an
additional information which would clarify the EEC's role in the financing of
the study of the dry dock project.
(2) The role of EEC in this project has been two fold:
(2a) EIB bought FCFA 30,000,000 of shares under the condition that
if the project was not implemented, the government would buy the EIB's shares
back. Hence, Senegalese Government became shareholder since the initial
project was abandoned.
(2b) EIB also invested FCFA 188,865,956 in risk capital expecting
the results of the dry dock study to define the final purpose of these funds
(consolidated capital or subsidy).
After the Senegalese Government decided to change the project scope, the
EEC decided to transfer the above amount to the government as a subsidy
included in the 5th EDF.
B. Translation of the telex of the Minister of Industrial and Manual trade
Development - signed Cheik Hamidou Kane
Following your letter dated August 11, 1982 I inform you that I
