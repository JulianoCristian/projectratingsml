appropriate protection against set-off, seizure and attachment.
2.
After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that 
a Special Account has been opened, withdrawals from the Credit Account of 
amounts to be deposited into said Special Account shall be made as 
follows:
(a)
until the Association shall have received:  (i) the first 
Project Management Report of the Federation and Republika Srpska referred 
to in Section 3.02(b) of the Federation Project Agreement and the 
Republika Srpska Project Agreement, respectively, and (ii) a request from 
the Borrower for withdrawal on the basis of Project Management Reports,

this Schedule 1; and
(b)
(i) upon receipt by the Association of a Project Management

shall reasonably request, furnish to the Association such documents and 
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for 
Eligible Expenditures.
4.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Part II.2 of this Schedule, the 
Association shall not be required to make further deposits into any

(a)
if the Association determines at any time that any Project 
Management Report does not adequately provide the information required 
pursuant to Section 3.02 of the Federation Project Agreement or Republika 
Srpska Project Agreement;
(b)
if the Association determines at any time that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Credit 
Account; or
(c)
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the 
Association within the period of time specified in Section 3.01(b)(ii) of 
the Federation Project Agreement or Republika Srpska Project Agreement, 
any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the Association 
pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of: (A) the records and 
accounts for any Special Account; or (B) the records and accounts 
reflecting expenditures with respect to which withdrawals were made on 
the basis of Project Management Reports.
5.
The Association shall not be required to make further deposits into 
any Special Account in accordance with the provisions of Part II.2 of 
Page  13
this Schedule if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the 
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the 
Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account pursuant to Section 
6.02 of the General Conditions. Upon such notification, the Association 
shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether further deposits into 
said Special Account may be made and what procedures should be followed 
for making such deposits, and shall notify the Borrower of its 
determination.
6.
(a)
If the Association determines at any time that any payment 
out of any Special Account was made for an expenditure which is not an 
Eligible Expenditure, or was not justified by the evidence furnished to 
the Association, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Association, provide such additional evidence as the Association may 
request, or deposit into said Special Account (or, if the Association 
shall so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment.  Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, no 
further deposit by the Association into said Special Account shall be 
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit 
or refund, as the case may be.
(b)
If the Association determines at any time that any amount 
outstanding in any Special Account will not be required to cover payments 
for Eligible Expenditures during the six (6) month period following such 
determination, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Association, refund to the Association such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund to 
the Association all or any portion of the funds on deposit in a Special 
Account.
(d)
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to sub-paragraphs 
(a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph 6 shall be credited to the Credit 
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with 
the provisions of this Agreement.

follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of said Special Account’s Authorized 
Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the Association a request or 
requests for deposit into said Special Account of an amount or amounts 
which in the aggregate do not exceed said Authorized Allocation.  On the 
basis of each such request, the Association shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into said Special 
Account such amount as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
For replenishment of said Special Account, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Association requests for deposits into said Special 
Account at such intervals as the Association shall specify.  Prior to or 
at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Association the documents and other evidence required pursuant to 
paragraph 4 of this Agreement for the payment of payments in respect of 
which replenishment is requested.  On the basis of each such request, the 
Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit 
Account and deposit into said Special Account such amount as the Borrower 
shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said documents and 
other evidence to have been paid out of said Special Account for Eligible 
Expenditures.  Each such deposit into said Special Account shall be 
withdrawn by the Association from the Credit Account under the Eligible 
Categories.
3.
The Association shall not be required to make further deposits into 
a Special Account, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit 
allocated to said Special Account minus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association pursuant 
to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions in respect of expenditures to 
be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit allocated to the Eligible 
Categories, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation.  Thereafter, withdrawals from the Credit Account 
of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Credit shall follow such 
procedures as the Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that 
the Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining 
on deposit in said Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for Eligible Expenditures.
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Accounts, 
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Association shall reasonable 
request, furnish to the Association such documents and other evidence 
showing that such payment was made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
ANNEX B to SCHEDULE 1

Except as the Association may otherwise specify by notice to the

Account under one or more of said Special Account’s Eligible Categories.
