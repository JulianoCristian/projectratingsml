The lessons\n            learned indicate that continuous updating of database system\n            on job brokerage and labor market information is critical\n            for success. Effective orientation and counseling is\n            necessary before soldiers are discharged. Being demand\n            driven, PELRP had the flexibility to respond to the\n            individual needs and interests of ex-soldiers which shows\n            that employment services tailored to the individual needs of\n            the unemployed in a demand-driven scheme is an effective way\n            to provide these services. In projects of this nature which\n            provide employment services, it is important to set aside\n            adequate time for these programs to work effectively because\n            job seekers who were employed with public organizations\n            previously find it hard to build trust towards employers in\n            the private sector. Development of capacity of the private\n            sector to provide timely and quality inputs including\n            technical assistance to clients in agriculture and in\n            business was a key to successful support in self employment.\n            Enthusiastic and interested extension agents and/or\n            counselors were pivotal to the success of the project. In an\n            emergency situation, 100 percent financing by the Bank (no\n            counterpart financing) may be desirable."}, "docdt": "2005-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
