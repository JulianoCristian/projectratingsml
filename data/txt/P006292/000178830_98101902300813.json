  transport services in five metropolitan areas: Belo\n            Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Recife and Salvador,\n            giving special emphasis to the provision of public transport\n            to the urban poor. It would include traffic engineering\n            measures to improve circulation in central areas;\n            introduction of exclusive bus lanes; traffic operations\n            programs to improve capacity and safety (TOPICS) to\n            alleviate critical congestion points; widening or\n            construction of missing links in the urban road networks;\n            reorganization and construction of bus terminals; and paving\n            of bus routes in low-income areas. The project would also\n            include an extensive technical assistance program for the\n            sector. Seventy-three percent of the investments in\n            Curitiba, Rectife and Salvador would directly benefit people\n            with per capita incomes below one-third the national average\n            and sixty-seven percent in Porto Alegre. A similar\n            percentage is expected to apply to the investments in Belo Horizonte."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
