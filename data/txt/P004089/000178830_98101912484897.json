Apart from direct imports, the\n            proceeds of the loan would be utilized by CNB to finance the\n            foreign exchange components of domestically produced capital\n            goods (estimated at 60%). In order to ensure access of the\n            smallest firms to Bank funds and to encourage a broader\n            dispersal of the Bank funds outside the Seoul metropolitan\n            area, it is intended that: (a) at least $15 million of the\n            proceeds of the proposed loan be used to make subloans to\n            firms employing no more than 50 workers or with total assets\n            not exceeding W 250 million; and (b) at least $15 million of\n            the proceeds of the proposed loan be used to finance\n            projects located outside of the city limits of Seoul. The\n            maximum size of individual subloans would be limited to\n            $400,000. The proposed loan would assist CNB in its efforts\n            to support the Government's policy of increasing the\n            regional dispersal of employment opprtunities and of\n            deepening the industrial structure."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
