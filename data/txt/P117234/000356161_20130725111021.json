to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: Performance Assessment\n            Frameworks (PAFs) must be driven by clearly specified policy\n            and institutional reforms ensuring that outcome indicators\n            are linked to concrete actions rather than vague\n            aspirational goals. Political-economy constraints should be\n            evaluated in terms of the risk they pose to the continuity\n            of the reform process. Implementation-capacity constraints\n            must be identified in order to guide the provision of\n            technical assistance. Meeting these challenges will require\n            an adequately designed and targeted program of technical\n            assistance, in the short run, coupled with sustained\n            capacity-building support over the long run."}, "docdt": "2013-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
