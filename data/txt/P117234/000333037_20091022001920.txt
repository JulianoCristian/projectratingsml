Operation type    Programmatic (first operation in a series o f three). Single tranche to be disbursed
                  from the Credit upon effectiveness.
Main Policy       The proposed PRSC series i s designed to assist the Government o f Mozambique
Areas             (GoM) to implement key policy actions outlined in i t s 2006-2010 Second Action
                  Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA 11). In particular,
                  the PRSC series supports a strategic subset o f objectives from the PARPA I1
                  results matrix focusing on improving public financial management systems and
                  adopting growth enhancing reforms to increase private investment. Within this
                  context, the PRSC-6 i s expected to help the G o M in: (a) the consolidation and
                  deepening o f the institutional reforms in the area o f the budget process, the
                  quality o f public financial management systems, the transparency and efficiency
                  o f the State procurement system, and the coverage and effectiveness o f external
                  audit; and (b) economic development by removing constraints to growth, notably
                  b y reducing structural constraints to financial intermediation.
K e y Outcome     Public financial manapement systems:
Indicators        Average diflerence over the past 3 years between primary expenditure outturn
                  compared to originally budgeted primary expenditures: Baseline 2007: 4.5%;

                  Baseline 2007: 85%; Target 2010: 95%
                  Growth enhancing reforms to increase private investment:
                  Credit to the economy as % o GDP: Baseline 2007: 14.8%; Target 2010: 22.5%

                  2007: 6.2%: Target 2010: 7%
Program           In line with the government PARPA-11, and as reflected in the FY08-11 Country
Development       Partnership Strategy (CPS), the program supported by the PRSC series
Objectives and    recognizes the importance o f strengthening economic governance systems, and
Contribution to   the centrality o f the new growth agenda to accelerate private sector development.
CAS               Specifically the PRSC series will support achievement o f the following CPS
                  outcomes: (#1) improved budget planning at central, district and municipal level;
                  (#2) improved government fiduciary systems; (#lo) simplify procedures to start a
                  business; (#11) increased access to finance and support for SMEs.

             (P072080); Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (P086169);
             Competitiveness and Private Sector DeveloDment Project (P106355).
Risks        A first set o f risks i s concerned with the potential for macroeconomic instability,
             due to the financial crisis, and the upcoming political elections in 2009. The
             impact o f the financial crisis on the Balance o f Payments (BOP) and the fiscal
             accounts remains uncertain and could be more severe than currently anticipated.
             In this respect the Bank i s proposing to increase the level o f budget support to
             contribute to assist the govenunent to maintain the planned level o f budgeted
             expenditures, without having to resort to large domestic borrowing. An additional
             set o f risks arises from the Parliamentary and Presidential elections which are
             scheduled in October 2009. The G o M will need to resist pressures for additional
             spending that are not sustainable, and prevent a reduction in the level o f revenues
             collection. The Bank team will continue to monitor the macroeconomic policy
             framework and i t s adequacy for the provision o f budget support.
             A second set o f risks concerns a possible slowdown in implementing the reforms
             program in the context o f the upcoming elections, especially in light o f the weak
             administrative capacity. While the program o f reforms has proceeded regularly
             in recent months, the transition period might imply a slowdown o f the pace o f
             reforms, particularly in land taxation and business environment. In order to
             mitigate this risk, the Bank team will increase its engagement to support the
             preparation o f the technical underpinnings required to implement the reforms.
             A third set o f risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could compromise
             economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. Progress in public sector
             governance has been mixed. The Joint Review in April 2009 noted the need to
             accelerate reforms in the legal and judiciary fronts, including in implementing the
             anti-corruption strategy and introducing (and enforcing) legislation to eliminate
             conflict o f interest for public officials. Questions are also related to the capacity
             for selection, negotiation and monitoring o f the projects and investments, in order
             to explore the opportunities o f the country's natural resources. For instance, the
             government i s in the process of negotiating three power mega-projects (coal, gas
             and hydro) with combinations o f foreign f i r m s and local partners, and it i s
             important to ensure the maximization o f the benefits for the country. A possible
             deterioration in governance could have negative effects on economic growth and

                   PROGRAM DOCUMENT
                 FOR A PROPOSED CREDIT
             TO THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
     FOR A SIXTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                                   I INTRODUCTION
1.       This Program Document proposes a Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC-6) to the Republic of Mozambique for a Credit in the amount of SDR69.5
million (USD110 million equivalent). The proposed Credit i s an integral part of the
Bank's strategy to support the implementation o f Mozambique's "Second Action Plan for
the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty"' (known as PARPA I1 by i t s Portuguese acronym),
aided b y the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the government and
the nineteen external partners (the G19)2 providing general budget support (GBS). While
the PRSC operations will provide financial support for implementing the whole PARPA,
they are to be disbursed against the upfront completion of a number o f specific reform
measures identified in the PAF. The proposed operation i s the first in a new PRSC series
o f three annual single-tranche operations to be delivered over FY10-12. The design and
objectives o f the PRSC series are elaborated in this Program Document, with a focus on
the prior actions for this operation (PRSC-6). This Program Document also provides an
indication o f the triggers for the subsequent two operations in the PRSC series.

2.        Mozambique's economic performance for the past decade has been very
strong and the government has been implementing an active program of structural
reforms. Following political stabilization and market-oriented reforms, and steady
improvements in infrastructure, the economy has registered an average annual growth
rate o f 8 percent between 1996 and 2008, and incomes have risen considerably. There i s
a very strong momentum for continuing the reforms program and striving to reach even
higher growth rates. However, the international financial crisis has clouded the economic
outlook. Fewer public and private resources are now available to finance investments
and economic growth i s expected to slow down substantially in 2009 and 2010. In this
context, this new PRSC series focuses o n the top two priorities for the Government of
Mozambique, namely improving the efficiency in the use o f i t s scarce resources and
boosting private sector investment and economic growth. Boosting economic growth i s
also widely expected to be at the core o f the next PRSP (to be prepared in mid-2010), and
t h i s PRSC series w i l l provide a transition from the old to the new PRSP, with a more
growth-oriented focus.

covered the period 2006-2009, but was subsequently extended to include 2010 in order to avoid a gap
before the next government i s able to prepare the next PRSP document, which i s expected in mid-2010.

3.      The PRSC series i s a key component of the Country Partnership Strategy
approved by the Board in M a y 2007, and closely aligned to the government
program. Bank support to the PARPA I1 i s through the FY08-11 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS; Report No. 39395-Moz). As government policies and budget are the key
instruments for implementing the PARPA, the Bank i s committed to supporting and
aligning with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario o f the CPS envisages
programmatic support through consecutive PRSCs, with a focus on supporting
Mozambique's efforts in increasing accountability and public voice and fostering
sustainable and broad-based growth. In line with the government program, and as
reflected in the CPS, the program supported b y the PRSC series recognizes-tlie centrality
o f the growth agenda and the importance o f enhanced public financial management
reforms.

poverty measured by the latest household survey. I addition to the reduction in
poverty, other social indicators have also shown significant improvements since the mid-
1990s (Table 1):

         In primary education (grades 1-7), the number of children more than tripled from
         approximately 1.3 million in 1992 to 4.2 million in 2008. Net enrollment rate at
         primary education doubled from 45 percent in 1998 to over 96 percent in 2008.
         Net enrollment of girls rose from 40 percent to 93 percent in the same period.
         Primary school teachers increased from 30,000 in 1992 to 73,900 in 2008.
         The gross enrolment rate in lower secondary education (ES1) increased from 4.8
         percent in 1998 to 28 percent in 2008. Net enrollment rate grew from 1 percent to
         9 percent during the same period. The gross enrolment rate for upper secondary
         school (ES2) increased from 1.3 percent in 2008 to reach 8 percent in 2008.
         Under-5 mortality rates decreased from 212 per 1,000 live births in 1996, to 178
         in 2003, and reached 138 in 2008.
         Infant mortality decreased from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1996, to 122 in 2003,
         and further down to 93 in 2008.
         Maternal mortality was reduced from an estimated 1,000 per 100,000 live births
         in the early 1990s to 408 per 100,000 live births in 2003, and to 340 in 2007.
         The share of the population with access to an improved water source increased
         from 39 percent in 1995 to 48 percent in 2008.
         The capacity of the health system was expanded to start providing free ARV
         treatment for HIV infection.

        Mozambique has made substantial progress towards achieving the poverty
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Assuming that the trend between 1997 and
2003 has continued, Mozambique would be on-track to halve the population living in
absolute poverty by 2015. As mentioned, reducing hunger and child malnutrition
remains a challenge. The MDG for sustainable coverage for water supply could also be
met, given the rapid improvements in the provision of urban water supply, although
significant progress i s needed to increase access to water in rural areas. There has also


  The 2007 poverty assessment suggests that poverty and inequality may actually have increased in recent
years, based o n the analysis o f the agricultural panel survey data (TIA 2002-2005), but highlights that this
preliminary result may also be related to the impact o f the drought in 2005. I f confiimed, this result would
indicate that the rapid GDP growth in recent years has been less broadly shared than during the past decade.
The recent dramatic spike in world agricultural and fuel prices may also have contributed to set back at
least some o f the gains achieved during the past decade. The last national household survey (IAF) was
completed in 2003. Data collection for the new national household survey has just been completed in
September 2009 and the main results are expected in early 2010.

primary education, gender equality and women's empowerment, reducing child mortality,
and improving maternal health. Nevertheless, more progress w i l l be required to meet
these MDGs, while combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases remains a serious
challenge. A detailed discussion o f progress towards each MDG i s included in Box 1

8.      Despite the promising progress, significant challenges remain. The country
remains poor (USD454 per capita income in 2008, using the Atlas methodology), social
indicators are low, infrastructure i s inadequate, and the business environment remains
unfriendly. Adult literacy rates are l o w (approximately 47 percent), and life expectancy at
birth remains very low (42 years). Despite economic growth, malnutrition has worsened
in Mozambique from 2003 to 2008 with the percentage o f chronically malnourished
children (stunted) increasing from 44 percent to 48 percent. The country also relies
heavily on foreign aid, which makes up about half o f i t s overall budget. Additionally, the
impact o f HIV/AIDS and malaria on the population has serious consequences. Malaria
alone accounts for 35 percent o f deaths among children below five years o f age, 60
percent o f admissions in pediatric wards, and 40 percent o f overall outpatient
consultations. I t has been found that in Sub-Saharan Africa, malaria reduces GDP
growth by an estimated average o f 1.3 percent per year. As for HIV/AIDS, current
projections indicate that in 2010 the Mozambican economy will be 14-20 percent smaller
than it would otherwise be due to the impact o f HIV/AIDSa4

9.       Constraints to private sector development and trade remain substantial, and
more progress i s required to improve the business environment. Mozambique's
ranking in the 2010 Ease of Doing Business was 135* out o f 183 countries, reflecting the
numerous challenges facing the private sector in Mozambique. Mozambique i s ranked
l l O * out o f 150 countries o n the 2007 Trade Logistics Performance Index. I t s weakest
indicators are quality o f transport and IT infrastructures. Mozambique i s 126* (out of

project) even if not in this series o f budget support operations.

Mozambique surpasses the SSA and l o w income group averages on all six aspects o f the
index (voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory

country's secondary school (28 percent in 2008) and tertiary (1.1 percent in 2008)
enrollment rates are only a fraction o f the comparators' countries.

been made in improving transparency and accountability b y strengthening Public
                                               GOALS
BOX 1: PROGRESS TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUMDEVELOPMENT

Mozambique is likely to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 (Goal 1). The poverty headcount
ratio declined from 69 percent in 1996/97 to 54 percent 2002/03. Taking into account demographic growth
over the period covered b y the two surveys, the number o f people who were lifted out o f poverty i s
estimated at 3.7 million. Assuming that the current trend would continue, Mozambique i s expected to halve
the population living in absolute poverty from an estimated 80 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2015.
Mozambique should be able to achieve universalprimary education by 2015 (Goal 2). Good progress has
been made in the last few years; the enrolment rate in 1'' grade increased to 95 percent in 2007 from 69
percent in 2003 (net enrolment in all grades o f EP1 more than doubled from 45 to 96 during 1998 to 2008)
and the completion rate increased from 39 percent in 2003 to 73 percent in 2007. A major achievement'is
the increase in the net enrollment rate at 6 years o f age which was 19 percent in 1998 and reached 73
percent in 2008. Nevertheless, efforts have to continue to increase enrolment and completion rates, as well
as removing gender disparities, and increasing the quality o f primary education.
Mozambique remains stable with respect to gender equality and empowering women (Goal 3). Gender
indicators at all levels o f education have improved, particularly in EP1 and the gender difference in net
enrollment ratio was reduced to only 4 percentage points. Net enrollment o f girls rose from 40 percent to 93
percent during 1998 to 2008.a~a result the girls to boys ratio in EP1 increased from 86 percent in 2003 to 90
percent in 2007. Nevertheless, significant gender gaps remain at the upper o f primary education (EP2) and
secondary education. More progress remains to be made also in women's involvement in the productive
sectors and in positions o f authority.
Substantial progress has been made towards reducing child mortalio and good progress has been made
in increasing immunization rates (Goal 4). Both infant mortality and the under-five mortality rates have
declined substantially since the turn o f the century and immunization rates have had a steady increase over
the past years. Under-5 mortality rate decreed from 178 per thousand in 2000 to 138 per thousand in 2008.
Nevertheless Mozambique i s very unlikely to meet this MDG goal b y 2015.
Good progress has been made in improving maternal health (Goal S), nevertheless Mozambique i s
unlikely to meet t h i s MDG goal by 2015. Maternal mortality has decreased from an estimated 1,000 per
100,000 live births in the early 1990s to 408 per 100,000 live births in 2003 and further to 340 in 2007. The
number o f attended births has increased slightly, however Mozambique continues to have one o f the worst
performances in the region for these targets.
There has been little progress in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (Goal 6). The 2007
epidemiological data suggest that the HIV/AIDS prevalence rates remain very high, particularly among
young girls, affecting 16 percent o f the population and o f which universe, 58 percent are women. Although
following a previous period o f increasing prevalence rates the average adult prevalence rates may have
remained stable at around 16 percent since 2003, some provinces have reached very high levels, with up to
38 percent o f pregnant women being seropositive in some districts. Despite improvements in setting up the
infrastructure needed for outreach and treatment, and in securing financial resources, only limited progress
has been made in reducing risky behaviors. There has been some progress in increasing the proportion o f
population using effective malaria prevention. Mozambique w i l l almost certainly not meet this M D G by
2015.
Finally, the MDG for water is expected to be met in urban areas, although little progress has been made
in increasing access to clean water in rural areas, and in ensuring environmental sustainability (Goal 7).
The share o f people with access to safe drinking water in urban areas has increased significantly and the
MDG for sustainable coverage i s expected to be met for urban water supply (to reach 70 percent). However
little progress has been made in increasing access to clean water in rural areas, In environmental
management, however, more remains to be done as government actions are ad-hoc and not well coordinated
among different actors.

Financial Management systems, including in procurement and in internal and external
audit. Also there has been progress towards improving the management o f natural
resources, notably b y strengthening the legal framework regulating the fiscal regimes for
mining and petroleum in 2007. I addition, in M a y 2009 Mozambique was accepted as a
                                 n
candidate to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). Progress however
remains limited in the Justice Sector and in Anti-Corruption, such that improvements in
the efficiency and transparency o f the justice system remain elusive, and corruption and
conflict-of-interest remain central issues. Also, despite some recent progress,
implementation of the public sector reforms program remains slow.

B. RECENT
        ECONOMIC        IN MOZAMBIQUE
               DEVELOPMENTS

11.    Mozambique's economic growth continues to be strong, but the structure of
the economy remains narrow. In line with the good performance o f the past 15 years,
Mozambique's GDP growth was 6.8 percent in 2008, slightly below the 7.4 percent
achieved in 2007 (Table 2). The rapid economic growth continues to be made possible
b y overall macroeconomic stability, policy reforms and continuing strong donor support,
permitting broad-based expansion across most sectors o f the economy, and mega-project
investments (Box 2). As discussed below, the macroeconomic policy framework remains
adequate for budget support and the authorities' policy stance i s satisfactory and
sustainable over the medium term. Nevertheless, the productive base o f the economy
remains narrowly focused on subsistence agriculture and a few isolated mega-projects?
Agriculture, which employs about 78 percent of the economically active population,
accounted for 23 percent o f GDP in 2008. I t was followed b y the manufacturing industry
at 13 percent (mostly accounted for by one large aluminum smelter), trade and retail
services at 11 percent, and transport and communications also at 11 percent. The
contribution o f the remaining sectors was between 5 percent (financial services) and 1
percent (extractive industries).

12.     The Balance of Payments in 2008 was only slightly worse than previously
envisaged, as stronger capital flows largely offset the deterioration in the current
accounL6 The current account worsened because o f a deteriorated trade balance and
larger income outflows. After improving substantially from 11 percent in 2005 to 7.9
percent o f GDP in 2006, led by an acceleration in exports (both mega-projects and other
exports), the trade deficit worsened to 8.4 percent in 2007, and 11.6 percent in 2008,
mainly as a result o f the increase in the price of o i l and grains (Table 3).




  The role o f megaprojects should not be overestimated however. Sonne-Schmidt, Amdt, and Magaua
(2008) developed a methodology to evaluate the direct contribution o f three key operational megaprojects
(Mozal, Sasol, and Moma) to growth in GDP at factor cost. The authors conclude that the direct effects of
these megaprojects were to raise the average annual growth rate between 1996 and 2006 by approximately
 1 percentage point. This i s not a particularly large number given that the average annual growth rate was
approximately 8 percent.

2006
Growth accounting exercises indicate that physical investments partly associated with megaprojects and
significant improvements in levels of education led to a growth dynamics heavily influenced by the
accumulation of the factors of production: labor (quality-adjusted) and capital between 1993 and 2006. The
graphs show average capital contribution to growth strengthening from 1999 onward, a result consistent with
the timing of megaprojects. Aggregate productivity growth (total factor productivity)-measured as the
residual of output growth after labor and capital contributions are subtracted-also was influential. The
graphs below show a roughly balanced growth between inputs and productivity. Productivity increases
contributed about a third to overall growth between 1993 and 2006.
The positive total factor productivity reflects the reshuffling of labor resources and a rapid 'transformation in
                                         n
the output structure of the economy. I a post-war context-where reconstruction efforts, a f i r s t wave of
structural reforms, and a stabilized macroeconomic environment spurred private sector activity-the
Mozambican economy has posted double-digit growth rates in mining, manufacturing, construction,
electricity, gas and water. Sectoral output shares have experienced substantial changes between 1993 and
2006, especially in agriculture, which nearly halved its output participation over the period-despite positive
contributions o f agriculture to overall economic growth. I t ultimately reflects a deep transformation of
output to more productive sectors that generated positive composition effects in aggregate productivity.
Going forward, a key challenge i s not only to support the continuation of such intersectoral (structural)
transformations but to ensure within-sector productivity gains by addressing impediments to microeconomic
efficiency

USDl million. Overall Mozambique's exports increased significantly (in real terms) in

fact, more than half o f
Mozambique's exports remain

aluminum smeltering operation
which employs no more than
1,100 Mozambican nationals (Figure 2). For there to be a virtuous circle o f increased
incomes generating private savings for investment, Mozambican exports need to be
further diversified, into traditional commodities with secure market access and non-
traditional commodities which have higher value-added content, preferably taking full
advantage o f the relatively cheap labor.

14.       Prudent monetary and exchange rate policies have brought price stability
and lower interest rates. Since 2007 policy i s determined at the monthly meeting o f the
Monetary Policy Committee, which i s a policy coordination forum; public press releases
are issued following each meeting to publicize i t s assessments and policy decisions.
Average annual inflation, which had accelerated from 8.2 percent in 2007 to 10.3 percent
in 2008 on account o f the rising international food and oil prices, decreased rapidly in
recent months. The 12-month average inflation f e l l to 6.1 percent in July 2009, and year-
on-year inflation dropped to 2.4 percent. Core inflation (excluding food and energy)
decreased steadily from 5.1 percent in 2007 to reach 2.4 percent by July 2009. Monetary
policy continues to be prudent, and aims to keep core inflation in single digits. Reacting
to a downward adjustment in Treasury bill yields and softening inflation, in 2009 the
Bank o f Mozambique (BM) reduced interest rates on i t s lending and deposit standing
facilities from 14.5 to 11.5 percent and from 10.25 to 3.0 percent, re~pectively.~ light

o f the rapid reduction in the 12-month inflation rate, however, the real interest rate for
Treasury bills has increased in recent months from approximately 6 percent in December
2008 to approximately 9 percent in July 2009.

comfortable level, although recent analysis suggests that the currency may be
overvalued. As a result of strong exports, higher aid inflows, and 'a tighter monetary

rate moved from 25.6 in July 2007, to 24.0 MT per USD in July 2008, and 26.7 MT at

first six months o f 2009. The Central Bank intervened heavily in the markets to smooth
the rate o f depreciation versus the U dollar in late 2008 and the initial months of 2009,

16.    Fiscal performance has been conducive to economic growth and the medium-
term fiscal strategy objective is to make room for private sector credit by avoiding
recourse to domestic financing. In fact the government has made large domestic debt
repayments every year since 2003 (except in 2007 largely because o f the need to fill the
gap resulting from shortfalls in external aid due to donor administrative delays).8


*The deficit before grants i s estimated at 13.1 percent in 2007 and increased to 16.5 percent in 2008 mainly
due to increases in donor-financed investment expenditures. Deficit after grants was 3.8 percent in 2007
and 2.2 percent in 2008. Mozambique has had consistent domestic current primary surpluses over the past

Maintaining the positive trend of the past few years, fiscal performance remained strong
in 2008 (Table 4). Revenue collections in 2008 were higher than in 2007 (and 0.2 percent
of GDP higher than foreca~t).~ Domestically financed expenditures were in line with the
budget in 2008, but externally financed expenditures were significantly below their
budgeted level. The share of expenditures to priority sectors was 64.5 percent in 2008,
which i s just below the 65 percent PARPA I1 target; however, this i s largely due to the
                                                                             n
lower than anticipated externally financed investment in priority sectors. I line with
these trends, the domestic current primary surplus was 0.5 percent of GDP higher than
programmed in 2008 (under the IMF PSI).

BOX 3:   GOVERNMENT                       I H R
                  POLICY RESPONSE TO THE HG E FOOD FUEL
                                                 AND  PRICES IN 2008

The combined effect of the food and fuel price increases created severe hardships for the Mozambican
population. In February 2008 riots erupted in Maputo and two provinces following an attempted increase in
urban transport fares. Simulations of the impact of the combined impact of the food and fuel price rises
indicated that an additional 800,000 people could have been pushed below the poverty line, raising the poverty
headcount by 4 percentage points to 58 percent. The impact was expected to be especially severe in urban areas
where the poverty rate was expected to increase by 8 percentage points. Most of the negative impact was
concentrated in the south region, particularly in Maputo, which i s a net consumer of food, and heavily
dependent on imported rice and wheat.
The government acted to mitigate the impact of internal and external shocks with a rapid and flexible policy
response. In June 2008 the government approved a policy response package which included the temporary
lifting of taxes on diesel and kerosene, a series of measures to stimulate agricultural production, and the
implementation of the already planned expansion of social mitigation measures to protect the most vulnerable.
The government temporarily removed the import duties and V A T on diesel and import duties on kerosene (from
June 2008 until the end of 2008). The removal of these taxes aimed to mitigate the impact of the higher diesel
prices on the productive economic activities (notably the fisheries and transport sectors), by offsetting the
increase in world prices at a cost of 0.4 percent of GDP. Gasoline did not benefit from temporary tax exemption,
and its price was raised in June 2008 to reflect the higher international prices.
The government opted for a sustainable response that builds on the agricultural potential of Mozambique (being
a fertile land abundant country), that i s to help increase agriculture production in the short and medium term
starting from the 2008/09 production season. In this context, in June 2008 the government approved the Action
Plan to Increase Food Production (Plano de A c ~ l o     Para a Produpio de Alimentos), which articulates an
aggressive push to increase agricultural production over the 3-year period 2008-2011, and i s intended to reduce
Mozambique's future vulnerability to increases in food prices. Implementation o f the Action Plan started in late
2008 through a mid-year budget reallocation, and will be implemented more fully in the next three years with
the support of significant increases in the budget for agriculture. The Food Production Action Plan envisages an
increase in expenditures of 0.5 percent of GDP for the rest of 2008, and additional expenditures of
approximately 2 percent of GDP each in 2009 and 2010.
To assist the poorest households to cope with the increases in the cost of living, in February 2008 the
government introduced a subsidy to urban transport, in the form of monthly lump-sum compensation to
registered-and-tax-complianturban transport private operators (minivans, buses), in exchange for keeping fares
                                                                 n
constant in spite o f higher fuel prices. The subsidy (which i s i effect a lump-sum transfer to the urban transport
industry) i s targeted in as far as the users of urban transport (minivans and buses) are mainly the poorest 80
percent of the population, and i s expected to have cost 0.15 percent of GDP in 2008. As fuel prices have now
returned to lower levels, the subsidy has in effect ceased to exist. I addition, in late 2007 the government had
                                                                       n
already approved an expansion in Mozambique's main social protection program, the Food Subsidy Program
(Programa de Subsidios de Alimentos, PSA), which provides direct cash transfers to eligible beneficiaries. The
number of PSA beneficiaries was increased by 20 percent (to 130,000 households) and the amount of the
monthly cash transfer was increased by around 50 percent.
The fiscal measures that the government adopted to minimize the impact of diesel and kerosene price increases
in the domestic economy were designed to be neutral on the budget financing requirements (Le. matched by
equivalent expenditure savings in other areas), and did not affect government borrowing. However, additional
funding was necessary to meet the needs for the Action Plan for Food Production. To fund the implementation
of the Food Production Action Plan, the government reallocated a significant amount of its budget resources
towards the agricultural sector in mid-2008, and decided to substantially increase its allocation to the
agricultural sector for the next 3 years, as reflected in its Medium Term Expenditure Framework 2009-2011
(Cena'rio Fiscal de Mkdio Prazo 2009-2011), which was approved in September 2008. The Bank provided
USDlO million in additional budget support from the GFRP Trust Fund to assist finance the government'sFood
Production Action Plan in 2008, and also increased the level of budget support in 2009 by a further USDlO
million from the I D A allocation.

17.      Credit to the private sector has been growing faster than GDP growth,
consistent with the government fiscal policy, and in parallel with improvements in
the soundness, depth and profitability of the Mozambique financial system. The
Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) in February 2009 found that the soundness of the
banking sector has improved substantially in recent years." The financial system has
deepened since the banking system was restructured. Sound financial policies and
cleaned-up balance sheets have restored confidence in the banking sector." Greater
confidence in the banking system has also led to a significant decrease in liability
dollarization and thus less financial vulnerability.12 Credit to the private sector has been
growing rapidly, at 29 percent in 2006, 17 percent in 2007 and at 46 percent in 2008, and
i s projected to continue to expand at 28 percent in 2009.

18.     Public and private investments continue to grow. Public investment remained
stable at 11.8 percent o f GDP in 2006, 11.7 percent in 2007, and 11.6 percent in 2008.
Private investments increased only slightly from 5.8 percent o f GDP in 2006, to 6.2
percent o f GDP in 2007, and 6.9 percent in 2008. Foreign investments accelerated
substantially from USD153 million in 2006 to USD428 miIlion in 2007, and USD587 in
2008 (approximately 50 percent in extractive industries, 15 percent in transport and
communications, 15 percent in agriculture, and 15 percent in manufacturing).

19.     The government skillfully managed the response to the global food and fuel
prices hikes in 2008 focusing on promoting agricultural production, while also
taking immediate action to protect the vulnerable population from the impact of the
                n
price shocks. I 2008, the government allowed the pass through o f international prices
o f food and fuel to the domestic economy, notably staying away from generalized
subsidies or avoiding the introduction o f measures which create trade distortions, while
protecting the economic sectors most vulnerable to the increase in energy prices (see Box
3). The impact o f higher o i l and food prices on inflation and the exchange rate was
successfully mitigated by easing monetary policy, and allowing limited adjustments to
foreign reserves. The government's fiscal plans were also revised in June 2008 to
introduce measures to mitigate the social impact o f the higher prices, including a
temporary scaling up o f social protection measures, and measures to support the
productive sectors o f the economy. The government faced a difficult tradeoff to finance
these measures. The additional fiscal cost in 2008 o f the response measures approved by
the government i s estimated to have amounted to approximately 1.3 percent o f GDP (or
                     n
USD120 million). I order to finance the measures in 2008, the government realized
expenditure savings from non-release o f 10 percent o f the, budget for recurrent
expenditures in selected programs and the domestically financed investment
expenditures, but protecting expenditures in PARPA priority sectors and programs. The

lo The FSA also noted that i t s vulnerability to the financial crisis i s limited. Exposure to risk through direct
financial linkages i s generally low. The only possible exception i s the risk o f financial contagion from
banks' exposure to parents which, while currently limited, cannot be entirely ruled out.
l1 The share o f non-performing loans fell from 14.4 percent in 2003 to 2.9 percent in 2008. The banking
sector's average capital adequacy ratio improved was to 17.8 percent in 2008, and the sector remains very
liquid, with liquid assets to total assets at 54.5 percent in 2008.
l2 Prudential measures led to a sharp decline in foreign currency-denominated loans from 71 percent o f
total loans in 2003 to 32 percent in 2008.

government also increased domestic borrowing, and sought additional financing from
development partners, notably the World Bank.

20.     This policy response i s quite at odds with the recent decision in August 2009
not to allow a pass-through of higher fuel prices to consumers and the implied
attendant subsidies to fuel companies. The fiscal costs o f this policy decision could
amount to some 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2009, or higher depending on the movement in the
international oil prices. In addition, such a policy response i s not targeted to the most
vulnerable. The authorities have suggested that this short t e r m measure i s intended to
prevent any social unrest, and it would be reviewed in December 2009 with a view to
gradually resume the use o f the automatic price-transmission formula.



C. ECONOMIC
         OUTLOOK FOR 2009-2011

21.      While the medium-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive, it has
been clouded substantially a a result of the financial crisis.13 Mozambique has so far
                                s
not been seriously affected by the global financial crisis. The dramatic drop in the price
o f aluminum (which accounts for 70 percent o f Mozambi ue's exports) i s expected to be
mitigated b y lower dividend payments by megaprojects.'% Similarly, while the financial
crisis will negatively affect the level o f foreign direct investment, the impact i s expected
to be mitigated by the start o f the construction o f two large coal mines in the Tete
region.15 Nevertheless, the severe impact o f the economic crisis on the South African
economy i s expected to negatively impact the Mozambican economy. The Mozambique
Economic Climate Index decreased for the fourth consecutive month in March 2009,
reflecting a steady drop in business confidence. Following discussions with the IMF in
April 2009, therefore, in consideration o f the significant uncertainty related to the impact

l3 The short-term macroeconomic outlook also faces risks from the upcoming elections period. The
Parliamentary and Presidential elections in Mozambique are scheduled for October 2009 (this follows the
municipal elections which ran smoothly in November 2008). Approaching the national elections, the
government w i l l need to resist pressures for additional spending that are not sustainable, and prevent a
reduction in the level o f revenues collection (as happened in 2004).
l4 The aluminum smelter Mozal provides about half o f Mozambique's export receipts and 70 percent o f the
manufacturing sector's output. Mozal's production and sales volumes in the first quarter o f 2009 remained
comparable with levels in 2008, despite the plunge in global demand and prices for aluminum. The market
for Mozal's high quality aluminum has suffered less from the global downturn than the rest o f the
aluminum market. Moreover, the high fixed costs typical o f the industry are conducive to smoothing output
in response to short-term fluctuations in market conditions, and the parent company, BHP Billiton, has
opted to maintain Mozal's production levels. Nevertheless, as sales receipts have plunged, Mozal has cut
o erating costs substantially, especially spending on local expenditures and employment.
`Work     i s moving rapidly to open two major coal mines in Tete, which i s believed one o f the largest
untapped reserves o f coking coal in the world. Government signed a contract with the Australian
Riversdale Mining to allow them to open a mine in Benga, Moatize district. Production should start in 2011
and the mine i s expected to produce 6 million tons o f coking coal and 4 million tons o f thermal coal per
year for 25 years. In March the Brazilian Vale mining company (formerly CVRD) started the construction
o f its mine in Moatize, which i s expected to produce 8.5 million tons o f coking coal and 2 million tons of
thermal coal, and also open in early 20 11. Approximately 700 houses are already under construction for
families who will be displaced b y the mine. The combined investment b y the two companies i s expected to
be over $2 billion during 2009-2010 (even though a large share w i l l be for imports o f capital goods).


                                                   - 14-
of the global financial crisis on Mozambique, the government agreed to take a prudent
approach and anticipate significant reductions in exports, foreign direct investment, and
aid flows (which finance over 50 percent o f the budget). Hence the IMF's projected GDP
growth has been revised down to 4.3 percent for 2009, which i s 3.5 percentage points
below the average for the past five years.

22.         The Balance of Payments (BOP) i s projected to deteriorate by nearly
US$400 million between 2008 and 2009, a the trade deficit widens, foreign direct
                                                 s
investment contracts, and foreign borrowing by the private sector is curtailed. As
mentioned above, Mozambique's trade deficit was 11.6 percent in 2008 and i s projected
to increase to 19.3 percent in 2009. Export receipts are expected to fall b y about USD900
million primarily reflecting a halving in the price o f aluminum, which accounted for more
than half o f export receipts in 2008, and lower traditional exports such as cotton and
cashews. International prices o f key commodities exports, except for sugar, came down
significantly compared to the average prices in 2008 (aluminum by 45 percent; natural
gas by 45 percent; cotton by 18 percent; shrimps by 8 percent). This will be only
partially offset by reduced import demand and significantly lower fuel and food import
prices. There i s no indication o f capital flight from Mozambique, although expectations
about private capital inflows-foreign direct investment and foreign borrowing-are
projected to fall by more than USDlOO million, largely because two megaprojects were
cancelled due to financing difficulties. Mitigating factors include a projected rise in aid
 inflows compared to 2008 and lower projected dividend payments by megaprojects.
Donors have broadly reconfirmed their funding commitments for 2009. In addition,
preliminary donor commitments for 2010 indicate that the level o f aid in national
 currencies i s likely to remain similar to 2009 (and a slight increase in U S dollar terms).
 As a result, forex reserves at the Central Bank are projected to fall by USD220 million in
 2009, reaching USD1.4 billion as o f end-2009 (or 3.9 months o f imports).

23.          I t should be noted that the increase in grants and externally-financed
investment expenditures envisaged over the next few years is likely the result of
optimistic projections regarding project aid disbursements by development
partners. In recent years the government has made a substantial effort to bring all aid on
budget. However, while projections on common funds and direct budget support have
been fairly accurate, there has been substantial overoptimism regarding projects and
vertical funds. This affects both the BOP and the fiscal outlook. More important,
accurate projections for the external component are essential for the realism and
usefulness o f the budget and the medium-term expenditure framework as planning
instruments. The authorities and donors are fully aware o f this problem and are working
to resolve it. An analysis o f the projects which under-disbursed pointed to specific
criteria for the inclusion o f projects on budget. In addition, in the past two years the
donors and government have made a strong push to bring external projects onto the
 Single Treasury Account (Cunta Unica do Tesouro, CUT), which would improve the
Treasury's financial control and accelerate the reporting on project execution. The Bank
 i s in the leading group in this effort and has brought several projects onto the CUT
 already.

24.         On the fiscal side, the financial crisis i s projected to result in lower
domestic revenues leading to a significant fiscal gap. The government has projected a
decline in total tax revenues o f around USD140 million in 2009 (approximately 1.5
percent o f GDP), mainly from lower VAT receipts, lower corporate income tax, lower
receipts from megaprojects and the traditional export sector, and lower fuel taxes (Table
5). Budget support receipts in local currency are also expected to be lower b y
approximately USD79 million (0.8 percent o f GDP) compared with previous projections
                                                                       n
used for the 2009 budget, due to changes in exchange rates. I addition, some
expenditure lines denominated in U S dollars are expected to increase, notably those
related to embassies, external debt service, and external travel, amounting to an extra
                                      n
USD19 million (0.2 percent o f GDP). I total, the projected fiscal gap amounts to approx
USD238 million (2.5 percent o f GDP).

25.         The government has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the crisis, but
faces difficult trade-offs. In early March 2009, the government formed an inter-agency
                                                                                    n
financial crisis task force at the ministerial level, which meets every fortnight. I April
the Bank presented to the task force key leading indicators on the global recession,
discussing how the task force could better monitor and mitigate the impact on
Mozambique. T o mitigate the negative BOPimpact o f the crisis and maintain a high level

Ministries' recurrent expenditures in selected programs and the domestically financed

expenditures in the priority sectors and programs o f the PARPA I )        ,

 approved measures to rationalize internal and external travel (reducing size of
 delegations, and class of air travel), which i s expected to bring additional savings of
USD46 million (0.5 percent o f GDP). The government i s also expecting to benefit from
 additional budget support from the European Commission (EC), amounting to USD18
 million (0.2 percent o f GDP). The balance o f the fiscal gap, after accounting for these
 expenditure cuts and the additional E C budget support, i s projected to be approx USD112
 million (1.2 percent o f GDP).

27.         The Fund and the Bank have advised the government to ease fiscal and
monetary policies during 2009, in order to help mitigate the fiscal impact of the
crisis. Hence, as agreed with the IMF, unless development partners are willing to
increase further budget support in 2009, the government plans to close the remaining
fiscal gap by borrowing domestically; by issuing Treasury bills. Specifically, the
government would need to increase domestic borrowing to about 1.8 percent o f GDP
(which i s 1.1 percent o f GDP higher than previously envisaged). Though large, the
increase in domestic financing does not jeopardize Mozambique's public debt
sustainability as the level o f public debt i s l o w and the increase in domestic financing i s
expected to be temporary. A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) carried out by the Bank
and the Fund in 2008, and recently updated in light o f the financial crisis, confirmed that
Mozambique faces a l o w risk o f debt distress (Box 4). Nevertheless, a prudent new
borrowing policy remains important.

28.             The recent decision by government to introduce a defacto subsidy to fuel
prices at the pump constitutes a significant risk to the fiscal outlook. As mentioned
above, starting in August 2009 the government has prevented the pass through o f
international fuel prices to the domestic market, and i t has promised to the fuel retailers
that it w i l l reimburse them in December 2009 for the related losses. In light o f the tight
fiscal situation, it i s likely that the cost o f the subsidy may also negatively impact
expenditure on priority sectors in 2009. While this i s widely perceived to be a pre-
election measure, and the government has indicated i t s intention to revert to a normal
price transmission during 2010, this already undesirable subsidy could have much more
serious implications if international o i l prices increase further. In collaboration with the
IMF and other development partners, the Bank i s actively pursuing policy dialogue with
the authorities to highlight the tradeoffs in terms o f alternative policies, which are less
costly and targeted to the poor, and encourage a transition towards a more transparent and
politically-independent price setting mechanism for the future (DFD i s financing a study
to this effect, which should be ready in October 2009).

29.        I n May 2008, the government made a request to development partners
for additional budget support to close the fiscal gap. The Minister o f Finance met
with the Ambassadors from the budget support donors and explained the revised fiscal
projections, asking for possible additional support from development partners. Only
Norway has indicated they may be able to increase somewhat their 2009 budget support.
While favorable to this request, the other development partners were unable to increase
their budget support for 2009. In light o f the unforeseen financial need, the Bank agreed
to consider: (i)increasing the size o f budget support provided through this PRSC from
USD85 million to USDllO million; and (ii)       accelerating its preparation to disburse the
funds in 2009.

30.         The Central Bank plans to ease monetary policy modestly to
accommodate the expansion in domestic budget financing to limit the adverse
impact on credit to the economy. Specifically, the monetary framework makes room
for broad money to expand by about 15 percent, allowing for private sector credit growth
o f 28 percent. The Central Bank expects that 12-month inflation at the end o f 2009 w i l l
remain broadly the same as at the end of 2008 on account o f a modest increase in
international fuel and food prices and because of the recent depreciation o f the exchange
rate.

Box 4: MOZAMBIQUE'S
               DEBTSUSTAINABILITY                             ANALYSIS
A Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was carried out by the Bank and the Fund in 2008. As a result o f
the M F , the NPV o f public external debt i s estimated to be approximately halved, from about 25
       DU
percent to about 12 percent o f GDP in 2006. Mozambique's public debt (including domestic debt) as
percent o f GDP i s expected to increase steadily until 2016 (see also Table 4) and then begin to decline
under the baseline scenario. These projections rest on the assumption that there w i l l be no recourse to
domestic financing over the long run. In addition, the revenue to GDP ratio w i l l continue to increase (by
0.5 percent per year until 2011 and then b y a smaller magnitude afterward) and foreign aid gradually
falls as a percentage o f GDP, while government expenditures w i l l increase only gradually over time.
After peaking at about 35 percent of GDP, the debt ratio eventually falls back to close to it s 2008 level
o f about 25 percent o f GDP. This debt dynamics i s largely driven by developments in external debt,
given the l o w and declining level of domestic debt as a result o f the discontinuation o f treasury bill
issuance for deficit financing purposes, the gradual redemption o f bonds issued to restructure the
banking system, and predominant use o f foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes. The NFW o f
public sector debt-to GDP ratio shows a similar pattern over time, as do the NPV o f debt-to-revenue and
debt service-to-revenue ratios. However, the NPV o f debt-to-revenue ratio falls faster and to a
significantly lower level than in 2008 after reaching its peak in 2017, whereas the debt service-to-
revenue ratio begins to fall much later (in 2024) and more slowly.
Mozambique's external debt levels are expected to remain well below their indicative thresholds for debt
distress both under the baseline and under various stress tests. Mozambique's public debt i s expected to
decline over the medium-to-long term under the baseline, while the stress tests indicate that public sector
debt ratios are most vulnerable to a permanently lower GDP growth.
This D S A has been partially updated b y the IMF in M a y 2009 to incorporate the revised macroeconomic
assumptions in light o f the global financia1 crisis, and s t i l l indicates that Mozambique continues to face a
low risk o f debt distress, though its public debt sustainability ratios have somewhat deteriorated as a
result o f the financial crisis.
In addition, there continue to be weaknesses in the supervision o f partial or full state shareholdings in
private or public enterprises, State's autonomous institutions, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and
other concessions, and mega-projects. While the performance o f public enterprises i s monitored
quarterly b y the Treasury on an enterprise b y enterprise basis, to date there i s no consolidated
assessment o f fiscal risk across all public enterprises. Similarly, while the Institute for State
Participations (IGEPE) has responsibility for monitoring public investments in private companies, it
does not yet have a procedure for making a consolidated risk analysis o f all the companies under its
remit nor for making budget provision for contingent (rather than actual) liabilities. Moreover, there i s
not yet a routine procedure for consolidating fiscal risks from public enterprises (monitored b y Treasury)
with the fiscal risks emerging from state investments monitored by IGEPE. In this context, the
government i s working to improve overall fiscal risk management and accountability, transparency and
revenue forecasting b y strengthening the systematic compilation and publication o f an annex to budget
execution documents covering quasi-fiscal activities, contingent assets and liabilities, and sensitivity
analysis o f fiscal risks.
With regards to future borrowing, the authorities should continue to rely on concessional financing and
grants to minimize future debt service. Any non-concessional financing o f new projects ought to be
considered case b y case based o n economic return, impact o n debt sustainability, and potential effects on
the financing decisions o f donors and concessional lenders. Also, the authorities would still need to
closely monitor any substantial scaling-up o f concessional external borrowing and the issuance o f
domestic debt to sterilize the additional liquidity injected from increased government spending. Debt
management has recently been reorganized and consolidated within the Ministry o f Finance following
international best practices, and capacity i s being strengthened.

3 1.     The medium-term outlook i s characterized by substantial uncertainty, with
the impact of the crisis in Mozambique expected to continue in 2010 and 2011. In
the same way in which the Africa region was affected by the impact o f the financial crisis
with a lag, the recovery i s also likely to be lagged, and perhaps slower. Such uncertainty
about the outlook for Africa i s very relevant for Mozambique. In fact, while there has
been some recent improvement in the global outlook, the outlook for South Africa has
worsened in the past few months, and t h i s may likely negatively impact the prospects for
                  n
Mozambique. I addition to the uncertain outturn o f the financial crisis, risks remain
related to natural calamities, a renewed surge in international oil and food prices, and
spending pressure during election times. Hence, it w i l l be important for the authorities
not to relax their policy stance, based o n a premature sense o f security. Given the high
level o f uncertainty for 2009, it i s difficult to make any projections for 2010 and 2011.
For the time being, the government and the IMF have assumed a slight acceleration o f
GDP growth to 5 percent in 2010 and 6 percent in 2011, somewhat below the average
growth o f the past five years. The leading sector would be agriculture, followed by
wholesale and retail trade, and also transport and communications, and construction.
They have also assumed an additional reduction in forex reserves o f USD15O million and
the need for additional domestic financing o f 0.7 percent o f GDP (about USD70 million)
in 2010. The BOPand fiscal accounts are assumed to improve only in 2011.

32.      The financial crisis has reemphasized the need to refocus efforts towards
increasing the efficiency in the use of public finances and taking action to increase
private investments and boost economic growth. The Government o f Mozambique
has been consistently pursuing sound fiscal, monetary, and external policies,
demonstrating a clear understanding o f the benefits o f a solid underlying macroeconomic
framework. The government has also been implementing an active program o f structural
reforms. There i s an enormous momentum for continuing the reforms program and
striving to reach even higher growth rates. Businesses' interest to expand and initiate
operations in Mozambique i s palpable. However, the financial crisis has clouded the
economic outlook. The anticipated reduction in tax revenues and foreign direct
investment is expected to result in a severe drop in economic growth in 2009 and beyond.
In this context i t becomes critical for government to address these challenges by
accelerating i t s efforts to maximize efficiency in the management o f public resources,
through improvements in PFM system, and accelerating the implementation o f growth-
enhancing reforms to increase private investment, Further PFM reforms are essential to
 improve service delivery and create, through efficiency savings, the fiscal space needed
to expand services and increase public investments. In addition, i t will be equally
 important to analyze the allocations and use o f public expenditure, with a view to
 maximize the efficiency and benefits from public expenditures, and to analyze trade-offs
 in public expenditure choices, and adequately fund expenditures in priority areas.
 Mozambique also needs to implement growth-enhancing reforms and challenging
 institutional reforms to exploit all possible economic growth opportunities. As articulated
 in the 2009 CEM, Mozambique has a vast, diversified economic potential, including in
 mining, energy, agribusiness, fishing, forestry, tourism, light manufacturing and services

serving as a gateway to neighboring countries.'6 However, there are many constraints
that prevent a more dynamic business growth and employment ~ r e a t i o n . ' The challenge
                                                                               ~
for Mozambique i s how to sustain high growth and reshape i t s pattern to generate more
employment b y exploiting all these export opportunities.**

33.        These challenges, which have been articulated in the PARPA-11, and are
expected to constitute priority areas in the program of the next government, are the
focus of this new PRSC series. The likely growth scenarios for the future - and the
corresponding poverty scenarios - w i l l heavily depend on the government's role in
removing constraints to continued growth, as well as i t s role in seizing new opportunities
for growth. Only rapid progress in certain key reforms, can keep the growth rate as high
as 7 or 8 percent in the medium term, and continue the rapid rate poverty reduction o f the
past decade. I t i s critical therefore that the government pursues a reform program to
resolve the key challenges to growth and poverty reduction. In this context, this new
PRSC series will support the government in: (a) the consolidation and deepening o f the
institutional reforms in the area o f macroeconomic management, with a focus on PFM
r e f o r m ~ ; 'and (b) economic development by removing constraints to growth, notably by
                 ~
simplifying the regulatory environment, improving access to credit, and promoting more
efficient land use.

              1.
             1 1 THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM: PARPA I1
34.    I n September 2006, the government formally adopted the Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PARPA 11). PARPA I1 i s the operational plan for the
governments' Five-Year Program (2005-2009), and sets out a broad and ambitious
agenda o f reforms. PARPA I1builds on the experience o f PARPA I and was prepared
                                                                  ,
by the government through broad-based consultations with major stakeholders and civil
society in a more participatory approach than PARPA I involving four national and ten
                                                     ,


l6 Mozambique also has a largely untapped potential in electricity production from hydro and coal as well
as in mining in general. While these projects are important for the country, they create relatively, few jobs.
The government objective i s to ensure that Mozambique obtains the maximum economic, social and
environmental benefits from these projects, notably in terms o f the fiscal benefits of large investments.
Indeed maximizing benefits from megaprojects (especially in natural resources) will be critical for
Mozambique to be able to finance poverty reduction programs, and reduce aid-dependency, while allowing
the government to offer a competitive trade and fiscal regime which can encourage domestic and foreign
investment.
l7The major priorities include simplifying the trade and tax regime; the s t i l l inadequate and inefficient
transport logistics; the lack o f articulation, standards, and facilitated technology diffusion; the rigidity in the
land tenure system; and shortage o f qualified professional skills in the labor force. Over-regulation and
arbitrary interpretation o f rules add a significant burden to business start-up and operation, particularly
among foreign investors who bring capital and know-how needed to supply the global market.
la The government w i l l also have to continue investing in health and education. In fact, while
improvements in productivity might benefit from greater efficiency in government spending and
improvements in the private sector's regulatory environment, it can't happen without improvements in
labor productivity as a result o f better education and health indicators.
l9 Improving the allocation and efficiency o f public expenditures i s not part o f this PRSC series but it i s
acknowledged as a crucial priority for government and the Bank w i l l continue to work with government
and development partners in th is area.

provincial Development Observatories.20 In 2008 the government announced that i t
would extend the PARPA I1 b y one year to include 2010, thereby strengthening
sustainability and continuity with the next strategic document. The PARPA I1 structure
and priorities were discussed in the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) presented to the
Board on December 19, 2006, and also included in the PRSC-3 program document, and
reference i s made to those documents for details.

35.     The PARPA I1 for the first time includes a strategic matrix of key indicators,
a joint effort by the government, donors and civil society. These indicators are
integrated into and monitored through the annual instruments o f the Economic and Social
Plan (PES in Portuguese) and the BdPES (Ex-post Assessment of Implementation o f the
PES), which i s submitted annually to Parliament.

36.     The monitoring of the PARPA I1 is open to participation from the public
and representatives of Civil Society Organizations, through the work of the
Development Observatories. The work o f the Development Observatories i s ongoing
and their meetings provide a forum for broad public consultation to strengthen domestic
accountability in PARPA I1 implementation and monitoring. These institutional
mechanisms, however, are still in their initial years and have very limited capacity,
thereby limiting the effectiveness o f public involvement.

37.     While maintaining its commitment to improve quality and access to social
services, PARPA I1 recognizes that "rapid, sustainable and broad-based growth"
warrants more emphasis on the growth of the productive and private sectors. The
strategy envisages small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the engine o f employment
generation. Rural development has a central place in the strategy. An essential role i s
attributed to districts as the focus o f development. There i s also a clear recognition of the
challenges related to HIV/AIDS, with a credible strategy for accelerating the national
response to the AIDS pandemic. Overall, the priority areas for public policy to sustain
growth and poverty reduction, and improve service delivery are arranged under three
             governance; (ii)
pillars:21 (i)                  human capital; and (iii)
                                                       economic development.




2o Mozambique has established `Development Observatories' (DO) as a consultative forum for discussion
o f poverty reduction issues, which includes representatives from government, civil society, and
international partners. The DO i s tasked with collecting and analyzing data o n poverty, and monitoring the
implementation o f the PARPA. Provincial DOs are intended to facilitate dialogue and consultation at the
decentralized level.
21 Key reforms in public financial management were treated in the text o f PARPA I1partly under the pillar
o f Governance, and partly under the pillar o f Economic Development. The strategic matrix highlighted the
importance o f these reforms b y creating a fourth domain: Macroeconomic Management.

     IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
A. LN S TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
    I K

38.     The PRSC series i s a key component of the Country Partnership Strategy
approved by the Board in May 2007, and closely aligned to the government
program. Bank support to the PARPA I1 i s through the Mozambique FY08-11 Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS, discussed M a y 30, 2007).22 As government policies and
budget are the key instruments for implementing the PARPA, the Bank i s committed to
supporting and aligning with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario o f the
CPS envisages programmatic support through four consecutive PRSCs, with a focus on
supporting Mozambique's efforts in increasing accountability and public voice and
fostering sustainable and broad-based growth. In line with the government program, and
as reflected in the CPS, the program supported b y the PRSC series recognizes the
importance o f strengthening economic governance systems, and the centrality o f the new
growth agenda to accelerate private sector de~elopment.~'The PRSC series i s also well
aligned with the Bank's principles on conditionality, namely (i)   reinforce ownership; {ii)
strengthen harmonization; (iii)   customize program to country circumstances; (iv) select
only critical actions; and (v) ensure transparency and predictability o f process (Box 5).

39.     Strengthening governance i s a key objective of the interventions supported
by the PRSC series. The PRSC series i s contributing to this overarching objective
through several channels, including (i)     strengthening the capacity, transparency, and
accountability o f state institutions, by strengthening PFM systems both at the central
level and at the local level; (ii)  fostering a competitive and responsible private sector
through interventions aimed at improving the business environment and the investment
               i icontributing to strengthen accountability overall through the process o f
climate; and ( i )
joint reviews that monitor progress in implementation o f the PARPA 1 , including raising
                                                                        1
the demand for better governance by supporting participation by civil society in the joint
reviews, and through the activities associated with the Development Observatories.

40.     Development policy lending will be complemented by investment support
and technical assistance. PRSC support w i l l continue to coexist with investment
support to well-articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to develop
government systems and capacities necessary for a n increased reliance o n them. IDA'S
investment portfolio, with 18 projects, i s diverse and supports the three pillars o f the
CPS. As o f June 2009, total IDA commitments were USD881 million. The share o f
policy-based lending in overall IDA disbursements in FVO4-07 was below 40 percent,
and i s projected to stay at around 40 percent o f annual commitments during the'CPS
FYO8-11. The PRSC series supports PFM and public sector reforms and embraces the
new growth agenda, and these objectives are also supported by several IDA projects,
thereby creating strong synergies.

ACCRA AGENDA



41.      A new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in March 2009
between the government and 19 donors (G19) providing general budget support,
including the World Bank. This M o U builds on the earlier 2004 memorandum, which
constituted a breakthrough in donor harmonization in Mozambique. I t i s based on a set
o f `fundamental principles': (i)
                                predictability and alignment with domestic systems; (ii)
monitoring has to be done jointly and that all policy actions or expected outcomes in the
program have to be based on the common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF);
  i i no
( i ) separate reporting to the donors i s required; and (iv) mutual accountability.
Reference i s made to the Mozambique Program Aid Partnership website:
www.pap.org.mz for details and a copy o f the MoU.

42.         The Bank will continue to work with the other budget support partners to
simplify the coordination process, and enhance the quality of the Performance
Assessment Framework. The G19 system has brought substantial benefits in terms of
streamlining the donor dialogue with the government. However, there are aspects that
s t i l l can be improved. Firstly, the process to select and update the PAF indicators would
benefit from more flexibility especially to reflect changing conditions (as evidenced
during the food and fuel crisis o f 2007-2008, and the global crisis o f 2008-2009) or new
evolving government ~ r i o r i t i e s . Second, there could be a better balance in the PAF
                                          ~~
between outcome indicators and policy reform actions. The PAF i s currently heavily
skewed towards the former.25 These two characteristics limit to some extent the
usefulness o f the PAF as a vehicle for timely policy dialogue, posing also constraints for
the preparation o f this operation. Thirdly, as discussed in the next paragraph, the G19
coordination process could benefit from streamlining, as over the years the expansion in


24
    The G19 system works as follows: donors and government agree on a set of triggers for year N in
September of year N-1. (It i s expected that changes will be limited to triggers on which a revision was
agreed the previous April, at the time of the Annual Joint Review). The performance of government i s then
reviewed in April of year N+1, and determines disbursements in year N+2. For instance, in September
2009 donors and government agreed on triggers for implementation in 2010. Government performance
against these triggers will be reviewed in April 2011, and based on performance this will determine budget
support in the 2012 calendar/fiscal year. Hence, this system entails a 3-year lag between the time indicators
are set and their use for the disbursement of budget support. As a result it i s not easy to have a PAF which
i s up to date and reflects the rich policy reform program undertaken by the government. The government
implementation of the PARPA reform program i s carried out and monitored through the annual instruments
of the Economic and Social Plan (Plano Econdmico e Social, PES, in Portuguese) and the Ex-post
Assessment of Implementation o f the PES (Balanp do PES, in Portuguese), which are submitted annually
to Parliament. These instruments are much more flexible and reflect the emerging priorities and action of
the government, but are not used by G19 as the basis for adapting the PAF.
25 This i s a challenge for the preparation o f PRSCs since using output and outcome indicators as prior
action i s at odds with Board-approved policy for Development Policy Operations (OPBP 8.60). Staff are
advised not to use output and outcome indicators as prior actions in the operation, and instead use them in
the results frameworks. As prior actions, staff should use the policy and institutional actions that the
government intends to implement to achieve these outputs and outcomes.

    the number o f donor working groups has led to an excessive atomization o f the dialogue,
'   making i t very hard to prioritize issues. '

    43.     The donor harmonization system in Mozambique could be strengthened by
    consolidating the policy dialogue in a smaller number of working groups which
    would lead to improved prioritization and efficiency. Implementation o f the PARPA
    i s monitored through Sector Working Groups and progress in achieving all the indicators
    contained in the PAF i s assessed once a year through the Joint Review in April, and this
    work i s complemented by the `Planning Meetings' in September to agree on the
    indicators and triggers for the following year. The sector working groups can be good
    vehicles for policy dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between
    the government and all the donors involved in a specific sector. Today this donor
    coordination system i s organized around a total o f 72 (seventy-two) sector working
    groups.     O f these, 29 are considered main groups which involve government
    participation, with the remainder 43 being donor-only sub-groups. An unintended
    consequence o f this large number o f groups i s that the policy dialogue tends to be
    excessively fragmented, focusing too narrowly on specific issues discussed across a large
    number o f different meetings. This makes the prioritization o f focus and dialogue
    difficult - all while imposing a heavy burden on the time commitments o f all involved.

    44.      Implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action is
    monitored by the G19, the UN agencies and other development partners. The big
    challenges are to align project aid with the national budget system, integrate i t as much as
    possible with the government's treasury and reporting system, and reduce the number o f
    Project Implementation Units. There has been substantial progress to bring project aid
    on-budget, and the percentage o f development aid on-b,udget i s estimated at above 90
    percent as o f 2007. The 2009 budget made further progress, and most of the externally
    financed projects are now included in the budget. As a result, the budget i s increasingly
    becoming a meaningful instrument for decision-making on resource allocation, and
    linking resources to results. In terms o f next steps, in September 2007 the government
    finalized the multi-currency module to the Single Treasury Account (CUT) and i s
    actively encouraging donors to put all their projects on-CUT (which will also ensure that
    the projects are on-budget). In addition, the public financial management reforms and
    procurement reforms supported by the G19 (and also by this PRSC series) are expected to
    facilitate increased use o f country systems b y IDA and other development partners.

    45.     The Bank and the IMF cooperate very closely within their respective
    mandates in assisting the government to implement the PARPA. Mozambique has a
    stable relationship with the IMF, anchored on a 3-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
    approved by the IMF's Board in June 2007 and a 1-year Exogenous Shocks Facility
    (ESF) approved by the I M F ' s Board in June 2009. The Bank actively participates in the
    semi-annual PSI review missions and bi-annual Article I V missions. Close collaboration
    in the preparation o f the PRSC series was ensured through Bank participation in IMF
    missions to monitor progress in the implementation o f the macroeconomic program and
    IMF participation in relevant G19 sector working groups and the two joint annual
    reviews. The IMF leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policy (including fiscal,
    monetary, and exchange rate policies), the electronic integrated financial management


                                                - 25 -
system (e-SISTAFE) and tax and customs reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue
on public expenditure management, sector structural reforms, reforms o f the civil service,
and poverty and social impact analysis. Areas o f close collaboration include banking
supervision, financial sector issues, trade issues, the PARPA, external debt sustainability,
and maximising the benefits from megaprojects and the use o f natural resources. The
practice o f holding joint IMF-IDA missions has both had synergistic benefits, and has
reduced the burden on government o f multiple missions. Development partners are also
involved in specific policy discussions, since all stakeholders agree that many
macroeconomic policy outcomes have structural foundations that development partners
can usefully support. As of March 2009, the IMF has become an ex-officio member of
the G19, and intends to continue the practice to set the timing o f i t s missions such as to
be synchronized with the joint reviews of the G19.

BOX  5: ALIGNMENT             BETWEEN THIS          PRSC      AND     GOODPRACTICE PRINCIPLES ON
CONDITIONALITY
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's strategy to support the implementation o f Mozambique's
Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA I1 by its Portuguese acronym), and
%e Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the government and the nineteen external partners (the
219). PARPA I1i s structured around three pillars (Governance, Human Capital, and Economic Development) and i s
Lhe operational plan o f the government's Five-Year Program. The previous PRSC series have been successfully
deployed between 2001 and 2008 and overall progress of the reforms has been satisfactory as the government
continues to pursue a far-reaching reform agenda and deepening reforms to reduce poverty. The PRSC series has
also been informed by significant amount o f analytical work completed over the past few years.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
Progress on the reforms i s monitored with the aid o f the PAF. Improved service delivery in PARPA priority sectors,
i.e. agriculture, health, education, rural water supply, infrastructure, justice and related governance sectors, i s
monitored through joint Sector Working Groups. Progress in achieving all the indicators contained in the PAF i s
assessed once a year through the Joint Review in April, and this work i s complemented by the `Planning Meetings'
in September to agree on the indicators and triggers for the following year. The sector working groups have become
a good mechanism for policy dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the government
and all the donors involved in a specific sector. Notably, a joint budget working group meets on a quarterly basis
with the government to monitor budget execution, particularly in the priority sectors.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The PRSC series i s designed to focus first o n key constraints in cross-cutting areas such as public financial
management and the operation o f the financial sector, which are the areas that provided the rationale for the prior
actions o f PRSC-6 and PRSC-7. The series then evolves to support improvements in the business environment and
shared growth through the incorporation o f triggers related to regulatory reforms and land taxation reforms for
PRSC-8. In order to reduce the transaction costs for the government, the Bank carries out all supervision jointly
with the other donors. A Joint Review takes place each year in April (year n). I t assesses the performance of the
government in the previous budget year, which corresponds to the calendar year (year n-1). The review focuses on
evaluating progress with regard to the indicators defined in the PAF and makes an overall assessment o f progress,
resulting in disbursement commitments for the following year (year n+l). The second event i s the `Planning
Meetings' in September. This review i s forward-looking and formalizes the agreement on the performance
indicators and targets for the following year (year n+l). Programmatic lending w i l l be complemented by investment
support. PRSC support will coexist with investment support to well-articulated sector programs, and with technical
assistance to develop government systems and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on them.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
As agreed with the development partners and the government, and in line with the Bank move towards increased
harmonization, starting with the previous PRSC series the Bank moved to use PRSC triggers selected from the
common PAF used by all G19 partners. All the prior actions and triggers o f this PRSC series are indicators
contained in the PAF and were selected because o f their criticality for achieving objectives which are consistent
with the government's own monitoring framework and to be in line with donor harmonization for general budget
support. The results framework comprises 6 prior actions for PRSC-6, and no more than 9 prior actions for PRSC-7
and PRSC-8.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
The Bank's supervision o f the PRSC series i s aligned with the supervision o f the joint General Budget Support
program o f the G19. Both the April Joint Review and the September `Planning Meetings' are a multi-sector
exercises, and Bank staff participate in all relevant sectors. Disbursements w i l l be contingent on satisfactory
progress towards a subset o f the PARPA's medium-term objectives as set out in the PAF matrix. In addition, the
review process i s explicitly designed to allow announcing budget financing amount early in the year in the budget
preparation cycle and to disburse early in the budget year, a principle to which the Bank adheres.

 V. THE PROPOSED POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
A. OVERALL
         DESCRIPTION

46.     The proposed Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-6) is the first
operation in a new series of three annual operations supporting the implementation
                  1
of the PARPA 1 . The PRSC series supports a strategic subset o f objectives from the
PARPA I1 results matrix. As intermediate outcomes the PRSC series supports
improvements in:
    (1) Macroeconomic management: Consolidate and deepen institutional reforms to
        improve the use o f public resources through better budget formulation, stronger
        public financial management (PFM) systems, and oversight.
    (2) Economic development: Continue to support broad-based growth by reducing
        the excessive regulation constraining business activities, improving the
        information basis for access to credit, and promoting more efficient land use and
        better access to land.

47.    The PRSC-6 supports specific ongoing reforms which are part of the above
program. The PRSC-6 supports reforms to improve macroeconomic management by
aligning the budget with economic policy priorities expressed in the PARPA and the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), expanding the use of direct budget
execution through the e-SISTAFE, continuing the implementation o f the new State
procurement system, increasing the coverage and efficiency o f external audit bodies, and
improving the human resources management in the public sector (through a reform o f the
medium-term wage policy). In terms o f economic development, the PRSC-6 supports the
government's efforts to improve the operation o f the financial sector, in order to expand
access to credit for private sector firms. Additional reforms to accelerate the pace o f
reforms to improve the business environment have been undertaken by government, but
they are not reflected in the PRSC prior actions because they are not reflected in the PAF.

48.    The new PRSC series is fully harmonized within the joint donor (G19)
mechanism for the provision of general budget support. All the proposed prior
actions and triggers for t h i s PRSC series are drawn from the joint Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF; see Annex 3), which itself i s a subset o f the strategic
                     1
matrix o f PARPA 1 . IDA'Sfocus w i l l be geared at specific areas, which are a subset o f
the PAF. This i s an important feature o f the proposed operations as, b y relying on the
PAF, the PRSC series w i l l remain consistent with the government's own monitoring
framework and w i l l also be in line with donor harmonization for general budget support.
This feature poses severe restrictions on the PRSC series, however. As discussed in
Section V I the government has been undertaking a rich program o f reforms, which i s not
captured in the G19 PAF. Therefore, in order to adhere to the joint budget support MOU
the Bank i s not using those reforms as prior actions.

49.     The program supported by the PRSC series i s directly drawn from the
PARPA 11, which has been extensively discussed with major stakeholders and civil
society. As the PARPA I1 was prepared b y government through broad-based
participatory consultations with major stakeholders and civil society, the fact that the


                                           - 28 -
PRSC triggers are entirely drawn from the strategic matrix o f PARPA I1 ensures that the
program o f reforms supported by the PRSC has been fully discussed with Civil Society
Organizations. Similarly, the monitoring o f the implementation i s open to participation
from the public and representatives o f Civil Society Organizations, through the work of
the Development Observatories and their participation in the two annual G19 reviews
(see paragraphs 33-35 and Box 5).26

50.     T h e policy matrix and results framework for the P R S C series in Annex 2
presents the specific areas supported by the P R S C series. As indicated above, the
PRSC policy matrix and results framework i s a sub-set o f the PAF matrix used by the
G19. The prior actions have been selected based on their criticality for contributing to
achieve the PARPA-I1 objectives. The criteria reflect the following two broad principles:
(i) trigger entails a policy or institutional reform which i s critical to remove a key
    The
constraint to poverty reduction and growth (based on the findings o f existing analytical
work), or i s an implementation activity o f a reform initiated earlier; (ii) trigger i s part
                                                                            The
o f the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and the assessment can be done
easily, e.g. verifying whether a law or some regulation has been approved.

51.       T h e specific program supported b y this new P R S C series is more focused
(compared to the previous series) around measures to strengthen macroeconomic
management and to accelerate economic development. In general terms, the new
series i s a continuation o f the past PRSC series, in that it w i l l continue to support the
                                    1
implementation o f the PARPA 1 . However, the new PRSC series i s more focused than
the previous one, and only supports measures to improve macroeconomic management,
and to accelerate economic development. In addition to measures in Public Financial
Management and civil service wage and pensions reform, i t includes measures to
strengthen the financial sector, and improve access to land, and simplify the regulatory
environment for business development. Table 6 shows the six prior actions that
government has fulfilled for PRSC-6 and the proposed triggers for PRSC-7 and PRSC-8.
As indicated above, these prior actions and triggers are indicative o f the richer reforms
program which i s being undertaken by the government, particularly to accelerate
economic growth, but which i s not well reflected in the PAF. A detailed sector-by-sector
discussion o f the broader program supported b y this PRSC series, including the specific
prior actions and triggers, i s provided in the next section.

         LEARNED THE PREVIOUS P R S C SERIES
 B. LESSONS   FROM

52.     A preliminary assessment of the likely outcomes achieved b y the previous
P R S C series i s positive, as most of the outcomes set at the beginning of the series are
likely to b e r e a l i ~ e d . ~ 'The previous PRSC series supported a broad reform agenda
covering institutional reforms to achieve three objectives. They were grouped in pillars:
(i) the consolidation and deepening o f the institutional reforms in the area o f
macroeconomic management; (ii)            reforms in governance by supporting decentralization

26 In addition, the W o r l d Bank also carried out two discussion sessions with CSOs in M a r c h and September
2009 to discuss the preparation and focus o n the n e w PRSC series, in the context o f the G19 system.
21
   An ICR o f the past PRSC series will be carried out in M 1 0 .


                                                     - 29 -
 to enhance public investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and
 by supporting public sector reform; and (iii)           economic development by removing
 constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth. Reforms
 in strengthening public financial management made impressive progress. Notably,
.progress was made in expanding the comprehensiveness of the budget and improving the
 efficiency and effectiveness o f public financial management, though the implementation
 of the e-SISTAFE. Also substantial steps forward have been made to make the State
 procurement system for goods and services more transparent and efficient, and to
 increase coverage and efficiency o f internal and external audit bodies. Public sector and
 judiciary reforms were slower than expected, including limited progress in
 decentralization. Nevertheless, some steps were taken to expand the role o f local
 government, and to establish the foundations for better management o f human resources
  in the public sector. There i s also a need to continue the work to strengthen the insurance
  and social protection sector. Similarly, significant steps have been made to improve the
 business environment, but much more progress i s required. Good progress has also been
 made to improve the quality and coverage o f the road network, by improving the
  institutional set up for i t s administration, and to expand the availability o f irrigation, and
  the access to technologies and extension information.

53.    The initial lessons from the previous PRSC series confirm the importance of
government ownership and harmonization with other development partners, and
the need for good analytical work to encompass the political economy of reforms. In
broad terms, it seems that the PRSC series has focused on the right set o f measures and
begun to address key impediments to growth. The new PRSC series will continue the
implementation o f the reforms program already supported under the previous series,
building on the experience o f the previous series. I t focuses on the same policy areas, but
placing greater emphasis on promoting economic growth by facilitating private sector
development. The experience with the previous PRSC series highlights a few important
lessons:

       Firstly, there was a strong government ownership of the program supported
       by the PRSC, which is directly drawn from the PRSP. The PRSC series
       achieved its main objectives due to strong ownership o f the reform program by the
       government. As a result, the medium term reform strategies never suffered
       reversals, despite delays in implementation in some areas. For example, following
       initial delays in implementing the ambitious new electronic integrated financial
       management system (e-SISTAFE) in 2004 and 2005, the progress since then has
       more than compensated and the transition to the new system has proceeded
       smoothly and with good results. A similar story could be told regarding civil
       service reform. The first phase produced limited results, but after a thorough
       external review and extensive internal consultations, a new strategy has been
       developed for the second phase that i s fully owned b y the government and which
       has started i t s implementation with renewed dynamism. The lesson about the
       importance o f ownership has been taken into account in the design o f the new
       PRSC series: all the prior actions and triggers will again be drawn from the PAF
                                         1
       which i s based on the PARPA 1 . They are consistent with the sector strategies,



                                               - 30 -
reform programs and their monitoring frameworks. This ensures a high degree o f
internalization and ownership b y the concerned institutions.

Secondly, even though the PAF framework imposes severe limitations in the
selection of prior actions and triggers, there was a positive impact from the
highly harmonized policy dialogue across donors providing budget support,
which has streamlined the donor dialogue with the government. The MoU o f
the G19 aligns general budget support with the Mozambican budget cycle,
improves the predictability o f resource flows, and harmonizes the donors regarding
policy benchmarks, the reporting and review process. It i s a powerful instrument to
improve the quality o f budget planning and execution and enhance the effectiveness
o f aid. Largely as a result o f donor harmonization, some reforms that had long been
advocated, e.g. increasing budget coverage for externally financed projects and own
revenues, have been implemented. This lesson has been taken into account in the
design o f the new PRSC series; the Bank will continue to actively participate in the
G19 system and carry out i t s policy dialogue within the harmonized framework. As
discussed above, however, the donor coordination system i s characterized b y
inefficiency due to the very large number of sector working groups. In addition,
the PAF used by the G19 needs to become more flexible to better reflect the
government priorities and programs. At present, the quality o f the PAF remains
limited and the procedures to revise the indicators are excessively rigid. Hence, the
Bank will continue to work with the other budget support partners to simplify and
improve the coordination process.

Thirdly, reform programs must be accompanied by coordinated capacity
building efforts. It would have been impossible to carry out the reforms
contemplated under the previous series o f PRSC's if they had not been supported
through extensive capacity building programs. In the past, much capacity building
occurred through isolated technical assistance projects, often driven by the priorities
of a donor. This has changed in the past years, and multi-donor sector wide
approaches have been developed and common funds have been established, also for
technical assistance and capacity building. This new approach was essential to
achieve the results that are visible now. This lesson has been taken into account in
the design o f the new PRSC series, as the reform program i s supported largely
through coordinated technical assistance and capacity building programs. Donor
funding for the public financial management reforms has been consolidated into a
single common fund for technical assistance since 2006. A further example i s
provided by the support to the financial sector reforms, which was consolidated
under the multi-donor Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project in 2006.
Policy dialogue and projects in the area o f business environment reforms are closely
coordinated amongst donors, but there i s as yet no common fund or sector wide
approach.

Fourthly, progress has been slower in reform areas where the political
economy context was critical, yet not adequately understood. In terms o f the
reform areas supported by the past PRSC series, progress has been slower in areas
such as decentralization and public sector reforms, where there may be underlying


                                      -31-
         reasons related to the political economy which need to be better explored and
         understood. This lesson has been taken into account in the design o f the new PRSC
         series. While the Bank remains engaged in policy dialogue in sensitive areas,
         specific policy actions have not been included as part o f the PRSC. The only
         potentially sensitive area o f reform included i s land taxation, on which however a
         decision has already been taken in the Council o f Ministers. Nevertheless, the team
         plans to assess the political economy o f this reform prior to the implementation.

C. ANALYTICAL STUDIES UNDERPINNING REFORM
                                 THE          SUPPORTED
                                        PROGRAM                                                        BY THE
      EE
       I
PRSC SRS

54.     The program supported by this P R S C series has been informedby a series of
analytical and diagnostic studies, which provide a sound basis for the reforms. The
reforms program in Public Financial Management (PFM) builds on the two Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) reports in 2006 and 2008 (Figure 3), as
well as the findings o f the IMF technical assistance missions on progress with PFM
reforms in January 2008 and March 2009 (with participation by the Bank), a G19 PFM
Quality Assurance Group mission in March 2009, and the two Country Procurement
Assessment Reviews (CPAR) carried out in 2001 and in 2008 (Figure 4). The reforms to
accelerate Economic Development have been informed b y the 2005 Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) and the new 2009 C E M which focuses on reshaping growth and
creating jobs through trade and regional integration, as well as the 2009 Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA), and the 2009 Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) report. In
addition, a Poverty Assessment was completed in 2007, and a Policy Note on the impact
and policy options to respond to the higher food and fuel prices was completed in 2008.
The policies and reforms supported by the PRSC focus on the main challenges to
sustained growth and poverty reduction in Mozambique which have been identified in the
studies. The analytical foundations o f the PRSC seek to assess whether government
policies and institutions are adequately set up and do in fact contribute to the overall
objective o f reducing poverty and whether the systems and procedures for channeling
resources to support these strategies are appropriate. The main conclusions o f these
analytical studies are summarized below:28
     8       Poverty Assessment. The second national household survey was completed in
         2003 and reported in March 2004. As affirmed earlier, the poverty headcount i s
         estimated to have fallen from 69 percent to 54 percent between 1997 and 2003.
         Reduction in rural poverty was more pronounced, although the proportion o f rural
         poor remained higher than the urban poor. An integrated Poverty, Social and
         Gender Assessment (PSGA) was completed in 2007. The 2007 PSGA also suggests
         that poverty and inequality may actually have increased in recent years, based on
         the analysis o f the agricultural panel survey data (TIA 2002-2005), but highlights
         that t h i s preliminary result may also be related to the impact o f the drought in 2005.
         Data collection for the new national household survey was completed in September
         2009 and the results (expected in early 2010) w i l l show whether poverty has

informed the design o f the PRSC series.

    continued falling. A policy note on the impact and responses to the higher food and
    fuel prices in 2008 highlights that the recent dramatic spike in world agricultural
    and fuel prices may also have contributed to set back at least some o f the poverty
    reduction gains achieved during the past decade. Simulations o f the impact o f the
    combined impact o f the food and fuel price rises indicate that an additional 800,000
    people could have been pushed below the poverty line, raising the poverty
    headcount by 4 `percentage points to 58 percent. The impact was expected to be
    especially severe in urban areas where the poverty rate was expected to increase by
    8 percentage points. Most o f the negative impact was concentrated in the south
    region, particularly in Maputo, which i s a net consumer o f food, and heavily
    dependent on imported rice and wheat.

e       Economic growth. Building on the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum
    (CEM) which focused on policies for the optimal use o f Mozambique's natural
    resources - land, forestry, fisheries, mining and water - the 2009 C E M currently
    under review by the government focuses on key constraints to accelerated growth
    that Mozambique needs to address. I t recognizes Mozambique as one o f the fastest
    growing economies in the world, but suggests that it has the potential to do even
    better. The Mozambican economy has undergone significant changes in the past
    decade, with the participation o f agriculture in output diminishing as more
    productive sectors grow. This ongoing diversification o f productive activities i s
    bound to further transformations in the economic landscape. Harnessing such
    transformations for economic development will require strategic policy steps.
    Through promoting competition and trade integration measures, the goal i s to
    induce further private sector demand for Mozambique's factors of production, and
    in turn diversify the economy and achieve shared and sustained economic growth.
    The reform priorities to accelerate growth include simplifying the trade and tax
    regime; the s t i l l inadequate and inefficient transport logistics; the lack o f
    articulation, standards, and facilitated technology diffusion; the rigidity in the land
    tenure system; and shortage o f qualified professional skills in the labor force. Over-
    regulation and arbitrary interpretation o f rules add a significant burden to business
    start-up and operation, particularly among foreign investors who bring capital and
    know-how needed to supply the global market. The governance o f megaproject
    investments i s also critical to maximize benefits for the country. The C E M report
    contains a series o f policy recommendations to remove these constraints, some o f
    which are expected to inform the drafting o f the new PARPA and also feature
    among the growth-related PRSC triggers.

e       Public Expenditure Reviews. The Budget Analysis Group o f the G19 regularly
    reviews the broad trends in expenditures and revenues, and the aggregate sectoral
    allocations, with a view to ensure that funding for priority sectors i s protected and
    that the broad sectoral and geographical allocations are reasonable. In addition, the
    various sectoral working groups also carry out a basic analysis o f intra-sectoral
    allocations and expenditures annually, which feeds into the overall G19 discussion
    with government on expenditure allocations. Only limited in-depth analysis has
    been carried out in recent years, however, to explore the efficiency in the use o f
    public expenditures, and the Bank has been advocating with G19 partners the need


                                         - 33 -
    to work with government to deepen public expenditure analysis. Formal PERs were
    completed in 2001 (in conjunction with the CFAA) and in 2004, in a participatory
    process that brought together central and sectoral government institutions, local and
    international academic and research institutes, the private sector, and a variety of
    donors. The recommendations o f these PERs focused on improving budget
    formulation, execution and reporting to enable better tracking and informed
    decision-making concerning poverty-related expenditures through reforms which
    were supported by the previous PRSC series. More recently, in 2009 an agricultural
    PER was carried out. The main recommendations highlight the need to further
    develop the financial planning and management system and to design a suitable
    structure o f programs and sub-programs that can be used for financial planning and
    management aspects. A PER in the water sector i s ongoing and i s facing similar
    constraints regarding the scarce availability o f data on expenditures b y functional or
    programmatic classification. Following the first Public Expenditures Tracking
    Survey (PETS) in the health sector in 2003, a new PETS has just been completed in
    the education sector, and a new one i s envisaged again in the health sector for 2010-
    2011.

a       Public Financial Management. Mozambique i s one o f the few countries to
    have completed two reasonably spaced PEFA assessments: the f i r s t was finalized in
    2006 (based on complete data for the 2004 fiscal year and partial data for 2005)
    whereas the second was finalized in early 2008 (based on complete data for 2006
    and partial data for 2007). These reports provide a good picture o f overall progress
    as well as o f relative progress for each step o f the budget cycle. The result o f these   .
    PEFAs provides a generally positive story, with a clear majority o f eight to four
    indicators posting substantive gains. (Defined as increase in letter grade, as opposed
    to including changes in letter grade suffixes, i.e. + or blank). Between 2006 and
    2008, out o f a total o f 28 indicators, the number o f indicators rated B and above
    increased from 10 to 16, while those rated C and below were reduced from 13 to 8.
    Only three indicators decreased their score. Rather unusually, the fall off in
    indicators has been mainly o n the top part o f the PEFA table (outturn in
    composition o f expenditures compared to budget and outturn in revenues compared
    to budget), whereas the improvement has occurred overwhelmingly on budget
    execution. T h i s i s important as a sound execution platform can assist greatly in
    improving the credibility o f resource flows to service delivery units. The only
    negative turning indicator on items other than outturns was PI-23, the availability of
    information on resources received b y service delivery units, due to the lack of
    Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys between 2005 and 2008. Additional reports
    on PFM systems include the IMF technical assistance missions on progress with
    PFM reforms in January 2008 and March 2009 (with participation by the Bank),
    and the G19 PFM Quality Assurance Group mission in March 2009. All the above
    studies noted improvements and continuing challenges in Mozambique's public
    financial management and fiduciary systems. They also identified specific action
    plans for dealing with weaknesses in coordinating support and policy dialogue on
    these issues. Government actions being supported by the PRSC series play a central
    role in helping to implement these action plans.

 e           Procurement. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was
         completed in 2008, and implementation o f some o f the main recommendations has
     '




         started. The assessment confirmed that since the previous CPAR conducted in
         2002, Mozambique has made significant progress in establishing the foundations o f
         a strong procurement system. In particular, Mozambique has made progress in the
         area o f developing the legal and regulatory framework for public procurement since
         the approval o f i t s decree 54/05 and the creation o f the regulatory body in 2006.
         The CPAR suggests that the government focus should now shift towards the
         implementation o f those rules and regulations, building the required capacity and
         adopting mechanisms to measure progress and performance. Government actions
         being supported by the PRSC series play a central role in helping to implement
         some o f the specific recommendations o f the report.

 e                                           n
              Financial Sector Analyses. I recent years the Bank has completed two formal
         financial sector assessments jointly with the IMF (FSAP). The May 2003 FSAP
         assessment found that the potential vulnerabilities o f the banking system lie mostly
         in i t s loan portfolio. I t also found that the volatility o f the Metical threatened
         financial sector stability. The 2009 FSAP update found that Mozambique has made
         significant progress toward developing and strengthening the banking sector,
         enhancing supervision, and improving central bank operations. Despite several
         government initiatives and legal and regulatory reforms, however, progress in
         financial deepening and access has been less satisfactory. K e y impediments include
         economy-wide, structural constraints to financial intermediation, which limit the
         number o f creditworthy clients and increase the costs o f financial services; and the
         lack o f competition in the banking system, which reduces deposit mobilization and
         contributes to high borrowing costs. The significant progress made in banking
         supervision needs to be consolidated by addressing remaining shortcomings. In
         particular, loan classification and provisioning, risk management guidelines and
         assessments, as well as the remedial action framework should be strengthened.

 e          Investment CZimate Assessment. The most recent I C A completed b y the Bank
         was in 2009. The previous I C A was done in 2003. The I C A uses as i t s primary data
         source an Enterprise Survey, which, for Mozambique, was undertaken in the first
         half o f 2008 and covered 599 micro, small, medium, and large firms. The analysis
         shows that the two most severe constrains to business operations are: competition
         from the informal sector (which i s a symptom o f the high costs associated with the
         regulation to which the formal sector i s subject) and access to finance. Other key
         constrains are: physical infrastructure, including the provision o f reliable energy,
         and weak governance structures-institutions, the r u l e of law, and security.

D. PLANNED LEVEL BUDGET
               OF     SUPPORT UNDER PRSC-6

55.    The program supported by the PRSC operations i s progressing well, as
reflected by Mozambique's uninterrupted record of good economic management,
the successful completion of the Joint Review in April 2009 and of the 4'h review of
the IMF PSI program in June 2009. The fourth review o f the IMF PSI was



                                              - 35 -
successfully completed in June 2009, and confirmed that the government's successful
reform effort has produced solid growth and price stability.2g As highlighted above, and
as was practice during the previous PRSC series, the progress on the (PRSC and the)
overall reforms program i s monitored with the aid o f the PAF, in the context o f the joint
donor (G19) mechanism for the provision o f general budget support. The Joint Review
2009, which was completed in April, has carried out an evaluation of performance during
2008. The Joint Review concluded that there exists a satisfactory basis for the donors to
continue to give budget support. Good progress was made in macroeconomic
management and in Public Financial Management, including the strengthening o f the
MTEF process, the start o f a pilot o f program budgeting (in three sectors for the 2008
budget), the continued roll-out and use o f e-SISTAFE, and the implementation of the
procurement system. Significant progress was also made in revenue collection and tax
administrations reforms, and towards the civil service salary reform. Progress was also
good in the human development sectors (health, education, water and sanitation, and
social protection), in the financial sector reforms, and in the implementation o f the road
sector program. A few areas o f weak performance were also identified. Notably, further
improvements in institutional capacity w i l l be needed to strengthen the mechanisms for
poverty monitoring and for the allocation o f public resources to strategic objectives, and
also to hasten the progress in reducing maternal mortality and chronic child malnutrition,
and to accelerate the HIV/ALDS prevention programs. Additional attention by the
government will also be required to improve the business environment, as well as to
maximize the benefits from the use o f natural resources, and to accelerate the
implementation o f the Anti-Corruption Strategy.

56.     I n order to assist the government to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis
the proposed amount of the PRSC-6 has been increased to US$110 million. This
level is higher than the US$85 million originally envisaged. The amount o f the following
two PRSC operations in this series i s currently envisaged to remain at around US$85-100
million, depending on continued good performance and the availability o f adequate IDA
             n
resources. I line with the Country Partnership Strategy, the amount o f the PRSCs w i l l
be approximately 40 percent o f the IDA envelope for Mo~arnbique.~'




29 The review  found that Mozambique's macroeconomic performance during 2008 has continued to be
strong despite pressures from high fuel and food prices. The government demonstrated its ability to
mitigate the impact of internal and external shocks with flexible policy responses, and reacted in an
effective and timely manner to higher fuel and food import prices in 2008 with an appropriate mix of fiscal
and monetary responses.
30 For comparison, the total level of budget support provided by the G19 external partners to the
government was USD458 million for 2008, and commitments for 2009 are USD485 million, and at 472
million for 2010. This amount corresponds approximately to 17 percent of the annual budget, and 30
percent of recurrent expenditures.

     VI. THE REFORM PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY THIS PRSC
                        SERIES
57. This section highlights the recent progress and future challenges in the reform
areas supported by the PRSC series, with a focus o n the proposed triggers for PRSC-6,
and indicative triggers for PRSC-7 and PRSC-8.31 A comparison o f the proposed prior
actions for PRSC-6 with the prior actions supported under the previous PRSC series i s
provided in Table 6. The table also includes indicative triggers for PRSC-7 and PRSC-8,
in as far as possible. As discussed earlier, it should be highlighted that the G19 PAF i s
somewhat out o f date and does not adequately cover important areas o f the government
reform program which are included in t h i s PRSC series, notably regarding the measures
the government i s taking to boost economic growth. The government fully recognizes
the importance o f these reform areas, and it has an active reform program which i s
reflected into and monitored through the annual instruments o f the Economic and Social
Plan (PES in Portuguese) and the BdPES (Ex-post Assessment of Implementation of the
                                                        n
PES), which are submitted annually to Parliament. I order to keep the PRSC series
within the parameters o f the G19 MOU, triggers related to such policy reforms are only
envisaged starting in PRSC-8, and have been introduced following the agreement with
other partners and government in the course o f the September 2009 "Planning Meetings",
which provided the forum to agree on the PAF indicators for the year 2010. The Bank
will continue to actively work to ensure that the critical measures that the government
plans to undertake to boost economic growth are reflected in the PAF indicators for
future years. The program document, however, already provides a description of the
main measures which have already been taken b y government to boost economic growth.

            MANAGEMENT
A. MACROECONOMIC

58.    Mozambique's good macroeconomic performance has been a key element o f the
excellent growth record in the past decade. M o v i n g ahead there i s a need to continuously
consolidate macroeconomic stability, strengthen public finance management, and
improve the allocation and efficiency in the use o f public resources. Without
improvements in these areas, the country's high growth rate w i l l be put at risk.

Improve the budget process and the use of public resources

The objective o these reforms is to strengthen the allocation o publicfinds through the
               f                                                f
budget preparation and execution process. The reforms have introduced the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as the key framework for medium term financial
planning and resource allocations, and the government is now in the process o adopting
                                                                              f
a programmatic budget classification to allow better links between PARPA, MTEF, and
budget allocations. I n the face o the current uncertainty facing Mozambique's economic
                                  f
prospects the legitimacy o the MTEF is under threat. The focus o the previous PRSC
                             f                                      f
                                                         f
series was initially on guaranteeing a minimum level o actual expenditures for priority
                                                   f
sectors, and then on supporting the alignment o the budget with the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This PRSC series will continue to support
strengthening o the budget and MTEF processes, and the steps to ensure closer
                 f
alignment between these two planning documents.

59.     There i s need to improve the links between the PARPA, the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework, and the budget, and to ensure adequate funding for
priority sectors. As the lagged impact o f the financial crisis generates some downside
risks to Mozambique's fiscal space, the authorities need to elaborate ways to do more
with fewer resources. A more strategic expenditure allocation and execution could
                           n
contribute to t h i s aim. I line with government efforts, there has been an improvement in
the level o f budget execution in recent years, and an increasing share o f the budget has
been allocated to priority sectors, as defined in PARPA 11. The government goal has
been to strengthen the MTEF to use it as the basis for the sectoral budget allocations, and
support programmatic implementation o f PARPA 1 . The quality o f the MTEF has
                                                         1
undoubtedly improved over the years since i t s introduction in 2006, when the 2007-2009
MTEF was subjected to Cabinet approval for the first time.32 In this context, the
government i s working to better develop the role o f the MTEF as a planning tool which
can b e adapted to changing circumstances, while continuing to work to improve the
underlying processes o f budget preparation and medium term planning. The most
important aspect i s that the development o f the budget reconciles with the baselines
developed in the MTEF, especially for outlying years, and deviations should be justified
(in budget formulation as well as execution). Aspart o the strengthening o the MTEF,
                                                          f                    f
the Ministry o Finance has ensured that the 2009 budget is in line with the first year
                f
o the 2009-2011 MTEF, in terms o the overall envelope, as well as for the aggregate
  f                                     f
allocation to priority sectors (prior action for PRSC-6).



        format o f MTEF had been used as an internal planning document since 200 1

60.      Despite the progress made in the elaboration of the MTEF over the years,
some significant challenges remain in order for the budget to be more closely
aligned with the PARPA and to contribute more to poverty reduction. There are s t i l l
a number o f weaknesses associated with this instrument, as reflected in the relevant
PEFA indicator (score o f C+ for PI-12, multi-year perspective in fiscal planning,
expenditure policy and budgeting, including a D on the dimension related to linkages
between investment budget and forward expenditure estimates), as well as the joint
review aide-memoire. The MTEF has s t i l l not progressed to being the instrument used to
facilitate strategic allocation and operational efficiency o f resources. This i s due to the
lack o f clarity o n the medium term resource envelope, notably for external funding. In
fact, there i s a significant gap between the scope and quality o f data in the MTEF
pertaining to the domestic versus the external component of the budget. The 2009-2011
MTEF mainly focuses on the domestic component, whereas the external component
finances half o f the budget. Excluding budget support, earmarked donor funds s t i l l
represent about 30 percent o f the budget - yet, in view o f data limitations, the ceilings
included in the 2009-2011 MTEF were only expressed in terms o f the domestic
component. This matters a great deal for the strategic impact o f the budget, because in
Mozambique, the actual composition o f spending differs significantly from budget
allocations (over 5 percent variance in excess o f aggregate deviations for two out o f the
three years under review in the PEFA, justifying a C on indicator PI-2), and most o f this
variance can be attributed to the external component o f the budget. Therefore, in order to
increase the likelihood that the budget as a whole contributes to the PARPA objectives, it
would be important to focus not only on appropriations o f the domestic component, but
also on i t s execution as well as on the appropriation and execution o f the external
component o f the budget.

61.     The government i s working to improve various key aspects of the MTEF and
the budget preparation and execution, including the quality of the external
component. In recent years the govemment has made a substantial effort to bring all aid
o n budget. However, while projections on common funds and direct budget support have
been fairly accurate, there has been substantial overoptimism regarding projects and
vertical funds. In collaboration with development partners, the government has
established and i s making use o f the ODAMoz database (http:\\www.odamoz.org.mz). A
challenge in recent years has been to ensure that all donors provide information to the
ODAMoz, so that it can offer transparent, accessible and complete information. The
ODAMoz now constitutes a prime information source on commitment and disbursement
in the external component o f the budget and it also contains relevant information for the
common funds (commitment and disbursement). The challenge i s now to improve the
quality and realism o f the information in ODAMoz, since accurate projections for the
external component are essential for the realism and usefulness o f the budget and the
medium-term expenditure framework as planning instruments. Following a simple
analysis o f the projects which under-disbursed in past years the government and donors
are working to develop specific criteria for the inclusion o f projects into the budget. In
addition, in the past two years the donors and govemment have made a strong push to
bring external projects onto the multi-currency Single Treasury Account (CUT), thereby
expanding the coverage o f expenditures administered directly through the e-SISTAFE.
Over time, this should improve the quality o f internal controls over expenditure,


                                            - 40 -
accelerate the reporting on project execution and improve i t s accuracy (see below).
Several donors have started to channel their project funds through the CUT, and the
World Bank i s at the forefront o f this process, with five projects already on-CUT or in the
process o f being rolled-in. The government i s committed to increase the percentage o f
external funds on-CUT, and has set a target o f 60 percent by end-2009. The government
objective i s to bring all donor projects on-CUT in the medium to longer term. T o this
end, the government has elaborated an on-CUT guide, with information on classification
and reports.

62.     The budget strategic planning process i s undergoing a transition from a
traditional focus on organic and economic classifications to a more programmatic
outlook, yet this transition is still largely incomplete. The quality o f MTEF and budget
submissions by sector ministries has been variable in the past few years-in most cases
                                                                                As
they are not the result o f costing and prioritization o f programs/a~tivities.~~ a result,
MTEF allocation decisions and ceilings are s t i l l too soft with not enough political clout
behind them. Whereas the 2009-201 1 MTEF was prepared using a programmatic format
for the domestic component o f the investment budget at the central level, the annual
budget for 2009 remained essentially prepared and expressed according to l i n e items,
using the traditional economic and administrative classifications. Clearly, there i s not a
one-to-one alignment between institutional / administrative structures and programs
derived from the PARPA. This misalignment, which exists at some stage in all countries
that introduce program budgeting, results in a disconnect between the MTEF and the
budget.

63.         Going forward, it would be preferable to pursue the gradual introduction of
the programmatic approach that i s contemplated by the authorities. This should help
to focus attention on the issue of budget execution, which i s an important part o f strategic
alignment, as well as o n the effect o f the execution o f donor projects on the overall
performance o f the budget, as a policy instrument. In addition to facilitate the l i n k s
between the strategic plans and the budget, the use o f the programmatic classifiers in
Budget Execution Reports would also substantially improve the monitoring o f the budget
execution. The Budget Division in the Ministry o f Finance in 2008 piloted the use o f
program budgeting classification in three sectors (public works, agriculture and interior),
and extended the pilot to the full budget in 2009. However, a review o f the initial pilot
has highlighted weaknesses with the classifiers, as reflected by the fact that a large
portion o f expenditures was classified under the category "other expenditures". The
Budget Division i s now working with sectors to resolve these problems, b y focusing on
improving the quality o f MTEF and budget submissions b y sector ministries through a
process o f costing and prioritization o f programs/activities at the sectoral level. Further
strengthening o f the budget preparation process and i t s alignment with the MTEF i s
needed to improve future budgetary performance and strategic resource allocation
(proposed triggers for PRSC-7 and PRSC-8). This will also make possible good quality
analysis of the efficiency in the use o f public expenditures. An essential aspect o f t h i s
w i l l b e to ensure that the programmatic approach i s applied consistently all the way from

33Mozambican legislation only envisages the use o f economic classifiers in budget preparation and
execution reporting.

planning to appropriation, execution and reporting. Programmatic classifiers for line
ministries are already available within e-SISTAFE, but these are currently severely
under-utilized. As discussed below, this i s part o f a broader agenda o f second-generation
P F M reforms that aim to fully realize the potential of the Integrated Financial
Management Information System successfully introduced as part o f the first generation o f
reforms over the past few years.

Improve the efficiency and effectivenessof public financial management

                 f
 The objective o this set o reforms is to implement the policies and procedures embedded
                           f
 in the SISTAFE PFM reform law. These reforms would result in sounder budgeting
practices, tighter internal controls, more efSicient cash management, more accurate
 accounting and reporting and auditing compliant with international standards. I n turn,
                                                               f
 these improvements are expected to result in creation o the fiscal space through
 efficiency improvements and better service delivery. One o the main steps in this
                                                                 f
 implementation process involves the setting-up o an integrated electronic financial
                                                     f
 management system (e-SISTAFE). During the past PRSC series, the government
 launched the software on a pilot basis, and progressively rolled it out to all ministries at
                                                       f
 central and provincial level, and to a large number o autonomous agencies. This PRSC
                                             f
 series supports increasing the utilization o e-SISTAFE to manage Mozambique's public
finances, paving the way for substantial improvements in accountability, transparency,
 and efficiency.

64.      Improvements in public financial management are essential for continued
economic growth id Mozambique. PFM i s essential to improved service delivery and
to the creation o f the fiscal space through efficiency improvements. The 2005 C E M
advocates that strengthening public financial management systems w i l l be critical for
growth in the next decade because: (i)   improved spending efficiency i s needed to achieve
better service delivery, which in turn i s needed to spur growth, particularly in
infrastructure, education and health; (ii) expenditure can no longer expand at the rate
                                           total
i t used to, making i t essential to secure efficiency improvements in the future; and (iii)
without steady improvement in public finance management the efficacy o f the high levels
o f donor funding may be put at risk.

65.     The government has embarked on a sequenced program of reform, and
Public Financial Management (PFM) systems have shown major improvements in
recent years. The 2006 PEFA assessment (published in 2006 and assessing performance
in 2004) highlighted the weakest areas o f public financial management systems to be
accounting, auditing, and procurement. Based on the 2006 PEFA assessment, the
authorities prepared and have been implementing the medium-term `Public Financial
Management Action Plan and Budget' (PFM-APB) for 2006-2009, which has been
agreed with the donors and i s financed through a multi-donor common fund. The APB i s
well-structured and the proposed phasing o f implementation i s ambitious but feasible.
The 2008 PEFA assessment (assessing performance up to 2006) highlights that
significant improvements have been made in the quality of PFM during the period 2004-
2006, in particular with the implementation o f the integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE). A summary o f the findings o f the 2008 PEFA

assessment i s provided in Section V.a above. As highlighted in Figure 3, the areas that
showed the most significant progress included payroll, procurement and internal controls,
cash management, revenue collection and management and donor practices, whereas
there was less progress o n the indicators pertaining to credibility o f the budget and
external oversight, and a slight deterioration on reporting due to the lack o f a Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) in the last three years. Areas for improvement
(rated D+ or below) included the oversight o f aggregate fiscal risk in the public sector,
the effectiveness o f tax collection, the availability o f information on resources received
by service delivery units, and the scope, nature and follow-up o f external audit. This
overall assessment was confirmed by the fiscal transparency ROSC conducted in 2007 b y
the IMF.

66.     The cornerstone of the authorities' action plan to strengthen Public Financial
Management i s the implementation of the integrated electronic financial
management system (e-SISTAFE).34The implementation o f the e-SISTAFE has been
proceeding rapidly, and the system became operational in 2008. Following an initial pilot
in 2005 (PRSC-3 prior action), the full version o f the Direct Budget Execution Module
was finalized and rolled out to all ministries at the central and provincial levels by end-
2007, and to the 31 districts which had the prerequisite infrastructure (PRSC-4 and
PRSC-5 prior actions).35Additional roll-out as o f end-December 2008 led to the inclusion
o f a total o f 50 districts and 25 autonomous institutions at central level. Hence the e-
SISTAFE system has now been comprehensively introduced across central government.
The roll-out was accompanied by an extensive training program, involving 1850 users
(more or less 6 users per Budget Execution Unit). Users have acquired good operational
skills and are now at a level o f being able to formulate requests for additional
functionality.

67.     Following the roll out of e-SISTAFE, the government has started to make the
transition towards a modern system of direct execution of the budget. Within the e-
SISTAFE reform, one o f the results with the highest impact in terms o f improvement in
Public Finance Management i s direct budget execution (according to the sequence o f
commitment, verification, and payment directly by bank transfer from the Single
Treasury Account), as t h i s increases transparency, improves information on public
spending and reduces the risk o f diversion of funds.36 The roll out and implementation o f
e-SISTAFE in all Ministries at central and provincial level has allowed the transition
from the previous system o f advance payments towards a modern system o f direct budget
execution. As o f end-2007 budget units started to make their payments directly b y bank
transfer from the Single Treasury Account, such that over 90 percent of goods and


34 The reforms started with the approval o f a new financial management law in 2001 and accompanying
regulations in 2002, which set the basis both for modern accounting procedures and for procurement
reform.
35 B y early 2008, e-SISTAFE had been rolled-out to all 25 Ministries and 7 State Organs (out o f a total o f
32) at central and provincial level, and a total o f 544 Budget Execution Units (UGEs, Unidade Gesfora
Executoru) across the whole country. Further, by March 2008 e-SISTAFE was successfully rolled out to
31 districts.
36 From September 2007 budget execution by `direct execution' became obligatory for all State institutions
with access to e-SISTAFE, and for all expenditures except overseas transfers and certain subsidy payments
(for example, payment o f funeral expenses). The direct budget execution modality stands in contrast to the
legacy system o f advances to spending units, which i s still in vigor for the parts of government that are not
connected to e-SISTAFE. Direct budget execution involves three phases or distinct steps in the expenditure
authorization process: the commitment o f the expenditure, its `liquidation' when resources are assigned for
payment and the actual payment, when funds are transferred directly from the Single Treasury Account
(CUT) to the bank account o f the supplier o f goods or services. When i t i s adequately implemented, the
direct budget execution modality ensures that the commitment, liquidation and payment o f expenditure are
authorized within e-SISTAFE by three different agents. These three agents are respectively in charge o f
budget execution (initiates the commitment and liquidation process), internal control (verifies compliance
o f the process and supporting documentation with rules and regulations), and financial execution
 (authorizes payment at the end o f the process). The segregation of duties between these three agents i s
 embedded in the design o f e-SISTAFE, as the three user profiles are mutually incompatible. The direct
 budget execution modality should also ensure that budget commitments remain within their respective
 ceilings, as the system blocks excessive commitments.

services and investments transactions o budget execution units are now carried out
live through e-SISTAFE (prior action for PRSC-6), leading to significant benefits in
terms o f improved information on public spending and build-up o f arrears, predictability
in the availability o f funds for expenditures and commitments by budget holders, and in
internal control and transparency.

68.    As a consequence of the e-SISTAFE there has been an improvement in the
credibility of the budget in terms of the deviation in the actual expenditure out-
turns compared to the budget (PEFA indicator PI-1).                         The results o f the
implementation o f e-SISTAFE are reflected in the improvements in budget execution
rates. The difference between the primary expenditure out-turn compared to the
originally budgeted (approved) primary expenditures (i.e. excluding debt service charges
and externally financed project e ~ p e n d i t u r e in recent years was 5.2 percent in 2004,8.0
                                                      )~~
percent in 2005, 2.4 percent in 2006, 3.0 percent in 2007, and 1.8 percent in 2008. The
improvements are also reflected in a smother distribution o f the budget execution
throughout the year, thereby avoiding the risk that a large share o f the budget i s spent in a
hurry and therefore has a lower impact.

69.     A second area of major improvement as a direct consequence of the
introduction of e-SISTAFE i s in the stock and monitoring of expenditure payment
arrears (PEFA indicator PI-4).38 The system o f registering and accounting for
expenditures (utilizing e-SISTAFE) records all commitments, all expenditures due for
payment resulting from the commitments made up until the end o f the fiscal year and all
uncleared advances. (All advances require a commitment, hence these must also be
recorded). Thus, there i s now a reliable and complete data on the stock o f arrears.
Whether expenditures are made through advances or through direct execution (direct
payment o f suppliers from the Single Treasury Account), it i s possible to know precisely
the value o f unpaid expenditure commitments. Further, the way the system i s conceived
does not permit the accumulation o f expenditure arrears in that the system temporarily
suspends or blocks the access o f budget execution units with uncleared commitments,
requiring the intervention o f a second (more senior) authorized expenditure agent to
undertake the cancellation (in the event that they are found to be erroneous), so as to
close the expenditure process opened by the original agent. Hence it i s anticipated that
with the extension o f direct budget execution, the level of expenditure arrears w i l l have
decreased significantly and that the system will automatically highlight irregularities so
that they can be speedily cleared.

70.    A third area of progress related to the SISTAFE reforms relates to the ability
of the authorities to obtain reliable, timely and relevant data on budget execution in
order to inform their budget decisions. The response to the food and fuel prices crisis
provides an illustration o f this. The authorities were able to identify USD46 million in
savings from reduced domestic and international travel b y a careful analysis o f the data
provided by e-SISTAFE. This example highlights the potential for efficiency savings and

37 I t i s important to distinguish between expenditures funded by domestic sources and expenditures funded
by Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), since the government has less (if any) control over the timing
o f ODA disbursements.
38 The score against this indicator increased from a "D+" to a "B+" during 2004 and 2006.

creation o f fiscal space associated with a more systematic analytical use of the data
produced b y e-SISTAFE. Other areas that could be targeted in future could include
vehicle and real-estate related expenditures.

71.     A fourth area of improvement i s that the accuracy and quality of the
informationin in-year budget-reportshas improved. As a result o f the live execution
of transaction in e-SISTAFE, transactions are now recorded in real time instead of at the
time o f replenishment o f the advance as was previously the case, and spending data i s
therefore more up-to-date and accurate. This i s reflected in an improvement in the
accuracy and quality of the information in in-year budget-reports (as reflected in an
improvement in the PEFA score for the third dimension o f PEFA indicator PI-23 from C
to B).

72.     A fifth area of significant improvement relates to the predictability in the
availability of funds for commitment of expenditures by budget holders (PEFA
indicator: PI-16).39 Predictability in resource flows is fundamental for budget holders to
be able to carefully plan and execute expenditures. Information on commitment ceilings
for the main budget holders (UGEs) i s provided through the e-SISTAFE system and
normally covers a period o f three months. The introduction o f a quarterly system o f
setting expenditure commitment ceilings through the e-SISTAFE system has been a
major factor bringing improvements in this aspect o f budget execution. The quarterly
system o f programming expenditure commitments through the e-SISTAFE system was
only introduced in 2006 and at the time o f the PEFA assessment the budget holding
entities were s t i l l learning how to use this programming. tool effectively. Since then,
budget holders have developed the use of this tool and with the expansion o f direct
budget execution, i t has become increasingly important. The increased use of direct
execution modalities (rather than execution through funds advances) has also facilitated
good cashflow management by the Treasury Directorate (DNT). Cash flow forecasts are
prepared for the fiscal year and are updated and monitored every week by the Treasury on
the basis o f actual cash inflows and outflow^.^'

73.    A sixth area of improvement i s in internal controls and reduced risk of
diversion of funds. The direct execution modality also results in the suppression of a
number o f commercial bank accounts that were previously used to hold cash advances.
This greatly reduces the risk o f misappropriation of funds, and streamlines internal

39The score against this indicator increased from a "D+" to a "C+" during 2004 and 2006.
40While there have been improvements in the predictability o f expenditure commitments, nevertheless over
the three year period o f 2004 - 2006, substantial within-year budget adjustments were frequently decided at
a management level above those o f the budget holding entities (the UGEs). During 2006, these adjustments
were made in a relatively transparent way, with the knowledge and involvement o f the UGEs. Nevertheless,
the scope o f these adjustments was relatively large, which necessarily reduced the level o f control o f the
UGEs over the process o f budget execution. Resolution o f this problem i s partly to do with improving the
quality o f budget preparation and analysis so as to increase the realism o f the budgets presented to the
National Assembly for approval. A more precise and more comprehensive Budget would reduce the need
for the regular and relatively large budgetary virements and re-allocations, which continue to characterize
the State Budget. In addition, the procedures for the management and reporting o f budgetary reallocations
needs strengthening so that these may be made at pre-defined periods o f the year, as part o f the quarterly
expenditure reporting process.

control procedures by avoiding the need for bank reconciliations to be performed in the
field.

74.     While the introduction of the direct execution through e-SISTAFE is already
bringing the above benefits, there are challenges related to the introduction of the e-
SISTAFE system in an existing paper-based culture, which limit its effectiveness.
There i s evidence that the actual use o f the system i s not always as envisaged in that the
execution o f goods and services often undergoes a dual process, partly manual and partly
automated. Often commitments are entered into vis-a-vis suppliers on the basis o f paper
processes and paper accounting books, without registering or authorizing a corresponding
commitment within e-SISTAFE. The goods or services would then be delivered and an
invoice would be received. At this point, the budget execution agent would enter the
commitment, liquidate the amount due and request the funds for payment in e- SISTAFE.
In terms o f internal controls, this means that the segregation o f duties and line items
controls embedded in the system are irrelevant when it comes to the upstream part of the
execution process (from commitment to liquidation). Expenditure could in theory be
committed over and above the corresponding appropriations. In practice, in some entities
an ad hoc system of reconciliation o f paper and IT balances has been put in place in order
to verify the amounts available for each line item. However, these types of reconciliations
depend on local initiatives and are prone to human error, if not fraud. In the same vein,
the commitment could occur without due process or adequate supporting documentation,
as the internal control agent's authorization i s not needed in order for the commitment to
be entered into. In order to tackle this problem the authorities intend to carry out a study
on a sample o f direct execution processes and verify the effective use o f the system. In
addition they plan to monitor t h i s phenomenon over time and identify areas (in terms o f
sectors and geographic location) where the problem is most prevalent in order to focus
efforts to resolve the problem.41

75.     Following the successful introduction of the e-SISTAFE, the government has
started working on complementaryreforms designed to make full use of the benefits
that the e-SISTAFE can deliver. I particular, the second generation o f reforms w i l l
                                      n
include integrating the payroll management and the revenue collection management in
the e-SISTAFE information management system. At present the payment o f salaries and
pensions continues to be executed centrally b y the accounting department o f the Ministry
o f Finance. A facility for making salary payments already exists within e-SISTAFE, such
that salary payment via e-SISTAFE started in the Ministry o f Finance in 2008 and i s
expected to be rolled out to other ministries during 2009 and 2010. The government
started to pay salaries for the Ministry o f Finance through the e-SISTAFE, and i s
planning to execute at least 10 percent o f payments for wages and pensions through direct
budget execution b y end-2009 (proposed trigger for PRSC-7).42 The government

41 This could be done by monitoring the proportion of invoices that are issued before the corresponding
commitment i s entered into the system.
42
   There are three different public sector payroll systems in Mozambique, serving the Southern, Northern,
and Central zones respectively. Since April 2008, salaries for 27 institutions, served by the payroll system
for the South Zone, have been paid through e SISTAFE, and a further 59 institutions were included by June
2009. Management of the public sector payroll systems for the other two zones (Central Zone and North

require the development o f an integrated electronic payroll management system (called e-
Folha), which w i l l automatically calculate salary entitlements and issue payment
requests. In addition, in 2007 the government has also developed a multicurrency module
for the single treasury account (CUT), to facilitate inclusion o f all donor-financed
projects on-CUT, and some donors have already brought projects on-CUT, while others
are considering it. Further, as mentioned above, the government started a pilot o f
program budgeting classification in i t s budget preparation and execution, so as to provide
sufficient detail to permit analysis o f poverty impacts o f government spending.

76.     Mozambique's fiduciary accountability has improved significantly in recent
years, but challenges remain. In addition to highlighting the significant progress during
2004-2006, the 2008 PEFA report emphasizes several remaining weaknesses and
challenges, for instance, in the monitoring of aggregate fiscal risk, and in the scope o f
follow-up actions o f external scrutiny and auditing. The main challenge i s to ensure the
sustainability o f the reforms and to realize the desired 'outcomes o f the reforms, in
particular through the consolidation o f the procurement reform and the deepening o f the
SISTAFE reform, and through the use o f instruments to improve the strategic allocation
of resources and improvement o f the system of internal control, financial records and
accounting, to bring about an improvement in fiscal transparency.

77.     Building on the main results and recommendations of the 2008 PEFA
assessment, a well a the 2007 ROSC on fiscal transparency, and the 2008 Country
              s         s
procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), the government i s preparing a new PFM
vision paper in 2009. The vision paper i s also being informed by the findings o f the
March 2009 IMF mission on progress with P F M reforms (in which the Bank also
participated) and the G19 PFM Quality Assurance Group mission in March 2009. The
draft PFM vision paper was discussed with donors in July 2009, and has since been
approved by the Minister o f Finance, and i t i s being finalized. The subsequent stage w i l l
be the preparation o f a detailed action plan, to be developed and agreed upon during
2009, which w i l l prioritize a series o f short and medium-term activities, as well as long
term structural reforms, in order to consolidate and deepen the developments in the public
finance management system.

Make the State procurementsystem for goods and services transparent and efficient
Over the past few years the government approved and introduced a new procurement
system that generally meets international standards o efficiency and accountability. The
                                                      f
approval o the new legislation in 2005 was followed by the creation and

and the beginning o a monitoring system. UFSA has been quite successful in asserting
itself as the central public procurement authority through capacity-building programs
and by disseminating tools that are essential for the efficient public procurement
operation (bidding documents and manuals). Further, UFSA has established a website
                          f
that provides a wealth o useful information on the legal and regulatory framework,
bidding documents, invitations to bid, and selected statistics on public procurement. This

78.      Substantial progress was achieved in 2006 and 2007 in the implementationof
the procurement reforms. Revised regulations governing procurement were approved
in December 2005 so as to promote competition and transparency. With the approval o f
the regulations, from an outdated and fragmented legal and regulatory framework,
Mozambique became equipped with a modern legal and regulatory framework, which i s
generally aligned to international good practice. A manual and a set o f (nine) standard
bidding documents and contracts based o n international standards exist. A new central
procurement institution, the Functional Unit o f Supervision o f Acquisition (UFSA), was
established and staffed, and became operational in 2006 (PRSC-3 prior action). A
director, staff and consultants have been appointed, and a website is also operational (at
http://www.concursospublicos.nov.mz). In addition, following the identification o f 776
Units for Execution and Management o f Acquisition (UGEAs) at central and provincial
level, a first set o f 472 UGEAs was established as o f end-2007. Hence, most o f the
activities envisaged as part o f second phase o f implementation o f the procurement
reforins have been completed (PRSC-4 prior action). These reforms were accompanied
by a comprehensive process o f capacity building in the application o f the new
procurement regulations, aimed at increasing the number o f specialized procurement
technicians. Specifically around 1860 technicians have been trained at central,
provincial, district and local municipality levels to facilitate the adoption o f the new
procurement system at the decentralized level. As a result o f these reforms, from a
situation where the standard procurement method was a noncompetitive process
(contractors selected from a list) and a nontransparent evaluation process, Mozambique
has now moved into a system based o n open competition as the default setting, and where
transparent and objective evaluation and qualification criteria are being created. Public
advertising i s now mandatory. Reflecting these improvements, development partners
increasingly rely on Mozambique's systems for National Competitive Bidding, with
fewer exceptions to the national regulations, and move to organically integrated project
implementation units.

systems in February 2008 based on the OECDDAC methodology. This exercise
served as the basis for the preparation o f a Country Procurement Assessment Review

79.     The improvementsin the legal and institutionalframework for procurement
has had an immediate impact in clarifying the circumstances in which non-.
competitive contract awards may be justified and in introducing a clear and
functional appeals and complaints system. As part o f the reforms, the government has
started the development o f a monitoring system to allow measurement o f the performance
of the reforms (prior action for PRSC-5). This builds on the requirement that under the
2005 regulations UGEAs are mandated to report procurement-related information,
including information on invitations for public bidding, information on direct contracting,
and justification and information on complaints. Available data on the methods o f
procurement applied for acquisitions above the small purchases threshold suggest a rapid
increase in the use o f competitive procurement systems: 7 1 percent o f contracts were
carried out through open bidding in 2006 and 85 percent in 2007. In the short term, the
government will continue to expand the operation o the procurement system (prior
                                                         f
action for PRSC-6 and proposed trigger for PRSC-7). Specifically, information on
public purchases available from UFSA shows that by end 2008: (i) least 88 percent o f
                                                                     at
contracts o f the public sector (and 95 percent in PRSC7) were subject to public tender in
accordance with the current Mozambican procurement legislation; (ii)       information on
other modalities of contract shows that due justification has been communicated to UFSA


                                                          - 50 -
in at least 90 percent o f cases; (iii) process for handling complaints by bidders, as
                                      the
defined in the current Mozambican procurement legislation, i s operational. In order to
deepen the implementation o f the Procurement Regulation (Decree 54/2005), and the
operationalization o f the procurement system, UFSA regularly carries out several key
activities. As o f end-2008, UFSA had carried out 138 supervision missions and trained
1860 technicians assigned to the UGEAs as well as economic agents in the area o f public
procurement and contracts. A total o f 779 enterprises related to public works, goods and
services providers have been registered in the Single Registry enabling them to
participate in public procurement. A total o f 950 UGEAs units for decentralized
procurement have now been established, in compliance with the approved models o f
organization and structure.

80.     As highlighted in the CPAR, however, there i s as yet no system in place to
ensure that all UGEAs systematically report procurement information to UFSA.
This highlights the need for a more robust management information system, which i s one
                                                       n
o f the major findings o f t h i s CPAR update report. I this context, to enable effective
procurement management and public monitoring, the government i s working to develop a
simple but strengthened M&E system, with a web interface to allow UFSA to collect data
directly from UGEAs through an electronic submission system, and track the
procurement performance o f the key ministries (indicative trigger for PRSC-8). Such a
Management Information System (MIS) will allow UFSA to track the procurement
performance o f the key ministries to ensure compliance and best value for money.

81.                                                                           n
         There are additional areas where more progress i s needed. I addition to
improving the availability o f reliable procurement information, the CPAR also
highlighted the need for an effective complaint mechanism to disclose abuse o f the
systems and allow for effective remedies while maintaining the efficiency o f the process.
Recognizing the sensitivity o f the issue, the CPAR made a number o f recommendations
as to how t h i s might be tested/developed. Also, the CPAR identified significant
challenges in the implementation o f the regulations and, therefore, highlighted the need to
establish a capacity-building system for public procurement mainstreamed into the
national systems. While the training program implemented by UFSA has played an
important role in the dissemination o f the rules and regulations o f the procurement
function, the time has come to adopt a more strategichstainable approach to capacity
building, including professionalization o f the procurement function through accreditation,
certification, and more targeted training. Hence the CPAR recommends (i)                the
development o f a strategic plan at national and subnational level for the training UGEAs
and private sector on implementing the Procurement legislation, including an improved
training regime; and (ii)    the development o f a specific professional career and
certification procedure within the public service for procurement specialists. The CPAR
also highlights the importance o f building an effective "coalition" within and outside the
government (civil society, private sector, media) to champion and ensure transparency
and integrity in public procurement and maintain the momentum o f the reforms. Finally,
there i s scope to further improve the legal and regulatory framework based on issues
identified under the CPAR and based on feedback from the experience acquired in
implementing the current regulations.

Increase coverage and efficiency of external audit bodies
                 f
The objective o these reforms is to increase efJiciency and accountability by
strengthening the external audit institution (Tribunal Administrativo, TA). I n order to
achieve this objective, this PRSC series w i l l continue to support increased capacity o the
                                                                                         f
TA to conduct audits and expand audit coverage. As capacity improves, the pedormance
o the TA has been increasing, and it is now increasingly respected as an independent
 f
and professional watchdog o public financial management.
                              f

82.     There has been some improvement in the external scrutiny and external
audit function in recent years. The TA i s involved in a process o f continuous
improvement embedded in a strategic action plan, with the technical assistance of
AFROSAI-e and other Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) and the support o f a multi-
partner common fund. The 2008 PEFA report indicated that the performance o f the TA
had improved between the 2006 and 2008 assessments on one o f sub-dimensions o f the
relevant indicator (PI-26), namely the timeliness o f submission o f the audit reports to the
legislature (from C to B). Yet there remains room for improvement in the scope and
nature o f the audit performed (from D to D), particularly in the compliance o f the TA's
audit work with international standards and the breadth o f work undertaken, and also in
the follow-up on audit recommendations (from C to C).

83.     The Report and Opinion on the Annual State Accounts i s completed within
the terms stipulated by law and i s available on-line. The Annual State Accounts
(Conta Geral do Estado, CGE), which are audited every.year by the TA, includes full
information on revenue, expenditure, financial assets and liabilities, at all level of
government. The good performance in this dimension i s marked b y the regular
submission o f the Report and Opinion o n the Annual State Accounts (Relatdrio e Parecer
sobre a Conta Geral do Estado) to the Parliament within the term stipulated by law since
the State Accounts o f 2004.43 These reports have also been made available on the web
page o f the TA.44There i s also substantial coverage o f the audit findings, and the related
Parliamentary discussion, in the local media. Further, a comparison o f the most recent
audit opinions (on the CGE for 2007, 2006 and 2005) with the earlier ones shows a
significant improvement in the comprehensiveness and quality o f the analysis. This i s
partly due to improvements in the quality o f the CGE itself but also seems to reflect a
strengthening o f the capabilities o f the TA.

84.     I n a well functioning system, as part of the preparation of the audit of the
Annual State Accounts, the Supreme Audit Institutions ( S A I ) carries out audit
activities to verify the data in the State Accounts. The scope o f the audit indicates the

43 Since 2004 the Annual State Accounts (Conta Geraf do Estado, CGE) has been audited each year by the
TA and an audit report has reached the National Assembly within 6 months o f receipt of the financial
statement (CGE) b y the TA, that i s 11 months after the end o f the corresponding fiscal year, which i s
compliant with Mozambican legislation (Article 50, Law 9/2002). This performance i s very good in the
African context.
44 Following approval by Parliament, the Annual State Accounts and the relevant audit report by the
Supreme Audit Institution are made available at the following internet address:

entities and sources o f funds that are audited in any given year. Where SA1 capacity i s
limited, the audit program may be planned by the SA1 in line with legal audit obligations
on a multi-year basis in order to ensure that most important or risk-prone entities and
functions are covered annually, whereas other entities and functions may be covered less
frequently.

85.     Substantial progress has been made over the past few years in improving the
capacity and performance of (verification) audit activities. T o inform the preparation
of the audit o f the Annual State Accounts, the Mozambique's Supreme Audit Institution
(Tribunal Administrativo, TA) regularly carries out verification audits o f the accounts o f
various public institutions at central and decentralized level. The number of such
verification audits realized b y the TA the has increased substantially over the past few
years, in parallel with i t s capacity:
 Year                       2003         2004         2005        2006         2007        2008
 Number of audits             5           29           69          168         36 1         350

The number o f verification audits carried out in 2006 was 168, o f which the auditors
completed 115 audit reports (PRSC-4 prior action). O f these, 55 audits were carried out
in the districts, for the first time, In addition, 45 audit re orts were judged in the course
o f 2006, which compares with 11 in 2005 and 4 in 2004.b: In 2007 the number o f audits
carried out by the TA more than doubled to 361, from which the auditors completed 281
reports, widely surpassing the target o f 90 financial audit reports (prior action for PRSC-
5). All o f the 128 districts have been audited at least once by the TA.

86.    While the increase in the number of verification audits by the TA i s
impressive, the scope of these audits remains limited, a it is estimated that in 2007
                                                         s
they covered approximately 26 percent of total expenditure^.^^ Building on the recent
progress, in line with the findings of the PEFA assessment, the TA has therefore shifted
the focus from the number of verification audits to expanding the share o f the State
Budget covered by the verification audits (in terms o f the budget administered by the
entities subject to the audits), such that the TA will continue to expand its coverage of
                                                             f
the State Budget in accordance with the technical norms o INTOSAI and according to
the Mozambican legislation4' to at least 30 percent in 2008 (prior action for PRSC-6)
and at least 35 percent in 2009 (proposed trigger for PRSC-7).4a Beyond this focus on


45 The judgment i s the final stage o f the audit (and results in either the acquitting or the attribution o f
financial responsibility).
46 In line with the definition used in the PEFA, t h i s percentage refers to the amount expenditure o f the
entities covered b y annual verification audit activities. I t does not refer to the sample o f transactions
selected b y the auditors for examination within those entities, which i s substantially smaller (and varies b y
size o f the institution and level o f risk identified b y the TA). The coverage i s calculated b y dividing the
sum o f aggregate expenditure o f the audited institutions by the aggregate expenditures of the State Budget
(as a percentage).

   According to the PEFA (indicator PI-26), the annual audit activities carried out by the Supreme Audit
Institution deserve a score o f "A" when they cover all entities o f central government; a score o f "B" when
they cover at least 75 percent; a score o f "C" when they cover at least 50 percent; and a score o f "D', when
they cover less than 50 percent.

increasing the scope o f the external audit, i t will be important for the TA to move towards
a risk-based approach to the selection of the institutions audited and the size o f the
verification sample in each given institution. W h i l e the TA i s interested in moving
toward a risk-based approach, at present the TA's auditors lack familiarity with risk-
based audit techniques. Further, none of i t s staff are qualified as chartered accountants or
accounting technicians, and as a result the TA's financial audits are not conducted in
compliance with international standards on auditing. In this context, the TA i s working
with development partners to create the capacity necessary to provide i t s auditors with
international technical and professional qualifications so as to better carry out i t s
            n
mandate. I particular, the Bank has recently approved an IDF grant in support of the
training and certification to international standards o f the TA's auditors.

87.     The response to the audit findings remains limited, however. The
Mozambicah system empowers the TA to impose fines or to recommend corrective
actions as a result o f i t s departmental audits. In practice, however, the follow up i s
largely limited to future audits by IGF and by TA specifically to verify the
                                                 n
implementation o f such recommendations. I terms o f the audit o f the CGE, it i s the
Parliamentary Committee on Finance and Planning that recommends follow-up measures
and a report on their implementation i s included in the TA's audit report (parecer) for the
following year's CGE. There i s thus a formal response and follow-up to the TA's report
and opinion on the CGE. Going forward, the TA and Parliament will need to build on
this existing mechanism to ensure a more in-depth follow-up of audit findings, including
detailed statistics on rates o f implementation o f the TA's previous recommendations.
 88.     Significant additional challenges remain in improving the functioning of
external audit. While the focus has been on quantitative aspects o f the TA's work, a
 growing discrepancy has appeared between the number of audit reports concluded and
the corresponding number o f judgments issued. As a result, the TA calculated that the
 average number o f days between the initiation o f an audit and the issuance o f the final
judgment now exceeds 500. This discrepancy greatly reduces the accountability o f
 managers o f the entities audited, as well as the impact o f the TA's work. I t should be
kept in check b y a careful analysis o f the business processes involved in these timelines,
 as well as an increase in the number of financial judges (a recent law has doubled their
number to 6 from the initial 3). I t i s important that action i s taken to reduce the relative
 delays in evaluation and judging o f the audit processes, and to achieve an acceptable pace
 in the completion o f audit processes. Holding people accountable and responsible i s an
 essential element to build-up credibility in the system. It i s also important for the TA to
 use the mechanisms at i t s disposal to impose sanctions and, when necessary, to forward
 to the prosecuting authority those processes that contain indications o f crimes committed.
 In this context, it will be important to institute a formal process for following up on
 government's action to address the issues identified in the audits. Although some actions
 are taken as a result o f external audits, no systematic follow-up i s undertaken regarding
 the implementation o f the recommendations. Finally, in support o f achieving broader
 dissemination and buy-in for audit reports, the government should look to civil society to
 help find champions to promote these initiatives. For instance, Civil Society
 Organizations (CSOs) should be encouraged to provide a non-government perspective o f

recommend changes where possible.

Improve human resources manapement in the public sector

 The objective o these reforms is to improve the management o the payroll and civil
                  f                                                 f

full census o the civil service, integrated payroll management within e-SISTAFE, and
              f
                            f
 created a single registry o State officials and civil servants (Cadastro dos Funciona`rios
Publicos, CAF). As a result o the reforms, in recent years Mozambique has
                                     f
 operationalized an electronic database o all civil servants, which can be used in the
                                            f
 management o the civil service human resources, and will also improve the management
                f
                    f
 and transparency o the salary payments. Building on this basis, under this PRSC series,
 the government has started a comprehensive review o civil service wages and pensions
                                                         f
                                                                    f
 system, which will contribute to reshape and improve the quality o the civil service.

89.      There has been important progress in the area of civil service reforms. The
government created the Ministry o f C i v i l Service (MCS) in October 2007. The M C S i s
responsible for the policies related to the management o f the human resources in the
public sector, control and inspection o f the public service, organization o f the public
administration, as well as the program o f reforms o f the public sector. As part,of i t s
activities the M C S carried out a detailed census o f civil servants in 2007 (PRSC-4 prior
action). The realization o f the census has allowed the creation o f a single registry o f State
Officials and Public Servants in 2007 (Cadastro Unico dos Funciona`rios Publicos, CAF;
PRSC-5 prior action). The C A F i s an integrated database that allows the development
and implementation o f features that support the strategic management o f human
                                         As
resources, including the p a y r ~ l l . ~ ' a result, the government i s now able, in real time, to
tell how many civil servants there are, by grade and region, and ministry.

90.      More recently the government has started to focus on the reform of the
public sector wages and pensions. The government had postponed the preparation o f
the new salary policy until after the availability o f data from the 2007 census o f civil
servants, since the preparation o f a new salary policy required having a reliable
information basis on the human resources o f the State. Following preparation during
2007 and 2008, the new medium term salary policy was approved by the Council of
Ministers in September 2008 (prior action for PRSC-6). The guiding principles o f the
new policy are: (i) simplify and rationalize the salary scales across ministries, and to
                    to
increase transparency and fairness, including b y integrating the remunerative allowances
(notably the `subsidio tecnico') into the base salary; (ii) decompress the salary scales,
                                                          to
in order to improve the remuneration in line with qualifications, competence,

49The government i s in process to move towards a fully computerized Human Resources system including
payroll. Such a system would involve several components: (i)database (called e-CAF) with information
                                                                a
on all public service employees was created in 2007, based on the data from the 2007 census of civil
servants; (ii)human resources management system (called e-SLP), which i s in process of being developed;
              a
  i ipayroll system for calculating salary entitlements and issuing payment requests (called elfolha), which
(i)
remains to be developed; and, (iv) a facility for making salary payments, which already exists within e-
SISTAFE.


                                                  - 55 -
responsibility and experience; (iii) reform the system o f locality subsidies and develop
                                   to
a new housing policy with a view to incentivize staff mobility and attract personnel to the
local level (in line with the ongoing administrative deconcentration); and, (iv) to
harmonize the salary policy with the pensions system and ensure the existence of a
pensions systems able to facilitate the retention o f personnel and provide an adequate
living standard for pensioners.

91.     The government has immediately started the implementation of the new
wage policy with a salary decompression in 2009, which i s consistent with medium-
term fiscal sustainability. The salary `decompression' implemented for the public
sector entails increases ranging from 14 percent for the lowest paid civil servants to 28
percent for the better paid, and substantially changes the salary structure o f the
Mozambican civil service. W h i l e fiscal sustainability i s one o f the tenets underpinning
the new wage policy, the government recognizes that there may be risks associated with a
salary decompression, especially at a time o f fiscal constraint. In general, there i s a risk
that an unplanned expansion in the size o f the public sector and its wage bill might limit
the scope for fiscal management and compromise the sustainability o f the current
economic growth path. A situation where a large fraction of public expenditures i s
incompressible in the short run, such as payroll and pension expenditures, could create
the necessity o f meeting expenditure obligations through new borrowing, including
borrowing from domestic markets. In turn this would compromise the macroeconomic
scenario, possibly crowding out private sector growth, and thereby undermine the
objectives that the reforms aimed to achieve in the first place, namely accelerating
                                                     n
economic growth and improving service delivery. I order to ensure fiscal sustainability,
therefore, the government initially set a ceiling for the cost of the reform in 2009, and
plans to prepare a detailed estimate o f the implementation o f new pay policy for the fiscal
years 2010 to 2012. This w i l l include an assessment o f the effects on the pensions bill as
a result o f integrating the remunerative allowances into the pensions bill calculation and,
the effects o n the wage bill of implementing the locality subsidy. In addition, the
government has also started diagnostic work to prepare a pensions reform, which i s
expected to be approved in 2010 (indicative trigger for PRSC-8).


B. ECONOMIC
          DEVELOPMENT

92.      Accelerating shared growth requires improvements in the climate for private
sector development, adequate infrastructure, improved smallholder productivity, and
tackling key challenges such as the impact o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the need to
improve significantly the management o f natural resources. This PRSC series focuses on
removing constraints to private sector development, by introducing reforms to deepen the
financial sector and improve access to credit, improving the operation of the land law to
facilitate access to land, and simplifying the excessive regulation constraining business
development. As discussed above, while the government has been implementing several
measures to boost economic growth, these reforms are not yet reflected in the PAF. The
Bank i s working intensively with government and development partners to expand the
coverage and relevance o f the PAF in the area of economic growth b y including key
measures to improve the business environment and to improve access to and use o f land.

Improve access to credit for private firms
Limited access to credit is a key constraint to business development in Mozambique. This
PRSC series focuses on reducing information constraints for commercial banks by
supporting improvements in accounting and reporting standards through the
implementation o International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the corporate
                 f
sector. Improving access to credit will also require additional measures to improve the
       f
level o competition in the banking sector, diversify the financial services and products,
and to strengthen the judicial system.

93.     The 2009 Investment Climate Assessment has highlighted that access to
finance i s one of the top two constraints to private sector growth. Access to finance
was the second most often cited obstacle to business operations by Mozambican firms
and i s confirmed as a key obstacle through empirical analysis linking the access to
finance indicators to firm-level productivity in Mozambiq~e.'~ empirical analysis of
                                                                The
the ICA, taking into consideration demand factors, found a highly credit constrained
environment: more than two-thirds o f the sample was credit constrained. The 2009 I C A
and 2009 FSAP pinpoint a number of reasons that hold back progress in financial
intermediation, including: (i) limited competition in the banking sector; (ii) of basic
                                                                             lack
infrastructure; (iii)unaffordable or irrelevant financial products; (iv) weak legal and
regulatory framework, and (v) information constraints.

94.     To address the `information constraints', there i s a need to improve financial
reporting infrastructure for the private sector. According to commercial banks the
absence o f reliable financial statements in the private sector i s a major constraint for them
to provide credit to a large number o f firms. The absence of reliable financial statements
in the private sector reduces the potential for cash-flow based lending. Banks and
financial institutions are compelled to rely on collateral even when reliable financial
                                                                             n
statements might have otherwise facilitated cash-flow based lending. I this context, the
government has hired an internationally renowned auditing firm to assist them in the
implementation o f International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the corporate
sector. There are a number o f complex activities that w i l l be undertaken including dealing
with the impact o f implementing P R S o n the tax administration system. As a first step,
with the assistance o f the consulting firm, the government has prepared the IFRS
Strategic Implementation Plan (proposed prior action for PRSC-6). Reflecting the
strong commitment to the introduction o f the IFRS, the required legislation adjusting the
Tax Code to be consistent with the adoption of the IFRS in the corporate sector has been
approved by the Parliament in M a y 2009."            Thus, the starting date for the IFRS
implementation in the large f i r m s i s expected to be January 2010 (indicative trigger for
PRSC-8).''      Improving the availability o f reliable financial statements o f small and

   The approval by Parliament o f the relevant legislative package in May 2009 would be a much better prior
action to reflect Mozambique's decision to introduce the IFRS. However, since it i s not included in the
PAF, unfortunately the Bank team cannot use it as a prior action in this PRSC series.
52 Preparations for implementing I F R S are extensive and complex. I t usually takes companies at least 12
months to prepare since IFRS requires complete restructuring o f the company's balance sheet, and
retraining o f all finance and accounting staff. I F R S for large companies (those with more than 500


                                                  - 57 -
medium-sized enterprises is also important. However, particular attention w i l l need to be
given to adapting the IFRS to suit the reality o f smaller f i r m s in Mozambique, which w i l l
require additional time, and therefore the starting date for the I F R S implementation for
medium sized f i r m s i s expected to be January 2011.

95.     Building the capacity of the professional accountancy body will also
contribute to the enhancement of the quality of corporate financial reporting. At
present, all the corporate entities in Mozambique, including investments with foreign
participation, are affected by a serious shortage o f qualified accountants and trained
accounting technicians.     SMEs are especially affected. The recently concluded
Accounting and Audit ROSC highlights the need to build capacity for the newly
established professional accountancy body (Order o f Professional Accountants o f
Mozambique). This would allow the new professional body to function as a modern
professional accountancy body, including launching o f a professional qualification
examination in Mozambique.

Strengthen the social securitv system

                   f
 The objective o these reforms is to ensure the financial sustainability o the social
                                                                             f
 security system, and to ensure the adoption o best practice and transparency in the
                                               f
                                                                                 f
 management o the social security funds, and thereby to facilitate a deepening o the
                 f
financial sector in Mozambique. I n recent years the government commissioned the
                                                         f
preparation o an actuarial`study and the elaboration o an investment strategy for the
               f
National Institute for Social Security (INSS). The results o the study, however,
                                                                 f
 highlighted severe shortcomings in the financial and monitoring data available at the
 INS. The study has also highlighted the need for signifcant reform in the management
 o INSS and the social security funds, which the government is in the process o
  f                                                                                  f
 addressing. This PRSC series therefore supports the reform process at the INSS.

96.     The government has undertaken a broad program to strengthen the social
security system in Mozambique. In order to improve the system's management and
reorganize the social security system, the government has revised the legal framework for
social protection, which resulted in parliamentary approval o f the new Law on Social
Security in 2007. However, implementation of the law i s facing difficulties, and there are
serious shortcomings in the operation and governance o f the sector. The government also
commissioned an actuarial study on the social security system, which was completed in
early 2008 (PRSC-5 prior action). The preparation o f the actuarial study, however, has
highlighted significant data gaps at the INS. The current institutional capacity o f the
INSS i s weak. Records for the entire system are s t i l l manual, although efforts to
introduce an IT system are underway. In addition, the INSS has not published i t s
financial statements since 2004. Weak institutional capacity and lack o f reliable financial
statements precludes an accurate assessment o f the financial situation o f INSS. This

situation prevents the full determination o f potentially significant fiscal and private
liabilities.

97.     A comprehensive, structured set of interventions i s urgently needed to
improve the situation at the INSS, which i s the backbone of the pension system. The
first priority i s to introduce an IT system and create and electronic database o f all
pensioners and contributors (indicative trigger for PRSC-8), improve administration,
establish the value o f the investment portfolio, and prepare and publish financial
statements. Concurrently, steps should be taken to improve registration o f contributors
and claimants and strengthen collection o f contributions. Cooperation with the tax
administration would be key in this regard. Once the financial situation o f INSS i s
clarified, a new accurate actuarial study should be carried out to assess the long-term
viability o f the system, with a view to determining whether parametric changes to
contributions or benefits are required. Last but not least, INSS should be subject to
independent supervision and develop an explicit investment strategy. At present the INSS
has n o investment strategy, and no internationally accepted valuation o f i t s existing
investments. The government commissioned a new investment strategy in 2008, and the
report has only recently been finalized. The strategy i s expected to be approved and
implemented starting in 2010. Under the strategy, assets o f the funds should be invested
with the sole objective to safeguard the benefits o f future pensioners. In addition, once an
investment strategy i s in place, INSS should consider outsourcing i t s investment
management.

98.     As part of the reforms, the government i s also preparing a reform to regulate
the private pension funds, to complement the reform of the Social Security System.
A consultancy firm has been contracted to elaborate the Regulatory Decree on the
Pension Funds, and a report i s expected in 2009. In addition, the government should
consider measures to stimulate the development o f supplementary private pension funds.
Options include tax incentives and capping benefits under the obligatory tier to encourage
participation in supplementary schemes.

Improving the operation of the land law and facilitating access to land

Mozambique's overall land-related policy and legal framework is sound; there are,
                                              f
however, some gaps in the implementation o relevant laws and regulations. These key
                f
gaps are lack o clarity, limited capacity and unclear institutional arrangements, and low
land tax and associated distorted incentives for land access. These implementation gaps
result in significant unfavorable consequences, which undermine the original legislative
intentions o the law, such as encouraging land speculative activities, ineffective land use
            f
                                        f                                f
planning and associated difliculties o dealing with large numbers o application for
concessions, and emerging inconsistency between land policies and other initiatives.
Given the overall soundness o the policy and legal framework, the focus o the reforms
                               f                                             f
supported in this PRSC series is, therefore, to improve implementation instead o revising
                                                                                  f
laws and regulations.

99.   The acquisition of land lease (administered by the State) has been identified
as a major obstacle to business development, both in various enterprise surveys


                                            - 59 -
conducted by the World Bank as well as in sector-specific studies undertaken for the
2009 CEM. Not only are investors turned away by the sheer complexity o f navigating
through the allocation system o f land use rights (DUAT), but the carrying cost o f their
capital while waiting for the necessary approvals makes i t unappetizing to invest in
Mozambique. The urban land system i s also not geared to absorb large influxes o f rural
labor migrating to urban industrial areas. Coastal land with high potential for organized
tourism development remains undeveloped, yet only about an estimated 10 percent o f the
coastal areas are available for additional lease.

100. Mozambique's overall land-related policy and legal framework i s sound;
there are, however, some gaps in implementation of relevant laws and regulations.
These implementation gaps result in significant unfavorable consequences, which
undermine the original legislative intentions o f the law, such as encouraging land
speculation, ineffective land use planning and associated difficulties o f dealing with large
numbers o f application for concessions, and emerging inconsistency between land
policies and other initiatives. In order to improve the implementation o f the existing land
law, the 2009 C E M recommends that the government should: (a) take measures to
facilitate a better understanding, better dissemination, and more capacity building for
improved implementation o f the Land Law; (b) undertake systematic delimitation o f all
local community lands in rural areas, starting with priority areas with relatively high land
use value; (c) disseminate, simplify, and further improve guidelines for consultations with
communities; (d) systematically adjudicate and title urban, peri-urban, and high use value
plots in rural areas; (e) enforce collection o f existing land tax, raise the rates without
affecting smallholder rural producers, and decentralize collection to the district level; and
( f ) conduct comprehensive rural zoning/land use planning for supporting informed
decisions and exploiting Mozambique's development potential.

101. Government i s taking steps to achieve better consensus about the
interpretation of the law and implementation issues. Some public officials believe
that Communities obtain rights only after Communities obtain approval for the
registration o f their use right. The October 2007 revised Article 35 o f Land Law suggests
that Communities are now subject to the same 3-tier approval system o f development
plans as investors. However, the Constitution and the Land Law clearly state they
already have those land use rights and can ask for formalizing if they wish. There i s
                                                                                 n
therefore a need to increase clarity o n the interpretation o f the land law. I order to
achieve better consensus, with support by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC),
the government plans establish National Land Policy Dialogue Platforms in 2009 with
full stakeholder participation. These forums w i l l constitute an avenue to involve all
stakeholders in a forward-looking policy dialogue regarding the implementation o f the
land law.

102. There i s a need to take steps to discourage land hoarding and to promote
efficient land use. Justified concerns about speculative acquisition o f large amounts o f
land have led Mozambique to adopt a regulatory framework that l i n k s award o f DUATs
to specific conditions on land use and revokes such rights in case the conditions are not
honored. International experiences show that such an approach i s administratively
difficult' and costly to implement and susceptible to discretion that can undermine


                                            - 60 -
investor confidence and security o f land rights. Increasing rural land taxes (possibly
differentiated b y land qualityhoning) w i l l be a more incentive-compatible way of
encouraging efficient land use. There i s a need to enforce collection o f existing land tax,
raise the rates, and decentralize collection to the district level. Rates should be designed
to exempt small land holders and communities and should be adjusted regularly
according to inflation. In addition it i s desirable that a share o f the tax revenues should
remain with the local authorities or district, which would also incentivize collection.
Similarly, urban land i s a very valuable asset, but currently only fixtures are taxed and
land itself i s exempted. This poses a significant problem for both idle land and for the
taxation o f small constructions located in large plots. Taxation o f urban land provides
incentives to put land to an efficient use. Thus under the current situation there i s a very
big forgone opportunity to use land more efficiently, improving both the economic use o f
land and increasing revenue yield. Merely improving the collection rate on issued
DUATs i s likely to lead to the land voluntarily being given back to the State. Enforcing a
simple land tax could be the most efficient way to reduce speculation in undeveloped
land, clarify ownership o f the land use rights, and make productive land available to
investors. I t h i s context, the government has started a process to review land taxes. The
             n
Council o f Ministers approved in September 2008 a decision to give mandate to the
Ministry o f Agriculture to explore a possible reform o f the land taxation system. Once a
clear data-base o f DUATs i s available, i t w i l l be possible to empirically explore the
revenue potential o f such a measure, as well as implications o f measures to facilitate the
transferability o f land use rights. This could then result in the approval o f a reform o f the
land taxation system in 2010 (indicative trigger for PRSC-8).

Improving the business environment by simplifying the regulatory framework

 Mozambique has a vast, diversified export potential, inchding in mining, energy,
 agribusiness, fishing, forestry, tourism, light manufacturing and services serving as a
`gateway to neighboring countries. The challenge for Mozambique is how to sustain high
 growth and reshape its pattern to generate more employment by exploiting all these
 export opportunities. A number o constraints have to be addressed to exploit these
                                     f
 export potentials, including macro environment, factor markets, trade logistics,
 institutions supporting exports, and professional services. This PRSC series focuses on
                  f
 one key aspect o the business environment, namely the excessive regulatory framework.

103. Facilitating firms to take advantage of existing export opportunities will also
lead to increases in productivity and investment. The I C A 2009 presents estimates o f
productivity and wage exporter premiums for Mozambique and i t s comparator countries,
for the subsample o f African countries, and for Mozambique alone. Results by and large
confirm the idea that exporters perform "better."53 In fact, exporters in Mozambique have
a labor productivity that is 135 percent higher than nonexporters, when measured as sales
per worker, and 145 percent higher when measured as value added per worker. I            f
measured using TFP, Mozambican exporters are 85 percent more productive than

53Research on the relationship between exports and firm growth has firmly established that the two are
highly positively correlated, while the direction of causality between them remains less certain. Some
studies point to evidence that exporting exposes firms to knowledge and competition that pressures them to
become more productive.


                                                  - 61 -
nonexporters, and wages paid are also 67 percent higher for exporters. This difference in
performance between exporters and nonexporters seems to be larger in Mozambique than
in other comparator countries: the coefficients for both sets of pooled countries are
smaller than for the regression with Mozambique alone. If we take the hypothesis that
more productive f i r m s self-select into exporting, these results may suggest that costs,
taken broadly to mean barriers to reaching foreign markets, may be much higher in
Mozambique than in the other countries. Only highly productive enterprises may be able
to overcome these barriers. If we take the opposite hypothesis, o f learning by exporting,
these results show the potential benefits that an export-driven strategy can bring to the
Mozambican economy.          .


104. The overall regulatory framework in Mozambique i s very unfriendly to small
and medium enterprises: licensing, inspections, red tape are a heavy burden.
Looking at factors holding back more rapid growth, one theme that has consistently been
raised in all the sectors that have been analyzed in the 2009 C E M i s that rather than
facilitating and regulating economic activities, the government has a "control and punish
mentality". The risk i s high under such a setting for the private interest o f civil servants
to cloud efficient decision making through rent-seeking. It i s critical to change the
mentality from "control and punish" towards "facilitate and regulate".

105. The government wants to accelerate progress in removing red tape, and
simplifying the business environment in 2009 and 2010. Mozambican firms are
currently subject to excessive operational licensing, inspections (labor, health,
environment), and red tape that constrains the ease o f doing business. The government
approved a new strategy to improve the business climate in early 2008. However,
implementation o f the strategy has been slow. For instance, while Mozambique i s
committed to improve the business environment and has set itself the goal to be best
among SADC countries in the Doing Business Indicators by 2015, it actually dropped
one position in the DBI ranking amongst SADC members from 2007 to 2009. This
indicates that other countries have improved their business environment faster than
                n
Mozambique. I 2009 a series o f "Quick Business Reform Areas" have been identified,
which can be fast tracked, improving the procedures for private sector f i r m s in starting
and running a business, trading across borders, registering property, dealing with licenses,
                                 n
and closing a business (Box 6). I t h i s context, government i s planning to fast track these
measures, and plans to approve five reforms before the end o f 2009, and to finalize the
remaining seven measures before the end o f 2010.

106. As part of the above reform push, the authorities are taking steps to unify the
business inspection regime and to improve bankruptcy proceedings, which presently
                                                           n
constitute major obstacles for businesses development. I July 2009 the Council o f
Ministers approved the decree on unified inspections for business activities, which paves
the way for the establishment o f a new unified inspection agency (for all inspections
except tax and labor inspections). This reform w i l l address a key concern o f private
                     n
sector associations. I addition, a new bankruptcy law has been submitted to Parliament

and i s expected to be approved by the new Parliament (after the elections) in 2010.54
Delays in bankruptcy proceedings are one o f the reasons for limited access to credit. I t
takes 5 years on average to solve a bankruptcy case through the court in Mozambique.
The new law w i l l provide a clear and simplified legal framework for bankruptcy
proceedings, which i s a first step towards faster resolution o f bankruptcies. Without
improvement in the court services it wi l l be difficult to implement successfully this type
o f law, however. Judicial administrative reform i s needed to improve the functioning of
courts and the services courts provide. Hence, as the capacity o f the judicial increases, it
will also be necessary to establish specialized courts. At present, judges lack familiarity
with bankruptcy proceedings. Creating specialized courts can improve judges' expertise
in this area and improve efficiency.

107. There i s growing consensus in Mozambique that it is time to consider bolder
and more aggressive reforms to reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation. Hence
the government has decided to carry out a comprehensive regulatory reform in 2010,


54 Neitherthe establishment o f a new unified inspection agency nor the preparation o f the new bankruptcy
law are included in the PAF, and therefore the Bank team cannot use them as a prior actions.

focusing on business-related licenses and regulations (indicative trigger for PRSC-8)?5
The goal o f regulatory reforms i s to reduce the political and administrative costs o f
rapidly eliminating large numbers o f unneeded rules. Countries face an enormous task of
reviewing and updating .the legacy o f laws, rules, and other instruments dating back
decades. In this respect the government i s considering establishing an inter-ministerial
team to study the `guillotine' approach which has been used in other countries that have
successfully implemented this type o f reform and learn from their experiences (such as
Kenya, Korea, Mexico, Ukraine, inter alia).56

c. THE AGREEDPRIOR ACTIONS FOR PRSC-6, AND INDICATIVE TRIGGERS FOR
PRSC-7 AND P R S C-8

108. The number of prior actions for PRSC-6 has been limited to six, in order to
streamline the operation and to focus on the most critical policy and institutional
actions required to help government achieve the expected outcomes of its reform
program. The implementation o f the overall program supported by the PRSC series i s
satisfactory. The prior actions underpinning government reforms to strengthen
macroeconomic management cover the areas o f resource allocation for poverty
reduction, institutional reforms to enhance public financial management systems, budget
management, procurement systems, auditing, and the management o f the civil service. I  n
the area o f economic development, one prior action supports government efforts to
foster economic development by adopting reforms to improve the workings of the
financial sector. As mentioned above, several reforms are being implemented by the
government to boost economic growth, also in response to the global financial crisis, but
they are not used as prior actions because they are not included in the PAF. The Bank
has been working with government and development partners to include key measures
under the economic development pillar in the 2010 PAF, notably on land administration
and simplification o f business licenses and regulations, such that the team can use them
as prior actions under PRSC-8. It i s envisaged that there w i l l not be more than 6 to 8
triggers each for PRSC-7 and PRSC-8 in the two broad areas discussed above
(macroeconomic management and economic development). Based on this discussion, the
prior actions for

109.    that the overall budgetary PRSC-6 are listed below.

110. The Government of Mozambique has completed the following prior actions
in implementingthe reform agenda supported by the PRSC-6:

         The Ministry o f Finance has ensured envelope and the amounts allocated to
         priority sectors, both as reflected in the State Budget of 2009 are in line with the
         first year o f the MTEF 2009-2011.


" This activity i s being supported as part of IDA'SPrivate Sector Development Project approved in FYO9.
56  The `guillotine' methodology allows governments to rapidly review a large number of regulations, and
eliminate those no longer needed without the need for lengthy and costly legal action on each regulation. I t
i s based on a highly structured review process (with clear filters and incentives for reform), a legal
framework, and a political strategy to gain support for a radical reform affecting many stakeholders.


                                                    - 64 -
   a   The Ministry o f Finance has ensured that at least 90 percent o f the total value o f
       budgetary purchases o f goods, services and investments for the Budget Execution
       Units during Fiscal Year 2008 has been effected through e-SISTAFE b y means of
       direct budget execution.
   e   The Ministry o f Finance has continued to strengthen the operation o f the
       procurement system as indicated by information available to U F S A demonstrating
       that: (i) least 88 percent o f public sector contracts (in terms o f number) let in
                at
       Fiscal Year 2008 were subject to public tender in accordance with the current
       Mozambican procurement legislation; (ii) least 90 percent o f public sector
                                                    at
       contracts (in terms o f number) procured o n the basis o f direct contracting and
       single source selection during Fiscal Year 2008 were duly justified; (iii)     the
       process for handling complaints by bidders as defined in the current Mozambican
       procurement legislation, i s operational.
   a   The Court o f Accounts (Tribunal Administrutivo, TA) has concluded i t s audit of at
       least 30 percent o f the State Budget o f Fiscal Year 2008 according to INTOSAI
       technical standards and according to Mozambican legislation.
   e   The Council o f Ministers has approved a new Medium Term Pay Policy for State
       officials and civil servants designed to be consistent with fiscal sustainability.
   a   The Ministry o f Finance has elaborated the transition plan for the adoption of
       mandatory IFRS.

                  VII. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
111. Implementation procedures for the PRSC-6 (in terms of monitoring and
evaluation, fiduciary aspects, and auditing; as well as environmental, poverty and
social aspects) are the same as those used for the previous PRSC series, which were
described in the program document for PRSC-3 (Republic of Mozambique, Third Poverty
Reduction Support Credit, Report No. 37970-MZ, approved January 25,2007).

A. MONITORING
          AND SUPERVISION

 112. The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs i s aligned with the supervision of the
                                                        n
joint General Budget Support program of the G19. I order to reduce the transaction
costs for the government, the Bank carries out all supervision jointly with the other G19
         n
donors. I addition to the two joint annual reviews, the supervision o f the PRSC i s done
on a continuous basis in harmonization with the other general budget support donors,
through the monthly joint government-donor steering committee meetings. Progress in
each sector i s monitored by joint government-donor sector working groups. Bank staff
actively participates in these meetings through i t s staff in the field offices and
Washington D.C. (through missions or by videoconference). Furthermore, the Bank
participates in joint IMF-Bank missions to monitor progress in the macroeconomic




                                           - 65 -
framework. The Bank and the Fund also monitor jointly progress in implementing the
PARPA-II.57

113. The government, with technical assistance from IDA and other development
partners, i s working to strengthen the monitoring system of the Strategic Matrix of
PARPA-11, in the context o f the development o f an integrated national monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system. Monitoring of the PARPA I1i s carried out on the basis o f the
`Strategic Matrix' prepared in early 2006 and included in the PARPA I1 document.
Sector working groups, including representatives of each relevant Ministry, Ministry o f
Planning and Development, donors and technical assistance, worked to select the key
PARPA I1 objectives in each sector and corresponding results indicators, actions, and
output indicators. A Quality Control Group led b y the Ministry o f Planning and
Development and by the chair o f the G19 was set up to oversee finalization of the
Strategic Matrix and identification o f key indicators. Implementation o f sector specific
matrices i s expected to be carried out by line ministries and sector agencies, while the
overall poverty monitoring i s the responsibility o f the National Statistic Institute (INE).
The Bank supports the government's effort to ensure the timely collection and analysis o f
the Strategic Matrix indicators to be used by the relevant agencies implementing the
Strategic Matrix: Ministry o f Planning and Development, line ministries and agencies at
central, provincial and district levels. In addition, following finalization o f the Strategic
Matrix with technical support from the Bank, in July 2007 the Monitoring Team within
Ministry o f Planning and Development began preparation o f Technical Notes for each
indicator. A national workshop involving M&E units in ministries took place in late
2008. The team has subsequently prepared a working plan to define decentralized level
of responsibility in monitoring indicators involving provincial level o f government. In
2008 the government announced that i t would extend the PARPA I1 by one year to
include 2010, thereby strengthening sustainability and continuity with the next strategic
document (to be prepared in 2010). The government i s now focusing on updating the
indicators and targets o f the Strategic Matrix for 2010.

114. In addition, an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant has recently
been approved to assist the government in strengthening the overall monitoring and
evaluation framework for the upcoming PARPA 111. The objective o f the IDF grant i s
to strengthen the government's capacity to coordinate the overall M&E framework for
the upcoming third Poverty Reduction Strategy and, particularly, to strengthen the results
orientation at sector level. The Ministry o f Planning and Development commissioned a
study (USEC 2008) on the planning cycle and monitoring and evaluation systems and
practices to get a deeper understanding of issues underlying the impediments o f a
functioning national M&E system. This shows government's strong commitment to
improving the M&E system on one hand and on the other hand the study provides a good
base for activity planning under this grant and other donors' assistance. While the USEC
study confirms that the long tradition o f planning and data production in Mozambique
serves as an enabling environment for a functional national M&E system, it also l i s t s the
following major constraints:

Report No. 46930-MZ).


                                              -66 -
        Fragmentation o f the M&E system in a multitude o f different systems and
        instruments at national, sectoral, ,provincial and district level without
        standardization or integrated methodology.

        Insufficient support by MPD in regard to institutionalization o f structures, clarity
        of methodology and processes, including the absence o f a planning portal and
        sufficient assistance for submittal and dissemination o f planning information.

        Absence o f a strong statistical system and integrated mechanism o f data
        production and dissemination to support the preparation o f the annual BdPES
        which i s further impeded by a proliferation o f information cycles at all levels with
        insufficient horizontal coordination and scheduling.

Activities under this grant would pick up the analysis o f the USEC study and target
specific areas. The work would focus on: (i)   improving the results orientation at sector
level by strengthening the logical linkage between different levels o f results and relating
them to budget and policy actions as well as provincial plans; and (ii)      improving the
linkage between M&E and planning, by strengthening the coordination mechanism and
production cycle o f the annual PARPA progress report5*

115. Various other activities are underway to strengthen the monitoring and
evaluation. capacity of government. Notably, the government with support from
DANIDA has also started a training program o f government officials at central and
decentralized level in the preparation o f Log-Frame matrices and the carrying out cost-
benefit analysis o f projects and activities.

           ASPECTS
B. FIDUCIARY

116. Fiduciary aspects and strengthening of the government's own systems are
key in this operation. As indicated in the PRSC-3 document, the public financial
management system i s considered reasonably adequate to support the PRSC series.
Weaknesses are found in internal control systems, the limited coverage o f the external
audit, and the high-level o f off-budget spending from external project finance. An action
plan on PFM reforms (discussed above), focusing o n comprehensiveness and financial
accountability system i s being implemented. The PRSC series supports implementation
o f key reforms in the action plan, in close coordination with the IMF program. Public

58One o f the primary challenges to improving monitoring and reporting of government performance has
been the lack o f coordination o f data management systems. The USEC study for example found for
Nampula province alone about 20 different M&E systems currently in use at different levels o f
government. In Tete province 14 different systems were identified and for Maputo about 10 M&E systems.
This fragmentation poses a huge challenge for data coordination and reporting at central level, which
eventually can feed into the BdPES and PARPA performance monitoring. In the absence o f a clear policy
and coordinated national response to systems gaps, ministries as well have developed different data
management systems. However, the experience o f several African countries demonstrated that a centralized
approach i s possible, if it i s simple, strategic, and brings stakeholders on board. To ensure sustainability o f
outcomes this IDF grant would finance the development o f a central web-based monitoring and reporting
system at national level. This i s expected to greatly improve the timeliness in evaluation and reporting on
government's performance.


                                                     - 67 -
financial management has been improving steadily in line with government commitment
to reform, and the dialogue between the government and the donors has been
constructive. In t h i s context, i t i s worth noting that the Bank i s moving towards
increasing the use o f country's financial management system in Mozambique, on the
basis o f an assessment that was made in early 2008.

117. The IMJ? concluded a safeguards assessment of the Mozambique Central
Bank in early 2008, which confirmed that the Mozambique Central Bank's control,
accounting, reporting, and auditing systems are adequate and aligned with
international standards. The assessment made recommendations to further strengthen
the governance structure o f Mozambique Central Bank, notably by opening the Central
Board and the Audit Board to independent experts from outside the Central Bank and
Ministry o f Finance. I t also recommended that the Audit Board should also ensure more
systematic follow-up o f audit recommendations and the audit charter be subject o f an
external quality assurance review (peer review) in accordance with international
standards. The authorities are in the process o f implementing the action plan that was
drawn-up as a result o f the safeguards assessment. I the context o f the IMF Policy
                                                       n
Support Instrument program, the government has agreed to follow up on the
recommendations o f the Safeguards Assessment, and committed to implementing a series
o f measure identified as part o f the assessment.

c. DISBUWEMENT AUDITING
             AND

118. Disbursement and auditing procedures remain the same a used for the     s
previous PRSC series. The proposed credit will be disbursed following standard IDA
disbursement procedures. The credit will be disbursed as a single tranche after
effectiveness and upon submission o f withdrawal applications from the Ministry o f
Planning and Development. IDA w i l l deposit the funds in a dedicated foreign exchange
account o f the Bank o f Mozambique in Frankfurt. It i s the same account which i s used
by other GBS donors to transfer their GBS contributions, as specified in the MoU. The
funds w i l l not be used for Excluded Expenditures in accordance with the Credit
Agreements. Within two working days, the Bank o f Mozambique w i l l credit the Metical
equivalent o f the credit funds to the Transit Account o f the Ministry o f Finance dedicated
to GBS funds. The Metical equivalent funds w i l l be transferred from the dedicated GBS
Transit Account to the Central Treasury Account in accordance with the treasury plan and
w i l l be used as State budget revenue and recorded in the State accounts as such. Auditing
procedures are the same as defined in Section 9 o f the M O U signed in March 2009. A
legally registered, private and independent audit company meeting international standards
on auditing and qualifications o f the auditors assigned will perform the annual audit, and
in accordance with the Terms o f Reference contained in Annex 8 to the MOU.59 The
audit costs will be met b y government. The annual audit report and the management letter
together with Management response will be submitted annually to government as well as
to GBS donors, including the Bank no later than three months after the year end.

59I t should be clarified that OP 8.60 does not require such an audit. However, the audit i s required as part
of the G19 harmonized institutional arrangements for the provision of budget support, and i s included in the
MOU which the World Bank has signed.


                                                   - 68 -
D. ENVIRONMENTAL
             ASPECTS

119. The legal framework for the environment i s relatively well developed in
Mozambique, but capacity to implement and enforce it remains limited. The
framework for environmental management in Mozambique i s defined by the Law o f the
Environment (Law no20/97), which applies to all public and private activities that may
influence environmental aspects. All activities that may result in a significant impact on
the environment are subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment, which has to
precede any issuing o f licenses and investment activity. The Ministry for the Co-
ordination o f Environmental Affairs (MICOA) i s the main entity responsible for
conducting Environmental Impact Assessments. The capacity o f M I C O A , however, i s
limited due to financial and technical capacity constraints.

120. The Bank team is working to assess the capacity of the government to carry
out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA). Starting in FYO9 the Bank team has started a Technical Assistance
activity to help the government to develop and implement appropriate policies in the
areas o f natural resources, environment and adaptation to climate change. In this context,
the Bank i s financing a stocktaking o f mega-projects that w i l l map forthcoming
investments and policy reforms with potential negative environmental impact, propose a
typology o f possible environmental issues linked to these investments and related policy
reforms. The stocktaking will also identify the future needs for Mozambique in terms of
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment
(SEA), the two tools that are needed to put in place mitigation measures to address
potential adverse environmental impact related to physical investment or policy reforms
in a given sector. The activity i s closely coordinated with M I C O A and the G19 partners,
in the context o f the five joint environment working group.

121. The reforms supported in this PRSC series are not expected to have
significant positive or negative effects on the environment, forest and other natural
resources. The PRSC series supports policy actions that create the enabling environment
to support poverty reduction, and which by themselves do not have an environmental
impact. I t i s expected, however, that regular private and public investment activities
which may result from such policy actions, could have impacts on the environment. For
instance increased land taxation i s expected to promote more intensive use o f the land
currently lying idle. Environmental aspects o f the reform o f land taxation w i l l have to be
considered during the preparation o f the reform. While the implementation o f the reform
o f land taxation i s expected to lead to an increase in land use, nevertheless it is not
expected that there will be need to introduce special measures since all activities to be
carried out on the land are subject to the Mozambican legal framework for the protection
o f the environment. As discussed above the Bank i s working to help the government to
develop and implement appropriate policies in the areas o f natural resources,
environment and adaptation to climate change. Thus, neither specific environmental
studies nor environmental impact management measures are anticipated for t h i s measure.
This also includes the potential effects from increasing exports - which may include
mining, energy and forestry. Increasing exports o f any of these sectors could have an
impact on the environment and forestry. As mentioned above, the Mozambican


                                            - 69 -
legislation requires that such impacts would have to be identified as part of           the
preparation o f the individual business projects, and evidence provided on how          the
                                               n
developer proposes to manage these impacts. I this context i t i s worth noting that    the
regulatory simplification envisaged under PRSC-8 will be carried out with               the
involvement o f M I C O A and the Ministry o f Health, in order to preserve             the
government's regulatory capacity in environmental and health safety issues.

122. Beyond the need to ensure that the environmental impacts of reform
supported by the PRSC i s mitigated, the sustainable use of Mozambique's natural
resources (land, mining, fisheries, forestry, water) represents a great opportunity
for poverty reduction as well as social and economic development, and needs to be
strengthened. As outlined in the 2005 CEM, public revenues from natural resource rents
could be increased from USD31 million to USD82 million per year under current
economic conditions, mostly by improving transparency and fairness in the issuing o f
licenses, quotas and concessions and in the collection and use o f revenue. Sustainable
exploitation o f natural resources by communities and individuals should be promoted to
contribute directly to poverty reduction and livelihood security. Investments in extractive
and exploitative industries can promote further growth and economic activity through
providing markets for local goods and services as well as inputs for processing industries.
Licensing and taxation o f natural resource use can provide significant revenue for
government, which in turn, can support funding development and poverty reduction
programs, especially where (local and global) market demand and prices allow significant
margins. However managing these resources i s complex. While G O M legislation and
policies recognize and seek to facilitate the role o f different models o f resource use for
poverty reduction and development, little attention has been given to the specific
mechanisms for: (i)      access, ( i promoting efficient use and (iii)
                                   i)                                       monitoring and
compliance with existing norms. This has led to a situation where regulations appear to
have produced unnecessarily complex procedures that create opportunities for rent
seeking and corruption, harming both the poor and private commercial interests. Over the
next few years IDA, in collaboration with the IMF and other development partners, w i l l
work closely with government to maximize the benefits from the sustainable exploitation
o f natural resource. An important step to enhance the revenue collection efforts was the
 approval by the parliament in December 2006 o f the new laws on the fiscal regimes for
the mining and o i l sectors, which have become effective in mid-2007.

E. POVERTY SOCIAL ASPECTS
         AND

123. The poverty and social impacts of the policies supported by the PRSC series
are expected to be positive. Analysis carried out on the impacts o f growth on poverty
reduction in Mozambique, has shown positive links, which has so far not been
accompanied by significant increases in inequality. The poverty reduction impact o f the
policies supported by the series i s expected to be significant, increasing the likelihood
that Mozambique will reach the first Millennium Development Goal. The specific
country policies supported by the PRSC series are not expected to have significant
distributional and social impacts, except possibly positive ones arising from the increased




                                           - 70 -
effectiveness o f the land tax administration system (as the land tax system would be
designed to b e progressive).

F. RISKSAND RISK MITIGATION

124. The risks to this operation relate to: (i)         the potential for macroeconomic
instability, ( ithe weak administrative capacity to implement public sector reforms and
              i)
decentralization, and (iii) deterioration in governance that could compromise economic
                          a
reforms. Details for each o f these areas are provided below:

125. A first set of risks i s concerned with the potential for macroeconomic
instability, due to the financial crisis, and the upcoming political elections in 2009.
The impact o f the financial crisis o n the Balance o f Payments (BOP) and the fiscal
accounts remains uncertain. Should the crisis deteriorate, the possibility exists that the
impact will be more severe than currently anticipated. In the same way in which the
Africa region was affected by the impact o f the financial crisis with a lag, it seems likely
that the recovery w i l l also reach Africa with a lag, and may be slower than in developed
countries. In fact, while there has been some recent improvement in the global outlook,
the outlook for South Africa has worsened in the past few months, and this may likely
negatively impact the prospects for Mozambique. In addition to the uncertain outturn o f
the financial crisis, risks remain related to natural calamities, a renewed surge in
international o i l and food prices, and spending pressure during election times. Hence, the
Bank i s working with the IMF and development partners to advise the authorities not to
relax their policy stance, based on a premature sense o f security. In addition, the Bank i s
proposing to increase the level o f budget support to contribute to close the BOPand fiscal
gap created by the crisis. The additional support would assist the government maintain
the planned level o f budgeted expenditures, without having to resort to large domestic
borrowing. Overvaluation o f the exchange rate also poses a risk to the macroeconomic
outlook and growth prospects. The Bank i s working with the IMF and development
partners to encourage the government to gradually address this imbalance. As
highlighted in the 2008 PEFA report, weaknesses in the oversight o f public enterprises
and state pakicipations entail a certain amount o f quasi-fiscal risks. In t h i s context, the
government i s working to improve overall fiscal risk management and accountability,
transparency and revenue forecasting by strengthening the systematic compilation and
publication o f an annex to budget execution documents covering quasi-fiscal activities,
contingent assets and liabilities, and sensitivity analysis o f fiscal risks. An additional set
o f risks arises from the Parliamentary and Presidential elections which are scheduled in
late 2009. Approaching the elections, the government will need to resist pressures for
additional spending that are not sustainable, and prevent a reduction in the level o f
revenues collection (as happened in the previous 2004 elections). For instance, while the
recent decision to introduce a defacto fuel subsidy i s expected to cost around 0.5 percent
o f GDP in 2009, in the context o f highly volatile international fuel prices the actual cost
o f this already undesirable subsidy could be much higher if international o i l prices
increase further. W h i l e this i s widely perceived to be a pre-election measure, and the
government has indicated i t s intention to revert to a normal price transmission during
2010, the Bank and development partners are engaged with the authorities in discussions



                                            - 71 -
to gradually phase out the subsidy in early 2010, and to explore possible improvements in
the price transmission mechanism (DFID i s financing a study to t h i s effect, which should
be ready in October 2009). The Bank i s also working with other development partners to
engage the government in discussions with on public expenditure priorities and tradeoffs.
The Bank team w i l l continue to monitor the macroeconomic policy framework and i t s
adequacy for the provision o f budget support. In addition, to mitigate the risks of fiscal
slippage due to political pressure in the run-up to the 2009 elections, the PRSC program
(and the PAF), supports the efforts by the government to strengthen PFM systems
(including the revenue collection systems and the oversight o f public enterprises), which
increase transparency and reduce the country's vulnerability to fiscal slippage.

126. A second set of risks concerns a possible slowdown in implementing the
reforms program in the context of the upcoming elections, especially in light of the
weak administrative capacity. There are two distinct ways in which this may impact
the PRSC operation. Firstly, the upcoming elections will entail a period o f transition
until the next government is in place, during which decisions w i l l necessarily be delayed
until the next administration i s firmly established. This transition period might affect
particularly the relatively newer areas of the reform program, such as the reforms in land
taxation and business environment. In order to mitigate this risk, the team intends to
increase its engagement at the technical level by facilitating the preparation of the
necessary technical underpinnings which will be required to implement the reforms.
Secondly, the elections may exacerbate the impact of the weak administrative capacity to
implement public sector reforms leasing to a general slowdown in the implementation of
the overall government program. T o mitigate the risk, the government and donors agreed
during the Joint Review 2008 to develop an integrated strategy for capacity development
in public finance management, and to strengthen the coordination and management o f
reforms. I addition IDA i s supporting the government to implement the second phase o f
           n
the public sector reforms, which (was agreed with all stakeholders including the
development partners and) was approved by Cabinet in October 2006. To strengthen
capacity at the district level and to improve control mechanisms (auditing) the
government has finalized i t s program for capacity building at the decentralized level. The
development partners, including IDA, are now discussing with government the
preparation of a national program that i s expected to deliver capacity building and
oversight more effectively.

127. A third set of risks concerns a possible deterioration in governance that could
compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. Progress in public
sector governance has been mixed. Significant progress has been made in thereby
improving transparency and accountability by strengthening Public Financial
Management systems, including in procurement and in internal and external audit. Also
there has been progress towards improving the management o f natural resources, notably
by strengthening the legal framework regulating the fiscal regimes for mining and
petroleum, and in May 2009 the government has been accepted as a candidate country to
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Joint Review in April 2009,
however, noted the need to accelerate reforms in the legal and judiciary fronts, including
in implementing the anti-corruption strategy and introducing (and enforcing) legislation
to eliminate conflict o f interest for public officials. Questions are also related to the


                                           - 72 -
capacity for selection, negotiation and monitoring o f the projects and investments, in
order to explore the opportunities o f the country's natur`al resources (minerals, petroleum,
hydropower, forestry, agriculture, among others). For instance, the government i s in the
process o f negotiating three power mega-projects (coal, gas and hydro) with
combinations o f foreign f i r m s and local partners, and it i s important to ensure the
maximization o f the benefits for the communities and advantages for the country. The
mixed progress in the area of governance may slow down further in the approach to the
next Parliamentary and Presidential elections in October 2009. A deterioration in
governance could have negative effects on economic growth and compromise poverty
reduction. To mitigate t h i s risk, IDA i s increasing its activities in the areas o f
Governance. Strengthening voice and accountability i s one o f the three pillars o f the
Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy approved by the Board in M a y 2007. IDA
already holds an active policy dialogue with the authorities o n the subject and closely
monitors developments associated with governance. At the request o f the government,
the Bank, IMF, DFID and Norway fielded a technical assistance mission in 2008 on how
to maximize the benefits from mega-projects, including those related to the exploitation
o f natural resources. In addition, the restructured Public Sector Reform Project has a new
legal sector capacity building `component. A further approach to enhance accountability
o f the executive i s increased disclosure o f information to the public, particularly
regarding financial management. Some progress has been made through the use o f an
official internet portal o f the government, but more effort i s s t i l l required. Also, as part o f
the activities supported b y the CommGAP Trust Fund in Mozambique, IDA i s working to
enhance citizen's voice, strengthen the media, and modernize the government's
communication functions. Specifically, the CommGAP has financed analysis to
strengthen government's capacity to engage with stakeholders to improve policy design
and i t s communication, including for local government at the municipaVprovincia1 levels,
as well as helping to better understand the current status and constraints to the
development o f a vibrant media sector in Mozambique which can promote information
and discussion o f policy decisions, and there are plans to strengthen some o f the NGOs
working on medidfreedom of information issues and partnering with the Faculty o f
Journalism o f Mondlane's University. Last but not least, IDA i s working with
government to carry out a program o f beneficiary surveys to increase public involvement
in the monitoring o f service delivery.

  Subject: Letter of Devehprnent Puficy far the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSE VI)


  Dear Mr. Zoellick,

     1. I am writing on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to request a Credit in the
        amount of US0110 million (PRSC V) from the International Development Association (IDA), to support the
                                        I
         continuing reform programme under the proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credits. This request
         comes in the context of the Memorandum of Understanding (Moll) between the Government of the
         Republic of Mozambique and international aid partners, including the World Bank Group. The Moll
         outlines the participant`s approach to the provision of budget support, among other related measures.

      2. The aforementioned Credit will help to meet the financing requirements that Mozambique faces to
         implement the Second Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA-IF), through the
         Economic and Social Plan (PES) and the annual budget (OE) for the year 2010, and support the

      3. Government`s policy response to face the international financial crisis.

      4. We want to congratulate your commitment to continuous support of the Government`s program, as we
         start this new PRSC series that will put greater emphasis on reforms aiming to improve the business
           environment for private sector development. as a means to foster economic growth and accelerate
           poverty reduction:

   The Programme

      5. As set out in the 2006-10 PARPA-II, the Government`s main objective is the reduction of the levels of
         absolute poverty in Mozambique. To achieve this goal, PARPA-II presents a strategy and programme
           focused on the following key priorities areas: human capital development (including education, health
           and access tu potable water); governance (good governance, legality and justice including public and
           legal sector reform}; economic development (including the promotion of national entrepreneurship and
           infrastructure development); and crnss-cutting issues including environment, HIV/AIDS and gender. The
           PARPA-II adopted in May 2006 is clearly aligned with these priorities.
                                                                      "*emwI   __(1

Overview n i Recent Progress

   6. The PARPA-IIimplementation in 2001 was broadly satisfactory, as noted in the April 2009 Joint Review,
      involving the Government and the Programme Aid Partners (PAPS) including IDA. The Mozambican
      economy continued to grow rapidly, achieving a GDP growth rate of 6.8 percent in 2008, in spite of the
      unfavourable external environment characterized by international prices of food and fuels. and settled
                                                     O
      at a rate of accumulated inflation just above I percent by December 2008. Further, satisfactory
       progress was made in health, education, and water and sanitation service delivery. The integration of
       the PES, OE and Medium Term Fiscal Scenario (CFMP) and the strengthening of the l a l a n ~ o PES
                                                                                                     do
       (BdPESf to monitor the PARPA has proved to be a useful exercise, although there remain weaknesses in
       the preparation of the budget and programmatic planning. A large effort is ongoing to improve
       quantitative poverty analysis and dissemination. Steps to imprave the monitoring system were ahn
       noted.

   7. The Government's commitment to address the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains strong.
      This is reflected in the PARPA-II. whose key actions are summarized in a matrix, along with indicators
       included in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed with the Government's direct budget
       support partners, to permit monitoring. The Programme defined in these instruments will be
       implemented through Government systems with monitoring and evaluation reported in my Government's
       annual Economic and Social Plan (PES) and the annual State Budget (DE) that are submitted to the
       Parliament for approvaf.

   8. The monitoring of the PARPA continued to improve and there was some progress towards the key
      PESIPAF indicator of ensuring the integration of the PES, OE and CFMP and strengthening the BdPES. The
      expenditures in priority sectors were 64.2%, which is below the target of 65% of the total Performance
      against PES/PAF targets in public service delivery was positive. In education, performance was broadly
      on-track and all targets were exceeded. In health. PAF indicators continue to show positive progress,
       particularly in relation to the average up-take of services measured by consultations per inhabitant.
       which surpassed the target defined in ZOO!.       Positive progress was made both in PES/PAF and
       Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators. Although the ZOO8 PES/PAF targets were met,
       HIV/AIDS remains one of the greatest threats to Mozambique's development and once again a stronger
       and better coordinated gender sensitive multi-sectoral response is needed.

    9. In terms of the environment for private sector development, progress was made in 21108, as reflected
       in the improvement of Mozambique ranking by 5 places to position 135 out of 183 economies in the 2U10
       Doing Business Survey, reflecting the Government's commitment, Mozambique slipped one place to Ifh
       within the SADC region, however, and'this highlights the need to accelerate our efforts to improve the
       business environment.

    I.
    O The impact of this progress on poverty reduction continues to be significant. The last household survey,
       completed in 2002/2003. shows that poverty incidence (based on the headcount index) declined to 54
       percent in 2003 (from 69.4 percent in I!!?). A new household survey is under preparation, and its
       results are expected in early 2010,

   It. The Government's programme which is being submitted for support within PRSC-VI includes two main
       components that are an integral part of the wider PARPA. PES and PAF matrices, namely:
      macroeconomic management and economic development.

Macroeconomic Management

   12. The Government remains committed to maintain macroeconomic stability improve public financial
      management and enhance governance. The Government is also committed to ensure that budget
      allocation to priority sectors are in line with the CFMP, and to continue to implement measures to
      strengthen revenue mobilization and the transparency and monitoring of the budget execution. The
      Government will also continue implementing the new procurement system. and expanding coverage and
      efficiency of internal and external audit bodies.

      a) The Government will maintain macroeconomic stability through adhering to an appropriate
         macroeconomic framework with consistent fiscal and monetary policies. It will also continue to
         improve public financial management through monitoring closely and allocating its resources to
         pro-poor spending in line with the CFMP.

       6) The Government will also continue to increase budgetary efficiency, transparency and accountability
           by expanding coverage and implementing "Sistema de AdministraF8o Financeira do Estado"
           (SISTAFE). Specifically, after the successful introduction of e-SISTAFE in 2004 in the Ministry of
           Finance and all its provincial directorates, the Government completed the roll-out to all Ministries
           and other Government institutions by the end of the 20117, and started using the direct execution
           modality. such that more than 90 percent of the budget execution of goods and services is done
           through e-SISTAFE direct budget execution.

       c) The Government will also continue to implement the procurement reforms. Followiog the approval of
          the new Procurement Regulations in 2005. my Government established the new central
          procurement institution, which has been staffed and made operational during 2007. We have also
          started the establishment of a monitoring system to increase transparency and measure the
          effectiveness of the reforms, in line with international best practice for the assessment of national
          procurement systems. Use of the new procurement system is expanding, and information on public
          purchases available from UFSA that show that at least 88 percent of contracts of the public sector
          in 2008 were subject to public tender in accordance with the current Mozambican procurement
          legislation. and when other modalities of contract have been used due justification has been
          communicated to UFSA.

       13. The Government is also working to increase efficiency and accountability. by strengthening the
           capacity of the Tribunal Administrativo, which is our Supreme Audit institution, to conduct more
           audits and expand the audit coverage.

       14. The Government is also improving its payroll management, and in this context it has approved the
           Medium Term Pay Policy in 2008. While raising the wage bill. the new policy aims to simplify and
                                                                                                             3

           rationalize the salary scales across ministries, decompress the scales consistent with qualification
           and responsibility, reform the system of housing and other allowances, and harmonize the salary
           policy with the pension system..

Economic Development

   15. Recognizing the main role of the private sector in the economic growth and employment, Government
       policies and reforms have improved the environment for the development of private sector activities,
       and reinforced the role of the market in the economy. as described below.

   16. The Government is working t o improve access to credit for private sector firms. One of the key
       challenges is to reduce information constraints for commercial banks by supporting improvements in
       accounting and reporting standards through the implementation of International financial Reporting
       Standards (IFRS) in the corporate sector. lmprovin 9 access to credit will also require additional
       measures to improve the level of competition in the banking sector, diversify the financial services and
       products. and to strengthen the judicial system.

   17. The Government is working to ensure the financial sustainability of the sociaf security system. and to
       ensure the adoption of best practice and transparency in the management of the Social Security funds.
                                          I
       The Government plans to build the T system of the INSS in 20I0, and this will allow the creation of an
       electronic database of all pensioners and contributors. Also. the elaboration of the investment strategy
       and the preparation of a new actuarial study will be completed shortly. and form the basis far the
       reform of the system.

   18. WE are committed with continuously improve the business climate. Thus, the Government will continue
       to implement the measures approved by the Strategy for improve the Business Climate. One important
       decision by the Government in 2009 was the removal of the minimum capital requirement to start a
       business. reducing significantly the costs for the private sector. The government also approved in 2008
       the Simplified licensing and the Small Business Simplified Tax. Another approach to reduce the costs of
       doing business is through the One Stop Shops, that are already expanded to all the provinces. with
       positive results, Other measures approved include a decree in July 200i, whereby all business
       inspections have been merged under one single authority (except for labor and fiscal inspections).
       which is expected to reduce the burden of inspections on private business. The new Bankruptcy Code
        has also been submitted to the Parliament, and it will be discussed when the new Parliament convenes
        in 2010.

'The response to the fllobal financial crisis

    19. The global financial crisis has put additional challenges in the Governments efforts for promoting
        economic growth and poverty reduction. To revert the impact of the crisis we approved additional
        measures to attract private investment and introduced fiscal measures to reduce 9overnment
        spending. The implementation of the Food Production Action Plan (PAPA). approved in 2008, will also

                                                                                                              4

      contribute to reduce the dependence on cereals from abroad, and reduce the pressure to the Balance
      of Payments.


Conclusion

   20. In sum, the Government's policy framework aims at consolidating macroeconomic stability. and is
       consistent with the medium-term goal of sustaining poverty reduction through strong broad-based
       economic growth. The Government remains committed to the overall objective of poverty reduction
       through sustainable economic growth, and has adopted several policy measures to mitigate the impact
       of the recent increases in the global price of food and fuel products. It is. therefore, the Government's
       hope that IDA will approve the requested Credit to assist in the implementation of the proposed
       programme.
