                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Before this December 2012 implementation support mission, the project was restructured, where new but essentially follow-on activities emanating from the originally-agreed
                         activities were included in the restructured Project. This was a second-level restructuring, and therefore there were no changes to (i) the project's development objectives, and (ii) the
                         results framework remain unchanged. There was neither reallocation of funds nor closing date extension. A long period of implementation delays after project was declared effective

                         caused the government to utilize other financial resources to implement activities originally agreed to be implemented under the project. The Government embarked on this option as
                         failure to implement these activities at the agreed time time would have led to the country losing a significant amount of overseas development financing crucial to its achievement of
                         its private sector development goals. This ODA was predicated on the implementation of these activities which were required to reform the business registration regime. The
                         changes introduced is expected to contribute to a more comprehensive business registration process across all islands and also introduce transparency in, and shorten the time for

                         The revisions introduced include, a new beneficiary agency (ADEI) to implement incubation services for newly established enterprises; the scope of services to be performed under
                         the Matching Grant Facility being implemented by the Chambers of Commerce has been expanded; support for business licensing and business registry support has been expanded,
                         and a number of revisions to the activities of the Cape Verde Investment Agency, and those for the Directorate General of Tourism introduced .

                         Preparations for the project's Mid Term Review are underway and is currently scheduled to take place by the first quarter of FY 2014.

                         With the conclusion of the initial application for matching grants support, the approval of consultancy services to reform the business licensing regime, engagement of an advisor in
                         the Ministry of Finance and a legal advisor to reform the national Procurement Act that would enable improved access to government contracts for SMEs, we expect the rate of
                         disbursement to increase to the levels expected by June 2013.

                         Discussions have been concluded on a different method for assessing the impact of the Matching Grant Facility (MGF). The method agreed initially has had to be discontinued on
                         account of insufficient number of enterprises applying to the initial call for proposals. While it was expected that more SMEs in the southern and more populated part of the islands
                         would have applied to the MGF, it turned out to not be the case. The second phase of the call for applications would be used to assess reasons for the relatively low number of
                         applications. Meanwhile, it has been agreed that the National Statistics Institute will lead the collection and collation of outcome indicators and assessment of the impact of the MGF.

                         Implementation Progress has picked up significantly and likelihood to achieve the PDOs significantly improved.
