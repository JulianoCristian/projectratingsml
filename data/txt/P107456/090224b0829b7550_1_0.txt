Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will close as now scheduled on January 31, 2015. Ninety-Six percent (96%) of project funds have been disbursed with the remainder
 committed and expected to be fully disbursed by March 31, 2014.

 Enhancing SME Business Opportunities - Under the Supporting SME Investment Climate Reforms sub-component, the activities of this sub-component
 were implemented by UCRE (State Reform Coordinating Unit) and NOSi (Operational Unit for the Information Society) with the objective of easing the
 business environment using electronic means, among others. The activities have been completed, with all the resources fully disbursed. The provision
 of an electronic platform to facilitate business registration, business licensing and property registration has led to a reduction in the time and cost to
 enterprises and individuals in undertaking these activities. In addition, individuals and businesses interface with government can now take place by
 smartphones as a result of support provided under the project to further

 For example, the authorities indicate that, now, for property searches and registration, searches are almost instantaneous (initially system was deployed
 in Praia and Sal, but replicated to other municipalities). The General Directorate for Registry and Notary informs that a deed of compliance is now
 completed within 24-48 hours and issuance of a Public Deed takes 48 hours.

 Nevertheless, the following activities remain to be completed - integration of the Closing of Business and ability to change the nature of Business
 Licensing services modules into the e-Governance Platform have taken longer than planned, contributing to lags on registering property and starting a
 business. Activities to operationalize the Investors’ One Stop Shop, and the integration and establishment of the External Commerce One Stop Shop
 are underway and is expected to be completed by end December 2014.

 The Matching Grant Facility (MGF) which was implemnted by the Chambers of Commerce completed three offer cycles, and over 110 enterprises
 benefitted undr the scheme.

 Activities to improve the transparency and efficiency of the Public Procurement system have been largely implemented on a satisfactory basis - revision
 of the legislation guiding Public Procurement has been completed and validated by the stakeholders and submitted to the relevant authorities for
 passage. Other ancillary legislation that the new Code impacts, have also being revised and these include legislation for the execution of procurement
 contracts for movable property, services and consulting services; Rules for Electronic Public Procurement Platform; Subventions Regime; Concession
 Contracts Regime; Public Enterprise and Public Participated Enterprise Privatization Regime; Public Domain (State Land Property) Goods Regime; and
 Public Private Partnerships Regime.

 The National Statistics Institute (INE) has submitted a report on the Impact of the MGF, which shows that, in general, the beneficiary SMEs are more
 open to innovation, have had better results in introducing new products and services to the market, among others. The impact on the economy is being
 ascertained as part of project closing activities..
