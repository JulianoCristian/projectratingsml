improve the\n            performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the\n            transparency and efficiency of public sector governance.\n            This restructuring request does not involve: a) revisions to\n            the Project Development Objectives (PDOs); b) closing date\n            extension; but does include c) a minor revision to the\n            results. The forecasted end of project target value for the\n            key performance indicator 'increase the number of SMEs\n            that compete for contracts through the public procurement\n            process' is being revised downwards, from\n            '80' to '30'. SMEs participation in\n            public procurement activities is a relatively new area and\n            the original final target value is deemed to be very\n            ambitious. This change will require revisions to the\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework in the project\n            operating manual."}, "docdt": "2012-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
