                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's closing date has been extended by six months and is scheduled to now close on January 31, 2015. This is the first extension of the closing date and a second
                         restructuring of the project. This restructuring will help address implementation delays encountered at project effectiveness. Sixty-Seven percent (67%) of project funds have been
                         disbursed with and additional 6% committed, with an amount of US$0.3 million expected to be disbursed by June 30, 2014.

                         Enhancing SME Business Opportunities - Under the Supporting SME Investment Climate Reforms sub-component, the activities of this sub-component were implemented by UCRE
                         (State Reform Coordinating Unit) and NOSi (Operational Unit for the Information Society) with the objective of easing the business environment using electronic means, among
                         others. The activities have been completed, with all the resources fully disbursed. The provision of an electronic platform to facilitate business registration, business licensing and

                         property registration has led to a reduction in the time and cost to enterprises and individuals in undertaking these activities.

                         For example, the authorities indicate that, now, for property searches and registration, searches are almost instantaneous (initially system was deployed in Praia and Sal, but
                         replicated to other municipalities). The General Directorate for Registry and Notary informs that a deed of compliance is now completed within 24-48 hours and issuance of a Public
                         Deed takes 48 hours.

                         Nevertheless, the following activities remain to be completed - integration of the Closing of Business and ability to change the nature of Business Licensing services modules into the
                         e-Governance Platform have taken longer than planned, contributing to lags on registering property and starting a business. Activities to operationalize the Investors’ One Stop Shop,
                         and the integration and establishment of the External Commerce One Stop Shop are underway and is expected to be completed by September 2014.

                         The Matching Grant Facility (MGF) which is being implemented by the Chambers of Commerce is about completing the Second Cycle - Seventy-three (73) projects were approved
                         during this cycle. The application phase for Third and final Cycle closed May 2, 2014, with Forty-three 43 enterprises submitting proposals.

                         Support to ADEI, which is the Government agency promoting SME development and innovation and, to the General Directorate of Tourism (DGT) continue to need special handling
                         to guard against slippages on implementation progress.

                         Activities to improve the transparency and efficiency of the Public Procurement system have been largely implemented on a satisfactory basis - revision of the legislation guiding
                         Public Procurement has been completed and validated by the stakeholders and submitted to the Government. Other ancillary legislation that impact the new Code are also being
                         revised and include legislation for the execution of procurement contracts for movable property, services and consulting services; Rules for Electronic Public Procurement Platform;
                         Subventions Regime; Concession Contracts Regime; Public Enterprise and Public Participated Enterprise Privatization Regime; Public Domain (State Land Property) Goods Regime;
                         and Public Private Partnerships Regime.

                         The National Statistics Institute (INE) has finally submitted a draft of the study on the Impact of the MGF to the PIU, but it is yet to be shared with IDA. The PIU reported the study
                         shows that, in general, the MGF beneficiaries are more open to innovation, have had better results in introducing new products and services to the market, and have overall better
                         performance than firms that have not benefited from the Fund. The study shows that, so far, 17% of beneficiaries are micro enterprises, 45% are small enterprises, and 38% are
                         medium enterprises. The Fund has benefited businesses in 6 islands the greater proportion residing in S. Vicente (39%), and the smallest in S. Nicolau (2%) and Fogo (2%). The
                         impact on the economy will be ascertained next.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The closing date of the project has been extended by six months to January 31, 2015 to allow for additional time to implement a number of key activities that have previously
                         encountered implementation delays.

                         The rate of implementation for activities being undertaken by ADEI, DGT, the Chambers of Commerce and the remaining reforms to the Business enabling environment must be
                         accelerated and completed within the next 4 months in order to positively impact the project's developmental objectives.
