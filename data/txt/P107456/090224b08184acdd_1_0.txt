                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last mission in April 2012, the project has undergone a second order restructuring, where new but essentially follow-on activities were included to be financed by the Credit
                         proceeds. An additional beneficiary agency (ADEI) to implement enterprises incubation services has now been included in the project, the scope of services to be performed by the
                         Chamber of Commerce has been expanded; support for licensing and business registry support has been expanded, and revisions to the activities of the Cape Verde Investment

                         With the conclusion of the initial application for matching grants support, the approval of consultancy services to reform the business licensing regime, engagement of an advisor in
                         the Ministry of Finance and a legal advisor to reform the procurement Act that would enable improved access to government contracts for SMEs, we expect the rate of disbursement
                         to increase to the levels expected by June 2013.

                         Discussions are expected to be concluded by January 2013 and the new method for assessing impact of the Matching Grant Facility initiated. The method agreed initially has had to
                         be discontinued on account of insufficient number of enterprises applying to the initial call for proposals.

                         Ratings for Implementation Progress and likelihood to achieve the PDOs are maintained as Moderately Satisfactory. During the next implementation support mission planned for
                         December, these will be reviewed and updated as needed.
