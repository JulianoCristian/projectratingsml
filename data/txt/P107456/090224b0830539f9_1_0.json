Use caution when\n            including macroeconomic indicators for a project that\n            supports limited microeconomic reforms. Attribution will be\n            extremely difficult. Establish the implementation unit by\n            the time of effectiveness. Prioritize impact studies of\n            innovative interventions. Conduct operational training for\n            all Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and implementing agency\n            staff involved in project implementation, even if they\n            already have experience with World Bank projects."}, "docdt": "2015-07-31T00:07:02Z"}
