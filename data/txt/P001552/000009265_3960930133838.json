           responsive to the needs of employers and the labor market;\n            to give a more important role to the private sector in\n            provision of TVET; to promote cost recovery in TVET and thus\n            to provide funds for increased levels of training; and to\n            increase quality and efficiency of public sector TVET.  The\n            components include:  development of the National Council of\n            Technical and Vocational Education and Training (CNFTP) for:\n            (a) promoting training and coordination among TVET\n            sub-systems, and strengthening linkages between the training\n            system and employers; (b) improving financing for training;\n            and (c) supporting the public and private training sectors.\n            The second component, will restructure and strengthen the\n            TVET system to make it more responsive to labor market\n            requirements, and improve its quality and cost efficiency.\n            The third component will improve the labor market\n            information system by improving the system by which\n            information about the labor market and training needs is\n            made available.  The fourth component, agricultural\n            education and training, will include an evaluation of the\n            sub-sector which will lead to development of policy measures\n            and the financing of agricultural education reforms and\n            training activities.  The last component, training for\n            senior civil servants, includes development and quality\n            improvement of the civil service training school."}, "docdt": "1992-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
