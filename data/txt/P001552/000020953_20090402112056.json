Some key lessons\n            include: 1) The selection and monitoring of key quantified\n            indicators is very important to facilitate the strategic\n            steering of the reform during project implementation and to\n            evaluate results at the end of the project. 2) Strong\n            national leadership and continuity are important for the\n            success of a project that includes major reform of the\n            sector. 3) The successful organization of employers as\n            necessary partners in a demand-driven training system\n            depends on the correct incentives and the provision of\n            appropriate technical assistance and support. 4)\n            Administrative and financial autonomy, implementation plans,\n            work programs, and a contracting approach are important to\n            ensure efficient project management. 4) Attitude changes are\n            essential elements of sustainability. 5) The continuous\n            adaptation of training to the needs of the labor market\n            requires flexibility in the management of the system, and\n            greater assignment of responsibility to the training\n            establishments can facilitate the emergence of a dynamic\n            aimed at enhanced efficiency and innovation. 6) The\n            successful implementation of in-service training could serve\n            as a model of pre-service training. 7) The arrangements and\n            modalities for the financing of training should take into\n            account the targeting of beneficiaries and be affordable to\n            the target groups."}, "docdt": "2000-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
