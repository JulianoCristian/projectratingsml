The\n            lessons learned from the project include: a) Financial\n            intermediation lending is an important instrument for\n            following up structural adjustment operations. The project\n            demonstrates that a well-designed and monitored financial\n            intermediation loan can play a role in reinforcing the\n            introduction of financial sector reforms, monitoring their\n            application, and providing a framework for discussing\n            further modifications in financial sector reforms. b) Beyond\n            the minimum capital standards established by prudential\n            regulations, some reasonable measure of portfolio quality\n            ought to be used as a criterion for access to an IBRD line\n            of credit. c) The need to develop a long-term strategy for\n            the future of the development banks was expressed as a\n            covenant in the Guarantee Agreements for the three direct\n            lines of credit to development banks, thus placing the\n            responsibility for these strategies on the Government, in\n            its role as Guarantor. d) A single apex loan that would\n            finance eligible subprojects of participating financial\n            intermediaries on a first come, first served basis would\n            have been a more efficient, as well as equitable, instrument\n            for channeling IBRD funds to finance private investments. e)\n            The complexity of this project made it quite difficult to\n            administer on behalf of a co-financier."}, "docdt": "2001-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
