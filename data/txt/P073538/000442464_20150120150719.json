In response, the\n            Bank in December 2000 launched an emergency response program\n            (ERP) with a 12 million dollars grant to ease the harshest\n            effects of the closure by offering temporary jobs to\n            Palestinian workers. Designed by the Bank in cooperation\n            with village councils, municipalities, and Palestinian\n            authorities' agencies, the program has so far created\n            more than 190,000 direct person days of work for\n            Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza through 232 micro projects."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
