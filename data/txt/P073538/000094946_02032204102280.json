Project\n            sustainability is rated as likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included the following: Using existing and\n            well-functioning programs to channel funds for emergency\n            operations can be effective. The use of existing mechanisms\n            for disbursement and financial control can give a project\n            immediate impetus and reduce the time needed for\n            preparation. Decentralized assistance to the client by the\n            Bank can be a determining factor in project success. It is\n            especially useful for task teams to be close to the client\n            in emergency projects with short implementation periods.\n            Statistics on employment generation can be misleading and\n            need to be carefully interpreted. Quick implementation of\n            emergency community projects requires decentralized,\n            streamlined implementation procedures. Simplified\n            procurement methods and disbursement procedures can be a\n            major factor in speeding up project implementation. Strong\n            project ownership is a determining factor for success. In\n            emergency operations, detailed analysis of the longer terms\n            issues related to sustainability and risk should be done at\n            project preparation. A review should be taken with other\n            donors to assess how these types of projects can be scaled\n            up and how they can have a greater impact."}, "docdt": "2002-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
