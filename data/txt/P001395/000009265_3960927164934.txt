HEDR0WDU AND UECOIHZNDATION 0T HEE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTWi&TIONAL DEVELOMTN ASSOCIATION
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
08 A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TIE KINGDOM OF LSOTO
FOR A SECOND POPUL&TION, HEALTR. AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
i         development credit to Lesotho for $DR 9.4 million (US$12.1 million
equivalent) is sabmitted for approval.  The credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity.  It would help finance a second
population, health, and nutritiou project.  The project would be
co-financed by the European Economic Community for US$3.2 million
equivalent, the Government of Ireland for US$2.6 million equivalent, and
the United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration for US$ 1.3 million
equivalent.
2.        Background.  Faced with severe budgetary and fiscal imbalances
and declining growth, the Government has recently embarked upon major
economic refor.a program, enunciated in its 1988 Policy Framework Paper.
The reform program stresses the importance of developing Lesotho's human
resources, especially in the education and populationfhealth/nutrition
sectors, where the Government is committed to improvements in quality of
services, cost-effectiveness, cost recovery (combined with measures to
protect the poor), and targeting of underserved groups.
3.        In population, the Government for the first time in 1988
publicly committed itself to reducing the rate of population growth (from
its current level of 2.7Z a year) through family planning: this provides a
major opportunity for developing a national population policy and expanding
related services. Family planning activities supported under the first IDA
project (Cr. 1585-LSO) and by other donors (including UNFPA and USAID) thus
far have had only minor impact on prevailing levels of fertility, largely
because of weak inter-agency coordination and lack of a clear sectoral
strategy including active outreach mechanisms. A more ambitious program,
involving several Government ministries and NGOs and emphasizing population
education and both facility and community-based services, is now required.
4.        In health, Lesotho has made significant progress under the first
IDA project and other donor-assisted schemes (EEC, British ODA, UNICEF and
African Development Bank) in developing a primary care system, by
constructing and upgrading clinics and training personnel at the newly-
created National Health Training Center. To expand and strengthen the
primary care system, however, more needs to be done to integrate government
and mission-provided services (through the Private Health Association of
Lesotho (PHAL), whose members account for about half of all health care in
the country) and to renovate, equip, and staff peripheral facilities. In
addition, the quality of urban health services, especially at the central
hospital in Maseru, has declined in recent years because of poor
management, inadequate referral procedures, and aging infrastructure. A
program of management strengthen- ing and physical upgrading, combined with
patient deconcentration to other facilities, is needed to reverse the



- 2 -
situation. The first IDA project has helped establish an effective
tuberculosis (TB) control program, with co-financing from the Government of
Irelands however, the prevalence of other infectious diseases, including
sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) and AIDS, requires a broader disease
control effort. Although important strides have been made under the first
project in improving budgeting and expenditure controls, it did not attempt
to address the major policy reforms which the Government now recognizes
must be implemented to increase efficiency of public expenditures and
mobilize additional resources *ithin the sector.
5.        In nutrition,  after years of ineffective institutional feeding
using donated food aid, the Government has recently shown an interest in an
integrated approach that would include nutritional surveillance, nutrition
education, and income generation at comunity level, combined with more
effective targeting of food to malnourished children and mothers. Such an
approach would be directed at the 30? of children under five who remaPn
chronically malnourished. UNICEF in particular has already coumntted
resources to an integrated program in two pilot districts. The other major
donors in the nutrition area, USAID and the World Food Program, are
striving to target their food aid at nutritionally at-risk groups.
6.        lhile no PCRIPPAR has yet been carried out on IDA assistance to
the PHN sectors in Lesotho, a mid-term evaluation of the first project
showed thats (a) the project preparation process should place more emphasis
on the views of health workers and of beneficiaries; (b) project
implementation should rely more heavily on non-governmental organizations
and the private sector; and (c) project management arrangements should be
well-defined at the outset of the project, with adequate provision for
staff and technical advice. These lessons have been fully incorporated in
the design of the proposed second project.
7.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project will introduce the
necessary financial and institutional policy reforms (paras. 9 and 11) to
contribute to the achievement of the following objectives: (a) slowing the
pace of population growth; (b) continuing to strengthen the health system
in both rural and urban areas; (c) reducing spread of tuberculosis and
sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS; (d) lowering the rate of
malnutrition in children and mothers; and (e) strengthening support systems
for sector planning, financial, personnel, and health information
management, and manpower development. While MOH will be the lead executing
agency for the project and other Government ministries (Agriculture,
Interior, Education) will also participate, a number of NGOs -- especially
church mission health facilities and the Lesotho Planned Parenthood
Association -- will figure prominently in project implementation.
8.        Proiect Descriptior..  The project will support the following six
components: (a) Rural Health Services -- upgrading of clinics,
strengthening of district-based primary health care teams, supply of drugs
to peripheral facilities, and creation of a decentralized health
development fund; (b) Urban Health Services -_ development of a pilot
system of urban filter clinics and improvements to facilities, equipment,
and management of the central hospital; (c) Family Planning -- development



of a national population policy, staff training, And provision of
contraceptives; (d) Food and Nutrition -- technical and logistical support
to a pilot household food security scheme and to a food consumption
mnnitoring system; te) Disease Control -- expansion of ongoing TB control
and launching of STD control activities, institutional strengthening,
supply of drugs and equipment, and operations research; and (f)
Institutional Development -- training, advisory services, and logistical
back-up for MOH financial and information management, health planning and
education, and manpower development, and for the National Health Training
Center.
9.        Closely-related policy reforms will be pursued in two main
areas: (a) health financing -- increases in cost recovery and improved
efficiencies in major health facilities and catego ies of expenditure
(e.g., drugs); and (b) health institutions -- development of a more
mutually-supportive and performance-based relationship between MOH and
PHAL, compliance with agreed manpower expansion targets, and
intensification of public-private sector cooperation in providing health
and family planning services. A recent health financing study indicates
that the vast majority of households are willing and able to pay more for
Government health care; additionally, to protect the poor, increases in
health fees will be accompanied by exemptions for low-income households,
and an assessment of the new fee schedule's impact on equity, efficiency,
and revenues will be carried out in 1989-90. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Lesotho are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7668-LSO, dated June 10,
1989, is also attached.
10.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project is consistent with
the IDA lending strategy in Lesotho and the 1988 Policy Framework Paper,
which emphasize human resource development and increased discipline in
management of public expenditures. By slowing the rate of population
growth, the project would also help mitigate current strains on the
environment - another important element in TJA's lending strategy.  IDA has
a comparative advantage among donors in addressing the financial and
institutional issues mentioned above, and in mobilizing support from other
donors within a common framework of sectoral objectives. Continued
financial and technical inputs from IDA are also required to carry forward
the long-term activities in family planning, primary health care, and
management strengthening initiated under the ongoing first IDA project.
11.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following main
actions, which will constitute conditions of disbursement for specific
categories of financing: (a) cost recovery will be increased to 12Z of MOH
recurrent expenditures by June 1990, and 15Z by June 1992; (b) a scheme to
give Government health facilities incentives to collect fees will be
implemented by March 1990; (c) a new agreement between MOH and PHAL,
building on the 1984 framework agreement and linking future MOH assistance
to performance of PHAL institutions, will be finalized by March 1990; and
(d) MOH will adopt a plan for increasing utilization of private doctors and
nurses in Government hospitals by March 1990. Other significant Government



- 4 -
actions covered by dated covenants are thats (a) a hospital efficiency
study will be completed by June 1990 and a phased plan to strengthen
management and achieve unit-cost targets will be implemented starting in
April 1991; and (b) a study of efficiency and financing of drug
expenditures will be completed by December 1990, and a reform program
acceptable to IDA will be implemented by April 1991; and (c) senior posts
in the Health Manpower Department will be established and filled by
December 1989 and alternative scenarios for manpower expansion and
redeployment will be developed and discussed with IDA within the subsequent
twelve month period. Conditions of effectiveness are thats (a) co-financing
would be effective, and (b) key posts in the Project Management Unit would
be filled.
12.       Benefits. Women and children and low-income households will be
the primary direct beneficiaries, obtaining more healthy days of work and
study and general improvements in quality of life as a result of the
project's primary care, family planning, and uutrition activities. The
adult population will benefit directly from disease control efforts focused
on TB and STDIAIDS. Indirectly, the countrv will benefit from increased
productivity of a healthier labor force and savings through the
substitution of lower-cost preventive services for higher-cost curative
care and improved cost-effectiveness of PHN programs. Benefits accruing to
the Government will be additional revenues from cost recovery and
improvements in PHN technical and managerial capacity.
13.       Risks. The main project risks are thats (a) shortages of
Government manpower and skills at headquarters level could adversely affect
project implementation; and (b) lack of coordination between Government and
NGO health providers could inhibit service delivery and effective policy
reform. The first risk will be minimized through delegation of significant
implementation responsibility to district level and to NGOs, provision of
intensive training programs and selective technical assistance, and
development of a scheme to encourage private medical practitioners to work
part-time in the public sector. The second risk will be mltigated through
the support of more effective consultative arrangements (initiated during
project preparation) and promotion of an explicit performance-based
relationship between Government and NGO health facilities (para. 10).
14.       Recomeendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
