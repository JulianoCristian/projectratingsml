                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is composed of (i) a mining sector component, which is financed by the original credit and a second additional financing, which was signed on July 20, 2011, and (ii) a
                         petroleum sector component, which is financed by the first additional financing (signed in 2006). The project is at a defining point since the original credit is closing by December 31,
                         2011 while the second additional financing is about to launch a series of new activities. The shift in gear is a reflection of a surge in mining sector investments initiated by a number of

                         large-scale international mining corporations which are in the middle new developments as well as expansion of existing operations. These investments will significantly increase the
                         national output. As such, the second AF will scale up successful activities of the original credit and will equip the mining sector agencies to meet the rapidly increasing demands
                         resulting from the ramp-up of investments and production.

                         The implementation of petroleum sector component has been extended to November 2013. This will allow a smooth execution of activities towards institutional reforms and regulatory
                         strengthening in the wake of the approval in May, 2010, of the revised "Hydrocarbons Law".

                         Progress towards achievement of results indicators is satisfactory for the original solid minerals project component with all indicators being achieved. Petroleum sector indicators are
                         less advanced, but progressing on track for achievement by credit closure in 2013. Direct project achievements to date include: (i) computerized management systems have been
                         installed and operationalized for award and tracking of exploration and mine titles. (ii) Geological data has been collected and analyzed (though widespread dissemination is still
                         pending). (iii) Local economic development activities have exceeded the end of project targets in terms of community-driven micro projects and an impact assessment is underway to
                         demonstrate results on the ground. (iv) In the petroleum sector, a computerized database management system has been designed for concession management with expected roll-out
                         in late 2011/ early 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Second Additional Financing is pending government adoption. This is expected by approval in the National Assembly in late September, 2011.

                         The Second Additional will support private-public partnerships in important infrastructure and public service investments: (i) A School of Mines will open its doors in November 2011,
                         (ii) a committee of mine developers and government is working on the design and development of a pas power plant and network expansion, (iii) Streamlined principles and
                         procedures will coordinate local economic development activities which are currently promoted by different operators# and government schemes.
