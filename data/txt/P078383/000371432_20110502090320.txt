I. Introduction

1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a second
additional credit in an amount of US$7.1 million equivalent to the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania for the Second Mining Sector Capacity Building Project (PRISM 2 - P078383),
(Original Credit Number 3810-0; first Additional Financing Credit Number: 3810-1).

2.       The proposed additional financing would help finance the costs associated with scale up
of highly successful activities which have contributed to a substantial increase in mine
production and income-generating activities as well as social and economic benefits derived
from Mauritania’s mining industry. These activities include (i) local economic development in
mining areas, (ii) geological data management, and (iii) capacity building of public mining
institutions. Additionally, in response to the strong increase in sector activities and the resulting
strong government and industry demand for skilled mine technicians, a new activity of education
and vocational training support will be added. Accordingly, the additional financing will address
the complete value chain of extractive industries1.

3.      The original project is financed by an International Development Association (IDA)
Credit in the amount of US $18 million equivalent which was complemented by a first additional
credit of US $5 million equivalent in support of the petroleum sector. There are no co-financing
arrangements for the second additional financing. However, the Islamic Development Bank
(IDB) has confirmed a parallel financing of US $4 million towards geological and geo-physical
surveys2. A coalition of mine corporations has furthermore committed approximately US $15
million to the enhancement of national mine education and training institutions. Private mine
foundations for community development have also confirmed interest in adopting community
development practices which have proven successful under the original credit. Both the IDB and
the private sector have conditioned their support by the continued Bank engagement in the sector
since the Bank is considered the leader of policy dialogue and sector governance support in the
sector.

II. Background and Rationale for Additional Financing in the amount of US $7.1 million

Country and Sector Context

4.      Mauritania has a long history of a vibrant mining industry with Société Nationale
Industrielle et Minière (SNIM) extracting iron ore for almost half a century. Starting from 2006,
substantial gold and copper deposits have also been exploited by international ventures. Since
then, production volumes have gradually increased for all three commodities. In dollar terms, the
combined annual export value averaged some US $1 billion for 2008 and ’09. This figure
climbed to US $1.4 billion in 2010. By 2012, expansion of existing plants will further increase
production to around US $2 billion (assuming constant metal prices). Besides the impressive

1
  The “extractive industry value chain” refers to the five stages of natural resource exploitation: (i) access to
resources, (ii) exploitation of resources, (iii) collection of taxes and revenues from resource exploitation, (iv)
distribution of revenue and benefits, and (v) sustainable development.
2
  IDB provided a credit of US$5 million to the original credit while Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) provided a grant of US$2 million, both through parallel financing.

                                                          7
production growth rates (approximately 30% per annum since 2003), another derived outcome is
a 20% annual growth rate in mine investors’ exploration expenditure. Both of these
achievements are results of the Government’s legal and regulatory reform and general capacity
building which was supported by PRISM 1 and 2.

5.      2010 saw the entry of two major mining corporations, Xstrata and Kinross, as they
acquired important mine assets for development and expansion. Public announcements by the
two corporations point to a fundamental change in the scale of operations in the country as
production volume could increase five-fold within the next five to seven years, at a total capital
cost of nearly US $10 billion. In light of these developments, it is clear that extractive industries
will remain at the very center of the economy in decades to come. The rapid expansion of sector
activities represents a paradigm shift since the nationally-owned operator, SNIM, has changed
from being the all-dominant industry-leader. Prior to 2006, the company generated more than
90% of the total production value of the sector. In 2010, the SNIM market share just exceeded
50%, and by 2015, SNIM is likely to be relegated to second or third place in terms of annual
production volume3. The changing structure of the industry imposes new demands on
Government’s regulatory capacities since investors’ service demands are increasing while civil
society pressure for monitoring of operations and tax payments are also mounting.

6.       The impacts of mine operations have become very visible and direct in regions
surrounding the mines since mine developers have invested substantially in infrastructure
facilities (roads, water and electricity) which supply mine sites as well as local residential needs.
Health clinics and schools have also benefitted from improvements with a knock-on effect on the
level of economic activity. Through the EITI process increasing tax contributions from the
expansion of mine activities is observed, although developers’ debt obligation and repayments
have reduced the effective tax contributions during early years of operation, as is the case in all
investment-intensive industries. However, 2011 marks the first year of full tax liabilities for the
two copper and gold operations commencing in late 2006.

7.      The importance of the mineral sector is also reflected in the current CAS (FY 2007-2011)
objectives aiming at achieving economic and social development based on private sector
development and natural resources. The project is specifically contributing to the following three
pillars of the CAS: Pillar 2 “anchor growth in the economic environment of the poor”, Pillar 3
“develop human resources and generalize access to social services, and in particular Pillar 4
”improve good governance and capacity building”. The project contribution to these pillars is
nested in (i) promotion of, mainly private sector, investments in sustainable exploitation of
natural resources, (ii) support to the integration of these investments into the social and economic
development of the mine regions, and (iii) support to the School of Mines in forming the next
generation of mine specialists.

8.      Nonetheless, new investments of the proposed magnitude will impose enormous
challenges to the Mauritanian economy and management of the mining sector. Infrastructure
developments, although predominantly financed by the mine corporations, will have to be
carefully planned for the purpose of integrated economic and social planning. New skill sets will

 The diminishing role of SNIM is in relative terms since the company is expanding by some 30% over the coming
years, but other larger-scale developments are expected to eclipse SNIM’s scale of operation

be required for the labor market. Most importantly, regulatory oversight and sector governance
must be strengthened in order to ensure appropriate performance by operators and strong
management of government revenue collection as well as expenditure planning.

The Original Credit and Project Objectives

9.       The original credit – US$18 million equivalent - was approved by the Board on July 8,
2003, became effective on October 17, 2003, and is progressing in a satisfactory manner. An
initial additional financing component of US$5 million was approved on July 6, 2006 in support
of extension of project scope to the petroleum sector. The closing date of the original credit,
together with the first additional financing, was extended from March 15, 2009, to December 31,
2010, and subsequently to December 31, 2011. On February 7, 2011 the Regional Vice
Presidency approved as a policy exception an extension of project closing date to November 15,
2013, for first and proposed second additional financing, which is 20 months beyond the
maximum 3 years’ timeframe for additional financing. The need for a closing date extension was
a consequence of the political instability in-country in 2008 and 2009 which caused a delay in
project execution of approximately 20 months. Legal amendments for the first additional
financing are processed in parallel with, but independently of the second additional financing.

10.     The original objective of the project was “to strengthen the Government’s capacity to
regulate mining activities in its territory and thereby facilitate private investment in the mining
sector, through:
        1. fostering local economic development in mining areas,
        2. improving gathering and access to geological information, and
        3. strengthening the Government’s institutional and technical capacity to manage
            mineral resources”

Project Performance and Status of Implementation

11.     Over the past 12 years the Bank, through PRISM 1 and 2, has supported the Recipient’s
extensive sector strengthening. The strengthening initiatives have been highly successful judged
by the sharp increase in investor interest and production activities. Investors are praising the
legal code and the regulatory framework for clarity and consistency. These aspects have been
determining factors for investors’ decision to engage in Mauritania. Legal and regulatory support
has been at the core of the PRISM activities with gradual improvements of the contractual
framework for mine investment and operations. Intensive capacity building among ministry staff
and strengthened management systems represent the second pillar of successful PRISM support.
In sum, PRISM activities have been integral components of a highly successful sector reform
program led by the Recipient.

12.     Direct project achievements to date include: (i) computerized management systems have
been installed and operationalized for award and tracking of exploration and mine titles as well
as for environmental monitoring. (ii) Geological data has been collected and analyzed (though
widespread dissemination is still pending). (iii) Local economic development activities have
exceeded the end of project targets in terms of community-driven micro projects and an impact
assessment is underway to demonstrate results on the ground. (iv) In the petroleum sector, a

                                                9
computerized database management system has been designed for concession management with
expected roll-out in 2011. The Hydrocarbons Law was revised in 2010, PRISM 2 is supporting
the completion of the implementing regulation. In addition, Mauritania is participating in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Mauritania has submitted its first Validation
Report to the EITI Board which was deemed “close to compliant” with a deadline for
remediation in June, 2011. In sum, Mauritania has substantially advanced all parts of the
extractive industries value chain, also referred to as the EITI++ which spans from award of
licenses over tracking of performance and revenue collection to the final objective of sustainable
social and economic development deriving from the extractive industries.

13.    Progress towards achievement of results indicators is highly satisfactory for the original
solid minerals project with all indicators being achieved – except the tracking of household
income level in mine regions for which a follow-up survey is presently under preparation.
Petroleum sector indicators are less advanced, but progressing on track for achievement by credit
closure in 2013. Progress to date on all indicators is presented in the results monitoring table in
Annex 1.

14.      Implementation progress of mining as well as petroleum sector components is deemed
satisfactory with the large majority of mining sector activities being fully completed while
petroleum sector activities have accelerated since the second half of 2010 thanks to signing and
initiation of key interventions. The original mining sector component has eclipsed a
disbursement rate of 85% while the petroleum sector component has disbursed 29%. The first
additional financing in 2006 provided resources for the petroleum sector support in response to
expected large-scale oil and gas exploitation. Notwithstanding, only one field, the Chinguitti oil
field has gone into operation, and current production stands at less than 10% of original capacity
which was estimated at 75,000 barrels per day. Other oil and gas explorations have not yielded
the results which were expected in the beginning of the 2000s, as a result, none of these have
advanced to production. In consideration of the declining relevance of the petroleum sector, the
second additional financing will not cover this area. On the other hand, activities supported by
the first additional financing will continue in parallel with the proposed mining sector activities
since the petroleum sector prospects remain relatively good although in a longer timeframe than
what was earlier expected.

15.     Lessons learnt from activities to date indicate that internal coordination in the MPEM is
strong and results from sector-specific activities (e.g. cadastre management, regulatory
strengthening, etc.) have been most successful. On the other hand cross-sectoral coordination and
inter-ministerial collaboration could be further improved. A renewed focus will be given to
cross-sectoral issues such as environmental management, tax calculation and collection. Other
instruments include reinforced collaboration with relevant bank project (Community-Based
Rural Development Project, Urban Development Project, and Public Sector Capacity Building
Project)

16.     The Project is in full compliance with all legal covenants and has no unresolved audit
issues. Audits are up-to-date and procurement guidelines are followed consistently. It is also
confirmed that all mandatory core indicators in the results framework are incorporated and
progress is monitored. All safeguard requirements are also in compliance.

                                                10
17.    The rapidly expanding mining industry and the resulting increased demand for sector
governance and management of mineral resources provide strong justification for sustained Bank
support to the sector. Alternatives to the second Additional Financing were considered (e.g.
preparation of a new, separate project) but rejected to take advantage of the strong
implementation performance of the PRISM 2. Moreover, since proposed activities would mostly
scale up existing interventions, additional financing was considered the most appropriate
instrument.

III. Proposed Changes

18.     Although PRISM2 has substantially contributed to attracting sector investments and
increasing mineral exports, these sector performance indicators cannot be solely attributed to the
project. Therefore, while the overall goal of the project’s intervention will remain unchanged, i.e.
capacity building of mineral sector agencies, the Project Development Objective (PDO) will be
adjusted to simplify the PDO and to focus on what this Technical Assistance project can be
reasonably held accountable for. It is proposed to revise the Project Development Objective as
follows:
        “The objective of the project is to strengthen the Recipient’s capacity to
        manage national mineral sector activities in an environmentally, socially
        and economically sustainable manner.”

19.    The proposed additional financing will follow the original project components structure:
(i) Local Economic Development in Mining Areas, (ii) Geo-information and Development, (iii)
Capacity Building in Public Mining Institutions, and (iv) Project Coordination and Management
and will add a new component: (v) Support of the School of Mines and Vocational Training. The
petroleum sector support, financed through the first additional financing will not be affected by
the proposed second additional financing. PDO indicators will be revised accordingly. The
revised Results Framework is presented in Annex 1 to update the indicators in line with the full
scope of activities and to strengthen the tracking of all sub-components of the project.

20.     The scale-up of the original project components will expand activities to regions which
have seen a recent influx of mine investments and will roll out tested and proven community
development models in collaboration with foundations sponsored by private mine operators. In
this context, lessons learnt from parallel Bank-financed projects (Community-Based Rural
Development Project and Urban Development Project) will be integrated to further refine
adaptation to local needs. The support to geo-information and capacity building will deepen
individual and institutional capacities in response to the rapidly expanding sector operations and
entrance of new investors. Environmental management and systematic monitoring of operators’
performance will receive special attention as the pool of operators has grown rapidly in recent
years with a resulting demand for improved oversight mechanisms. Finally, the new component
of support to the School of Mines and vocational training will support government efforts of
establishing a sub-sector of the national education and training sector to accommodate the
demands from the industry for a skilled workforce. This component will be carefully coordinated
with Bank-financed projects supporting higher education and technical/vocational training. A
more detailed description of project sub-components is found in Annex 3. The following table

21.     The closing date of the original credit remains December 31, 2011. Notwithstanding, it
has become clear that three key contracts under the original credit are likely not to be concluded
by the closing date, i.e. “Interpretation and Synthesis of Geo-Scientific Data”, “Supervision of
Geo-Scientific Data Interpretation””, and “Environmental Audits of Major Mine Operations”.
The present Project Paper proposes to extend the closing date under the original Credit for the
three captioned contracts to October 1, 2012.

22.     As mentioned earlier, approval has been given for a revised closing date until November
15, 2013, of the first additional financing. Extension was necessitated by the country-wide
moratorium of operations in 2008-09 in response to political instability. Remaining activities
pertain to regulatory strengthening, petroleum sector promotion, and staff training. The proposed
closing date for the second additional financing is November 15, 2013

24.    Implementation arrangements under the proposed additional financing would remain the
same as under the on-going project. The current Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has efficiently
implemented the existing project. The PCU is fully staffed with a project coordinator and a
deputy coordinator, procurement specialist, financial management and disbursements staff,
monitoring and evaluation officer and a geologist. The PCU staff and arrangements will be
maintained throughout the duration of the additional financing.

25.    The Recipient has adopted a Project Execution Manual (PEM) for the purpose of the
implementation of the original project, with updates reflecting the first and second additional
financing. The PEM will continue to be used throughout the duration of the project. Annual
Work Plan and Budgets for each year of the project implementation are developed by the PCU in
consultation with relevant agencies, and this arrangement will remain without changes.

26.     The proposed Additional Financing will finance 100% of eligible expenditure. In contrast
to the original credit and first Additional Financing which separated costs by different categories,
the proposed second Additional Financing will operate with only two categories, i.e. “Grants”
and one combined category including all eligible expenditure, as reflected in Table 3 below.

28.     Procurement for second additional financing activities will be carried out in line with the
guidelines for procurement of goods and works and for consultants’ selections published in May
2004, revised in October 2006 and May 2010. Procurement for the original and first additional
credit will adopt the same procurement guidelines for all procurement not yet initiated. Likewise,
prior review thresholds will be consolidated in line with the harmonized threshold in IDA-
financed projects in the country. To this end, an amendment of the legal documents providing for
the original credit and first additional financing will be signed. Procurement capacities have been
assessed and are in line with Bank requirements. A Procurement Plan for the first 18 months has
also been prepared and reviewed.

29.    A financial management assessment was carried out in March 2011 in the context of the
preparation the additional financing for PRISM 2. The conclusion of the assessment is that the
financial management system in place, subject to the reinforcement measures, satisfies the

                                                16
Bank’s minimum requirements under OP/BP10.02, and therefore is adequate to provide, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely financial management information on the status of the
project required by World Bank. It is expected that the auditor of the PRISM 2 under recruitment
will also audit the additional financing resources. The fiduciary aspects of the current operation
will be handled by the qualified fiduciary team of PCU who has strong knowledge and
experience in Bank’s fiduciary procedures; which is one of the strengths of the financial
management arrangement for this additional financing operation.

30.    A new segregated designated account (DA) in US $ to be opened at a commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank will be established for the additional financing. Ceiling of the designated
account will be US $950,000. The project will continue to use Statement of Expenditure (SOE)
and/or Summary Sheet to document project expenditures, and SOE thresholds for various
expenditure types under the original project will continue for the additional financing.

IV. Appraisal Summary

Economic considerations

31.     The project is a capacity building project and, as such, does not lend itself easily to
quantitative investment analysis. However, numerous economic indicators illustrate the benefits
to Mauritania of the rapidly expanding industry activity. Total mineral sales have gone from
appr. US $175 million in 2003 to more than US $1.4 billion in 2010. Taxes have followed an
even stronger incline with total receipts increasing from US $15 million in 2003 to about US
$135 million in 2010. Direct efficiency gains within the sector administration are illustrated by
the permit fees paid by mining companies. Since 2007 the annual revenue from fees has
multiplied by ten from US $500,000 to US $5 million. While fiscal and economic benefits to
date are largely derived from successful sector promotion and the entrance of new operators,
future increases are expected to originate from improved tax calculation (as initial tax holidays
expire) and the creation of stronger linkages between the local economy and mine operations.
These aspects are directly supported by the additional financing.

Risks

32.     Overall project risks are rated to be “Moderate driven by likelihood” for preparation as
well as implementation. The project is a continuation of existing project activities and the PCU
has ample experience of Bank fiduciary procedures. However, at country-level, fiduciary
weaknesses pose a certain risk to project execution. The Bank plans to provide continued
training and undertake risk-based supervision missions to help build capacity and ensure that
adequate controls are in place for all fiduciary aspects. The long and open Bank engagement with
sector agencies has produced a firm consensus on policy direction and sector priorities which
guides the activities. Civil society has engaged strongly in the extractive industries in the interest
of (i) mitigating/managing negative impacts of mine operations and (ii) ensuring transparency in
revenue management. Under the auspices of the national EITI committee, a platform for
consultation among civil society, government and the private sector has been established. This
platform has engendered a common understanding of the actual fiscal contribution from the
extractive industries. The project is also directly supporting environmental audits of the mine


                                                 17
operations and strengthening of the management system to supervise technical, environmental
and social performance obligations.

Safeguards

33.     The current Project Environmental Category (B) would not change under the additional
financing. The additional financing does not trigger any new policies. To date, safeguards
compliance of the project is satisfactory. Three instruments were prepared prior to the original
credit in order to guide safeguard activities during project implementation, i.e (i) a Sectoral
Environmental Assessment (SEA), (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and (iii)
Environmental Impact Assessment of the Future Nouakchott University Campus (EIA). All
documents have been updated and disclosed prior to appraisal to reflect the additional financing
and to provide a clearer link between current sector issues and activities supported under the
project. Additionally, an Environmental Management Framework – Environmental Management
Plan to guide safeguard issues pertaining to the micro projects and construction of the technical
school4 has been prepared and disclosed prior to appraisal. Construction of a School of Mines in
Nouakchott, which is also associated with the project, is envisaged at the university campus; the
EIA prepared for the Higher Education Project in 2004 has been updated and re-disclosed. There
are no land acquisition/involuntary resettlement issues on the Nouakchott university campus, as
the land is owned by the Government and is free of any tenants and claims. An additional
remedy has been included in the Financing Agreement, which allows the Association to suspend
the withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account or accelerate the repayment of the Credit when
the Association has determined that: (i) the Recipient has failed to apply sound environmental or
social standards or practices in its management or carrying out of activities in its mining sector;
and (ii) as a result of such failure, a situation has arisen after the date of this Agreement which
makes it improbable that the objectives of the Project will be achieved.

Policy Exceptions

34.    A policy exception to Operational Policy 13.20 governing Additional Financing for
Investment Lending was granted by the Regional Vice President on February 7, 2011, to allow
extension of original closing date beyond three years for the first additional financing and for the
second additional financing. No other policy exceptions are being sought. The project
implementation structure is fully in place and operational, all manuals are in compliance with the
Bank requirements. Safeguards documents have been prepared in line with the relevant OPs/BPs
and have been publicly disclosed.

                       Annex 3: Detailed Description of New Activities
MAURITANIA: SECOND MINING SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT

   Component 1. Local Economic Development in Mining Areas

Activities financed under the local economic development (LED) will support government and
local authorities in translating mine investments into sustained economic activity in the project-
affected areas and in spurring diversification of the local and national economy. With the
expected surge in investment inflows to the sector, it is imperative that the local and national
economy take proactive steps to create synergies with the mine developers in terms of
infrastructure and social service investments. Moreover, economic development must be
facilitated to optimize benefits deriving from mine operations, such as job creation, development
of local sub-contracting and supply to the mine, industrial diversification, business development,
etc.

1.1 Development and diversification of local economic activities
(a) Local business development (US $250,000)
The original PRISM 2 credit has recorded strong success in promotion of diversified business
development in the Nouadhibou-Zouerate corridor. This component intends to take the
achievements one step further by offering training modules for local entrepreneurs in topics such
as business planning, financial management and technical skills. The local business development
initiative rests on two parallel targets: (i) offering higher quality and more diversified goods and
services to the local consumers and (ii) exploiting the potential for supplying and servicing the
mine sites so as to increase local and national content in mine operations. Experience from
Mauritania and other mining countries shows that the best prospects for augmenting local sub-
contracting are found in catering services and maintenance and construction works. The training
modules will be conducted on site to assure highest participation of local beneficiaries and will
be composed of general business competencies and targeted courses which suit the particular
business needs in the given areas. Agricultural extension services which were first implemented
through the original credit will also be refined and be included as part of the technical support.

(b) Micro project administration (US $ 750,000)
More than 50 micro projects in the Nouadhibou-Zouerate corridor have been successfully
executed during the original credit with an additional batch of some 20 micro projects to be
implemented in 2011. Modalities have been firmly established with concise proposal and
documentation requirements and field presence through a satellite project office in Zouerate. The
office administrator provides on-the-ground support to project beneficiaries as well as local
authorities. The project team has received requests from government authorities as well as mine
operators to expand the micro project program to other locations where communities are affected
by mine operations. The current component will focus on refining administrative modalities and
implementation procedures in order to disseminate know-how and possibly manage programs
financed by external sources (private mine operators have expressed interest) with community
commitments but who do not possess the community development expertise. It is also envisaged
that the component will finance a limited amount of seed funds to launch new programs in a
timely manner. Update of the administrative procedures will be done with due consideration to
the results and lessons from the Bank-financed Community-Based Rural Development Project.

(Not continued under the proposed additional financing)

1.3 Hydro-geological studies
(Not continued under the proposed additional financing)

1.4 Strengthening of development management capacity
(a) Development planning at regional level (US $250,000)
A regional “public expenditure plan 2020” will be prepared for selected areas and communes in
the Inchiri Province (Wilaya) which is host to two large-scale mine operations (Tasiast and
Akjoujt gold and copper mines). The local PEP’s will meet an immediate local demand spurred
by an inflow of investments but will also serve as a role model for replication in other parts of
the country. The province saw the first influx of investment and migrants when the Tasiast and
Akjoujt mines commenced operation is 2006. The town of Akjoujt is estimated to have grown
from some 15,000 to 50,000 inhabitants between 2005 and 2010. A second wave of migrant
workers, dependents and other business people is expected to arrive with the expansion of the
Tasiast mine and potential developments of other very prospective mine sites in the province.
The PEP will help develop a strategy for absorbing the expected inflow of people by undertaking
a comprehensive assessment of investment needs for infrastructure and social services. The
expansion of mine operations will also require substantial investments in infrastructure (road,
water and possibly railway and port facilities). The PEP will aim at merging the public
investment needs with the mine operators’ investment plans so as to open up infrastructure
investments for combined usage. The PEP will also assess sustainability issues related to
financing maintenance costs of the public goods and services as well as needs for local capacity
building in order to manage and sustain the investments. Comprehensive consultation and
training activities are also planned in conjunction with this activity. Linkages to the Bank-
financed Urban Development Project are sought,

(b) Support to community consultation and participation processes (US $200,000)
The Bank has generated ample experience of inclusive consultation with communities affected
by mine operations, and especially marginalized groups such as women, elderly and ethnic
minorities. International best-practice will be tailored to national demands and sensitivities in
order to establish ready-to-use manuals for government authorities as well as private investors.
The manuals are expected to become important tools for successful execution of other project
components and for potentially private investors’ community engagement.

1.5 Supervision of local economic development (US $300,000)
Monitoring and evaluation of the impact of mine investments in the affected communities and
local economy is a crucial part of ensuring that mine investments and operations are contributing
to economic and social development in positive and sustainable manner. At international level,
investor commitment to comprehensive baseline studies of economic and social indicators has
improved greatly in recent years, but too often the focus is turned towards one-off compensation
arrangements without any consideration of longer term impacts and sustainability of community
investments. Even in the event of strong investor engagement in continuous M&E of impacts,
there is often a hesitation or suspicion among local communities and civil societies of biased

                                               32
reporting and the depiction of overly positive impacts. The M&E component will support
relevant government and local authorities in defining an appropriate M&E system to capture
impacts though regular reporting. The activities to be funded will seek engagement and
collaboration with private investors (possibly through the International Council for Minerals and
Metals) in compilation and tracking of indicators. The component will also finance government
representatives to participate in data collection so as to ensure a balance between private and
public sector participation in the M&E surveys. The increased government participation is
expected to reinforce civil society confidence in the reporting. The component will also support
awareness creation and active participation from civil society interests.

   Component 2. Geo-information and development

Various data collection campaigns have been conducted during the original project and through
prior and parallel financing. Data collection has covered a wide range of geo-physical and
geological surveys as well as geo-chemical analyses. Sector agencies have done substantial
interpretation and developed a comprehensive knowledge base, but with further refinements in
software and modeling techniques, it is warranted to invest additional resources in data analysis
and integration of data. Government is also planning to conduct new geological surveys through
financing from the Islamic Development Bank. The second Additional Financing would provide
resources for analysis of the newly acquired datasets. Lastly, resources will be required for
dissemination of the content of the geological database and the analytical production and map
interpretations.

2.1 Airborne geophysical surveys
(Not supported under Additional Financing)

2.2 Geological surveys
(a) Support to SIGE and SIGM (US $250,000)
Under the Department of Mines and Geology two agencies are charged with database
management and analysis of geological and environmental information, Service de la Géologie
and Service de l’Environnement Minier, respectively. The backbone of the database management
are two dedicated information systems, Système informatique de gestion environnemental
(SIGE) and Système informatique de gestion minière (SIGM), While the systems have proven
useful for sector management and promotion and as a reference point for investors, the rapidly
changing sector context and the growing complexity of geological and environmental datasets
require a comprehensive system update. Likewise, staff is in need of training. Technical
assistance will assess system functionality, provide on-the-job training and redesign software
components in collaboration with ministry staff. In parallel, critical hardware purchases will also
be financed.

(b) Publication and dissemination of geological survey (US $300,000)
While the geological knowledge of Mauritania is comprehensive, it is recognized that the full
scope of the data has not yet been clearly communicated to the wider investment community or
local businesses. Technical assistance will support the MPEM in further publication of key
aspects, such as characterization of high potential mineral groups, hydrological survey data, etc.
MPEM will also study options for web-based data dissemination.

                                                33
2.3 Hydro-geological mapping and water database of Mauritania
(Not supported under Additional Financing)

2.4 Synthesis of geological data and mineral resources information
Interpretation of geo-physics (US $650,000)
A comprehensive geological knowledge base has been compiled over the years. The knowledge
base comprises various dimensions of information, including geo-physical, geological and geo-
chemical parameters. In order to better target prospective zones of geological and mineralogical
interest, the various dimensions need to be interpreted in an integrated manner. It is the objective
of this activity to identify potential zones for more detailed surveying. An international
consultant will be recruited, but in consideration of the capacities and experience that ministry
staff have build up over the years, the work will be carried out as a cooperative effort which
would combine global expertise with local knowledge.

2.5 Supervision of the geological infrastructure component
(Not supported under Additional Financing)

   Component 3. Capacity building of Public Mining Institutions

The newly established “Police des mines” is tasked with overall coordination of inspecting mine
operators but resources and knowledge are sourced from other departments and ministries,
including the Ministry of Environment, tax authorities and others. The full range of these
ministries will be the primary beneficiaries of this sub-component.

3.1 Mining Sector Promotion Unit
(a) Mining sector promotion initiatives (US$ 300,000)
The project will also support design of a sector promotion strategy in order to enhance the
awareness of the geological potential and the depth of geo-data already available in Mauritania.
The promotion strategy would have both a domestic and an international angle so as to target
local businesses as well as international investors. A road-show and series of workshops will be
designed for a local audience, i.e. small mining enterprises and geological consulting companies.
Existing information brochures and promotion material will be updated for participation at
selected international minerals investment such as the Prospectors and Developers Association of
Canada (PDAC), as well as regional investment promotion events specific to the minerals sector.

(b) Public awareness and stakeholder participation (US $200,000)
The additional financing will support consultancy services to develop a public awareness
program for areas where mining activities are taking place. The purpose is to inform citizens and
government officials of the laws and regulations pertaining to the mining sector, and to facilitate
community consultation, as provided in the relevant legislation. A detailed community
consultation and sensitization toolkit will be developed with literature in the local language to
explain, in simple terms, the rights and obligations of mine operators and communities under the
legislation. An important aspect of the consultation toolkit will be to explain to local
communities the benefit streams that could accrue to communities, as well as the mitigation of

                                                34
negative impacts and influences. At national level, the project will collaborate with the national
EITI committee on public awareness campaigns.

3.2 Mining cadastre unit follow-up
(Included under sub-component 3.4)

3.3 Environmental management of the mining sector
Environmental audits of the three largest operators in Mauritania are carried under the original
credit. Follow-up activities to this work will be included under sub-component 3.4 below.

3.4 Institutional strengthening of the Directorate for Mining and Geology
(a) Integration of M&E systems for supervision of operators’ performance (US c$300,000)
The Ministry of Energy, Petroleum and Mining has developed, with support from PRISM 1 and
2, an electronic database for management of environmental matters (Système informatique de
gestion environnementale – SIGE). A comprehensive pool of environmental (and to some extent
social) characteristics is compiled in SIGE. Notwithstanding, the SIGE lacks integration with
other sector databases and reporting templates. As a result, currently SIGE is not capable of
monitoring performance of individual operators over time. It is envisioned to design internal
portals of data transfer from the existing cadastre management system to the SIGE so as to obtain
key information and performance obligations for individual mine title holders. The updated
SIGE will be capable of tracking and reporting on social and environmental performance of the
operations and recording the benefit streams arising from mine activities.

The Additional Financing will support redesign and implementation of database and reporting
templates. Appropriate IT upgrades will be purchased as will essential equipment for conducting
field missions, regular and surprise site inspections. Moreover, the original PRISM 2 credit is
presently financing environmental audits of the largest mine operators with the intention to
verify whether or not agreed performance obligations and management plans are properly
implemented. Conclusions of the audits are expected only in third quarter of 2011, but pertinent
recommendations will be adopted under the support activities. It will be of crucial importance to
instill financial and operational viability in the database and reporting procedures to ensure that
adequate financing mechanisms are in place for sustaining its operations after project closure and
to ensure that users at central and local level are capacitated and incentivized to maintain the
upgraded SIGE.

(b) Regulatory strengthening of mining operations (US$ 150,000)
Whilst the Mining Law was revised in 2008, it has become clear that various concerns have not
been addressed. For that reason, further revision and clarification is envisioned in the short term.
The additional financing will provide funding for technical assistance to prepare revisions to the
legal text as well as specific regulations that have yet to be addressed, inter alia: (i) occupational
health and safety regulations for mining; (ii) divisions of authority between provincial and
central authorities and across sector agencies, such as the division of responsibility between
MEPM and the Ministry of Environment; (iii) division of benefits with the local authorities; and
(iv) detailed regulations on mines inspection.

3.5 Training in mine site inspections and reporting (US $550,000)

                                                 35
Associated to the redesign and upgrading of information systems, on-the-job training will be
provided to government staff tasked with inspection responsibilities. Local authorities will also
be expected to contribute to reporting of operators’ performance. Likewise, mine operators will
be required to file regular self-reporting templates. Regional workshops will be organized to
ensure that procedures are properly disseminated and understood by the respective users. Other
aspects of sector governance will also be covered.

    Component 4. School of Mines and technical training support

Government of Mauritania has decided to establish a School of Mines (SOM) in response to the
current demand for specialized sector professionals and not least the expectation of increasing
future needs for qualified employees at current and projected mine operations. To this end,
Government is collaborating closely with private and public mine companies as well as
development partners with the objective to launch the first in-take of some 25-40 students in
October, 2011. The School of Mines will be composed of an academic program (5 years) and a
technical diploma program (3 years) which will produce the following candidates:

Academic program (at Nouakchott academic campus):
    Mine engineers
    Mine geologists
    Electro-mechanic engineers

Technical diploma program (in Akjoujt, close to operating copper/gold mine):
    Welders
    Fitters
    Mechanics
    Masons

The time table envisions opening of the academic degree program in October, 2011 while the
diploma program has a start date of January, 2013. The academic program will consist of a two-
year single-stream curriculum before a final three-year specialization in the three engineering
disciplines listed above. The initial lecturing will take place in rented facilities which will
accommodate the initial limited number of students and the predominantly theoretical teaching
methods. Construction of a permanent engineering campus will commence in spring 2011 and be
implemented in parallel with the academic program. The targeted construction completion date is
September 2013, in time for opening as the first class of students enter the Third Year cycle at
which time specialization will commence.

The diploma program will require immediate access to workshops and laboratory facilities,
commencement of courses is, thus, determined by the construction schedule for the required
facilities. Subject to detailed design, construction is expected to be completed late 2012 or early
2013. The center for the technical diploma program will be located in proximity to the operating
copper/gold mine in Akjoujt although exact location is not yet known, some 250 km from
Nouakchott. The capacity of the technical school will be approximately 50 students per year.
Management of the facilities as well as daily operation of the diploma program will be


                                                36
supervised by a resident director, but overall program and curriculum management will be led by
a Nouakchott-based SOM director general.

The bulk of the capital costs will be derived from corporate sponsorships, while operational
expenditures are projected to accrue from a sales tax on mineral sales. Resources from the Bank
would target fiduciary aspects, quality assurance of study program, training of trainers and
supplementary course programs whose audience would also include sector specialists from
ministries and sector agencies.

4.1 Coordination and advisory services for oversight of School of Mines development (US
$200,000)
Additional staff is urgently needed for coordination of SOM development and project
management. Currently, a small administration of one senior professor and two staff are
responsible for all administrative and executive tasks related to supporting the inter-ministerial
supervision committee. One additional senior staff will be recruited in order to separate the
planning and coordination work between curriculum development on the one hand and
construction supervision and facilities management/ administration on the other. The job title for
the latter tasks will be Facilities and Development Manager. Besides daily supervision of
construction works and related administrative issues, the Facilities and Development Manager
will lead the process of staff recruitment as well as student enrollment. Another important task
pertains to coordination between the academic program located in Nouakchott and the technical
diploma program which is under construction in Akjoujt.

Legal statutes have been prepared for the SOM, defining its legal structure and principles of
governance. However, the project will finance detailed procedures which have yet to be
developed for the functioning of the Board of SOM (Conseil d’Administration). The legal
support would also facilitate recurrent Board meetings and its operations. Advisory services will
be provided for operational procedures which are considered crucial for SOM’s autonomy and its
quality of operations. These include development of procurement procedures including mandate
and functioning of the SOM Staff Selection Committee. Financial management manual, internal
reporting procedures and auditing requirements will also be supported. Other operational issues
may also need to be addressed such as public funding mechanism, regional collaboration, etc.

4.2 Curriculum development and research/professional outreach programs (US $200,000)
Core curriculum of the academic and technical diploma programs will be financed by private
sector contributions, but supplementary course modules will be financed by the Bank on (i)
financial principles of mine development and operation, (ii) governance, legislation and policy-
making in the mining sector, (iii) principles of mine taxation. The Bank has a comparative
advantage in these topics since similar activities have been supported elsewhere in the region and
beyond. The audience will not be limited to enrolled students but also include the wider sector
interests. In this way, SOM will engage in research and outreach activities which serve a broader
audience than the academia.

Equipment purchases may also be included under Bank support, subject to financial constraints.
Priority purchases would include library infrastructure and population as well as essential
laboratory equipment.

                                               37
4.3 Training of trainers (US $200,000)
Support will be extended to training of SOM staff with emphasis on up-grading/up-dating
lecturers’ teaching skills in line with the curriculum to be taught. Limited support may also be
given to administrative staff in order to ensure streamlined school management. Training and
skills development will be executed as overseas exchange programs of limited duration or in-
country training delivery. Visiting professors and twinning programs will also be eligible for
funding based on approved operational plans for SOM. It is also an explicit objective for the
SOM to engage in regional collaboration with peer institutes in (francophone) West Africa so as
to create regional centers of excellence in specialized subjects and mobilize a critical mass of
student demand and external resource mobilization. Regional partnership programs will be
supported through protocols for student exchange programs and delivery of lectures with a
regional audience.

4.4 Peer reviewer of School of Mines execution (US $250,000)
A key ambition behind the formation of a School of Mines which is operating autonomously
from the existing national education system is the interest in maintaining a high quality of
teaching and eventually highly qualified graduates from the SOM. This sub-component will
finance an external panel of experts to conduct regular assessments of the SOM. Assessments
will be based on mutually agreed performance parameters including evaluation of teaching
techniques, review of grading system and graduate competencies, inspection of facilities and
resources available for lecturers and students. Survey methodologies will also be designed for
tracking satisfaction rates among students, graduates and employers. The review mechanism
serves multiple stakeholder groups ranging from students, employers (including Government of
Mauritania) and regional academic institutions which have an interest in assuring consistency in
school performance before and during regional partnership arrangements which may lead to
commonly accepted accreditation programs.

4.5 Coordination of vocational training programs (US $200,000)
In addition to the formation of a highly skilled workforce to steer the future development of the
Mauritanian mining industry, operators and developers have an imminent need for technically
competent workers for mine construction/ expansions as well as exploration activities and mine
operation. The envisioned workforce will not require higher technical education, but a strong set
of competencies and knowledge of specialized work practices will be needed. Such specialized
training modules are usually of a duration of one to six months and taught at vocational training
centers. Existing training centers in Mauritania do not meet the anticipated demands, either
because of capacity constraints (SNIM training center in Zouerate can only accommodate
SNIM’s own personnel) or because of inadequate or obsolete training programs and facilities.
The sub-component will support initiatives of collaboration between companies and training
centers in developing tailor-made training programs which meet company employment needs.
Initiatives of collaboration have commenced where companies aim to make use of existing
training facilities but provide additional equipment, curriculum and teaching skills/ experts to
conduct the training programs on a “Lease-Operate-Transfer” basis. The training centers will
benefit from the programs through up-grade of equipment and curriculum as well as staff
capacity building. The subcomponent will assist, through consultancies, in match-making
between industry demands and training supply, in defining accreditation programs and in

                                               38
assuring continuity of training programs. This sub-component will be closely aligned with
Technical and Vocational Education and Training project in terms of integrating improved
school management structures, training of trainers and other pertinent cross-cutting issues.

       Component 5. Project execution and administration (US $1,300,000)

The Additional Financing will continue to support the dedicated Project Coordination Unit which
has been functional throughout the PRISM 1 and 2 operations. The PCU is responsible for all
fiduciary arrangements pertaining to the project as well as administration of contracts. The PCU
operates in close collaboration with the Ministry of Industry and Mines on management of
Project activities and integration into the wider sector reform and strengthening. Emphasis will
be placed on smooth transitioning of Project tasks to the relevant ministry departments and
development of an action plan for sustaining Project outcomes after the closing date in
November, 2013, which cannot be extended as per the policy exception for final extension of
closing dates.
