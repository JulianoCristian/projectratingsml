The second additional\n            financing will scale up activities that have been\n            successfully implemented during the initial stages of the\n            project: (i) build local and regional capacity to benefit\n            from and establish economic linkages with mine operations,\n            (ii) strengthen national capacity to regulate and supervise\n            mine operations, and (iii) expand the geological\n            knowledge-base. Finally, (iv) a new activity of education\n            and vocational training support will be added to help form a\n            new generation of mining specialists."}, "docdt": "2011-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
