1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Mauritania has since its independence in 1960 been highly dependent on revenues from its natural
wealth of iron ore and fisheries. Traditionally, they have accounted for the bulk of national exports.
For this reason the two Mining Sector Capacity Building Projects (“Projet de Renforcement
Institutionnel du Secteur Minier”, or PRISM), have been considered important building blocks in
Mauritania's national development strategy. The state-owned Société Nationale industrielle et Minière
(SNIM) commenced iron ore mining in the early 1960’s and has remained a central source of
government-funding since its creation. Paradoxically despite important ore reserves and massive donor
financing for its investments, SNIM's annual production of 10-12 million tons remained stagnant
between the mid 1970’s to early 2000’s. At the time of preparation of the second PRISM, in the
beginning of the 2000’s, SNIM enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the mining sector, Government
institutions in the sector were weak and few foreign investors, let alone domestic companies were
present in the mineral sector1. The country's overall business environment, coupled with limited
knowledge about the country’s mineral reserves outside SNIM's concession areas, was not appealing to
private mining investors. The absence of a modern institutional framework for the mineral sector
exacerbated the situation. The fact that the Fraser Institute Global Mining Survey did not include
Mauritania in its survey (despite being the continent’s second-largest producer of iron ore) is
symptomatic for Mauritania’s perceived isolation at the turn of the twentieth century.

2. The first PRISM project was approved in 1999, and the second in 2003. The preparation of the two
operations took place during a time when nationwide reforms gained traction. In the late 1990’s
Mauritania, then one of the poorest African countries was one of the first to prepare a full Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS). Mauritania had also taken steps towards better governance with the
adoption of the "General Framework for the National Program of Good Governance" in 1991;
governance strengthening and capacity building was one of the four strategic focus areas of
Mauritania's first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) presented to the IMF and World Bank
Board in 20012. The 2nd CAS (24122-MAU) for 2001-2005 maintained a continuity of government’s
strategic priorities since the early 1990’s. The objectives and approaches selected under both PRISM
projects were aligned with the thrust of the first PRSP and the CAS.

3. Private sector-led growth was one of the underpinnings of the national development strategy, which
underscored the government’s eagerness to attract (foreign) private investors to the economy and
particularly the mining industry in order to exploit the country’s resource potential. An institutional
audit conducted under the “Private Sector Development and Capacity Building Project” (1995)
recommended an ambitious mining sector reform program to improve sector competitiveness and to
enable public sector mining institutions to efficiently regulate the sector and attract and manage foreign
investments.



1
  Interest from international mining companies began to emerge in the early 2000’s, but all of this centered around
exploration with no actual production coming on stream until late 2006.
2
  The other strategic focus areas were: (ii) accelerating private sector-led growth, (iii) growth anchored in the economic
environment of the poor and (iv) developing human resources and ensuring universal access to basic infrastructure and
services.

In 1999 the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania                      Box 1.Timeline of main events

private sector promotion, emphasized: (i) rationalization of the role            1991 General Framework for

offshore production would commence on a significant scale by 2005-2006. Given this new
development PRISM-2 was originally designed with a comprehensive capacity building component for
the hydrocarbons sector in order to support transparency and governance of the projected petroleum
resources. However before project appraisal was completed the national authorities declined the
Bank’s involvement in this sector. Given the limited IDA funds available for Mauritania at that time
and the large financing needs to pursue the reform and institutional strengthening agenda in the hard
mineral sector alone, it was agreed to launch the PRISM-2 without the hydrocarbon component. The
ambition was that the hydrocarbon component could be introduced later if the appetite for transparency
and capacity building reemerged in the hydrocarbon sector.

6. In August 2005, a bloodless military coup ended the 21-year presidency of President Ould Taya. A
transition government quickly returned to democracy and elections were held in late 2006 – early 2007.
The new government was committed to a development agenda focusing on economic governance.
GIRM took a number of key steps that broke with earlier practices and re-launched a constructive
dialogue with the development partners. A new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was
approved with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and in December 2006 Mauritania was granted
debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Mauritania’s population and partners had high
hopes for the beginning of a new era, coinciding also with the commencement of off-shore oil
production. The PRSP-2 was thus prepared in a highly optimistic environment and provided the basis
for the third CAS (2008-2011). In addition, the Bank responded to a government request to scale up its
support in the mineral resources sector and boost its assistance by: (i) granting on July 6, 2006 a US$5
million equivalent additional financing to PRISM-2 to re-integrate the hydrocarbon component (IDA-
38100); and (ii) helping GIRM set up the pillars for a more transparent revenue collection in the
extractive industries (including oil) through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). A
National Committee for EITI (CNITIE) was established in January 2006 (as one of the first countries to
do so), and Mauritania received a US$240,000 grant from the Multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) for EITI
2006-2008 activities. Finally, a second additional financing of US$7.1 million to PRISM-2 was
granted on May 19, 2011. Various observers, inside and outside the Bank4, ascribe Mauritania’s
relative stability and enhanced governance since 2009 to the reforms and success of the extractive
industries which set a benchmark for other sectors of the economy, e.g. the recent push to push for
inclusion of the fisheries sector under the EITI framework.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7. The Project's development objective5 as stated in the Development Credit Agreement was to
“strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to regulate mining activities in its territory and thereby facilitate
private investment in the mining sector, through: (a) fostering local economic development in mining
areas, (b) improving gathering and access to geological information, and (c) strengthening the
Borrower’s institutional and technical capacity to manage mineral resources”

8. The initial set of indicators included:

  “He [President Aziz] can also argue that political stability thanks largely to military strength, the financial fruits of a
renewed hunt for oil and minerals, along with some efforts at reform and liberalization, has delivered a turn-around in the
country’s economic fortunes…”, Financial Times, April10, 2014
5
  This wording from the Development Credit Agreement differs from the PAD which defined the following objectives: (i)
Build up and consolidate the Government's long term institutional and technical capacity to manage the country' s mineral
resources, including social and environmental management; (ii) Promote private investments in the minerals sector; and (iii)
Improve mining sector contribution to national and regional socio-economic development
                                                             16
       -    Mining related personnel of Ministry of Mines and Industry (MMI) and mining institutions,
            and representatives of local government and NGOs of mining areas trained (numbers);
       -    average time to grant a mining title maintained below 30 days;
       -    increase of sector (a) investments and (b) exports;
       -    railway and harbor facilities in NW Mauritania made available to other mining operators
            than SNIM
       -    extent of diversification of economic activities in mining areas as measured by number of
            sub-projects implemented under the small grants program; and increase in household
            income in those areas.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

First Additional financing (2006)
9. The first additional financing was provided in 2006 to build the capacity of the institutions in the oil
sector in line with the support provided for the hard minerals. This addition was aligned with the
original development objective of capacity building for mineral resources without requiring any
changes, but the following key indicators were added:
       -    Revised hydrocarbons law and regulations plus modernized model Production Sharing
            Contract (PSC) which is to be applied to new petroleum permits;
       -    Training of staff of petroleum ministry;
       -    Creation of an Environmental Unit within the ministry;
       -    Completion of Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA), and preparation
            and effectiveness of environmental regulations for petroleum sector management;
       -    Operationalization of Petroleum Cadastre and Sector Data Bank/Information Systems ;
       -    Completion of key sector strategic studies.

QALP Review (2008)
10. A QALP (Quality Assessment of Lending Program) assessment of November 2008, by QAG rated
the quality of implementation satisfactory, quality of supervision moderately satisfactory, likelihood of
achieving DOs as moderately unlikely and quality of design moderately satisfactory (originally QAG
rated it moderately unsatisfactory). The last two ratings related basically to the new hydrocarbons
component, the addition of which QAG qualified as unwarranted considering the major setback with
Chinguitti oil production at that time. The project and country teams disagreed strongly with QAG,
pointing out that the assessment was carried out shortly after the start of the period of deep political
turmoil. QAG's assessment of the hydrocarbon sector potential has indeed proved to be unfounded
given the rebound in oil exploration (eight wells to be drilled in 2013-14) and discoveries of natural gas
with the potential to supply not only domestic demands but also export to neighboring Senegal and
Mali. Still, QAG's unsatisfactory rating of candor and realism of the ISRs6 at that time, was taken into
account. The results framework and tracking of indicators were strengthened and subsequent ISRs
improved.

Second Additional financing (2011)
11. A second additional financing was approved on May 19, 2011 to support the scaling up of
successful activities undertaken so far and finance a new activity: School of Mines and Vocational
Training. The PDO was rephrased to better reflect the achievements to which the technical assistance

6
 QAG criticized a “perhaps forced choice of inappropriate mining indicators and artificially low target levels” and
commented that before adding a petroleum component the team should have recommended a rigorous technical evaluation
of oil production prospects.
                                                        17
activities could reasonably be attributed. The revised PDO was to “strengthen the Recipient’s capacity
to manage national mineral sector activities in an environmentally, socially and economically
sustainable manner.” The key indicators were updated and revised to reflect the more ambitious project
scope. A set of new intermediate results indicators was added with respect to the new Mining School
and Vocational Training component. The revised PDO was approved by the Board as part of the
Additional Financing package.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
 12. The initial 2003 PRISM-2 Project Appraisal Document (PAD) listed as target populations and
sectors: (i) local communities in mining districts, in particular along the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor;
(ii) private foreign and national mining investors/operators; (iii) national and regional sector
authorities; (iv) water management authorities; and (v) land use management authorities. The two
additional financing activities expanded the categories of the beneficiaries to up- and mid-stream
petroleum agencies including (vi) the departments in charge of the petroleum sector, (ix) the national
oil company Société Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures (SMH), and the special purpose vehicle for the
Banda gas-to-power project (Société de Production de l’Electricité à partir de Gaz, SPEG). The second
additional financing activity also benefited (x) the School of Mines as well as (xi) the national EITI
committee and its stakeholders. The additional financing also expanded the number of the beneficiaries
through the scaling up effect and the extension to populations in areas impacted by new mining and oil
activities.

1.5 Original Components

13. Component 1 - Local economic development (LED) in the mining areas, supporting the
empowerment of local communities and municipalities for the development of alternative economic
activities and increased efficiency in the delivery of social services. The inclusion of LED was highly
innovative at the time of preparation and responded to the strong pressure on the global extractive
industries to assure that local communities enjoyed direct benefits from the operations7. Such activities
have later been widely adopted by subsequent Bank projects and within the industry at large. Project
activities included: (i) facilitation of alternative economic activities to diversify the local economic
base; (ii) provision of small grants for small businesses and entrepreneurs; (iii) capacity building of
local authorities for the delivery of social services and regional development; and (iv) hydrogeological
studies and works to improve the availability of water in the regions.

14. Component 2 - Geo-information and development. This component provided the geo-scientific
information necessary to enhance economic development. It supported a variety of sectors, including
water resources and environmental management, and helped promotion of investments in the mining
sector. This component continued the work started under PRISM-1 by upgrading existing information
and increasing its availability. It included: (i) airborne geophysical surveys over selected areas with
mineral potential; (ii) geological mapping; (iii) metallogenic studies of selected ore districts and/or
minerals based on outputs from PRISM-1; (iv) updating of the country's hydro- geological map in
collaboration with the National Center for Water Resources (CNRE); and (v) supervision assistance of
complex technical activities in particular geophysics. The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) which had
already co-financed PRISM-1, provided US$ 3.6 million in parallel financing for additional airborne
surveys under this component.

15. Component 3 - Capacity building of public mining institutions. Mining sector management
capacity was to be strengthened by establishing a Mining Sector Promotion Unit (UPM) and by
reinforcing the Mining Cadastre Office and the sector monitoring and control capacity of the
Directorate for Mining and Geology (DMG) both created under PRISM-1. It would thus consolidate
the sustainability of public mining institutions established under PRISM 1. Inter-institutional
relationships were to be strengthened, especially between the Ministry of Rural Development and
Environment and the DMG's environmental unit - Service des Affaires Evironnementales (SAE). A
comprehensive training program was included to build capacity of the employees involved in sector
activities directly (or indirectly such as local authority representatives).

16. Component 4 - Project management. It built upon the existing PRISM-1 Project Coordination
Unit (PCU). A regional project coordination unit was established in Zouerate to coordinate local
economic development activities in the North. This satellite office was moved to Akjoujt with the
second additional financing in 2011.

1.6 Revised Components

17. The 2006 additional financing operation eventually introduced the one component already
proposed in 20038 to cover hydrocarbon sector management issues with five subcomponents:
    (i) Improving the legal, regulatory and contractual framework through model Production Sharing
          Contracts (PSCs), revised Hydrocarbons Law plus a coherent package of secondary
          legislation and regulations.
    (ii) Capacity building in the Ministry of Petroleum and Societe Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures
          (SMH) and institutional audit of that Ministry to streamline organization and sector roles.
    (iii) Strengthening of environmental management through preparation of a Strategic
          Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA), preparation of environmental regulations and
          training of the core team responsible for environmental approval and monitoring of oil
          projects.
    (iv) Data management/petroleum cadaster: creation of a data bank and related information system,
          including the cadastre system for oil/gas concession blocks.
    (v) Strategic assessments: preparation of strategic assessments for utilization of natural gas,
          promotion strategy of exploration in relinquished acreage.

18. Under the second additional financing operation, one new component - Support to the School of
Mines and Vocational Training – was added to the existing five. In addition, all of the four original
mining components were expanded in order to (i) cover populations in areas which had seen a recent
influx of mine investments, (ii) further analyze existing geo-scientific data, and (iii) deepen capacity
building, with special focus on inspection capacities of Direction de Police des Mines. The second
additional financing also supported the national EITI Committee, which has established itself as an
important platform for dialogue among stakeholders from (i) government, (ii) civil society, and (iii)
operators. The new component of support to the School of Mines and vocational training was to
support the public-private partnership of government and mine operators which aimed at nurturing this
new sub-sector of the national education system. This was done through a dedicated academic and
technical school to accommodate the growing demands from the mining industry for a specialized and
skilled workforce.

Box 2. School of Mines
    The Mauritania School of Mines was created in 2011 as a partnership between government, a group of
    mining operators (SNIM, Kinross and First Quantum) and development partners, including the World Bank.
    The school is a response to the need to qualify human resources in a sector that is going through rapid
    transformation in Mauritania. The school signed a convention with the Polytechnic School of Montreal,
    Canada, as strategic pedagogic partner and other conventions of partnership with academic and scientific
    institutions in Nouakchott, Rabat, Ouagadougou, Niamey, Istanbul and Alger. The school is located
    temporarily in Nouakchott, while waiting for the construction of its campus in Akjoujt, a mining city 255 km
    north of Nouakchott. The construction work is expected to start in July 2014 for the school to be ready for
    entrance in 2016. The school started with a group of 25 students selected among the best secondary
    graduates in scientific areas and had a total enrollment of 75 students at project closure in November 2013.
    It will offer programmes for mechanical engineers and geologigists (bac +5) as well as technicians
    (bac+3). The first students will graduate in 2016. The PRISM-2 supported the school by financing the
    purchase of pedagogical equipment (language lab, library), training of faculty staff and management, legal
    administrative support as well as facilitation of regional collaboration.

19. The project design changes were prepared in response to the evolution of the sector and the
evolving demands of the sector stakeholders. Implementation arrangements were maintained based on
the same PCU which performed well all along (as it already did under PRISM-1). The mid-term review
(reported as of May 2006 in the files) was in essence the preparation of the first additional financing,
but embedded in the 2006 Board Project paper.

1.7 Other significant changes

Development of the oil sector
20. In 2006, oil production – entirely for export - effectively started at the Chinguetti off-shore field,
but actual output rapidly declined from its projected 75,000 barrels/day (bpd). Hampered by technical
difficulties due to a more unfavorable geology than expected, production decreased to 18,000 bpd in
2007. It finally stabilized at 7,500 bpd, under a new operator (Petronas). The Chinguetti setback
resulted, inter alia, from unrealistic pressure from the government as well as from some decision-
makers in the operating consortium to start cashing in from oil production as soon as possible and get a
quick return on investments. Not enough consideration was given to potential technical setbacks and a
slower production development strategy allowing for example a more sustainable exploitation of
combined oil and gas production. In effect, it reflected the lack of institutional capacity in the
hydrocarbon sector.9 This underscores the relevance of the hydrocarbon component which was
introduced belatedly.

21. Although some oil exploration continues off-shore as well as onshore, gas exploration has proved
more successful. The Banda gas field was declared commercially viable in 2013 while comprehensive
drilling campaigns continue for other deposits. The strong relations with MPEM allowed the Bank to
gain a central role in the development of the Banda gas-to-power project. Consequently, parts of the
projected oil support activities were redirected to support of the gas development (notably social and
environmental impact assessment of the Banda development, master planning for handling and
storage). A separate package of Bank support (through investment and risk guarantees) was approved
on May 29, 2014, to support financing of the proposed 180 MW (and later 350 MW) gas-to-power

9
  The Bank team had proposed in 2003 an emergency TA to effectively provide immediate advice to the government and
thereby also respond to recommendations from other decision makers of operating consortium, concerned by the lack of
experience on the government side
                                                        20
plant which will supply Mauritania and its neighbors Senegal and Mali. The proposed plant will also
supply the mining companies in the North, which are among the key sponsors (see Annex 3).

Institutional upheavals
22. The political climate has posed challenges throughout project implementation. First, successive
changes of the ministry responsible for hydrocarbons and the ministry of mines (first split in 2005, re-
merged in 2007, then split again in 2008 and re-merged in 2010 with energy also) complicated
implementation. Moreover, the military coup of 200810 caused the country to plunge into a period of
political instability. As a result, the international community put most of its activities in Mauritania on
hold until the return to democratic rule. In accordance with OP/BP 7.30 (Dealing with de facto
government), the Bank suspended its disbursements and missions; contacts with authorities were put on
hold and non-essential staff of the Bank country office went on administrative leave. Following new
elections in 2009, the Bank re-engaged with resumption of on-going activities in September 2009. The
period of political instability caused a delay in project execution of approximately 20 months. The
closing date of the original credit was extended to December 31, 2011. The 2nd additional financing
(approved in July 2011) allowed for a two year implementation period with closing date on November
15, 2013. The same closing date was granted for the 1st additional financing whereas for the first credit
the closing date remained December 31, 2011. The political and institutional instability between 2004
and 2012 is reflected in the CPIA ratings in which Mauritania has remained stagnant at 3.2 in the
overall rating and with relatively weak performance in areas of transparency/ accountability (constant
of 2.5), public administration (constant 3.0) and public sector mgmt. & institutions (2.9 to 3.1).
Likewise, Mauritania is 173th (out of 189) in the 2014 Doing Business survey. Against this
background, PRISM-2 implementation has been remarkably successful.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

23. As a direct follow-up operation to PRISM-1, PRISM-2 benefited substantially from the lessons
learned under the first operation. PRISM-2 was prepared in a timely manner to allow a seamless
transition between the two projects. Implementation was designed to rely on the successfully tested
PCU of PRISM-1, which was staffed by a combination of former ministry staff and external
consultants. The design and scope expanded on the various components of the first project (see table 1
Annex 2) and also took into account recommendations collected under the 2003 Extractive Industry
Review, most prominently the local economic development support. This approach emulated the
Extractive Industries Value Chain which aims to address all stages of mineral development from
mineral discovery to distribution of benefits as illustrated in the box below. The EI Value Chain
emphasizes five distinct features in the natural resource management process. A resource-dependent
country has to move through each of these. They cover: the organizational matters that are a
prerequisite for commencing activities, particularly the establishment of a legal and contractual
framework; regulation and monitoring of operations; the collection of taxes and royalties; revenue
management and distribution and sustainable development policies and issues, as illustrated in the five
chevrons below. The first four may be understood sequentially but the fifth chevron attempts to
capture a number of related considerations that influence (more or less) all of the activities in the
extractive industries. The components included under PRISM-2 cover all of the links except the fourth

link concerning “Revenue allocation”, which has been addressed through the Public Sector Capacity
Building Project (P082888 – “PRECASP”).

Box 3. Extractive Industries Value Chain




New components
24. A new component - local economic development - was added (compared to PRISM-1) with multiple
dimensions supporting small-scale business development, community investments as well as local
development planning. The project and its design fitted well within the Bank's Mauritania project
portfolio with direct linkages to other flagship project, e.g. Community-Based Rural Development,
Public Sector Capacity Building and Education Sector Support Projects.

25. The need for a hydrocarbon sector component was clearly identified by 2002-2003, but as
mentioned above the authorities then in power eventually did not want to include this critical
component at appraisal. It was however reintroduced as an additional financing in 2006 under very
different political circumstances. The political commitment to transparency and institutional
strengthening in the hydrocarbon sector has been substantial in Mauritania since the approval of the
first Additional Finance. Indeed the government that came to power then, and the later one in 2009,
were clearly committed to transparency and institutional strengthening in the oil sector.
26. Paradoxically the (re)introduction of this hydrocarbon component was the main reason of the
relatively negative score for quality of design of QAG's 2008 QALP. The upswing in the hydrocarbon
sub-sector after 2009 illustrated that, on the contrary, reinforcing institutional capacity in this part of
the extractive industries sector was paramount and long overdue. Institutional strengthening in the
hydrocarbon like in the hard mineral sector has proven to be key in the sustained effort to improve
governance in Mauritania11.
27. Risks at entry were generally identified and correctly rated and mitigation measures (including on
the fiduciary front) were broadly adequate. The risks associated with political instability (not
mentioned in the first PAD but listed in the documents for the first additional financing) were
underestimated – a broader issue that affected all Bank operations in Mauritania, reflecting an over-
optimistic mood among donors after the 2006 democratic elections. Political events primarily resulted
in delaying implementation but did neither derail nor stop much the institutional development.

 Revenue collection has shown formidable growth recently with tax collection rising from 12% to 19% between 2009 and
2012, while revenue from extractive industries has increased fourfold over the same period.
                                                         22
2.2 Implementation

28. Two important events were: (i) the two additional financing operations through which new key
components were added on the basis of expressed client demand following a proactive and flexible
approach; and (ii) the 2008-2009 period of political instability when the Bank suspended its
disbursements and missions. Despite the political turmoil and uncertainty, the PCU managed
nonetheless to retain its staff and pursue “survival” activities. The PCU diligently and efficiently used
the counterpart funds that remained available. There was however an interruption in the policy
dialogue. Payments to suppliers/ consultants were on hold, and a number of complaints were filed by
those who did not receive payment for completed work during the suspension. The project team
however reengaged diligently once the suspension was lifted. Resumptions of payments resolved most
problems, except evidently for the significant delays in implementation and some resulting cost
escalation. A technical audit of the whole operation was also carried out as part of the re-engagement.
29. The first Additional Financing was beset by slow disbursement at the beginning. At several times,
a high staff turn-over in the ministry and agencies hampered effective capacity building and retention
of skills. Inter-ministerial coordination was also not always up to expectations. Sustained PCU and
supervision efforts ensured that activities regained traction while a reorientation of some activities
(towards the storage and transport segment) met actual country demands. The second Additional
Financing achieved its end targets despite a compressed timetable of just 24 months of implementation.

30. The project was never rated as a problem project or potential problem project, even during the
2008-09 suspension. The only flag raised then pertained to the country risk. The re-engagement of this
project was one of (if not) the most successful and efficient of the Mauritanian project portfolio. The
DO ratings from supervision were most of time S, dropping only briefly to MS during 2009-2010.
Likewise, IP ratings were mostly S, dropping only to MS during 2009-2010 and briefly in 2012. Under
a comprehensive project scorecard system used up to 2009 for the Mauritania portfolio, the project was
consistently rated among the two best Bank projects out of a portfolio of more than 10 operations
(achieving for example a score of 4.7 over 5 for the 2008 CPPR). The Bank’s engagement through
similar sectoral support operations has been limited to a Business Environment Enhancement Project
(P102031) and an Agricultural Policy Lending (P088828), both of which rated Moderately Satisfactory
in ICRs. Disbursement rates were satisfactory. The first credit (IDA 38100) was 98.5% disbursed. The
final disbursements for the first additional financing (IDA 38101) reached 95.7% while the second
additional financing (IDA 4933) achieved 91.1% disbursement. The combined disbursement rate
stands at 96.4%

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31. The indicators selected in 2003 regarding training and mining title registration, as well for the small
grant program reflected adequately the immediate progress. Mining investors' decisions to invest
before project end (new mines to be opened) did also indicate progress towards PDO and reflected
actual strengthening of institutional capacity and procedures in place. But cumulative investments in
the sector and particularly increase in annual exports by project end were less appropriate indicators
because of time lag aspect and the high exposure to factors beyond control of the project. Cumulative
investments may reflect, to a certain extent, the effect of project outcomes on international investors'
decisions, but those decisions are also influenced by other factors (political environment, international
market developments, capital funding available and other investments alternatives). Likewise the
indicator - increase of mineral exports – is usually partly flawed by fluctuating commodity prices. In

                                                    23
the specific Mauritanian case the various production increments (in gold and copper) which actually
occurred – albeit later than initially expected - can still be attributed in part to PRISM-2. A variety of
global mining investment surveys have unanimously identified the three most important pull factors for
mining investment: (i) good mineral prospectivity, (ii) clear and secure licensing framework, and (iii)
clear legal framework. Indeed, PRISM-2 has supported Mauritania strengthen all of the three areas.
The appropriateness/target levels of the mining investment production indicator were questioned in the
QALP assessment. This assessment also pointed at the mix of outcomes and output in the results
framework.

32. An institutional sustainability index mentioned in the 2003 PAD was not clearly defined and
eventually not applied. The indicators for the oil component added in 2006 were essentially
straightforward, reflecting well the TA nature of the operation. Several of these indicators go to the
core mandate of the energy authorities (i.e. management of geo-science data, establishment of
environmental management functions, drafting of legal texts, etc.). The set of indicators was adjusted
in 2011 as a part of the second Additional Financing. Final target numbers were increased, some
reshuffling between PDO and Intermediate indicators, and new M&E database for tracking socio-
economic developments in mining, and new intermediate indicators added for the new School of Mines
component. These changes responded to the QALP comments concerning artificially low end targets
for some indicators. Data collection has been generally effective and broadly adequate. A number of
straightforward indicators were used to report insufficient progress during implementation in the ISRs
and particularly in aide-memoires, and to make recommendations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33. Bank standards were observed with respect to safeguard and fiduciary issues in the operation. A
key component of the project included training and institutional strengthening of staff from MPEM in
the area of environmental and social management and enforcement the Ministry of oil and mines. The
creation of Police de Mines and an Environmental Unit for hydrocarbon sector oversight testify the
stronger institutional capacity. Project activities with identified safeguard risks (i.e. micro-projects and
School of Mines) complied with framework procedures which were designed during project
preparation. The School of Mines is implementing a mitigation and management plan for impacts
caused by construction work. All micro-projects were screened against a rapid assessment framework.
On the other hand, the ambitions of cross-ministerial collaborations were only occurring on ad hoc
basis. The PCU was particularly diligent with respect to compliance with fiduciary aspects and
safeguards requirements, such as stakeholder engagement

34. Identification and evaluation of micro-project proposals followed elaborate procedures which
included multiple consultations and a scoring framework which promoted projects with community-
wide impacts as well as female participation. The PCU launched consultations to assess the degree of
achievement of target objectives of the project. Surveys were conducted in 2004, 2011 and 2013 to
collect household and community-level information in areas impacted by extractive operations.
Moreover, as part of the EITI, consultations have been held in most of the 17 provinces. The topics
have included EITI implementation, environmental protection, natural resource governance, promotion
of local sub-contractors and job creation, the fight against corruption and PRISM-2 outputs and studies.

2.5 Post-completion operation

35. PRISM-2 has arguably expanded and solidified the management capacities of relevant authorities
in the sense that with the PRISM-2 Mauritania has been successful in (i) expanding its geological and
hydrological knowledge base and (ii) diversifying the industry structure by attracting reputable global
operators to complement SNIM’s operations (see 3.2 and Annex 3). Accordingly, there is strong reason
to expect that Mauritania’s extractive industries will witness a further growth in scope and scale over
the coming five to ten years. Nonetheless, with respect to the wider challenge of sustainable natural
resource management, achievements must be consolidated through consistent inter-agency
collaboration and the development of linkages with other sectors (e.g. energy, infrastructure, local
private sector) of the economy. In particular, a clearer government policy and strategy is needed in
order to maximize revenues from the EI, as well as a further capacity building in the area of fiscal
management of the mine operations as well as oil and gas exploitation. A better design of tax
instruments and incentives is required together with capacity strengthening in tax calculation and
collection, including tax audit exercises and financial modeling. An analysis and subsequent capacity
building would focus on (i) bench-marking of Mauritania compared to other mining countries, (ii) the
effectiveness of the current fiscal terms, and (iii) administration of tax and revenue collection. There is
also a need for further strengthening of monitoring and regulatory capacity within the Ministry of
Petroleum, Energy and Mines (MPEM). Further hydro-geological research is needed as limited
availability of water resources is a factor which at the same time slows down exploration and
investment in new mining operations and hampers the economic development of the country at large
and the well-being of the population. A follow-up operation is proposed for FY 2015 under a new
multi-sector capacity building project, benefiting a number of ministries and agencies including the
Ministry of Finance and MPEM that would inter alia address EI revenue collection and management at
the central level. Also the annual revenue reporting promoted by the EITI will continue under the
auspices of the national EITI committee.12

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Ratings: Substantial

346 Relevance of objectives. As the extractive industries (EI) have been the center of Mauritania's
economy (GDP contribution, exports, tax revenues, technological advancement) since independence
and will remain so for decades to come, the strategic relevance of the project objectives remains as
substantial now as at the time of appraisal. The importance of the EI has been reflected in the country's
PRSPs and the successive CAS which highlighted the country’s objective of achieving economic and
social development thanks to increased private sector development and natural resources exploitation.
The project has precisely addressed these objectives by (1) improving the institutional environment to
attract private sector investments to exploitation of natural resources; and (2) supporting the integration
of new investments into the social and economic development of the impacted regions and the
economy at large. Given the embryonic institutional set-up in Mauritania's extractive industries in the
early 2000s and the limited presence of private investors, the PDOs of improving institutional and
technical capacity, and promoting private sector investment, were clearly relevant, appropriate and
timely.


12
  Mauritania did go through a 6-months period of suspension in first half of 2013 due to delayed reporting. However, the
reporting compliance was restored in June 2013, and Mauritania is current EITI Compliant
                                                            25
37. Relevance of design. The project design was thoroughly prepared, on the basis the successful
design of PRISM-1 plus lessons learned from similar TA operations in a dozen other mining countries
worldwide and Bank studies/ reviews.13 The project was innovative as it was used as a strategic
opportunity to engage the mining industry in supporting local development planning, strengthening
capacity of local authorities for improved service delivery in mining areas, and providing small grants
for promoting enterprises and alternate employment opportunities for the locals to reduce dependency
on mining. Both additional financing operations were designed with due consideration to the complete
value chain of the extractive industries (see Box 3 above). The broad mix of field surveys, analytical
studies, legal and regulatory drafting, and technical support to the various agencies was adequate for
the broad institutional strengthening objectives. Likewise for the local economic development
component, a balanced mix was chosen between a small grant program and actions for the
strengthening of the local authorities. On the hydrogeological side, the comprehensive approach
followed to improve the knowledge of available water resources in the mining regions, was a first of its
kind in Mauritania; this included a new effort to consolidate for the first time the data and overall
works of the CNRE and DGM, which belong to a separate ministry.

38. Relevance of implementation. Implementation support by the Bank was fully responsive to
changing needs and country circumstances. The important hydrocarbon component was swiftly
reintroduced as soon as the post 2005 government demonstrated its commitment to transparency and
institutional building in the sector. The new activity added with the second Additional Financing -
support to the establishment of a School of Mines - was also in response to very strong government and
private sector demand and co-financing. The partial reorientation at the end of the project of the
hydrocarbon component to support also the mid-stream segments of the hydrocarbon sector was a
result of express client demand, but within the remit of MPEM and the project objective. Whenever
the opportunity arose, the Bank assisted Mauritania access EITI, IDF, EI-TAF and bilateral (NORAD
and IDB) funds in order to consistently leverage additional advice and financial support for reform in
the EI.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

39. The PDO was formally revised as part of the second Additional Financing in 2011 in order to better
reflect the achievements to which the technical assistance activities could reasonably be attributed. As
a consequence, the explicit reference to local economic development was removed in recognition of the
various external factors which could impact local economic development. The following table
provides a split evaluation of the PDO achievement. Subsequent paragraphs provide justifications for
the rating.

Box 4 Split evaluation of achievement of PDO

 Original PDO: “The objective is to strengthen the Government's capacity to regulate mining
 activities in its territory and thereby facilitate private investment in the mining sector, through: (i)
 fostering local economic development in mining areas, (ii) improving gathering and access to
 geological information, and (iii) strengthening the Government's institutional and technical
 capacity to manage mineral resources”.

 Revised PDO: “The objective of the project is to strengthen the Recipient's capacity to manage
 national mineral sector activities in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable
 manner”

 At the time of approval of the revised PDO in 2011, disbursement stood at US$19,064,000, or 61%,
 of the total end-of-project disbursement of US$31,082,000. The following table provides a split
 evaluation of the respective PDO achievements weighted against the actual disbursement. The
 original PDO contains three sub-components: (i) local economic development, (ii) geological data
 management, and (iii) institutional strengthening. The achievement of the LED and geo-data
 management sub-components is considered to be “Satisfactory”. Institutional strengthening is
 considered to be “Highly Satisfactory”. The combined evaluation of the achievement of the original
 PDO is thus “Satisfactory”. Achievement of the revised PDO is also considered “Highly
 Satisfactory” since all three dimensions of sector management (environmental, social and economic)
 are considered “Highly Satisfactory”.

40. Mining sector development. PRISM-2 contributed in a major way to developing institutional
capacity and improving governance in the mining sector, making the industry attractive to private
operators, including world players (as expressed in both the original PDO as well as the revised version
of 2011). The expanded geological knowledge base (Indicator 13) has played an important role in
reassuring investors of the mineral and hydrological resources in the country. Sale of cartographic and
geological data (financed by PRISM-1 and 2) increased seven-fold between 2004 and 2010, and mine
permit approval processes have remained efficient and in line with international benchmarks (PDO

Indicator 6: average response time of 21 days). The flow of investments in exploration (Indicator 9) has
increased nine-fold between 2004 and 2012 from US$ 13.5 million to US$ 104 million, thus
outperforming global averages (see chart below). Increase in production and exports of minerals over
the last 10 years has been significant (from US$ 175 million in 2003 to US$ 1,761 million in 2012)
(see detailed analysis in Annex 3). The PRISM-2 support to the drafting of the Mining Law of 2008
added reassurance to investors as it was hailed as one of the best examples in West Africa at the time.14

41. These achievements are significantly better compared to the subdued investment climate and
business environment in Mauritania in general (CPIA ratings for business regulation and trade have
both declined since 2004 and Mauritania is 173th on the Doing Business ranking). FDI flows to
Mauritania since 2004 have been characterized by three spikes, all of which directly related to
investments in the Chinguitti oil field (2004-06), Akjoujt and Tasiast copper and gold mines (2005-08),
and SNIM modernization and expansion 2011-13). Total investments of the mentioned projects are in
the order of US$ 2,000 million while total FDI amount to US$ 3,760 million. Hence, subtracting the
FDI to extractive industries, the average annual FDI stands at around US$ 200 million. The
importance of EI investments compared to overall FDI is illustrated in the following chart. 15

42. The most important industry development is the diversification of operators and commodities
which has seen SNIM’s virtual monopoly of 2004 being transformed to a diversified industry of 2013
also including copper and gold production as well as phosphate exploration (Indicator 8). SNIM’s
monopoly of the critical railway line has been dismantled which is paving the way for other
international miners (Glencore-Xstrata and MMG) to advance their development plans, which are so
far confirmed in an amount US$ 900 million, leading to 50% increase in national output but likely to
expand even further within 12 to 24 months.16     This diversification can be directly attributed to
GIRM’s (and MPEM’s) enhanced planning and regulatory capacities (Indicator 7).

43. At the same time, oversight and enforcement of operators’ performance was enhanced – as
demonstrated in the reliability of the mining cadaster (PDO Indicator 6) at a time when demands for
mining concessions increased rapidly and the gradual evolution of the “Police des Mines”. A direct
project achievement is the computerized management system (Indicator 9) which has been installed for
tracking of exploration and mine titles as well as for environmental monitoring. In summary, PRISM-2
substantially contributed to institutional strengthening along three axis: improved geological
knowledge, enhanced legal certainty, and greater regulatory efficiency (as reflected in the PDO
indicators 5 and 6 and outcome indicators 7, 8, 9, and 13).

44. Hydrocarbon sector development. The pace of exploration in hydrocarbons has surged17 after the
positive results of the Banda field (to which PRISM-2 provided critically needed support). These
developments are evidently not the result of PRISM-2 only but also of other factors (such as high
regional demand for energy and general investor appetite world-wide). It is however clear that better
governance, a modern regulatory and investment framework (PDO Indicator 3), well-functioning
government institutions, availability of updated geo-science data (Indicator 1), - all of which supported

by the project - have spurred investors' interests. It is also noteworthy that the disappointing (and ill-
advised) outcome of the Chinguitti oil field unfolded in the absence of Bank support (i.e. prior to
2006), whilst the comprehensive and promising Banda gas field development is realized with
substantial Bank support. The revisions of the regulatory framework for oil and gas operations
(financed by the PRISM-2) are important cornerstones of this development. Moreover, there are high
expectations that the new database management systems for concession management and geo-science
data collection in the hydrocarbon sector will help optimize the national potential in planning and
contract negotiations, (These achievements respond to PDO indicator 3 and outcome indicators 1 - 6)

45. Socio-economic development. The project, in combination with the EITI, has helped stakeholders
gain a better understanding of hard mineral and oil sector operations and flow of revenues
management. Civil society gained from improved transparency of EI development with increased
access to information and dialogue with other stakeholders.18 The small grants program for income
generating activities was ground-breaking and performed well with more than 2,100 direct
beneficiaries across 27 communes (PDO Indicators 1 and 2 plus Indicators 10 and 11) and as
demonstrated by the improved local development outcomes in areas adjacent to mine operations19.
Studies funded by the project allowed local communities to identify locations for drinking water.
Access to drinking water was made possible in the town of Choum (population: around 5,000) with
three water gathering points built with project funds. The creation of the School of Mines is a
significant contribution to increased “Mauritanian capacity and participation” in an industry which has
often been criticized for its enclave nature. Graduates20 from the school are also expected to be the
next generation of regulators and decision-makers assuring the long-term sustainability of the
institutional strengthening. (These achievements respond to PDO indicator 1, 2 and 4, as well as
outcome indicators 10, 11, 12 and 14 - 17)

46. Overall, Mauritania has substantially advanced all parts of the EI value chain, from award of
licenses over tracking of performance and revenue collection to the final objective of sustainable social
and economic development deriving from the EI. The project was also highly regarded by the donor
community in the efforts to build governmental capacity and ability to manage the EI in a transparent
manner. PRISM-2 shows a very strong delivery record with respect to project indicators and general
human development indicators (as reflected in Annex 3). It is important to mention that these
achievements were realized in the northern part of the country which is traditionally the most
vulnerable to food insecurity and low HDI (see CPS FY ’14-’17). Targets of all six PDO indicators
were essentially achieved or exceeded21. Out of the additional 17 intermediate indicators, 15 were
achieved or exceeded22. Indicators for the economic diversification component exceeded significantly
revised targets (120% to 275%).

economic or other quantitative investment analysis. However, numerous economic indicators illustrate
the benefits to Mauritania of the rapidly expanding mineral sector (detailed in Table 1 of Annex 3). In
parallel with the large increase of total mineral sales (from a low of US$175 million in 2003 to a peak
of US$ 1,761 million in 2012, see Annex 3) royalties/taxes paid to GIRM increased from
approximately US$9 million in 2005 to more than US$370 million in 2011.

48. Direct efficiency gains within the mining sector administration are illustrated by the permit fees
paid by mining companies. Since 2007 the annual revenue from fees has multiplied by about ten from
US$ 500,000 to US$5 million in 2010 and peaked at US$ 7.4 million in 2011 (see Annex 3). Sale of
cartographic and geo-scientific data also rose from US$ 16,000 to more than US$ 100,000 per year
which testifies that geological data and interpretations financed by the project are indeed sought after
by investors. Another project outcome worth quantifying is that of the small grant subcomponent.
With a budget of about US$1.4 million the project helped create or supported the development of 206
income generating activities involving 2,152 beneficiaries; their aggregate annual revenues (based on a
sample of 52 micro-projects one year after the end disbursement) was estimated at US$ 2.4 million.
Considering the many project achievements and outcomes in light of the total credits amount of some
US$ 30 million, the use of funds can be considered efficient, even if the total duration of the project
was longer (almost two years delay caused by the political disruptions) and some increase of
operational expenditure (resulting from the delays) over the original estimates.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome
Rating: Satisfactory

49. Based on the relevance of the objectives and design, the Satisfactory implementation and
efficiency, and particularly the Highly Satisfactory outcome assessment, it is proposed to rate the
Overall Outcome Satisfactory. One should reiterate that Bank support to Mauritania's EI has been and
remains highly relevant in light of rapidly expanding mining operations as well as advanced
negotiations on gas exploitation for power generation. Expanding on the achievements of PRISM-1,
PRISM-2 has been instrumental in bolstering Mauritania's successful promotion of its EI through
improved knowledge of the national geology and mineral potential as well as modern systems for
investment management. The effects are felt by the population in terms of surging government
revenue, benefits to directly affected communities and improved job opportunities in the sector and

associated industries. These conclusions were also highlighted in the 2008-2011 CAS Completion
Report.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
50. Poverty and social development. The positive impact of the small grant program is mentioned
above and detailed in Annex 3. The percentage of women as direct beneficiaries of the micro-projects
exceeded end of project targets (75% compared to 70% target). The community development program
has also contributed to the preparation of a comprehensive community development model for areas
affected by current and future mine operations (encompassing not only community grants but also
wider infrastructure and social service delivery initiatives). Water supply, community centers and
productive activities have benefited from improvements, and a positive ripple effect was observed on
the level of economic activity. A comprehensive household study was carried out in the mining and
nearby areas with surveys in 2004, 2011 and 2013. In particular in the areas of the Nouadhibou-
Zouérate corridor between 2004 and 2011, 16 out of the 20 surveyed social and economic indicators
(access to services, schooling, employment, income), showed major progress with increases ranging
from 11% to 120% (see Annex 3). Of particular significance in these areas: (i) the average monthly
revenue per working person more than doubled from MRO 42,600 in 2004 to MRO 98,950 (about four
times the national official minimum wage) in 2013; (iii) the average revenue per household increased
by 177% from MRO45,700 in 2004 to MRO126,800 in 2013. This trend is slightly higher than
national average for the period, but it should be noted that the impact areas are located in the northern
regions which have seen far lower social and economic growth trends than the national average (CPS
2014-17). Thus, the impacts are significantly higher than comparable surrounding areas.

51. Gender considerations. The Mauritanian context offers a challenging environment for promotion
of gender equality given a relatively low participation in the job market and the public debate by
Mauritanian women. For this reason, a focused effort was made in promoting women’s participation in
the micro-project component (with extra weight given to female project proponents in the selection
criteria). It is noteworthy that the ambitious target of 70% direct micro-projects beneficiaries was
exceeded (actual rate: 75%). Training in micro-project management achieved a commendable 40%
female participation rate. On the other hand, training at MPEM and other public agencies suffered
from the low ratio of female staff resulting in a reportedly low participation rate, although this was not
tracked systematically. The School of Mines has a gender policy which means that about 30% of
students are women. This rate has been possible since, inter alia, separate living facilities for women
are provided by the school.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
52. As detailed above, significant progress was achieved with the PRISM-2 in establishing and
strengthening the different EI agencies and the MPEM. Pioneering work was also done with the
introduction of transparent measures in managing the petroleum sector, such as the set-up of the oil
fund (in collaboration with the IMF), publication of petroleum contracts on-line, implementation of
EITI. A number of positive indicators allow for optimism with regard to sustainability: (i) observed
resilience of agencies despite the repeated political turmoil in 2005 and 2008-09, (ii) rapidly increasing
income streams from service fees directly to MPEM because of the surge in investor activity, and (iii)
introduction of dedicated contributions to “Training Funds” in oil-gas contracts and model mining
agreements. The current institutional chart is reproduced in Annex 2.

                                                   32
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
53. The two PRISM projects have created the “enabling environment” in the extractive industries in
terms of geological knowledge, legal certainty and regulatory efficiency. This environment has
promoted (i) external (private) investment and (ii) transparency and better governance in the extractive
industries. This has contributed to Mauritania's economic development and relative political stability
(since 2009) despite political division and military pressure. Interestingly, the positive correlation
between natural resource dependence and enhanced governance indicators, i.e. “inverse Resource
Curse” has also been documented at a global scale since 2000 in McMahon and Moreira (2014) which
show that economies with high dependence of mineral or hydrocarbon resource have outperformed
other economies in the areas of regulation, rule of law and corruption since 2000.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

54. A number of stakeholder consultations were conducted as part of the EITI implementation. The
minutes of these consultations are recorded at www.cnitie.mr and demonstrate a solid appreciation of
the socio-economic effects deriving from the extractive industries. The PRISM projects have clearly
gained a very high recognition, although a general sentiment has been that the extractive operations
remain isolated from the broader economic and social spheres in Mauritania.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

55. Except for the addition of the oil sector, the risk to development outcome for PRISM-2 is hardly
different from that of PRISM-124 outcomes which have proved sustainable even after the 2005 coup
and the 2008-2009 political turmoil. Arguably, the ministerial structure has become more stable in
light of the current track record of four years of continuous operation in which petroleum and mining
are housed under the same ministry. It is also noteworthy that funding mechanisms have been put in
place by which 0.1% operators’ revenue is allocated to training and skills up-grading of ministry staff.
PRISM-2 has faced the traditional dilemma of TA support to government agencies since staff can be
tempted to accept (better-paid) positions in the private sector. In order to counter this trend, PRISM 2
has supported (i) long-term organizational planning and (ii) the School of Mines, both of which are
expected to nurture development of new talent.

56. The risk with respect to the continuing existence and efficiency of the various EI
institutions/agencies created/supported under PRISM can be considered small. The institutions (the
two Cadastres, SIGE, SIGM, and Mining Police) are now fully operational in an autonomous and
transparent manner, with some producing their own cash flow.25 One risk factor concerns the viability
of some IT systems which were implemented during the final year of project execution (mineral fiscal
modeling and the monitoring system of operators’ performance. The legal and regulatory framework
reforms implemented under the project were adopted with full backing of the Government. The
geological data products created by the project are available to the international investor community
(although not yet on-line) and present up-to-date knowledge of Mauritania’s mining resource potential.

57. With the project's support and EITI activities in Mauritania, the civil society has been strongly
engaged in the EI with respect to ensuring transparency in revenue management. Under the auspices of
the national EITI committee, a platform for consultation between civil society, government and the

24
  Its ICR rated its sustainability likely.
25
  The revenues generated by the mining cadastre have steadily raised from US$ 0.3 million in 2000 to US$ 34to 7 million by 2010-2013.
                                                                 33
private sector has been established. This platform has created a common understanding of the actual
fiscal contribution by the EI.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

58. As a result of the intensive sector dialogue with government during the implementation of PRISM-
1 and lessons derived from the first project, the Bank prepared a comprehensive institutional
development and capacity building program for the EI that is at the very center of Mauritania's
economy. Experience was also drawn from similar projects in Africa and Latin America, particularly in
the areas of cadaster management and geo-science data management. From PRISM-1 to 2, the project
activities have gradually evolved from institutional capacity building and investment promotion to a
stronger emphasis on managing the impacts and benefits of extractive industries and responding to
community needs. The project was broadened and deepened with the two additional financing
operations, with the first one expanding in a timely manner its scope to the oil sector and the second
one embracing the establishment of the School of Mines. Dialogue concerning the petroleum sector
and project studies was instrumental in the development of the Banda gas-to-power project which is
expected to mark a new level of collaboration between Mauritania and Senegal as well as public-
private partnership. PRISM-2, in each of its three steps, has been fully consistent with the national
PRSPs and the Bank CAS/CPS. The reintroduction of the oil component was carried out in a timely
manner in 2006, reflecting a high staff proactivity and client responsiveness by the Bank. In sum, the
resurgence of the oil and gas exploration justifies that “Quality at Entry” is elevated to Satisfactory
rating as compared to the “Moderately Satisfactory” rating given at the QALP review. The weaknesses
in original results indicators, as identified by QALP, remain counterweights in the assessment.

b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

59. Supervision missions were conducted on a regular basis, staffed with a generally good mix of
sector specialists. Continuity of staff on the Bank team was high and much appreciated by the
Mauritanian counterparts. The Bank team pursued the close working relationship attained in PRISM-1
with its Mauritanian counterparts who remained actively engaged in project implementation. The
supervision team, with steady assistance of the country office and close involvement of the country
managers, were also constantly engaged in sector dialogue with GIRM and provided substantial
assistance in the government interaction with other donors (such as the IDB, NORAD, GIZ) and the
private investors. A high degree of cooperation was achieved with other Bank projects in Mauritania,
Community-based Rural Development and Public Sector Capacity Building Projects in particular.

60. Bank’s implementation assistance was highly responsive to the country's evolving needs. This is
illustrated not only by the two additional financing operations and the reintroduction of the
hydrocarbon component, but also by: (i) the speed and effectiveness of re-engagement of the Bank in
the EI sector after the 2008-2009 suspension of disbursement and missions: (ii) the synergies achieved
with the EITI programs; and (iii) intense policy dialogue in order to safeguard the important
institutional gains previously achieved, at every change of government and particularly the successive

                                                  34
episodes of institutional reorganization when the ministries responsible for mines and for oil were split
or re-merged.

61. Weak points in supervision mentioned in the 2008 QALP report included lack of energetic follow-
up of social and regional economic impacts, weak follow-up of training initiatives despite the important
role of training in institutional development; and the temporary disuse of the ISR as a vehicle for
candidly and comprehensively recording issues for management attention and action, and for recording
significant developments. For some period of time (2006-2009) extensive and detailed comments and
recommendations contained in the aide-memoires following the supervision mission were indeed not
fully reflected in the ISRs. Following the discussions of this QALP report, the ISRs improved in
candor and transparency and were quite comprehensive until project closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

62. Overall, Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. The design stage took a balanced and realistic
approach to the social, gender and environmental dimensions, while the technical design was
appropriate and pragmatic – as proven by the continued relevance of PRISM-2. Supervision inputs and
policy dialogue were considered to be adequate.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63. Borrower ownership and commitment has been high. The successive Ministries of Mines and
Industry/Oil/Energy were generally committed partners in the identification of strategic reform
objectives as well as in the implementation of reform and institutional capacity building. While the
pre-2005 government was not favorable to Bank engagement in the hydrocarbon sector, the successive
governments after 2005 all gave priority to governance issues. As a result of the two periods of
political turmoil, changes in ministers and sector agencies were frequent – a factor that made the
dialogue costly in time and resources. But overall, the ministries' and the agencies’ commitment to
sector reform remained firm and they performed well to assist in implementation of the PRISM-2. The
monitoring and reporting activities were carried out regularly under the control of the PCU which fully
served its purpose. Counterpart financing was timely and satisfactory. The delays in project
implementation were caused by repeated periods of political disruption, which were beyond the control
of implementing agencies. There were no significant problems in procurement, disbursements or
financial management.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

64. The PCU was exemplary in its implementation of the project, including in financial management
and audit, disbursement and procurement functions. Its excellent management allowed the project to
achieve its objectives, and to use cost savings to attain additional outcomes. It followed procurement
and financial management procedures in line with the World Bank guidelines. The PCU maintained a
positive and pro-active relationship with implementing agencies and the Bank team throughout the



                                                   35
project implementation. It was able to carry out the planned activities26 in a timely manner. It had a
consistent and reliable leadership and the quality and stability of its key staff (most were active since
the beginning of PRISM-1 until the end of PRISM-2) were major factors of success. The project was
consistently rated first or second in Bank portfolio reviews and was highlighted as one of the successful
intervention in the CAS FY 08-12 Completion Report. These ratings are testaments to the PCU’s
strong performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

65. Throughout the implementation process27 the authorities were committed to all the project
objectives, were actively engaged in policy dialogue and acted diligently towards implementing the
project in close partnership with the Bank.

6. Lessons Learned
66. The majority of lessons learned from PRISM- 1 still apply to PRISM-2 (not laid out in detail
here28), but an additional set of lessons from PRISM-2 should be highlighted: First, development
impact through sector reforms with solid institutional strengthening is achieved with a sustained
engagement - not through a “one-shot” 4-5 year project, but over 10 to 15 years. Particularly in
Mauritania where there is a pervasive problem of weak capacity (especially in government and state
agencies) and frequent government changes, the problem of absorption capacity can be mitigated
through the Bank’s long-term involvement with a program of reforms and sustained capacity building
efforts with realistic objectives in a timeframe that is progressive and also realistic. The commitment
of the borrower and its agencies (and the sustainability of the outcomes) is significantly reinforced
when they know that the Bank will remain a long term partner in the sector. The persistent support also
allows an opportunistic approach which can ultimately bring about changes in sensitive matters when
the time is ripe. The inclusion of the oil component with the first additional financing and the buy-in of
post-2005 governments into EITI are strong illustrations of policy dialogue which has required time
before coming to fruition.

67. Second, leverage for change is not directly linked to the volume of financing brought by the donors.
Through its sustained efforts in policy dialogue and capacity building, with less than US$ 45 million
over 15 years, the Bank has contributed to major institutional and structural changes in Mauritanian EI
which could not have been achieved through an engagement via to the single state-owned entity,
SNIM. 29 Over the past 25 years, billions of funds have sustained SNIM’s operations (and current
expansion) without contributing to sector reform.

68. Third, Promotion of local economic development was innovative at the time of project design.
Such activities have later been widely adopted by subsequent Bank projects and within the industry at
large. It is clear that EI sector TA’s are not the best vehicle to promote innovative community-driven
development practices. On the other hand, numerous TA projects over the past decade have piloted and

26
  Several strategic studies for the oil & gas as envisaged in 2006 were not carried under the PRISM and were replaced by more urgent studies and other
activities pertaining to the downstream segments of the oil and gas sector.
27
     The oil sector issues being a different sort of problem during the first 3 years when there was not yet an hydrocarbon component
28
   Lessons listed in the PRISM-1 ICR: Government commitment; inter-ministerial/inter-project cooperation; project implementation
arrangements under an independent PCU, rather than through the sector ministry; substantial resources for local/international training of
the Client; stringent contract management and supervision arrangements. See PRISM-1 ICR.
29
   Frequent criticism from Mauritanian civil society holds that the mining sector under SNIM absorbed a too large chunk of donors’
financing, at the expense of other sectors, like rural and urban development.
                                                                          36
facilitated methodologies for community development and investment among oil, gas and mining
companies. With established and well-documented procedures for consultation, decision-making and
accountability, such initiatives have gained much more legitimacy at local and national level.30

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
69. All the Mauritanian counterparts consulted have been satisfied with the World Bank team and the
project, which they consider to have achieved all its objectives. The Bank team not only maintained a
high quality supervision of the project but continuously provided high quality advice to the authorities
on EI issues. The quality of this advice and dialogue would be missed if the Bank were not present any
more in the EI in the future through a follow-up operation

(b) Cofinanciers
70. It has not been possible to obtain inputs from the Islamic Development Bank since staff involved in
the project support is no longer available.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

71. The Islamic Development Bank participated in the original PRISM-2 through a parallel financing
of US$ 3.6 million. Additionally GIZ is actively involved in transparency and management of natural
resources including mining and fisheries sectors. The Bank and GIZ have collaborated to advance the
implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) since 2011.
72. Donors and commercial entities have a long tradition of financing SNIM’s investment plans. In
December 2009, the French Development Aid Agency (Agence Francaise pour le Developpement), the
African Development Bank and European Development Bank, together with other European private
banks invested around US$ 1.1 billion in SNIM's modernization and expansion project. The program
includes: the development of Guelbs II (new mine), constructions of a new mining port in Nouadhibou,
modernization of the railroad from Nouadhibou to Zouerate, and a professional training center.

The comparison between the Projected and Actual expenditure per component is partly distorted by the
fact that the PCU recorded training costs and particularly costs of long-term local consultants under
“Project Coordination & Management” expenditures (as an illustration the actual expenditure of the
project management category is in the order of US$ 2.5 million, the remainder of the US$ 6.95 million
is consultant expenditure). Moreover, the cost of project coordination exceeded original projections
because of the prolonged implementation period.

Several contracts on geo-information were executed at an actual cost below original forecast. Likewise,
the School of Mines expenses were less than expected because private sector contributions replaced
parts of the planned vocational training.

Additionality of PRISM-2 over PRISM-1: Comparison of objective and achievements between
PRISM-1 and PRISM-2

In order to correctly quantify and assess the value added of PRISM-2, it is relevant to establish the
achievements upon completion of PRISM-1 which, in turn, defines the baseline of PRISM-2. The two
projects were closely interconnected as PRISM-2 built on PRISM-1 by expanding and deepening the
achievements of the first project. PRISM-1 was designed as the first phase of a comprehensive and
long-term program to build the institutional and regulatory framework necessary for the sustainable
development of the extractive industries in Mauritania. In an abbreviated form, sustainable
development of extractive industries can be condensed to five steps:
        1.     Understanding of the geology and indication of mineral prospectivity;
        2.     Attraction of investment to develop and exploit the mineral resources;
        3.     Assurance of inspection, enforcement and management capacities of extractive
               operations;
        4.     Effective and balanced revenue collection by authorities;
        5.     Equitable redistribution of revenue and benefits.

Table 1 below illustrates how PRISM-1 achieved important outcomes relating to the first three steps,
inter alia, by developing knowledge of the country's mineral resources, ensuring open access to this
knowledge to potential investors and development of sector governance capacities. In other words,
PRISM-1 established the foundation for mineral development.

As shown in the second column of Table 1, PRISM-2 was successful, first of all, in greatly expanding
the outcomes of each of the three steps, i.e. multiplication of maps and geological interpretations,
expansion active exploration and mining licenses, and sophistication of oversight and enforcement
agencies. Moreover, PRISM-2 achieved substantially higher revenue collection as well as broad-based
benefit-sharing through local economic development and enhancement of the education sector. In
summary, PRISM-1 provided the important foundation for developing the extractive industries in a
sustainable manner as defined in steps 1-3 above. In comparison, PRISM-2 assisted government in
capitalizing on the geological knowledge and investor interest by multiplying revenue collection as
well as redistributing the benefits, that is steps 4 and 5. At the same time, the three basic cornerstones
of good sector governance were further enhanced.

Additionally, PRISM-2 entered a new industry segment by supporting the hydrocarbon development
whilst PRISM-1 was limited to the hard minerals. PRISM-2 supported an overhaul of the Petroleum
Law, including revisions to the standard Production Sharing Agreement. Regulatory capacities of the
hydrocarbon agencies were expanded through reforms of the institutional structures, including
establishment of a sector-specific environmental unit as well as a revamped license registry and
database of geological and pre-development information.

The School of Mines represents the final additionality of PRISM-2. The project contributed to the
private-public partnership which also included government and a number of public and private mine
operators. PRISM-2 ensured that the legal framework and ownership structures of the school were
defined. Moreover, academic and administrative staff skills were supported and essential teaching
material, including library and media facilities were developed.

 businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to increase or diversify their productive capabilities; (iii)
 strengthen the capacity of local authorities for the delivery of social services; (iv) develop
 hydrogeological studies to improve the availability of water in the region; and (v) strengthen the
 regional development management capacities, especially in the environmental and social areas.

1.1 Development and diversification of local economic activities

(a) Local business development
This program identified in a participatory way new local economic activities and initiatives in mining
areas. Assessments were conducted within a regional development framework, through workshops,
studies and surveys. Participatory diagnostics were the key element in establishing the necessary
partnerships among local communities, local authorities and mining societies in order to establish the
projected demand for public infrastructure, service delivery, and alternative economic activities in light
of development potential and priorities. This analysis provided orientation and information to existing
and potential artisans and small entrepreneurs. Originally concentrated in the Zouerate area the
participatory diagnostic process was extended to other areas with mining activities.

(b) Feasibility studies of social infrastructure, service delivery and alternative economic activities
This subcomponent assessed the feasibility of the alternative economic activities identified under the
participatory process. A consulting company carried out: (i) a study to identify possible promising
agricultural activities in the region; (ii) feasibility studies (technical, social and economic) of 11
projects selected among the identified activities; and (iii) detailed definition (with cost estimates) of 5
pilot projects, to be submitted for financing to the government, donors and mining companies.

 (c) Small grants program to support diversification of local economic development and technical
assistance
This program provided the necessary funds to artisans and small entrepreneurs to diversify and or
increase their productive capabilities through improved level of expertise, increased capacity, purchase
of new equipment, training and new business development. The program applied to already-established
as well as new small businesses, NGOs, and community organizations. Two parallel tracks were
targeted: (i) exploiting the potential for supplying and servicing the mine sites so as to increase local
and national content in mine operations, (ii) offering higher quality and more diversified goods and
services to the local consumers in sectors not related to mining in order to reduce the community
dependence from mineral operations. Concessional cost-sharing percentages were applied to target
vulnerable groups including women and the elderly. The program was first established in zones of
influence of mining activities the North, principally along the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor. It was
extended to other mining areas, covering in total four provinces. Training modules were offered to
local entrepreneurs in topics such as business planning, financial management and technical skills. In
total 206 micro-projects were financed, using a total amount MRO 393 million (US$1.355 million32) or
US$ 6,580 per project. Total number of people employed in the projects is estimated at 2,152 of which
741 in new jobs financed by the grants. 618 persons were trained.

(d) Micro project administration
Administrative modalities and implementation procedures (including selection criteria, standard
financing agreement and simplified procurement procedures) were developed and refined as lessons
were learnt from the initial batch of micro-projects and lessons from the Bank-financed Community-
Based Rural Development Project. The procedures were widely disseminated so as to provide lessons
for other potential other sources of funds, including private mine operators who had expressed interest.
Information was gathered and monitoring was done through stakeholders’ surveys, workshops.
Information campaigns preceded all entries into new towns and regions in order to assist in

  With an average rate of exchange rate of MRO290/US$ (MRO280/US$ for Cr. 38100 and ROM302/US$ for Cr.4933.
                                                      43
management of community expectations and to keep the various parties (populations, local and
national authorities, companies, government and donors) informed. An impact study was carried out on
a sample of 52 micro-projects on year after the end of the first round of projects implemented along the
Nouadhibou-Zouerate corridor.

{e) Development of local enterprises
After an inventory of the goods, works, and services local enterprises are providing to the mining
companies, a consultant developed a plan for upgrading the capacity of the enterprises to supply better
the mining sector. A pre-feasibility study was also prepared for a proposed Business Development
Center.

1.2 Improved service delivery in the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor

This subcomponent provided technical assistance to streamline and improve the provision of services
to local communities located along the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor – identifying alternatives of a
sustainable system for the delivery of services, including private sector sub-contractors. Impact areas
included zones which were previously serviced by SNIM as well as zones without pre-existing services
(water and electricity). This subcomponent included: (i) the construction of a water distribution33
network for Choum, a community which so far could not take advantage an existing fresh water well;
(ii) a study on the use of renewable energy (solar, wind) for the power supply of seven communities
along the Nouadhibou-Zouerate line, leading to the preparation of seven basic proposals and technical
specifications for different supply mixes, ready for funding by donors or mining companies; and (iii) a
detailed study, following a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) approach of alternative schemes
for the management of power and water delivery to all the communities along the railway line currently
dependent on SNIM.

1.3 Hydro-geological studies

This subcomponent financed hydrogeological work in the Zouerate - Choum segment of the railway
corridor area with the objective to locate new water reservoirs, through an inventory of existing
information, satellite imagery and aerial photo data interpretation as well as detailed geological and
geophysical and exploration surveys on the ground. International consultants carried out first a
hydrogeological study identifying 11 locations for drilling and promising areas for further exploration
for water. In the course of the study the existing databases of CNRE and SNIM were integrated with
data of the ministry of mines collected through various instruments, together with mathematical models
of aquifers. Then a foreign company drilled 11 reconnaissance wells under a US$2,4 million program
including deep wells. Two wells produced substantial water flow. The data was used in the preparation
of the feasibility study of the iron ore project El Aouj that the mining conglomerate Xstrata is planning
to develop in partnership with SNIM.

1.4 Strengthening of development management capacity

This subcomponent aimed at providing: (i) support to municipalities for the set-up of community
development plans through participatory consultation, technical assistance and training; (ii)
reinforcement of the regional capacity to manage social and environmental impacts of mining


33
  Choum was supplied until then with low quality water brought in on SNIM's trains.

 development, including SNIM's social and environmental management capacities and (iii) assistance to
 strategic long-term economic development planning of the area.

 An integrated regional development strategy was developed for the Inchiri province where two large-
 scale mine operations Tasiast (gold) and MCM Akjoujt (gold and copper) mines are located. A regional
 public expenditure plan (PEP) 2020 was prepared, which should meet local demands resulting from an
 inflow of investments and migrants34. The PEP lays out an investment program of MRO 41,600
 million (US$ 139 million) for absorbing the expected inflow of people, based on a comprehensive
 assessment of investment needs for infrastructure and social services. The expansion of mine
 operations will also require substantial investments in infrastructure (road, water and possibly railway
 and port facilities). The PEP was articulated along the 5 pillars of the national PRSP. The PEP merges
 the public investment needs with the mine operators’ investment plans so as to open up infrastructure
 investments for combined usage and assess sustainability issues (financing maintenance costs of the
 public goods and services as well as needs for local capacity building in order to manage and sustain
 the investments). The Inchiri PEP will also serve as a model to be replicated in other parts of the
 country.

 A study by an international consultant defined the needs of the municipalities in the Zouerate-
 Nouadhibou corridor and of SNIM for acquiring the capacity to manage environmental and social
 impact of mining development. Training and TA was then provided to staff of the municipalities and
 SNIM. For SNIM, it centered on the creation of an environmental management system for its Guelbs
 mining site.

 Direct material support was provided to the municipalities in the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor:
 construction or rehabilitation of 5 municipalities (some of which did not have permanent building
 before) and procurement of computers and furniture for the offices of 6 municipalities.

 1.5 Supervision of local economic development

 The M&E subcomponent supported government and local authorities in defining an appropriate M&E
 system to capture impacts of mine investments through regular reporting. The activities monitored
 affected communities and the local economy. A number of field missions were carried out to follow the
 various local development activities. Three household surveys (2004, 2011, 2013) examined the
 evolution of 20 indicators of the populations in the mining areas. Their results are detailed in Annex 3.

   The town of Akjoujt is estimated to have grown from some 15,000 to 50,000 inhabitants between 2005 and 2010. A
 second wave of migrant workers, dependents and other business people is expected to arrive with the expansion of the
 Tasiast mine and potential developments of other promissing mine sites in the province.

Data collection with a wide range of geo-physical and geological surveys as well as geo-chemical
analysis had been conducted under PRISM-1 and through prior and parallel financing. Additional data
collection was undertaken under this component of PRISM-2. While sector agencies had done
substantial interpretation and developed a comprehensive knowledge base, more data analysis and
integration of data, was carried out with further refinements in software and modeling techniques under
PRISM-2. In addition PRISM-2 supported dissemination of the outputs.


 2.1 Airborne geophysical surveys

Figure 1- Airborne surveys PRISM-1 and 2




PRISM-1 (with a contribution of IDB) had financed some airborne geophysics (a cost- and time-
efficient tool for providing information on surface and sub-surface rocks characteristics and geology)
over an area of 226,000 km². PRISM 2 with the IDA Credit as well as with new IDB parallel funding
has covered another 480,000 km² with airborne surveys totaling 680,000 line km over three selected
areas complementing the works carried out under PRISM-1 (see Fig. 1). As a result, more than 70% of
the national territory has been covered. At the end of the project, 75 map sheets at an 1/200,000 scale
had been completed.



                                                  46
     2.2 Geological surveys

(a) Support to SIGE and SIGM
Geological mapping carried out under PRISM-135 (with a synthesis covering the whole country at a
1:500,000 scale and 32 map sheets surveyed at a 1/200,000 scale) already confirmed and identified
parts of the country's mineral potential. The raw data produced contributed to attract the attention of
private mining investors and the interest of other sectors. PRISM-2 extended the coverage to areas not
yet covered under the first survey. International consultants (BRGM, BGS) produced an additional 21
geological maps at the 1:200,000 scale (ca. 185,000 km²) over selected areas of the country.

In addition, the project financed capacity building for the DMG's two units charged with database
management and analysis of geological and environmental information (Service de la Géologie and
Service de l’Environnement Minier). A comprehensive system update was done of the two dedicated
information systems, Système informatique de gestion environnemental (SIGE) and Système
informatique de gestion minière (SIGM). Capacity building included technical assistance to assess
system functionality, on-the-job training and software plus purchase of critical hardware.

(b) Publication and dissemination of geological survey
Technical assistance was provided to support the MPEM in further publication of key aspects
(characterization of high potential mineral groups, hydrological survey data, etc.) to communicate the
full range of available date to the wider investment community and local businesses.

2.2.1 Hydro-geological mapping and water database of Mauritania

The project supported the development of a national computerized water wells data base and
information system, in close cooperation between the ministry in charge of mines and the National
Water Resources Center (CNRE), based on CNRE’s own data and on that generated under PRISM-1
and PRIDSM-2. A hydrogeological map at the scale of 1:500,000 was completed. The project financed
international and national consultants - to develop the information system, disseminate the information
and produce the map – as well as hardware and software, equipment, and training.

2.2.2 Synthesis of geological data and mineral resources information

This sub-component provided assistance to further process geo-data generated under PRISM-1 and
PRISM-2 and prepare maps, documents and materials aiming at promoting the mining sector as well as
spreading the use of the information to other sectors and users. The knowledge base36 comprising
various dimensions of information, including geo-physical, geological and geo-chemical parameters
was integrated, by the USGS consultants. Products include various maps of Mauritania at the 1/
1,000,000 scale as well as regional mineral resources assessments, ore deposits modeling and
exploration of methodology guidelines, thematic studies on geo-environment. Parallel financing was
provided by JICA (Japanese International Cooperation Agency) to train OMRG (Mauritanian
Geological Research Office) in ore deposits modeling and mineral resources assessment documents
production, to be promoted by the Mining Promotion Unit.



35
  Before the PRISM 1, Mauritania had only one map of 1968 at 1/1000,000 covering the whole country.
36
  However political reluctance has obstructed on-line access to the geo-data base; data access is possible on walk-in basis in
the ministry.
                                                             47
 2.2.3 Supervision of the geological infrastructure component

 Given the highly technical nature of the airborne geophysical surveys and cartography, an engineering
 supervision was needed to ensure smooth progress of the activities and quality of output. The
 supervising team of consultants advised the PCU in evaluating bidding documents, overseeing works
 progress, assisting in the coordination of training programs and disseminating products and information
 generated by the project.

 3.1 Mining Sector Promotion Unit

 This sub-component supported the establishment of a Mining Sector Promotion Unit (UPM) by
 funding the procurement of goods, including hardware, software and office equipment, the contracting
 international as well as national consultants to set up the unit, preparation of studies and materials, and
 support in carrying out promotion activities. The UPM was later integrated into the ‘Direction du
 Cadastre et de la Géologie’. The project financed the annual participation of Mauritania at the
 international high level mining forums INDABA (South Africa) and PDAC (Canada), part of the
 organization of the mining and petroleum forum “MAURITANIDES” in 2010 and 2012, where
 hundreds of participants got acquainted with Mauritania's mining and hydrocarbon potential, and its
 legal and regulatory framework. More than 3000 investors, suppliers, operators or stakeholders
 participated in the 2012 forum, almost twice as many as the 2010 conference forum. This event showed
 the level of investor and business interest in the Mauritanian mining sector.

 A consultant designed: (i) a mining promotion strategy to enhance the awareness of the geological
 potential and the depth of geo-data already available in Mauritania, targeting local businesses as well as
 international investors; (ii) a guide for investors and (iii) a website for the dissemination of data. A
 road-show and series of workshops was designed for a local audience (small mining enterprises and
                                                     48
geological consulting companies). Consultancy services provided a comparative review of the existing
mining legislation and rules, together with a comparison of tax regimes in a sample of mining
countries. Finally various texts were drafted to update the mining law and ancillary decrees.

3.2 Mining cadastre unit follow-up

Created under PRISM-1, the Mining Cadastre Unit had become a successful and exemplary operation
ensuring secure, prompt and transparent issuance and follow-up of mining titles for exploration and
production. PRISM-2 financed the modernization of its software system up-grading of equipment, plus
additional training of its staff.

3.3 Environmental management of the mining sector

PRISM-2 expanded the capacity building activities initiated under PRISM-1. First, logistical support
was provided to the new Police des Mines (financing and technical support of a number of field
missions; supply of equipment and furniture). Second, international experts directed teams of
government staff in detailed environmental and social audits of the three main mining companies
currently operating; this work assessed to what extent the companies were complying with
environmental and social regulations and whether or not agreed performance obligations and
management plans were properly implemented. Third, follow-up activities related to the environmental
audits of the three largest operators above were also included under sub-component 3.4 below.

3.4 Institutional strengthening of the Directorate for Mining and Geology

During the ten years of project implementation, the institutional set-up of the ministry went through
various revisions in order to respond to sector needs and policy changes and priorities of the
Mauritanian government. The final administrative which prevailed at the completion of PRISM-2 is
illustrated below.

Two information systems established during the PRISM-1, Système Informatique de la Gestion
Environnementale – SIGE - and Système Informatique Géologique et Minière – SIGM, received
continued support throughout PRISM-2. A broad range of support included further training of
personnel and procurement of software. Moreover, the systems were updated and redesigned in order
to facilitate data transfer and communication with associated agencies, i.e. the separate water resource
and geological survey agencies (CNRE, OMRG).

A dedicated IT system was developed to facilitate monitoring of license holders’ activities throughout
the lifetime of a mineral license from the award of license at the Mining Cadastre through exploitation
to eventual mine closure. The system allows DMG and the Police des Mines37 to properly monitor
exploration and production activities of the mining operators. In this way, the separate capacity
building activities which had been targeted the Mining Cadastre and the Environmental Monitoring
Unit were integrated into a joint supervision and enforcement mechanism.

A consultant carried out a needs assessment of the tax administration insofar as it related to the mining
operations. Tax audit manuals were prepared based on international accounting standards and ad hoc
training for the personnel of the tax administration was rolled out. The consultant also accompanied
the fiscal audit of the two private mining operations, Tasiast and MCM.

Throughout PRISM-2 strengthening of the regulatory framework of mining operations (US$150,000)
continued. Various issues had not been addressed when the Mining Law was revised during the 2008
times of political turmoil. Technical assistance prepared revisions to the law as well as specific
regulations inter alia: (i) occupational health and safety regulations for mining; (ii) divisions of
authority between provincial and central authorities and across sector agencies, such as the division of
responsibility between MEPM and the Ministry of Environment; (iii) division of benefits with the local
authorities; and (iv) detailed regulations on mines inspection.

3.5 Training programs

Training programs to underpin the institutional capacity building were centered around three pillars: (i)
Technical training programs (in-country and at regional or overseas training centers) were targeted staff
at the public agencies; (ii) On-the-job training was provided as part of the TA activities, inter alia, mine
site inspection, IT system development and financial analysis; (iii) Public awareness programs and
consultations benefited a broader set of stakeholders and the national population at large. Support to
regional dissemination campaigns of the Extractive Industries Transparency (EITI) entered under this
component.




37
 Its task is the overall coordination of inspecting mine operators but its resources and knowledge are sourced from other
departments and ministries, including the Ministry of Environment, tax authorities and others.

 A substantial support to the hydrocarbon development and management was included through the first
 additional financing. The sub-components were substantively designed at the time of the original
 credit in 2003 but due to domestic politics and priorities, the activities were put on hold until a new
 administration came to power in 2005. The timing of the additional financing, i.e. coinciding with first
 production from the Chinguitti oil field, was somewhat coincidental since the scope of activities had no
 direct relation to Chinguitti operation. Rather, the activities were oriented towards general sector
 governance and data management.

 During implementation the use of the funds of the first additional IDA credit for the financing of this
 component has partially changed compared to the 2006 fund allocation per subcomponent, since in
 several instances alternative financing had become available while on the other hand other needs
 appeared in the hydrocarbon sector for which no other financing was available. This was particularly
 the case with the partial reallocation of the funds, initially all concentrated on the upstream part of the
 hydrocarbon sector to its downstream part.

 4.1 Improving the legal, regulatory and contractual framework

 The old legal and fiscal regime applicable for the oil sector (1988) and PSC model (1994) needed
 updates and the secondary regulations (covering technical, economic and environmental aspects) were
 incomplete. An international consultant carried out a comparative assessment of the competitiveness of
 the existing legal and contractual framework vis-a-vis state of the art sector legislation, and PSCs. This
 was followed by a comprehensive revision of the Petroleum Law including the decrees on petroleum
 concession titles and the petroleum cadastre. A Production Sharing Contract was also drafted. This
 PSC is the standard being used for current license rounds.




                                                     52
4.2 Capacity building

Main beneficiaries of the capacity building were personnel of the Direction Générale des
Hydrocarbures (DGH), including upstream exploration and production agencies as well as mid-stream
energy storage and transport agencies. Moreover, Société Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures (SMH)
also benefited from the support. Institutional assessments and organizational training plans
underpinned the training activities which were provided to personnel. These activities were
complemented by an IDF grant which facilitated preparation and implementation of an action plan for
the capacity building in hydrocarbon sector agencies. Training in financial modelling and analysis of
oil and gas operations was also offered to ministry counterparts of the Ministry of Finance. National
technical experts provided continuous advice in areas including legal, contractual and financial matters
as well as data management support. An important activity concerned negotiations advice and training
related to the negotiations of the Banda Gas Field.

4.3 Environmental management of the petroleum sector

Advisory services were provided to the drafting of environmental and social obligations as part of the
standard investment agreement. Moreover, the project supported the establishment of environmental
(including social) unit of the DGH. An important activity which was originally planned under this sub-
component was the Sector Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA). This activity was eventually
financed by a NORAD (Norwegian) grant but under the purview of the UPCM. This instrument was
key in assessing the existing environmental and social status of the hydrocarbon sector. The output of
the study was a report with strategic recommendations and directives, and a second report providing the
basic data. Thanks to cost savings, it was possible to finance the definitive social and environmental
assessment of the proposed Banda Gas-to-Power project. This assessment is central to the realization
of the landmark Banda Gas Project, which is expected to unlock the national gas potential.

4.4 Data management/petroleum cadastre

The project financed the development and implementation of the petroleum cadastre. A high level
international consultant was hired to: (i) develop and help establish a modern cadastre with its
computerized system allowing to record and monitor the oil concessions with their contracted areas; (ii)
support in the start-up this new entity. The consultant also assisted in ensuring the performance of
various IT systems in the ministry (mining and oil cadastres, SIGM, SIGE, Intranet and Website). The
credit financed the purchase of the necessary equipment.

The project financed also the design and installation of a large database to receive and store the
numerous technical, economic, environmental, financial data submitted (mostly in digital form) by the
oil operators during their survey, exploration and production activities. The project funded the
development by a specialized consultant and the installation of the whole system with hardware and
software. The whole system includes a Geographic Information System (GIS), a website, a main data
base system in the MPEM and archives.

4.5 Sector strategic assessments

Advisory services together with limited hardware and software supported: (i) strategy for promotion of
exploration; (ii) economic modeling for the upstream part; and (iii) economic modeling for the gas
value stream. Additional activities supported storage and transportation of petroleum products. These
                                                  53
included: (i) a review and updating of legal and regulatory framework of the subsector; (ii) advisory
services for the development of a new Public Private Partnership (PPP) to manage the refined products
storage installation previously run by an SOE; (iii) development of norms, security and certification
standards for liquid and gas petroleum products (storage and distribution); (iv) Master plan by 2020 for
the transport of refined petroleum products including butane gas.

The School of Mines (SOM) is established by the government in close partnership with the three main
private and public mining companies as well as the World Bank. The bulk38 of the capital costs is
financed under corporate sponsorships, while operational expenditures are projected to be covered from
a sales tax on mineral sales. Resources from the Bank cover fiduciary aspects, quality assurance of
study program, training of trainers and supplementary course programs.

5.1 Coordination and advisory services for oversight of School of Mines development

The project financed: (i) a coordinator of the engineering and construction monitoring to Akjoujt, legal
counsel for the preparation of regulations of the School and other legal and administrative framework;
(ii) the Environmental and Social Impact Study for the campus.

5.2 Curriculum development and research/professional outreach programs

The project financed: (i) an institutional and pedagogic audit; (ii) courses given by foreign professors;
purchase of software, hardware, and teaching materials (including language teaching); and (iii) a
survey of student satisfaction (merged with (i))

5.3 Training of trainers

Professors and administrative staff benefitted from managerial, technical and teaching training in at a
variety of partner institutions in the region as well as in France and Canada. The beneficiaries included
the seven professors recruited so far.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

PRISM-2 is essentially a capacity building project and for this reason it does not lend itself well to a
standard economic analysis. No separate revenue streams are generated as a result of the project.
However there are a number of parameters available that allow quantitative evaluation of specific
project components and their outcomes. These are:
• Direct outcome of the small grants program
• Wider social and economic impacts on population in mining regions
• Increase of exports revenues from the mining
• Tax income derived from the mining sector
• Service fees for the mining cadastre and from the sale of geological maps

Outcome of the small grants program.
This program supported 206 micro-projects in four provinces for a total amount MRO 393 million
(US$1.355 million 39) or US$6,580 per project. The total number of people employed in the projects is
estimated at 2,152 of which 741 in new jobs derived from the grants. In addition to the financial
support, basic business training and project management was provided to the beneficiaries. A total of
618 persons were trained. The percentage of women was 75% in terms of direct beneficiaries and 40%
in terms of persons trained. The micro-projects covered a range of activities, including vegetable
growing, sheep/goats breeding cooperatives, carpet weaving, tanneries, simple jewelry making and
other crafts, trade and tourism. The bulk of the projects were in the two provinces (Tiris-Zemmour and
Inchiri) where the three large mining companies are operating.

An impact study was carried out on a sample of 52 projects in 2010, one year after the funds had been
disbursed. The total annual turnover of these micro-businesses amounted to MRO168 million
(US$558,000) and the total incremental turnover that could be attributed to the project financing itself
was MRO87 million (US$288,000). The average incremental annual sale per project amounts to
US$5,547 – which compares quite favorably to the average funding of US$6,580 provided per project
by the program. When the figures of the sample are extrapolated to the whole population of 206
projects, the total annual turnover of the 206 projects would amount to MRO668 million (US$2.2
million) and the total incremental turnover at MRO345 million (US$1.14 million) per year.

Impact of the Expanding Mine Sector and the Project on the Population.
Reviews of the local economic development activities and three household surveys (2004, 2011 and
2013) were carried out in the Tiris-Zemmour, and Inchiri provinces, around the Zouerate mines and
Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor, Akjoujt and Tasiast mines. The number of municipalities surveyed was
gradually increased with the 2011 survey and lastly the 2013 survey (when the Atar – regional capital
of the Adrar region province was included). The full data series 2004 to 2014 does not exist for all
municipalities and a full comparative assessment of the changes is not possible for the whole period for
all regions. Still a positive evolution is clear for the Zouerate, Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor and
Inchiri towns. The data from the 2004 and 2011 surveys for 20 social indicators in eight
towns/municipalities of the corridor show a good progress for 16 of those indicators40. Selected

   The lack of progress for four others (School enrolment, number of pupils per class, solid housing, connection to water network) and a
stagnation or relative decline between 2011 and 2013 for others reflects in fact the arrival of migrants, including in new, peripheral areas
of Zouerate, without public services

indicators are shown below – with significant improvements shown in bold and some declines shown
in italics. Paradoxically, for some indicators there was a substantial improvement from 2004 to 2011
(reflecting the positive impact of mining developments) followed by a stagnation or decline to 2013, as
a result of a important arrival of migrants in those “booming” areas. The data for Atar, a regional
capital not located close to mines and thus only indirectly impacted by the mining boom 2013, allows
better appreciation of the influence of mining activities. The strongest impact can be seen in Zouerate
(mostly because of SNIM) but after that along the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor, impacted by the
PRISM-2 itself and the Tasiast mine.

Three indicators are particularly significant: (i) the unemployment rate has significantly dropped in the
Northern corridor from 26% in 2003 to 16% in 2011; (ii) the average monthly revenue per working
person more than doubled from UM42,600 in 2004 to UM98,950 (about four times the national official
minimum wage) in 2013; (iii) the average revenue per household increased by 177% from UM45,700
to UM126,800 in 2013 in current prices. In constant prices, the annual increase in household income
between 2004 and 2013 mirrors the average national GDP growth rate, but it is significantly higher
other areas outside the capital Nouakchott. The numbers of permanent jobs per entity/small businesses
surveyed increased significantly in about all areas surveyed. Evidently the significant improvement of
                                                   57
most indicators cannot be attributed solely to the project itself (except for the small businesses
developed with the small grant program). It results from a combination of the fast development of the
mining industry, of the project itself and the impact of some other local development programs by the
government and some donors.

Development and Exports of the Mining Industry
The recent impressive development of the mining sector is illustrated by a number of striking
indicators. The first indicator is the steadily growing number of active mining titles in the mining
cadastre (below).

Quarries                     27         37               84               90               81
 TOTAL                  157             189              330             373              347
(Source: Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines)

The total number of active titles increased by 121% from 2009 to 2013. The number of exploration
titles increased by 117%, while the number of production titles for large mines went from 7 to 10.
These increases are translated in spending amounts. The total annual amount of investment in
exploration (i.e. excluding physical and movable assets) increased from US$13.5 million in 2003 to
US$33.5 million in 2010 and US$104 million in 2012. This translates to an annual average increase of
27% since 2003 – significantly above the 10% growth set as target for the PRISM-2 intermediate
outcome indicator. This trend outperforms global average growth of 20% p.a. as well as African
exploration expenses which saw an annual increase of 22.5% during the period 2004 to 201241.

Likewise, the increase in total mineral production (all exports) is considerable. Even when discounting
the substantial increase in world market prices for iron ore, Mauritania’s growth is remarkable with
diversification into other commodities, including gold, copper, phosphates and quartz (although the
latter two have ceased operation after a few years of operation). Mauritanian mining exports increased
from a low of US$175 million in 2003 to a peak of US$ 2,115 million in 2011, the exports of the two
new private mines, MCM and Tasiast alone, grew from 0 in 2005 to US$664 million in 2011 and
US$624 million in 2012. The exports in volume and value are detailed below.

With the spectacular increase in sales revenue, the extractive industries industry has consolidated its
dominance of Mauritanian foreign exchange earnings from 20 to 40% of total exports in the early
2000s to more than 60% after 2010. While the PRISM-2 had no influence on the increase of SNIM's
sales and production, the geological data acquisition and interpretation as well as the enhanced
regulatory framework under PRISM-2 were important contributors to investors' decision to engage in
the development of the Tasiast gold mine and the gradual expansion of the MCM Akjoujt gold/copper
mine.

The perspectives of further mining developments in the near future are favorable. The Kinross group
(fourth largest gold producer in the world) is envisaging a US$1.5 billion investment over three years
to expand production of the Tasiast mine by 2016. Tasiast gold mine is also one of the sponsors and
will be a main beneficiary of the SPEG gas-to-power project that the Bank has been actively promoting
including with TA from PRISM 2.

The Glencore Xstrata group (the world fourth largest mining group by revenue) has been actively
preparing investments in three large-scale iron ore deposits in northern Mauritania, Guelb El Aouj,
Lebtheinia and the Askaf joint venture with SNIM. The combined production volume of these
developments would exceed 20 million tonnes per year. One key bottleneck was removed in late 2013
with a framework agreement in place for access to existing railway facilities, which are owned and
operated by SNIM. This would allow Glencore Xstrata to complete definitive Feasibility Studies and
joint venture plans with SNIM plus stand-alone investments with a commencement of production
around 2018. SNIM is also advancing on modernization and expansion plans which saw total

                                                  60
production in 2013 reach a new record of 13 million tonnes with planned increases to 18 million tonnes
by 2018.

Revenues for the Mauritanian Government and fees collected by the Cadastre
Total fiscal receipts accruing to government from the extractive industries have seen an exponential
growth but also a relative stability in later years, although the trend has been a gradual increase in
revenue from the mining sector while the hydrocarbons have generally trended downwards since the
initial one-year surge in 2006 when oil exploitation commenced. It is impossible to extrapolate any
future trends from the existing numbers since a variety of factors will influence future revenue
collection: (i) a decline in the world market price for iron would directly influence the profitability of
SNIM, which remains the single-most important revenue source; (ii) expiration of initial tax holidays is
expected to see a gradual increase in payments from other mine operators, (iii) gradual depletion will
strain output from the Chinguitti oil field, (iv) signature bonuses for oil/gas exploration licenses will
generate one-off windfalls, and (v) commencement of the Banda gas operation will provide a new long-
term revenue stream. Despite these factors of volatility, it is valid to point out that PRISM-2 has
contributed to a diversification of the extractive operations. This diversification is likely to continue to
provide a stabilizing effect to the volatile nature of extractive industry profitability.

Direct gains for the mining sector administration are the permit fees paid by mining companies. Since
2007 the annual revenue from fees multiplied 15-fold from US$500,000 to US$7.4 million in 2011
before stabilizing around US$4.4 million in 2012/13. The total fees collected recently by the cadastre
were as follows (in UM).

Regarding the SIGM, its purpose is promotional rather than commercial. Thus the revenues from the
sale of its products are small but have been on the rise: from about US$ 16,000 in 2004 to a peak of
US$ 105,000 in 2010 and the US$23,000 in 2012.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

In recent years, the mining sector in Mauritania experienced a boom. Mining exports increased by more
than 10 times between 2001 and 2011, from $ 188.6 million to 2,115 million. Also, royalties and
various fees charged by the state experienced a similar growth.

Over the coming years, it is expected that the sector will maintain its expansion. Several large mining
projects are under preparation or implementation. These are:
    The merger acquisition of Kinross and Red Back Mining that will create the world's 4th largest
     gold producer and generate financial resources for the mine expansion Tasiast to be one of the
     largest in Africa with an investment of USD 1.5 billion over 3 years, an annual production of
     one million ounces and about 3,000 jobs are expected by 2015 ;
    The acquisition of Sphere by Xstrata (4th global mining group and the largest producer of coal),
     to develop iron projects in Mauritania ( Askaf , El Aouj and Lebtheiniya) for an investment of 6
     billion U.S. dollars;
    SNIM has undertaken an ambitious program of modernization and development (PDM) that
     will enable among others to increase its production 4Mt/year from 2014 and see production
     reach 40mt by 2025 through partnerships including with Arcelor Mital , MinesMetal and
     SABIC .
These perspectives are also enhanced by new factors conducive to investment in the mining sector such
as:
     The establishment of a stable and attractive legal and regulatory framework;
     A more secure and less costly access to energy and thanks to the project for electricity produc-
       tion from gas;
     The existence of a skilled labor force and thanks to the recent opening of the School of Mines.

However the geological potential of Mauritania is still under-exploited and a number of accompanying
measures should be taken to increase the attractiveness of the country to fully benefit from the activities
in progress.

These measures can be organized under the following themes:
1) Local Development: In order to maximize the impact of mining on local populations, some actions
should be taken with regard to:
     The creation of a coordinating unit for the development of mining areas: the unit, which must
       be linked to the Office of the Minister (MPEM), to coordinate social activities of mining com-
       panies. The unit would receive annual action plans of all mining companies to avoid duplication
       or excessive concentrations of operations in a few regions. It would also provide space for ex-
       change and cooperation between the various mining companies. The coordinating unit could al-
       so develop community projects in priority areas and propose co-financing of these projects to
       mining companies. Some PRISM II studies such as the feasibility study of renewable energy in
       the corridor or study on agricultural activities carriers can help identify community projects;



                                                    67
    Support to domestic SMEs: mining companies in Mauritania are using service providers in
     many areas such as engineering, logistics, transportation, supplies but Mauritanian companies in
     these sectors are not much involved due to a lack of expertise in those sectors. To improve local
     content of services offered by mining companies, the Mauritanian firms should benefit from a
     program of strengthening their technical and managerial skills. A study conducted under PRISM
     II on the development strategy of local firms can be a starting point in the right direction.

2) Geo-information for development: prospects in this area can be grouped as:
     Airborne Geophysics: Mauritania has covered a good part of its territory by airborne geophysi-
       cal (magnetic and radiometric) surveys but still much remains to be done in this area as the na-
       tional coverage is not complete. The uncovered areas can host significant unexplored mineral
       reserves. In addition, the coverage of these areas could help with the development of other sec-
       tors of the economy, such as the search for hydrocarbons and hydrogeology.

       The few methods that have been used so far are magnetometry and radiometry. It would be
       worthwhile to cover some areas previously selected by other methods such as airborne geophys-
       ical gravity and electromagnetic surveys.

       The density measurement under current coverage is regional with a flight line spacing of 700
       meters. It is recommended to cover selected areas with a higher density measurement, that is to
       say, closer flight lines (200 m or less).

    Geology: The realization of a geological map should not be the end of the geological studies of
     a country but rather the beginning of the process. Existing studies in the PRISM helped to en-
     hance the field and provided a basis for work of great value. In fact, the geological knowledge
     of Mauritania is still in its infancy. The work of major international geological offices such as
     BRGM, BGS and USGS helped raise a large number of technical issues that need to be ex-
     plored. Further research in at least two directions would provide more information:

       First, carry out more detailed mapping of selected areas for their geological, mining, hydrogeo-
       logical or other elements. Current maps are scaled at 1:1,000,000, 1: 500,000 and 1:200,000. It
       would be desirable to make more detailed maps with scales such as 1:50,000, for example. In
       fact, many issues were identified thanks to previous work. Those issues should be studied and
       analyzed. They included the need for additional absolute dating to remove many ambiguities
       recorded. In addition, petrographic, geochemical, sedimentological, stratigraphic are still need-
       ed.

       Higher resolution maps and specific studies will help to achieve not only a better understanding
       of the national subsoil but also contribute significantly to mineral exploration, hydrogeological
       research hydrocarbons and other sectors of the economy.

    Hydrogeology: The availability of drinking and industrial water is an important factor for eco-
     nomic development in Mauritania. In the absence of surface water resources, it is imperative to
     turn to groundwater resources. The work of PRISM in this area was exploratory. The current


                                                  68
      geological map is preliminary. It is necessary to perform a more detailed hydrogeological map-
      ping of the country (1:200,000) based on fieldwork.

      Furthermore, the detailed study of the region Choum - Zouerate was a pilot study that validated
      the use of a set of technical tools. This study should be replicated in other mining areas. It is
      also necessary to conduct additional drilling and more to make a regular update of the
      mathematical model produced.

    Synthesis and interpretation of the acquired data: PRISM produced a considerable amount of
     geo-scientific data. The utilization of this data is underway by various mining companies active
     in the sector. However, these studies are limited to particular sectors and their results are not
     available to the public. It is therefore necessary to carry out thematic studies to maximize the
     value of the significant investment that has already been made.

      Moreover, there is a need to explore and see ways of disseminating the available scientific
      information to a larger audience. The new School of Mines could be a springboard for the
      development of a national scientific capacity in the field of geosciences.

3) Support and strengthen the capacity of the administration: in this area, priority areas to be
strengthened include:
    Promotion of the mining sector: In this area, the Government must act on the following three
     areas:
    Organization and participation in mining forums: in this area, The MPEM can consolidate and
     build on the gains made in the organization of the ‘Mauritanides forum’ and further prepare the
     content of participation in international and regional mining forums;
    Set up a special unit to support mining investors (exploration and exploitation). On this basis,
     this unit should play the following roles:
              (i) record the concerns of investors;
              (ii) study these concerns to suggest recommendations;
              (iii) decide how policy change, adopt according to the interests of the country; and
              (iv) implement the policy changes necessary.

In the same context, the Government should encourage mining companies to establish an industry
group (e.g. a Chamber of Mines) to facilitate consultation with these operators.
    Engage in dialogue on improved legal and regulatory framework;
    Support for supplies and equipment: In this context, the Government must continue to support
     the institutions responsible for the management of the mining sector (Department of Mines, Po-
     lice Directorate of Mines, Mining Cadastre, MMIS, etc.) supplies equipment and software, as
     these institutions are working in a highly sensitive area and the renewal and updating of soft-
     ware is of utmost importance;
    Support in the field of training and modernization of tools: the Government must continue to
     develop annual training programs to the institutions in charge of the mining sector. It must also

                                                  69
       modernize the working tools of these institutions. In particular, it is useful to develop a proce-
       dures manual for the Directorate of the Mines Police. Moreover it will also be necessary to
       strengthen the capacity of the MMIS through targeted recruitment.
4) School of Mines Mauritania:
The number of current teachers at the temporary premises in Nouakchott and the scientific and
educational equipment do not cover all the planned theoretical and practical teaching needs. Therefore,
pending the installation at the Akjoujt campus, the school will have to rely on foreign experts and
foreign institutions to provide some modules – and partner institutions to provide some practical
teaching indispensable for the theoretical training.

As the engineering students advance in their training that includes an integrated preparatory course of
two years and a three years specialization course, the school will need new educational, scientific and
technical equipment to provide teachers and students ever more efficient and specialized teaching tools.
The school should continue to allow its officers, professionals and teachers ongoing training to enable
them to keep up with global developments in their respective fields, so that the quality of management
and that of the education is always the best possible.

There will be a pressing need for funding to carry out curriculum development and also undertake
studies on the educational curriculum for supervisors and quality control of the instructional level.
Budget currently provided by SNIM is ear-marked daily management, Kinross and First Quantum
support is oriented to campus constructions in Akjoujt.

The School of Mines needs an important financial backing to carry out those activities, to complete the
preparation of the Akjoujt site and to cover some immediate needs:
   - equipment
   - library and media center
   - laboratories and workrooms
   - Educational and Administrative offices
   - boarding and cafeteria
   - a sports center and a health center
   - production of conventional and renewable energy to provide the school with autonomy
   - recruitment of consultants and experts
   - audits and evaluation
   - acquisition of university textbooks
   - teaching and subscription to journals software
   - learning trips
   - managerial , technical , educational and academic training
   - transport of students (locally and abroad )
   - acquisition of transportation and transport equipment for supplies to the Akjoujt campus
       (refrigerated trucks) and public transport students (study tour) and staff
   - ICT

The Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines (MPEM) considers the PRISM II as a great success. The
Project contributed greatly to the exceptional development of the mining sector in Mauritania in recent
years.
                                                  70
Virtually all indicators of project performance were achieved. All in all the PRISM II exceeded its
targets by 33%.

The contribution of the PRISM II to the development of the mining sector in Mauritania is convincing
with impacts covering all segments of the mining sector. With regard to sector research, the PRISM II
provided geology and airborne geophysics with the necessary geological data. This data are stored in
the MMIS, which was established with the support PRISM.

The cadastre unit was also set up with the support PRISM, to provide information on the availability of
a particular area and the application for permits.

PRISM II strengthened sector operations with enhanced capacities of the institutions responsible
mining and the establishment of the appropriate legal and regulatory framework.

The success of PRISM II was made possible through a combination of several factors such as:
   - The relevance of the development objectives of the project;
   - The commitment and continued support of the World Bank and in particular the project’s team;
   - Government’s support;
   - The cumulative experience of the team of the Project Coordination Unit.

Even though the mining sector is booming and exports increased more than 10 times between 2001 and
2011 and the sector's prospects are reassuring, the challenges facing the sector are still significant. The
Mauritanian subsoil is still unexplored, investments in the sector are not yet at the height of the
geological potential of the country and local operators are not yet able to take full advantage of the
current industry trends.

The Government, in collaboration with its technical and financial partners must mobilize the necessary
resources to meet the challenges. It is within this context that the support of the World Bank in
Mauritania mining is essential for the consolidation and development of the sector.
