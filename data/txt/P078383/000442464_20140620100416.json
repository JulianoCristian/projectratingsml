outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            development impact through sector reforms with solid\n            institutional strengthening is achieved with a sustained\n            engagement - not through a one-shot 4 to 5 year project, but\n            over 10 to 15 years. The inclusion of the oil component with\n            the first additional financing and the buy-in of post-2005\n            governments into extractive industries transparency\n            initiative (EITI) are strong illustrations of policy\n            dialogue which has required time before coming to fruition.\n            Leverage for change is not directly linked to the volume of\n            financing brought by the donors. Through its sustained\n            efforts in policy dialogue and capacity building, with less\n            than United States (U.S.) 45 million dollars over 15 years,\n            the Bank has contributed to major institutional and\n            structural changes in Mauritanian EI which cannot have been\n            achieved through an engagement via to the single state-owned\n            entity, societe nationale industrielle et miniere (SNIM).\n            Promotion of local economic development was innovative at\n            the time of project design. Such activities have later been\n            widely adopted by subsequent Bank projects and within the\n            industry at large. With established and well-documented\n            procedures for consultation, decision-making, and\n            accountability, such initiatives have gained much more\n            legitimacy at local and national level."}, "docdt": "2014-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
