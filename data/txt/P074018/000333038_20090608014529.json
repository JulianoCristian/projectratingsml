as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) fund disbursement linked to\n            construction progress (for individual construction)\n            facilitates effective use of funds. In the absence of this\n            link, there is a risk that beneficiaries may use funds for\n            purposes other than the intended use; 2) the projects\n            approach to the reconstruction of housing are now standard\n            across South Asia disaster management housing reconstruction\n            programs and have influenced housing reconstruction in Aceh,\n            Indonesia. Lessons learnt from the project have been\n            integrated into those projects; 3) the Government of\n            Gujarat's (GoG's) 2003 promulgation of the Gujarat\n            Disaster Management Act, provided for the formation and\n            mandate of the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority\n            (GSDMA). The formation of the GSDMA allowed for quick policy\n            decisions during project implementation, for the\n            co-ordination of a multitude of line departments (without\n            questions of authority) and for the integration of\n            longer-term disaster management into the disaster\n            reconstruction. In the absence of the Act and the GSDMA\n            integrated disaster management would not have been possible;\n            and 4) disasters require quick reconstruction to meet the\n            needs of affected people. This can contradict with long-term sustainability."}, "docdt": "2009-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
