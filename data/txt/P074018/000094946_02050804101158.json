negative environmental impacts and measures to be\n            taken to mitigate them. An awareness campaign will be\n            conducted so that excavated materials at each site will be\n            managed properly, and storage/piling is done away from water\n            bodies and drainage channels. Villages will be involved in\n            the planning and site selection. No forestland, ecological\n            protected areas, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, or\n            known habitats of flora/fauna will be acquired for public\n            use, nor will environmental resources be overused as\n            building materials. Pollution from and in the construction\n            camps, loss of roadside vegetation, change in water\n            availability, pollution of riverbeds (where bridges are\n            built), management of borrow areas/quarries, and pollution\n            from hot-mix and batching plants will be governed and/or\n            alleviated using standard guidelines for\n            mitigation/management of construction-related impacts in\n            contractual provisions. All construction codes for buildings\n            safety and worker safety will be strictly implemented.\n            During construction activities, standard construction codes\n            for minimizing environmental concerns will be used to offset\n            increase of the catchment/submergence area due to increased\n            dam height, and spillover and dust from haulage, storage,\n            and handling of earth. The codes include provisions for\n            efficient storage, haulage, handling of earthwork, dust\n            suppression, and erosion control."}, "docdt": "2002-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
