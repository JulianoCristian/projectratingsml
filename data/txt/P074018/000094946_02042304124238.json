There are four project\n            components. The first finances the implementation of\n            owner-driven housing recovery plans initiated under the\n            ongoing immediate phase (Phase 1) for the partially damaged\n            and fully collapsed houses in the affected rural and urban\n            areas. The second component funds for repairing,\n            strengthening, rehabilitating, reconstructing, and upgrading\n            damaged public buildings, roads and bridges, and dams and\n            irrigation infrastructure in the earthquake-affected areas;\n            2) retrofitting undamaged government administration\n            buildings and critically important public buildings and\n            preparing detailed engineering documents for retrofitting\n            key bridges; and 3) constructing buildings and control rooms\n            needed to foster State emergency management as well as\n            setting up the Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management\n            (GIDM) and the Institute for Seismic Research. The third\n            component ensures the participation of earthquake-affected\n            communities establishing village-level subcenters to build\n            capacity for earthquake-resistant construction,\n            strengthening local government mechanisms, gender\n            sensitization, and community-based disaster preparedness\n            programs. The fourth component finances the establishment of\n            a professional emergency management program."}, "docdt": "2002-04-10T00:00:00Z"}
