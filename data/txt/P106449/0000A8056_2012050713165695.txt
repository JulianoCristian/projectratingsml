                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During a supervision mission conducted between January 9 and January 20, 2012, the GoB reported: (i) a portfolio of 182 subprojects, amounting to approximately US$2.8 million
                         from the credit, have been fully implemented in the departments of Sta. Cruz, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Potosi, La Paz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija; (ii) a second portfolio of 43
                         subprojects was being prepared by the GoB for further review; and (iii) corrective measures were being taken in order to reduce the implementation delays associated with
                         Component 1.

                         The project coordinator, the financial and procurement specialists are key to the successful technical implementation of this project. These responsibilities were reassigned to the
                         Directorate of Administrative Affairs of the Ministry of Planning and Development, as all DRM functions remain within the Ministry under the Vice Ministry of Planning and
                         Coordination.

                         Delays in project effectiveness and high turnover within the project's ministerial counterparts have resulted in moderate implementation delays, particularly as they pertain to
                         Component 1.

                         During the next supervision mission, the project team will reassess implementation progress and discuss the next steps to complete the project.
