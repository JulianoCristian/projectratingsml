H. Restructuring

2008 Additional Financing. Approved by the Board on June 5, 2008, signed on
November 18, 2008, and effective on June 22, 2009, the AF provided additional funding
to support the GoB’s reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts to address adverse effects
of La Niña. The Original Credit increased by SDR 2.7 million (US$4.2 million
equivalent) representing 25 percent of the new total Credit (Original Credit + AF) of SDR
10.7 million (US$16.5 million equivalent). The AF expanded the ERDMP to (i)
geographically scale up small rehabilitation, reconstruction, and mitigation works to
cover the five prioritized areas of the original project, and (ii) rehabilitate the productive
capacity to cover the affected communities.

June 2012 Project Restructuring. The Level Two restructuring approved on June 28,
2012 included: (i) reallocation of funds within subcomponents under Components 1 and
2; (ii) complete and partial cancellation of some subcomponents under Component 1; and
(iii) extension of the Project closing date from June 30, 2012, until May 15, 2013. The
reason for the changes made within Component 1 was the GoB’s use of other funds to
implement the activities (see Section 1.7). These modifications did not trigger changes in
safeguard category or in the PDO.

February 2013 Project Restructuring. A second Level Two restructuring approved on
March 7, 2013 included the extension of the Project closing date from May 15, 2013 to
September 30, 2013. The principal reason for this was to permit completion of the
Alpacoma Basin integrated management study.

September 2013 Project Restructuring. A third Level Two restructuring approved on
September 26, 2013 cancelled SDR 0.7 million (US$1.1 million equivalent) due to the
fact that certain civil works could not be contracted and completed before the Project
closing date..

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. At the time of appraisal in 2007, the Bolivian economy
recorded a favorable performance, with a steady growth of the hydrocarbons and mining
sectors at 10 and 5.2 percent respectively. Bolivia also experienced a significant current
account surplus (12.8 percent of GDP) as well as a budget surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP.
Additionally, between 2005 and 2007 public investment in infrastructure increased by 36
percent. Official estimates projected economic growth at around 5 percent for 2007
However, due to devastating floods affecting the agricultural sector that year GDP
growth rate reached only 4.6 percent.2

2.      Bolivia is highly exposed to adverse natural conditions, a situation exacerbated by
an important proportion of the poor living in vulnerable areas. The 2006–07 El Niño3
phenomenon produced exceptionally high rainfall which, coupled with inadequate
maintenance of infrastructure, led to inundation, landslides, and flash floods. The
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) estimated that the
El Niño event affected 258,460 individuals and that its aggregate economic impact in
losses and damages was US$443 million,4 almost 4 percent of Bolivia’s 2007 GDP. In
March 2007, the Bank reallocated US$8 million from the Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project (BO-3630) to address immediate transport sector needs, including
road repair and rehabilitation.

3.      The political landscape of Bolivia underwent significant change after the
inauguration of President Evo Morales in 2006. Promising democratic and cultural
revolution, he carried out agrarian reform, raised the minimum wage, and increased state
control or taxation of companies in hydrocarbon, mining, transport, and energy sectors.
By the end of his first term he had succeeded in bringing up living standards of the
poorest Bolivians. Nonetheless, the energies and attention of the first Morales
Government in the 2006-09 period were often diverted; they were invested in resolving
an autonomy dispute in the country’s easternmost regions (2006-08), campaigning
against a referendum to recall the President (2008), drafting a new Constitution (2008-09),
and finally, organizing new elections (2009). This period was marked by very high
turnover of government officials. It was primarily due to these events that the ERDMP
experienced delays in effectiveness and early implementation.

4.     Government Strategy. Due to the losses caused by the El Niño event, the
President of the Republic of Bolivia declared a “State of National Emergency” by

  Center for Economic and Policy research “Bolivia’s economy – An Update,” 2007.

  El Niño is an irregularly occurring, abnormally warm tropical Pacific Ocean weather pattern. The phenomenon is
characterized by an above-average increase in surface water temperatures along the coast of South America and
westward into equatorial portions of the Pacific Ocean. The result of this ocean warming is generally a significant
increase in rainfall. This notwithstanding, the “El Niño Effect” has also been blamed for severe drought in some areas.

Supreme Decree 29013 (January 28, 2007). In response, the Ministry of Planning for
Development (MPD) presented the National Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction (PRRES). This plan incorporated two core principles: (1) recovery
activities focus on emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction so as to enable rapid
restoration of productivity and (2) implementation methodology is premised on risk-
mitigation and prevention, such that future vulnerability is reduced. In addition to
providing a framework for immediate response, the PRRES also stipulated development
of clear guidelines and policies for integration of disaster reduction/prevention in all
future development activity at national, decentralized, and community levels.

5.      Bank Strategy. This 2007 Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management
Project (ERDMP) in the amount of SDR 8.0 million (US$12.5 million equivalent) was
approved by the Board on December 20, 2007, signed on February 11, 2008, and
effective on December 11, 2008. The ERDMP qualified as an emergency recovery
activity, and was not foreseen in advance of the emergency situation. However, it was
consistent with the 2007-2008 Interim Strategy Note (ISN)5 proposal to further develop
working knowledge on reducing vulnerability to natural disasters (floods, landslides and
drought in densely populated areas, particularly the Altiplano and the Titicaca Basin).
Furthermore, the Project strengthened the legislative framework pertaining to disaster-
risk management and response, in addition to executing small works aimed at reducing
the impact of adverse natural events that could jeopardize Bolivia’s development.

6.      El Niño’s impacts were greatest on transport and agriculture sectors, but also
caused damage to potable water infrastructure, sewage treatment, and other critical
infrastructure. Starting in December 2007, the ERDMP addressed basic needs relating to
rehabilitation and reconstruction on roads, on infrastructure in the agricultural sector, and
worked to strengthen GoB institutional capacity to prepare for and respond to similar
events in the future. In March 2008, the GoB requested an Additional Financing (AF) to
the ERDMP in the amount of SDR 2.7 million (US$4.2 million equivalent) to address
additional damages resulting from the 2008 La Niña6 phenomenon, namely floods and
landslides, which had an aggregate economic impact of US$511 million in losses and
damages,7 affecting 618,740 individuals.8 The AF—approved by the Board on June 5,

  Despite the strong mandate of the GoB at the time, uncertainties and risks, particularly regarding the final outcome of
the Constitutional Assembly and the on-going nationalization program, prevented the design of a five-year WBG CAS
with accompanying scenarios, triggers, and results projections. The GoB and the Bank agreed that a two-year ISN
would provide the most appropriate instrument to continue supporting Bolivia through investment lending and
technical assistance and to provide help in evaluating the country’s policy options as the government moves forward to
define its development priorities and policies.

  La Niña is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, essentially the opposite of El
Niño (associated with warmer temperatures). When normal gravitational effects pulling ocean waters away from the
Equator are amplified by La Niña’s unusually strong tail-winds, inordinately large quantities of warmer surface-water
are drawn away. These are replaced by colder waters rising from below. The colder ambient temperatures that result
serve in turn impede the formation of clouds and tropical thunderstorms in the overlying atmosphere, leading to
generally drier conditions for proximal landmasses, among them South America.

works.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The project was designed as an Emergency Recovery Loan operation (ERL) for
DRM. The 2008 Financing Agreement stipulates that “the objectives of the Project are:
(i) to support the Recipient in the implementation of its National Plan for Sustainable
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction following the El Niño 2006-2007 event; and (ii) to
strengthen the Recipient's ability to respond to future adverse natural events.”

8.      These objectives were achieved through (i) Strengthening the National System for
Risk Management through capacity building at the national, sectoral, and subnational
levels; and (ii) Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Small Mitigation Works. The
Project’s original key indicators were:

   Number of infrastructure facilities restored and number of beneficiaries with restored
    access;
   DRM Units established in 9 target sectors and 9 departments (staff trained, fully
    funded by respective agency, and 6 sector risk management strategies submitted to
    the MPD);
   Recommendations for a National Risk Management System submitted to the MPD;
   Number of territories implementing pilot projects integrating risk management
    concepts;
   Draft of legislation for incorporation of risk management in territorial planning
    submitted to the MPD;
   Draft of legislation for implementation of vulnerability reduction strategies in public
    investments submitted to the MPD.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and key indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      There were no revisions to the PDO during the life of the Project. However, the
PADs for the original credit and additional financing (IDA-43770 and IDA-44400
respectively) provide a slightly rephrased version of the PDO wording of the Loan
Agreements.

1.4 Principal Beneficiaries

10.    The Project’s 446,156 direct beneficiaries included: (i) rural, predominantly poor
communities situated in 54 different municipalities, which benefit from reconstruction of
transport, health and education infrastructure; (ii) participating municipalities in 8




                                            3
different departments, 9 which receive support for disaster preparedness and response,
implementation of DRM units and preparation of sustainable land use-plans; (iii) national
agencies dealing with disaster risk management including National Meteorology and
Hydrology Service (SENAMHI), Vice Ministry of Civil Defense (VIDECI), Vice
Ministry for Planning and Coordination (VPC), National Fund for Productive and Social
Investment (FPS), which benefit from improvement of information systems, disaster
preparedness and response trainings, delivery of computer equipment and proposals for
DRM plans by sector; and (iv) the National Government, benefitting from a reinforced
“National System for Risk Reduction and Disaster and Emergency Response”
(SISRADE) from proposed legislative revisions and selected sector strategies.

11.    Additionally, the Project was expected to benefit the general population by means
of overall strengthening and institutionalization of DRM policy and practice in Bolivia.

1.5 Original Components

12.         The project had two original components:

A. Strengthening the National System for Risk Management (SDR 1.4 million or 17
   percent of total credit at appraisal). Activities in this component were designed to
   focus on the development of strategic plans and norms relating to
   reconstruction/rehabilitation and risk mitigation, and on the integration of the various
   sectors in an emergency recovery framework. Efforts focused on the requirements
   needed to implement the reconstruction activities executed under PRRES, and on
   identifying necessary small mitigation measures following La Niña, including the
   development of norms, legislation, and information systems required to support
   disaster recovery operations. This component built on experience of reconstruction
   programs then in place to improve the recovery operation model and to integrate
   associated sectors in a structured recovery framework for use in future disaster
   situations.

B. Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Small Mitigation Works (SDR 6.7 million or 83
   percent of total credit at appraisal). A series of rehabilitation/reconstruction
   subprojects were undertaken in an effort to restore damaged infrastructure in specific
   areas determined to have been particularly affected by El Niño. These included
   rehabilitation of water and sewage systems, repairs to basic infrastructure in small
   schools, housing, and small health centers; bridge and road repairs; and investments
   in water intakes, small earthen irrigation structures, riverbank protection, filtration
   galleries, and related activities. Subprojects were identified by local communities, and
   then forwarded by municipalities for selection by the MPD. This component included
   a Project Preparation Advance of SDR 3.2 million which was subsequently
   cancelled/not used, as the GoB decided to bear the cost.



9
    Departments include Chuquisaca, La Paz, Cochabamba, Potosí, Santa Cruz, Pando, Tarija, and Beni.




                                                          4
1.6 Revised Components

13.   Components 1 and 2 remained throughout Project implementation. However, the
2008 AF and 2012 and 2013 restructurings introduced the following changes:

A. Strengthening the National System for Risk Management: the AF increased allocated
   funds by SDR 0.2 million (US$0.3 million equivalent), representing 7 percent of the
   AF, to provide additional technical assistance to the National Rehabilitation and
   Reconstruction Plan (PNRR) developed by the GoB to address effects of La Niña.
   The June 2012 Project restructuring reallocated funds from subcomponent 1.1.4
   “Development support for the National Information System” to subcomponent 1.2.2.
   “Incorporating Risk Management in the territorial planning process” in order to: (i)
   cover the cost of the Alpacoma Watershed Study and the Oruro Land Planning, and
   (ii) cancel three activities for which the GoB opted to use other funding sources.

B. Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Small Mitigation Works: the AF increased funds
   by SDR 2.5 million (US$3.8 million equivalent), 93 percent of the AF, to
   geographically expand subcomponents 2.1 Execution of Rehabilitation and
   Reconstruction Works and 2.3 Execution of Small Mitigation and Rehabilitation
   Works accommodating additional needs resulting from the La Niña Emergency. The
   September 2013 Project restructuring included the cancellation of some civil works
   subprojects that could not be contracted and executed before the Project closing date.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.     2008 Additional Financing. The AF provided additional funding to support the
GoB’s efforts to address adverse effects of La Niña. The Credit increased by SDR 2.7
million (US$4.2 million equivalent) representing 25 percent of the new total Credit
(Original Credit + AF) of SDR 10.7 million (US$16.5 million equivalent). The AF
expanded the ERDMP to: (i) geographically scale up small-scale rehabilitation,
reconstruction, and mitigation works to cover five prioritized areas as in the original
project; and (ii) rehabilitate the productive capacity to cover the affected communities.

15.     June 2012 Project Restructuring. The Level Two restructuring approved on
June 28, 2012 included: (i) the reallocation of funds within subcomponents under
Components 1 and 2 to allow the completion of the Alpacoma Watershed Study and
Oruro Land Management Study; (ii) the total or partial cancellation of some
subcomponents under Component 1; (iii) and the extension of the closing date from June
30, 2012, until May 15, 2013. The cancellation totaled SDR 3.9 million (US$6.1 million
equivalent). It is important to note that the SDR 3.2 million (US$4.9 million equivalent)
cancellation was part of the Refund of Project Preparation Advance, which the GoB did
not use in the end. These modifications did not trigger any safeguards or affect the PDO.

16.   The restructuring reallocated proceeds within Project components and cancelled
subcomponents as follows:




                                           5
      Subcomponent 1.1.3 “Incorporating Risk Management in Public Investment”: The
       Vice Ministry of Public Investment and External Financing (VIPFE) decided to
       carry out this activity with a grant from the Swiss Agency for Development and
       Cooperation (SDC).
      Subcomponent 1.1.5 “Preliminary studies for the development of a risk financing
       strategy”. VIPFE decided to carry out this activity with its own resources and its
       own schedule.
      Subcomponent 1.1.6 “Technical Assistance for the development of a contingency
       plan for la Niña”: This activity was carried out under a Bank-executed technical
       assistance trust fund from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
       Recovery (GFDRR) by the Vice Ministry of Civil Defense (VIDECI).

17.    February 2013 Project Restructuring. The Level Two restructuring approved
on March 7, 2013 included the extension of the Project closing date from May 15, 2013
to September 30, 2013 to allow sufficient time to finalize the Alpacoma Watershed
Study.

18.    September 2013 Project Restructuring. The Level Two restructuring approved
on September 26, 2013 cancelled SDR 0.7 million (US$1.1 million equivalent) due to
civil works that could not be contracted and completed before the Project closing date.

19.    Extension of Closing Dates. The Project ended in September 2013 after three
closing date extensions (including the AF). The original credit closing date was extended
from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012 upon Board approval of the AF in June of 2008. The
June 2012 restructuring extended the closing date to May 15, 2013, and the February
2013 restructuring extended the closing date to September 30, 2013.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     Soundness of Background Analysis. Project design was based on analysis of
Bolivia’s existing DRM program. At the time of project preparation, there was a growing
body of knowledge and lessons learned on disaster risk management and emergency
projects within and outside the Bank. Moreover, the Project design benefited from
lessons learned with the Bank-financed 1998 El Niño Emergency Assistance Project
(Project P055974), the objective of which was to support immediate prevention and
reconstruction activities.

21.    The Project design and preparation were based on a Bank and ECLAC damage
and loss assessment conducted after the 2007 El Niño. While funds were reallocated from
an ongoing project and disbursed quickly, the Bank team began preparing the ERDMP to
secure additional funding to continue recovery and reconstruction activities.




                                           6
22.     While ERDMP was an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL), prepared under OP/BP
8.00 – Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies 10 procedures, its design included
aspects of long-term development; the project did not simply finance the reconstruction
of damaged infrastructure, but rather it invested in reconstruction adhering to higher
standards (than for original structures), integrating flood-resistance and landslide-
prevention standards in design. The 1998 El Niño Emergency Assistance Project in
Bolivia specifically addressed the recovery of damage to economic and social service
infrastructure. Incorporating a long-term vision, the ERDMP contributed to reducing
vulnerability of Bolivia’s public infrastructure to future disasters.

23.     Assessment of Project Design. The original PDO focused on increased capacity
for disaster vulnerability reduction by legislative and policy reforms feasible within the
duration of the Project, though the majority of the Credit was destined for reconstruction
and rehabilitation activities. This objective was clear and important for the country as
indicated in the 2007-2008 ISN.

24.    The strategic choices underlying the original Project design reflect lessons learned
and imperatives of the emergency situation then prevailing. The first choice was to focus
on emergency recovery and disaster management, including capacity building on risk
reduction activities. On this basis, project design emphasized: (i) support to local capacity
development; (ii) assistance to a selected number of vulnerable municipalities, especially
those that El Niño and later La Niña, left most at risk; and (iii) reliance on existing
agencies in the post-disaster situation rather than creating new ones under the Project.

25.      To manage safeguard risks, an additional strategic choice was made to limit the
eligibility of civil works to those that would not cause physical or economic displacement
(as defined in the Bank’s involuntary resettlement safeguard policy, OP 4.12). Given the
substantial need for a wide variety of mitigation investments, the works remained
relevant for Project design. The Bank team furnished assistance to the FPS in designing
specific and streamlined processes and procedures, including the definition of roles and
responsibilities of both entities and the municipalities, with detailed work plans reviewed
and agreed upon with the Bank, ensuring adequate construction norms as well as
compliance with environmental safeguards.

26.    Project components were clearly formulated and conducive to PDO achievement.
The Project design was flexible, including additional SDR 2.7 million (US$4.2 million
equivalent) of AF to respond to 2008 La Niña effects, adjusting and scaling up the
components. The initial set of natural hazards–floods and landslides–was broadened to
include droughts and forest fires, which emerged as critical issues in certain
municipalities.




10
   On October 25, 2012, OP/ BP 10.00, Investment Project Financing have been updated and now include provisions
formerly contained in OP 8.00.




                                                       7
27.     Risk Assessment. Overall Project risk was deemed significant at appraisal. In
retrospect, this rating correctly gauged the challenges as relate to the volatile political
situation, institutional weaknesses, and requirements of successful institutional capacity
building. Most of the risks identified in the PAD materialized at some point during
Project implementation. One of these risks materialized early on; it involved the
disagreement between the national and departmental governments over responsibility for
prevention, preparedness, and rehabilitation. Initial mitigation response measures
foreseen in Project design were to keep the Project at a distance from the political
constraints by focusing on implementation of the PRRES. High turnover of implementing
agency officials, especially in the ERDMP’s first four years, was effectively mitigated by
securing GFDRR grant, enabling recruitment of qualified technical assistance to meet
short- and long-term needs where capacities were lacking, insufficient, or in need of
strengthening.

2.2 Implementation

28.    For most of its lifespan, project implementation was satisfactory as reflected in
the ISRs and Aide Memoires.

Factors that facilitated implementation were:

29.     Continuous GoB-Bank partnership. GoB-Bank collaboration grew progressively
stronger, especially in the ERDMP’s last three years, when the GoB demonstrated its full
commitment to PDO achievement. The Autonomy and Decentralization Law (July, 2010)
redefined administrative prerogatives at central and decentralized levels, compelling
adaptation of the national DRM framework. And after 2011 in particular, a renewed
commitment from the GoB expedited Project implementation. A project implementation
unit within the Vice Ministry of Planning and Coordination, led by the Vice Minister
himself, was put into place and a Technical Committee composed of representatives of
the three implementing agencies (MPD, VIDECI, and FPS) was formed.

30.     Provision of additional international expertise through grant funding. Project
implementation benefited from the provision of specialized technical assistance financed
by (i) Bank-executed trust fund from the Bank-GFDRR totaling US$0.6 million, and (ii)
Country-executed grant from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) totaling
US$1.5 million. The GFDRR grant enabled the ERDMP to develop sectoral risk
management strategies, a municipal-level risk assessment methodology, and a GIS-based
disaster risk management information platform, all key components in Bolivia’s current
DRM program.

Several factors – some outside and some within the control of government and
implementing agencies – adversely affected the Project:

31.     Initially, Project implementation was slowed by a long delay in credit
effectiveness. The GoB was unable to secure the National Assembly’s enactment of a law
approving the credit for a year following the Board’s approval largely due to a prolonged



                                            8
period (2006-2009) of major changes in Bolivia, including regional autonomy disputes,
the National Assembly’s focus on revision of the Constitution, campaigning for two
different referenda and re-election, and high turnover of government officers. High
turnover of GoB counterparts was especially detrimental (e.g. the Minister of Planning
for Development—a key Project interlocutor—was changed three times in 2008 and then
again in 2009). The situation stabilized after mid-2009, following re-election of President
Morales for a second term. From 2009 to the Project’s closing in 2013, the turnover rate
of GoB counterparts slowed to the point that it no longer posed an impediment to Project
implementation.

32.    Project management shortcomings. The Mid-Term Review found the Project’s
Overall Objective achievable and the indicators and institutional arrangements to be fully
on track for implementation. Initially, timely submission of audits and observance of
Bank procurement processes represented a challenge to implementation. In one instance,
due to delay in an external audit, close supervision was required, after which the MPD
took corrective measures—contracting the audit—and resolving the situation.

33. Institutional coordination shortcomings. Despite recent progress on revision of
    Bolivia’s legislative DRM framework, institutional norms governing collaborative
    inter-agency coordination are relatively few. The same situation prevails at
    decentralized levels, in departments and municipalities. Building functional
    collaborative relationships between multiple agencies, including shared leadership
    responsibility, was most clearly manifested by formation of the ERDMP Technical
    Committee, composed of representatives of the three implementing agencies (MPD,
    VIDECI, and FPS). This process took longer than anticipated and was not operational
    until the second half of the Project with substantive Bank support. None the less,
    rendering this collaborative inter-agency approach workable was an investment
    necessary to building organizational and operational norms conducive to long-term
    sustainability. A similar effort was carried with Bank technical assistance to foster a
    multi-sector DRM program that is now under consideration by the parliament.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.     M&E design. Project objectives were realistic and relevant at the time of design
and the M&E was mainstreamed into all project components and conducted at three
levels: (i) contract compliance; (ii) impact monitoring; and (iii) project implementation.
As an emergency project, the M&E focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation with
indicators at the output level. The framework could have gone further to include more
outcome indicators, which would have supported fuller assessment of it development
impact.

35.     M&E implementation and utilization. Semi-annual FPS monitoring of Project
progress permitted adjustment of activities, budget and procurement plans. M&E for
Component 1 was carried out by the Vice Ministry of Planning and Coordination (VPC)
and for Component 2 by FPS. M&E consisted of evaluating results against pre-
established indicators according to the operations manual, results of which were included



                                            9
in progress reports. In particular, for Component 2, the implementing agency (FPS) has
monitored all of its subprojects using a SAP computerized system that keeps track of
progress at all stages of implementation, from approval, through contract signing,
execution, reception and submission of closing documentation. This allowed monitoring
of specific indicators, including resources used by subproject, type and number of works
executed by department and municipality, and beneficiaries by gender.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.     Safeguards Compliance. Based on an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
and the needs assessment, the type of works considered fell under the environmental
classification Category C (likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts).

37.     Environmental Safeguards. Field visits carried out during Project implementation
corroborated that the civil works were of small scale, occasioning minimal and no lasting
impacts on the environment. In the few instances that there were effects on air, water, or
soil, all were transitory. The Project also strengthened environmental management
through local preventative planning and non-structural mitigation works.

38.     Social Safeguards. The Social Assessment began during the pre-appraisal
mission, prior to Board approval, in order to develop a benefit-sharing strategy reflecting
stakeholder interests and participation. The assessment contained five parameters: (i)
social consensus; (ii) social access; (iii) social equity (ensuring subprojects benefit more
than 50 percent of the population); (iv) social capital and cultural identity; and (v) social
control (the community to exercise decisive control over the requested work). This Social
Assessment, which included data collection and analysis and consultations with key
stakeholders, provided the MPD with the tools necessary to begin to study long-term land
use policies, including the resettlement of communities highly vulnerable to future
occurrence or recurrence of natural disaster.

39.    FPS field-technicians employed consensus-building mechanisms and participatory
methodologies for site-selection and follow-up stakeholder feedback. The 2013 FPS
report on social safeguards states that Project beneficiaries consisted of 52 percent
women and 48 percent men. A detailed analysis breaking down beneficiary by gender for
nine types of civil works shows that the beneficiary ratio varied between 46 percent
female to 54 percent male and 56 percent female to 44 percent male. With regard to
indigenous peoples, beneficiary communities gave satisfactory ratings to all civil works.
The approach ensured equitable inclusion of another vulnerable subgroup, the acutely
impoverished; 44 percent of subprojects benefitted impoverished municipalities (i.e. in
which 90 percent of the population earns under US$1 per day).

40.     Fiduciary Compliance. No major fiduciary issues requiring GoB or Bank
attention emerged during Project implementation, as corroborated by audit reports and
procurement post-reviews.




                                             10
41.     Financial Management. At Project closing the overall Financial Management was
rated as Moderate Satisfactory due to delays in compliance with internal controls and
external audits. The MPD was proactive in addressing minor shortcomings in the
supervision of external audits and complying with overall financial management
(including accounting records and Interim Financial Reports).

42.     Procurement. Procurement performance at project closing was rated Moderately
Satisfactory. Close supervision and extensive support were needed to improve MPD
overall procurement capacity. Initial shortcomings in terms of contract management and
low participation in the bid process —largely related to lack of experience with Bank
procedures—were identified and addressed in the Procurement Unit at FPS (responsible
for civil works). By closing of the ERDMP, the Unit demonstrated adequate capacity for
compliance with Bank procurement standards and procedures.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43.     The Project promoted the establishment of a solid basis for DRM in Bolivia.
Regional initiatives and specific country efforts by other agencies, including the Bank,
assure the investment’s sustainability. DRM has been one of the four pillars of the 2012-
2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)11 in the country. Not incidentally, 70 percent of
DRM investment in Bolivia is financed by the GoB, 30 percent by external partners, of
which the ERDMP constituted 9 percent. The GoB has taken ownership of the Project’s
outputs (e.g. recommendations from the pilot land planning study are implemented by the
Department of Oruro and rehabilitation works from Component 2 are managed and
maintained by municipalities). With Bolivia's acquired experience and access to IBRD
financing as of fiscal year 2014, potential new Bank-funded operations are currently
under discussion with the Government. The Project has helped mainstream DRM in the
GoB, contributing to incorporation of risk reduction and mitigation measures in other
projects, formulation of sectoral DRM strategies for Agriculture, Basic Sanitation,
Watersheds, Irrigation, Decentralization, and Civil Defense, and establishment of sectoral
and departmental DRM units within the GoB.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) remained highly relevant and was
consistent with the current Bank strategy and national development plan. But while
progress has been made, disaster risk reduction challenges have intensified. Significant
increase in frequency, intensity and duration of rainfall and/or drought pose imminent
threat to food security, health conditions, and access to basic services for much of the
populace. Between 2006 and 2008, aggregate economic impact in losses and damages in


11
   The four pillars of the 2012-2015 CPS are: (i) sustainable productive development; (ii) climate change and disaster
risk management; (iii) human development and access to basic services; and (iv) public sector effectiveness.




                                                          11
Bolivia due to El Niño and La Niña was estimated at US$954 million, affecting an
estimated 877,200 people. The 2010-2011 Interim Strategy Note and 2012-2015 CPS
acknowledge and reiterate the importance of investing in risk reduction. Similarly the
country's development plans include disaster risk management as a key objective within
the framework of environmental management and climate change-mitigation and
adaptation.

45.    Project design is consistent with the PDO and relevant in addressing challenges
inherent to disaster risk reduction. As an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) instrument,
the Project was flexible, allowing for important adjustments, including institutional
capacity building, engagement of decentralized echelons of the GoB (departments and
municipalities) and communities, as well as financing of mitigation works when it
became clear that these were integral to effective DRM in Bolivia.

46.     Project implementation supported the evolution of the legal and institutional
framework for DRM in Bolivia. The difficulty inherent to effective institutional capacity
building, especially with the changes in political landscape occurring during the first half
of the ERDMP’s lifespan, in large part explains the extended period required to
implement a relatively modest credit. This was exacerbated by implementation and
procurement challenges faced by small municipalities and the limited capacity of FPS.
Implementation arrangements retained their relevancy throughout the life of the Project,
ultimately contributing to institutionalization of results and consolidation of Bolivia’s
disaster management agencies. In addition, the risk-mitigation and vulnerability
methodologies developed under the Project were compatible with territorial planning
exercises. Lastly, the Project contributed to development of a national framework for
resettlement of inhabitants of zones susceptible to recurrent non-mitigable risk from
natural disaster.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objective

47.    Strengthening the National System for Risk Management

48.    Working through the National Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction (PRRES), Component 1 supported Bolivia’s efforts to reinforce its
National System for Risk Reduction and Disaster and Emergency Response (SISRADE).

49.     Interinstitutional coordination support for disaster reconstruction and
rehabilitation under the PRRES included: (i) strengthening inter-agency coordination at
national and sub-national levels; (ii) incorporating DRM as a key component in national
development planning processes; (iii) building capacity of sectoral DRM unit personnel;
and (iv) improving linkages and access to information systems for DRM-related planning.

50.   Incorporation of risk management in the territorial planning processes. The
Alpacoma Watershed Study and Oruro Land Planning pilot project approached risk
management and vulnerability assessment from a holistic, multidisciplinary perspective.
For Oruro in particular, the pilot project’s approach and results enabled the MPD’s



                                            12
Territorial Planning Unit to incorporate DRM as one of its key transversal themes. They
generated proposals, alternatives and solutions to problems in a wide array of fields,
including civil works, bio-engineering, drainage, hydrology and livelihoods/socio-
economic activity. Above and beyond the risk-mapping, territorial zoning, and
sustainable land-use pilot project that these activities yielded, their larger outcome was to
permit testing and validation of DRM as a core concept in effective preventative planning
(as opposed to reactive measures and strategies). Strongly endorsed at departmental and
sectoral levels (Stakeholder Workshop), replication of this methodology in other zones is
projected.

51.    Development support provided for the National Information System (SNID) and
the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI) strengthened SENAMHI
by (i) updating and centralizing the information from meteorological stations; (ii)
standardizing data by categories for better processing; (iii) developing data collection
methodology; (iv) developing the climatologic index for risk assessment; (v) and linking
meteorological information to GeoNode (a disaster risk management data platform, via
the National Information System on Risk Management [SINAGER]) to consolidate and
standardize data from different sectors at national and decentralized levels useful in risk
mapping. The increased forecasting capability of SENAMHI has been key to integrating
risk management criteria in GoB decision making and strategic planning. Currently, 23
public institutions access and contribute to the GeoNode platform, contributing to
improved reliability and availability of DRM data.

52.    Strengthening of the National Risk Management System through implementation
of Component 1 recommendations was effectively achieved by institutional capacity
building, this with a comparatively small portion of the total credit (US$1.4 million).
Today, the GoB has the improved institutional framework and increased technical
capacity necessary to identifying and formulating responses to Bolivia’s DRM-related
challenges.

53.  Strengthening of risk management in sectors and territorial entities by creation of
DRM units in nine target sectors in nine different departments.

54.     Sector strategies have been submitted to the MPD, including assessments and
contingency plans. Despite high turnover of officials, competing priorities, and capacity
problems that posed a major challenge to timely implementation, the ERDMP
successfully oversaw drafting of six sectoral strategies, including Agriculture, Basic
Sanitation, Watersheds, Irrigation, Decentralization, and Civil Defense. Two were
realized but not approved by the GoB due to quality concerns (Transport and Housing),
and one (Treasury) was retracted by the GoB during its redefinition of target sectors).
Together, these sectoral methodologies are the basis for the National Disaster Response
Strategy and have contributed to preparation of the National Disaster Risk Management
Program (NDRMP, 2013-17). The Program is currently awaiting approval by the
National Assembly and will provide the basis for continued dialogue between the GoB
and the Bank.




                                             13
55.     Professional capacities have been strengthened by means of more than 20
different DRM courses and workshops, in addition to an online risk management course.
These covered risk assessment and prevention, vulnerability reduction, data management,
and GeoNode’s integration.

56.    Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Small Mitigation Works

57.     Rehabilitation and reconstruction of prioritized works in the five regions. The
Project repaired, restored, or rebuilt damaged infrastructure at 244 sites. The Project
repaired 331 kilometers on a total of 105 roads and built 80 culverts and river-bank
reinforcement/anti-erosion works, in addition to rehabilitating infrastructure related to
educational, health, water, and agriculture/irrigation sectors. The ERDMP contributed to
effective application of DRM principles and practices to civil works executed by
municipalities, particularly concerning the use of higher quality materials, adherence to
higher standards of construction, and to municipalities becoming better able to carry out
tasks related to civil works implementation and procurement. Furthermore, subprojects
were implemented using methods that created local employment, as subcontractors
recruited their workforce from among beneficiary communities.

58.     Accompanying technical support for works execution provided. The Project
provided supervision of and assistance to municipalities in execution of civil works,
ensuring compliance with quality construction norms. The works were built to better
standard than the original infrastructure to improve their resilience with regards to future
adverse natural events. FPS assessment of 48 subprojects (19.7 percent of total subproject
portfolio) report 82.8 percent of beneficiaries to be highly satisfied/satisfied, 17.2 percent
to be moderately satisfied, and no incidence of beneficiary dissatisfaction.

3.3 Efficiency

59.     At the aggregate level, the Net Present Value (NPV) of investments in
Component 2 attains $8.4 million using a discount rate of 10 percent and Internal Rate of
Return (IRR) reaches 24.4 percent. These figures were estimated taking into account all
project costs, including counterpart, and maintenance cost of road improvement
subprojects. On the other hand, only some benefits were taken into account due to the
limited information and difficulties to quantify less tangible benefits. In particular the
cost-benefit analysis takes into account the benefit of protecting arable land through
riverbank protection works and reducing inaccessibility risk in the rural area through
roads improvements—road improvement and riverbank protection works represent 85
percent of investment carried out under component two. The positive financial result of
the project is linked with high return of road improvement sub-projects that more than
compensate the negative returns of riverbank protection projects linked with low
agriculture productivity.




                                             14
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

60.    The satisfactory rating also takes into account the trend toward improvement,
from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory, evident in the last four ISRs. The Project
design and objectives remained highly relevant during Project implementation. Six out of
seven PDO indicators were achieved; one partially achieved, four fully achieved, and two
surpassing target values. This resulted in improved DRM capacity at national and sub-
national levels and reduction in local vulnerability.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61.    Disasters affect the poor disproportionately. Project intervention contributed to
increased resilience of these more vulnerable substrata within the general population; 44
percent of subprojects (107 out of 244) benefitted impoverished municipalities. The
Project’s inclusive approach accorded equitable opportunity for these groups to become
involved and to manage their respective subprojects. It also fostered operational
collaboration between such groups and the municipal and departmental agencies
mandated to oversee their welfare and development, making them active partners in
conception and implementation of DRM activities.

62.     The Social Assessment shows that men and women benefitted equitably from the
infrastructure subprojects realized under Component 2. Of the Project’s 369,370
beneficiaries at the date of the assessment in early 2013, 52 percent were women and 48
percent men (191,141 women and 178,229 men, respectively). In a more detailed analysis
of nine types of civil works the beneficiary by gender breakdown shows variation
between 46 percent women/54 percent men and 56 percent women/44 percent men. With
regard to indigenous peoples, beneficiary communities gave satisfactory ratings to all
civil works. Consensus-building mechanisms and participatory methodologies were
employed for site-selection and follow-up stakeholder feedback. Interviews conducted by
the FPS reveal men and women beneficiaries’ general satisfaction concerning their
degree of inclusion in subproject site-selection, implication in decision making processes,
involvement in implementation, and follow-up controls.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.    The Project contributed to the institutionalization of a DRM system in the country.
Key agencies such as VIDECI and MPD, coordinate with sub-national entities
(departments and municipalities), and all have benefitted from training to improve
technical and methodological capacities. In addition to the improved weather forecasting
network at SENAMHI, strengthening the SINAGER system (including the GeoNode data
platform) for disaster-risk assessment and simulation modeling. And lastly, participating
municipalities today possess better methodological approaches and improved capacity for
responding to local DRM issues, this with heavy involvement of local communities.




                                            15
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

64.     The Project served as a vehicle for innovations within GoB, which have since
become common practice in DRM local activities, notably: (i) a methodology for risk and
vulnerability analysis and preventive planning that dynamically integrates complex
technical and scientific expertise (with community knowledge through an educational and
awareness-raising process); and (ii) a bottom-up approach that balances municipal and
local communities’ roles and capacities with central coordination and support.

65.     Through the ERDMP, the GFDRR Trust Fund (TF) grant contributed crucially to
creating sectoral DRM strategies. A US$0.6 million TF grant supported the Project’s
recruitment of technical assistance to formulate the sectoral strategy terms of reference at
a time in which internal GoB issues (high turnover of officials, competing priorities, and
capacity problems) posed a major challenge to timely implementation. The grant enabled
strategies to be drafted for six sectors, including Agriculture, Basic Sanitation,
Watersheds, Irrigation, Decentralization, and Civil Defense. Today, these sectoral
methodologies constitute the cornerstone of Bolivia’s National Disaster Risk
Management Program (NDRMP, 2013-17). This Program’s objective is assimilation of
national DRM policy and strategy with Bolivia’s 2025 Strategic Agenda and Integrated
National Planning System (SPIE, an inter-ministerial coordinating unit). The ongoing
GoB-Bank dialogue on DRM—an exchange that continues after the close of the
ERDMP—is in no small part due to GFDRR collaboration during the life of the Project.

66.      As concerns Component 1, additional positive outcomes identified include
increased demand for mitigation investments and better understanding of the importance
of territorial planning, particularly with reference to the challenge of controlling growth
in urban and high-risk areas (Stakeholder Workshop, see Annex 6). Under Component 2,
subproject implementation generated employment for local populations on civil works
such as roads, schools, riverbank-protection, and the like.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

67.     In November 2013, representatives of governmental agencies directly involved
with the project implementation were interviewed for firsthand views on the Project’s
results and impact. During the same month additional input was sought during a
stakeholder workshop involving both the Bank and GoB representatives. 12 Points
emphasized by participants in terms of major impacts of the project were: (i) institutional
capacity building in DRM at national, departmental, and municipal GoB levels; (ii)
preserving, systematizing, and making accessible DRM data vital to vulnerability
assessment and planning (SENAMHI and SINAGER); (iii) integration of DRM in land-
use planning (Oruro and Alpacoma Studies, multi-sectoral risk-mapping exercises that
will be replicated in other departments); and (iv) the rehabilitation or reconstruction of
damaged infrastructure and repair of roads to improve the sustainability of livelihoods
and quality of life for 446,156 beneficiaries.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

68.     After initial delays, the GoB has demonstrated firm commitment to DRM policy
and programs. Sustainability of these is likely, given strong local ownership of Project
investments and demands from a better informed, more engaged population. Integration
of DRM issues in planning processes and increased awareness of climate-change
consequences are likely to also contribute to the continuity of efforts initiated by the
Project. This notwithstanding, the Development Outcome faces several internal risks:

69.     Maintaining and building institutional coordination. Currently, there exist
significant legislative gaps and lack of operational experience as concerns inter-agency
coordination, whether at national or decentralized levels. Promoting legislation to bridge
these gaps and continued efforts at inter-agency process-building and collaborative
method are integral to developing technically and operationally sound DRM strategy.

70.     Sustaining technical capacities at the local level. High staff turnover following
government reshufflings can challenge the effectiveness of investments in capacity
building. Especially at municipal levels, emphasis will need to be maintained on
recruiting and retaining qualified technical staff; this is a critical prerequisite to genuine
strengthening of DRM programs.

71.     Securing adequate funding. National budgetary constraints necessitate
development of a risk financing strategy. Such strategy should secure resources
specifically intended to address emergencies and to strengthen DRM investment in risk
mitigation works, hydro-meteorological data-collection infrastructure (including
electronic platforms), and community-based multi-hazard early-warning systems.

72.     Additionally, there are several external risks relating to the country’s growing
disaster-vulnerability and the magnitude of DRM challenges. It is not possible to
guarantee that infrastructure as well as hazard-monitoring systems will not be damaged
by a major catastrophic event. Furthermore, effects of environmental degradation and
substantial and increasing population numbers living in high-risk areas could render
insignificant the impacts of mitigation investments. If properly conceived, preventative
planning could have an effective mitigatory influence on these future contingencies.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.    This rating is based on the fact that the ERDMP was an ERL (Emergency
Recovery Loan) project, identified in a very short period, which was unusual in that it
rose to the challenge of institutional capacity building, an essential component of
recovery. It also takes into account the quality of collaboration between Bank and



                                             17
Borrower, inclusion of innovative elements that enhanced Project impact, and the
design’s efficacy in delivering response to client needs. On the other hand, limitations to
risk assessment and in the analysis of the complex institutional environment resulted in a
long delay in effectiveness. They slowed attainment of Project objectives initially.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     The rating reflects that the Bank proactively identified and resolved challenges to
achievement of relevant development outcomes. Bi-annual supervision missions were
timely and resulted in effective decision making, resolving critical issues affecting
Project implementation. Inventive responses were fielded to overcome problems, the
most noteworthy being recourse to a TF grant to resolve capacity issues and which was
also directly responsible for successful completion of sectoral risk management strategies.
The Bank also had a Sr. DRM Specialist based in Bolivia during the last half of the
Project’s life, providing constant, hands on support to implementation. Procurement and
financial management were well supervised and solution oriented. Supervision of
safeguards was conducted regularly. The Project’s three restructurings enabled it to attain
its major development objectives despite the complexity and scope of transformative
changes affecting the political and institutional landscape of the country at the time.
However, supervision could have gone further in ensuring that the challenges in meeting
certain objectives were addressed more effectively and that unused funds were promptly
reallocated or cancelled.13 Additionally, the Bank should have taken action earlier in re-
evaluating project costs and re-assessing GoB’s real financial needs in order to avoid the
approval of a US$ 4.2 million Additional Financing and a subsequent total cancellation of
Project funds of US$ 7.1 million.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The rating reflects the moderately satisfactory performance of the Bank in
ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision. Evaluation of overall performance is
based on the Bank’s recourse to the GFDRR to improve technical assistance, specialists
in the Bank’s country office, and restructurings that supported PDO achievement. None
the less, a more thorough assessment of the political and institutional complexities in the
country as well as a more assertive evaluation of the GoB’s financial needs and project
costs would have facilitated execution.




13
   The Bank could have considered redefining the original Project results matrix as well as more closely monitored the
achievement of indicators (e.g. PDO indicator 7 and intermediary indictor 3). Additionally, the Bank should have dealt
with the unused PPF funds at a much earlier stage as well as better supported the GoB to allocate resources in
Component 2 more adequately which may have avoided such a large cancellation of funds at the very end of the Project.




                                                         18
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      The rating is based on the delayed implementation that occurred due to
institutional coordination problems (leadership rivalry and unclear definition of roles and
responsibilities among implementing partners) and revolving door turnover of
government officials that challenged the Project during its first three years of its existence.
Moreover, the decentralization process happening in the country created disagreement
between the national and departmental governments over responsibility for risk
prevention and rehabilitation. This questioned the relevance of certain indicators, leading
the GoB to find alternative solutions to implementation requirements14 . However, the
GoB demonstrated more sustained commitment to PDO after 2010, beginning with
consolidation of the legal and institutional framework essential to improved DRM policy
(notably, the July 2010 Law N° 31 on Autonomy and Decentralization, delegating
territorial planning prerogatives to departmental [not national] authorities). Naturally,
implementing an ERL project premised on an innovative form of multi-sectoral
cooperation and institutional capacity building did not occur without complications. In
the last half of the Project’s lifespan, the GoB collaborated effectively with the ERDMP
to attain the major development objectives.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.    The rating reflects the differing performance levels of the various agencies—
MPD, VIDECI, and FPS—responsible for Project implementation. In the initial stage (up
to one year after the effectiveness), these agencies suffered inter-agency coordination and
management difficulties that slowed decision making and implementation, especially as
concerned timely submission of audits and observance of Bank procurement processes.
Close supervision, training, and technical assistance helped strengthen capacities, just as
greater stability in terms of government officials’ turnover after the re-election of
President Morales in 2009 contributed to an accelerated pace and improved quality of
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory considering that both
government and implementing agencies’ performances are rated as moderately
satisfactory. Initial agency performance suffered shortcomings which were addressed and
resolved through capacity building (workshops, trainings, and online courses) and


14
  For intermediary indicator 3, only recommendations for a territorial planning legislation with a DRM focus could be
produced as territorial planning responsibilities had shifted from the national to the subnational level during the life of
the Project.




                                                            19
provision of intense and qualified technical assistance. These steps, in addition to
increased political stability and sustained GoB commitment after 2011, contributed to
improved performance and successful PDO achievement.

6. Lessons Learned

79.     Bundling of infrastructure subprojects can produce catalytic effects. For
example residents on one rural settlement that benefited from project investments
(rehabilitated primary school complex, a rebuilt access-road, and improved potable water
infrastructure) 15 recounted that the net result of these enhancements had been to
transform their community into a pole of attraction; families from nearby farms now send
their children to attend the school, and many from more distant districts have moved
“into town.” The bundle of improvements has had a transformative effect on population
and livelihoods dynamics.

80.     A national DRM strategy should respond to the particular needs and
conditions prevailing in the country in question. The Project is illustrative of a DRM
strategy capable of adapting to changing conditions. At numerous intervals the Project’s
inbuilt flexibility allowed it to adjust effectively to a legislative and institutional
environment in flux and to deliver the expected results. However, this challenging
environment slowed down the pace of a project that was pioneering the application of
OP/BP 8.00, limiting the possibilities to see the actual benefits of an expedited project
implementation following an abbreviated approval process vis-à-vis a regular approval
procedure for a standard investment operation.

81.     DRM awareness at community level contributes to ownership and
sustainability of results. Prior to this project, departmental authorities, municipalities,
and grassroots communities were often not included in DRM-related decisions and
processes. Participatory in approach, this project reserved crucial decision making and
supervisory roles for beneficiaries, leaving them better informed and more engaged with
regard to DRM issues, thus more likely to demand continued GoB attention to them.

82.      Development of monitoring and evaluation systems for Emergency Projects
is critical to accurate assessment of results and balanced inference of lessons. Despite
consensus on the importance of prevention and mitigation, monitoring and evaluation of
DRM activities linked to Emergency Projects must receive greater attention.

83.    The importance of the Bank’s GFDRR grants in providing highly qualified
and intensive technical assistance to enhance and help build national capacities and
hazard-monitoring systems. This has been an indispensable strategic advantage in a
context in which institutional capacities are lacking. The GFDRR resources enabled the
ERDMP to develop sectoral risk management strategies, a municipal-level risk

assessment methodology, and a GIS based disaster risk management information
platform.

84.     The importance of frequent supervision and qualified Bank staff in Bolivia.
The frequent supervision and presence of an on-site team composed of specialists in
DRM, engineering, economics, procurement, and social development, was indispensable
to the ERDMP’s successful implementation and wide variety of beneficial outcomes.

85.     Institutionalization of DRM priorities. Collaboration with the ERDMP
contributed to FPS’ developing a set of guidelines and standards for subproject
maintenance and repair. This signals ownership of DRM concepts and is a positive
indicator of sustainability of the new or rehabilitated infrastructure.

86.     Multiple restructurings may create high transaction costs. Multiple
restructurings may create high transaction costs for small operations like the ERDMP and
can divert both Government and Bank resources away from implementation, especially in
a context in which inter-agency coordination is already difficult.

87.     Undertaking a large amount of small-scale reconstruction works may not be
a viable model in this type of context. Given the challenges in implementation and
procurement faced by small municipalities and the limited institutional capacity of the
implementing agency (FPS) in the initial staged of the Project, undertaking a large
amount of small-scale reconstruction works may not be a viable model in this type of
context. Additional support is needed for those small municipalities that are lacking basic
technical capacity to formulate project profiles and carry out procurement processes. This
is an approach that FPS should be prepared to implement in the future, and for which the
Bank will need to build in additional counterpart costs to ensure additional staffing and
logistic support.

Strengthening the National System for Risk Management through capacity building
at the national, sector, and sub-national levels (achieved)

Appraisal Estimate (including AF): US$2.4 million
Actual/Latest Estimate: US$1.4 million

Working through the National Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
(PRRES), Component 1 supported Bolivia’s efforts to reinforce its National System for
Risk Reduction and Disaster and Emergency Response (SISRADE).

Principal implementing partners were the Ministry of Planning for Development
(MPD)/Vice-Ministry for Planning and Coordination (VPC) and the Vice-Ministry for
Civil Defense (VIDECI).

   Inter-institutional coordination for disaster reconstruction and rehabilitation. At
    Project inception, technical assistance was provided to prioritize reconstruction and
    rehabilitation needs as well as to improve design and supervise construction works.
    This process contributed to improve local capacity and inter-agency coordination in
    DRM. In addition, a national and sub-national DRM-related agencies assessment by
    sector was carried out by the MPD, through a consultation process, in order to support
    the strengthening of the National Risk Management System. These recommendations
    included: (i) strengthening inter-agency coordination at national and sub-national
    levels; (ii) including DRM as a key component in national development planning
    processes; (iii) capacity building of sector DRM units’ personnel; and (iv) improve
    linkages and access to information systems for DRM-related planning.

   Risk management incorporated within territorial planning processes. The Alpacoma
    Watershed and the Oruro Land Planning studies were conducted to assess the impact
    of the 2007-2008 El Niño/La Niña adverse effects. The biophysical and topographic
    characteristics analysis of the studied areas identified landslides and floods as the
    principal disaster risks. The studies’ findings will provide: (i) engineering designs for
    land stabilization to reduce landslides risk and (ii) inputs supporting future territorial
    planning and sustainable organization of socio-economic activities.

    The Decentralization and Autonomy Law (2010) confers mandate for territorial
    planning on departmental—not national—authorities. Accordingly, the Oruro Study
    was carried out under the aegis of Oruro Department authorities. The Study’s results
    and methodologies later helped the MPD’s Land Use Planning Unit (at national level)
    to better integrate DRM in its approach to planning.

   Development support provided for the National Information System (SNID) and the
    National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI). The Project led to
    improvements in the reliability and distribution of information supporting risk
    management decision making. The successful implementation of the GeoNode, a



                                              24
    disaster risk management data platform, through the National Information System on
    Risk Management (SINAGER) centralized risk information from all sectors at the
    national and sub-national levels. Currently, 23 public institutions access and contribute
    to the GeoNode platform, including line ministries, departmental and municipal
    governments, and research institutes. In addition, government officials were trained in
    the use of GeoNode and how to integrate risk prevention and vulnerability reduction in
    decision making processes.

    The Project strengthened SENAMHI by (i) updating and centralizing the information
    from meteorological stations; (ii) standardizing data by categories for better
    processing; (iii) developing data collection methodology; (iv) developing the
    climatologic index for risk assessment; (v) and linking meteorological information to
    GeoNode for risk mapping. The increased forecasting capability of SENAMHI has
    been key in supporting risk management decision making. The Government of
    Ecuador has shown its interest in a South-South cooperation to learn from Bolivia’s
    experience and improve its meteorological forecasting service as well as risk
    management data platform.

   The National Risk Management System strengthened. The National DRM Program
    developed with support of the Project allowed for a better understanding of Bolivia’s
    challenges and provided recommendations to address them. In addition, the experience
    of the 2007-2008 El Niño/La Niña recovery efforts supported the preparation of a draft
    legislation formalizing recovery operations responsibilities and authorities. This
    proposal included a methodology and implementation model for execution of
    emergency work incorporating DRM as a transversal theme.

   Risk management strengthened in sectors. As planned, DRM units were created in 9
    target sectors in 9 departments. The sectors chosen by the GoB did not include the
    Treasury (as first set forth in the PAD) and added Health and Education, which did not
    figure in the PAD. Different approaches were taken to operationalizing these units;
    some of them were incorporated as administrative offices or technical departments and
    others were represented by an individual (serving as “focal point”). The DRM Units
    located within ministries were incorporated as part of their planning departments, and
    linked to the MPD instead of functioning as independent technical units.

    Sector strategies submitted to MPD included assessments and contingency plans by
    sector. These were presented in six documents covering eight out of nine sectors. The
    strategies served as inputs to strengthen the National DRM Program by cross-
    referencing key sector information to improve coordination in disaster prevention and
    mitigation.

    In addition, over 20 courses and workshops were carried in DRM, prevention,
    vulnerability, risk assessment, data management, and integration to GeoNode. A risk
    management on-line course “Educate” was also carried out by VIDECI with more than
    122 participants.

Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and Small Mitigation Works

Principal implementing partner for Component 2 was the National Fund for Productive
and Social Investment (FPS).

   Rehabilitation and reconstruction of prioritized works in the 5 regions. The Project
    rehabilitated or reconstructed 244 damaged infrastructure that needed to be repaired
    and restored to its original operational capacity. In some cases, modifications were
    made to improve disaster resistance based on a review of vulnerability. Civil works
    were primarily carried out by FPS with the support of the municipalities, and the
    hiring of local workers supported socio-economic rehabilitation efforts. Official FPS
    reports found that the level of acceptance for civil works was favorable in all
    communities, using a sample of 23 projects (9.5 percent of project portfolio).

   The Project intervened to repair 331 kilometers on a total of 105 roads and built 80
    culverts and river-bank reinforcement/anti-erosion works, in addition to rehabilitating
    infrastructure for educational, health, waterworks, and agriculture/irrigation sectors.

   Accompanying technical support for civil works execution. Supervision of civil works
    and assistance to municipalities in works execution were provided by the Project to
    ensure compliance with quality construction norms. FPS assessments report 100
    percent beneficiary satisfaction with both the quality of the civil works realized and
    the improvement of their standard of living.

    These works included infrastructure rehabilitation/reconstruction relating to potable
    water supply, sewage evacuation, water intake, irrigation systems, bridge and road
    repairs, riverbank reinforcement, filtration galleries, and schools, among others. The
    target areas for these works were those determined to have been particularly hard hit
    by effects of the El Niño and/or La Niña events. Component 2 civil works were
    identified by local communities, and then proposed to the local municipality.
    Thereafter, the municipality collaborated with the FPS on implementation, quality-
    control, monitoring, and evaluation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management project aimed to restore access to
basic infrastructure in five target regions, and to strengthen the Government’s ability to
respond to disasters. It had two components: Component 1, strengthening the National
System for Risk Management, and Component 2, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
Works. The project implemented 244 subprojects in the departments of Santa Cruz,
Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Potosí, La Paz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija for about US$7.8
million. These subprojects included civil works such as riverbanks protection,
improvement of roads and bridges, reconstruction of education and health infrastructure
and irrigation systems

As the project has not followed any output or outcome indicators that allow directly
estimating the economic benefit, this annex shows the results of a cost benefit analysis
based on rough but cautious assumption on costs avoided by riverbank protection works
and roads improvements—these projects amounts 85 percent projects and disbursements
carried out under Component 1 (Figure 1). The benefits of remaining civil works are not
included due to difficulties to estimate benefit of heterogeneous infrastructure projects
such as the rehabilitation of sport infrastructure, irrigation projects and reconstruction of
schools perimeter walls, classrooms and other education and health infrastructure.
Seemingly, the benefits of institutional strengthening and policy development are also
excluded as the benefits of these activities are difficult to capture in a cost-benefit
analysis.

Methodology and assumptions

The aggregate financial analysis consider all project cost but only take into account
benefits and recurrent cost of river protection works and road improvements projects.
This analysis is a low bound estimate of cost-benefit analysis of the project as it passes
over the benefit of 15 percent of subproject which heterogeneity did not allow
quantifying specific benefits. Moreover, this analysis does not include the benefits


                                                  29
resulting from reduced environmental damages, cultural losses, injuries, stress and
overwork in relief participants, health risks and social fragmentation. Seemingly, the
analysis does not factor in the intangible effect of institutional strengthening and policy
development supported under Component 1. In addition, specific cost-benefit analysis of
river banks protection works and roads improvement are also carried out to qualify the
specific financial effect of these kinds of projects. The assumptions were carefully
selected to avoid overestimation of the benefits in order to have conservative estimates
that supplement the lack of hard information on the effect of sub-projects on economic
activity.

The direct investment costs of the project are taken into account as well as the
counterpart financing reported by FPS (Figure 2). In the case of riverbanks protection
works, no maintenance cost is taken into account as Bolivian municipalities do not make
maintenances of this kind of infrastructure. As counterpart of this assumption, it is
assumed that riverbanks protection works will endure only 10 years on average. In the
case of road improvements, a yearly maintenance cost of 10 percent of initial investment
is assumed, allowing to extent the average lifetime of this infrastructure to 15 years. All
costs were expressed in 2010 US dollar using the GDP deflator to avoid distortions
generated by inflation.

The benefits of riverbanks protection works were estimated assuming that each meter of
river protection cost about US$400 and that each meter of gabions protect, on average,
200m2 on midlands municipalities and 500m2 in lowlands municipalities—no riverbanks
protection works take place in highland municipalities. The amounts disbursed in
riverbanks protection works divided by the unit cost of gabions allows estimating the
length of gabions constructed by region each year. The length of gabions and the
assumptions on area protected by each meter of protection allows estimating the total
area projected by region. The resulting protected areas was used to estimate the avoided
cost using the departmental agriculture Gross Domestic Product per cultivated hectares—
the cultivated hectares at department level were attained using national estimates of
national cultivated area published by the National Statistical Institute and area cultivated
at departmental level presented in the 2008 national agriculture survey. The attained
figures should be consider a low bound estimates as the lack of riverbanks protection may
have other impacts not quantified in this analysis and the fact that productivity of land
close to river tends to be higher than the departmental average.

The benefits of road improvements were estimated assuming that these improvements
avoid cost resulting from the lack of mobility in rainy season affecting agriculture sector.
It is assumed improvements will reduce the days without traffic by 20 days in the raining
season. The number of direct rural beneficiaries of road improvements time the days of
normal transit allow to estimate the total number of days lost avoided by region—urban
beneficiaries were excluded the analysis as urban population may have better access to
alternative roads that may help to mitigate the effect of rains. The lost time the
department agriculture output per urban population allow estimating the cost avoided by
road improvements. As in the previous case, these figures should be consider as a low
bound estimate as the agriculture loss estimate are not taking into account that losses
could be higher due the raining season occurs during the harvest season. Moreover, the
lack of improved roads may generate cost to other economic sector such as commerce
and may increase maintenance costs of roads. Finally, the analysis is not taken into
account the effect of road improvements on urban population that could suffer higher
transportation cost and delays.

Results and sensitivity analysis

At the aggregate level, using a discount rate on 10 percent, the Net Present Value (NPV)
attains of US$8.4 million, The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) reaches 24.4 percent. This
positive results are linked with the high returns on road improvement subprojects which
specific IRR attained 45 percent showing that road improvements may avoid severe
economic damages in region where rains compromise access of rural roads. In contrast,
the specific IRR of riverbank protection sub-projects is negative due to the Bolivian low
agriculture productivity and the fact the most of these projects were carried out in middle
land region where average protected area is smaller and productivity tend to be lower.

built to check the robustness of result to lower benefits. In the first scenario, it is assumed
that benefits are 15 percent lower in the base case scenario, and in the second scenario a
30 percent reduction is assumed. As expected the reduction of benefits reduce the
aggregate NPVs and IRRs but they continue showing positive result at aggregate level.

La Paz, Bolivia
November 21, 2013

The workshop was entitled, “Validation of Results for the Emergency Recovery and
Disaster Management Project—ERDMP.”

Its primary objective was to bring together representatives of the Bank, Borrower (GoB),
and implementing agencies to share, discuss, and validate the results of the Project.

Present at the workshop were representatives of:

      The World Bank (Country Office and Headquarters);
      Ministry of Development Planning (MPD) / Vice Ministry for Planning and
       Coordination (VPC);
      Vice Ministry for Civil Defense (VIDECI);
      National Fund for Productive and Social Investment (FPS);
      General Directorate for Territorial Planning (DGOT);
      Vice Ministry of Housing and Urbanism;
      Vice Ministry of Waterworks and Irrigation;
      Vice Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity, and Climate Change;
      Vice Ministry of Basic Sanitation;
      Ministry of Rural Development / DRM Unit Department of Oruro;
      Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz.

The event lasted one day and was participatory in character as described below.

-Opening remarks were delivered by Armando Guzman, the Project TTL.

-Official opening discourse was delivered by the Vice-Minister of the MPD.

-These were followed by a series of presentations concerning Component 1 of the Project
for strengthening the National System for Risk Reduction and Disaster Emergency
Response (SISRADE) through capacity building at national, sectoral, and local levels.

-Three different presentations were given, by MPD/VPC, VIDECI, and the Bank. After
each presentation question-and-answer and sessions were opened to all parties present.

-The morning session concluded with validation of Component 1 indicators as set out in
the PAD.

-The afternoon session proceeded in the same fashion but concerned elements of
Component 2, which focused on rehabilitation, reconstruction, and small mitigation
works.



                                           36
-Presentations were given by the Bank, VPC, and FPS followed by discussion, queries,
and response.

-The session concluded with validation of the results figuring in the matrix of indicators.

-Various lessons learned and recommendations were forwarded, followed by closing
remarks.

The workshop was above all an inclusive forum. The presence of an ample cross-section
of Bank, Borrower, and other stakeholder interests fostered highly productive discussion
and interchange in a relatively short period of time. The salient points of consensus are as
follow:

      Compared to the 2007 pre-Project situation, 2013 disaster-response capacities of
       the GoB are significantly improved, thanks notably to the building of new
       coordination processes and inter-agency relationships necessary to implementing
       Component 1. Although successful continuation of cross-sectoral cooperation and
       collaboration will require clearer definition of roles and prerogatives of the
       various actors involved, the Project-supported dialogue that has been inaugurated
       represents the crucial and perhaps most difficult first step in a long-term process.

      The Project has contributed crucially—notably through the Alpacoma and Oruro
       Land-use Studies—to developing baseline data and multi-disciplinary
       methodologies for identification of zones susceptible to disasters and other
       adverse events.

      The Project has been crucial to preserving and making accessible institutional
       memory as concerns data pertinent to DRM. Current and historical archives have
       been digitally catalogued in systematized fashion (SENAMHI and SINAGER)
       and then made accessible via an electronic platform (GeoNode), two signal
       achievements without precedent in Bolivia.

      Another ground-breaking aspect of the Alpacoma and Oruro Studies has been to
       unite a wide array of scientific and technical expertise in service to integral area
       plans, providing future DRM and development activities with holistic profile of
       natural and social contexts based on high-quality, geo-referenced, up-to-date
       information.

      Sustainable rehabilitation is an indispensable component of reconstruction.
       Future development planning must involve genuinely balanced assessment of
       whether or not recurrence of disaster in a particular locale or situation is
       foreseeable, and avoid simply rebuilding where future disaster is imminent.
       Resettlement may present an opportunity to improve the standard of living of
       vulnerable groups in high-risk areas, functioning as both a response to factors
       underlying vulnerability and addressing exposure to existing risk.



                                            37
Implementation process for subproject identification should be more flexible. Many
municipalities lacked sufficient funds and/or capacities required to assemble competitive
subproject proposals, with the result that they were unable to engage with the Project.
This could be resolved if expenses incurred for subproject identification could be
reimbursed upon approval of the application.

      A contingency line of credit or special emergency fund could effectively alleviate
       certain difficulties that slowed crisis-response time at the outset of the Project.

      Effective DRM is inherently multi-sectoral. It should henceforth be implemented
       in holistic fashion, integrating inputs from a multitude of sectors and levels
       (national, departmental, municipal, and community).

      Long-term vision, coherent policy, and integrated implementation are essential
       prerequisites of effective DRM.

      From both economic and human life lost/saved standpoints, it is far more
       effective to concentrate on prevention than on mitigation.

      Many of the Project’s successes that do not show up in the indicators. These
       include but are not limited to: the catalytic effect of rebuilt schools in attracting
       new residents seeking high-quality education for their children; DRM strategy is
       beginning to be developed by the GoB directly from Bolivian experience, not
       imported from elsewhere; and providing development ideas for integrating DRM
       in planning for urban contexts, in which close to 60 percent of Bolivia’s populace
       resides.

      To be genuinely effective, DRM must become an integral part of territorial
       planning.

      Territorial planning should take into account multiple facets, including
       environment/ecology, livelihoods, resource-management, climatic shocks, and
       various other crucial elements.

      The new risk assessment tools and methodologies are ground-breaking in that
       they actively engage participation local authorities and populations, namely
       departmental and municipal. Risk assessment can thereby achieve maximal
       efficacy, as it (1) is nuanced to reflect socio-economic and environmental
       particularities of a given zone and (2) is appropriated by the stakeholder /
       beneficiaries themselves.

   Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

   Summary of points raised in the Borrower’s evaluation report.

1. The Government believes that integrating Disaster Risk Management with land use
   planning is crucial in identifying risk at the local level and formulating preventive
   measures. In parallel, Disaster Risk Management should be incorporated as a transversal
   theme within each sector. These two complementary approaches will ensure a
   comprehensive development planning process in the short, medium and long term.
2. The GoB recommends providing incentives for the resettlement of populations
   established in urban areas with high landslide risk.
3. In terms of project implementation, the Government considers that execution of
   reconstruction and rehabilitation works should happen more quickly, especially in the
   context of an ERL. First, it becomes difficult to evaluate the effects of El Niño and la
   Niña on damaged infrastructure many years after the disaster. Secondly, due to the
   execution delays in component 2, many civil works identified in the original design
   became irrelevant as municipal governments chose to bear their cost outside of the
   project. In the future, the Government plans to improve its ability to identify and
   prioritize reconstruction works.
4. The GoB acknowledges that the procurement process needs to be better adapted to the
   context of poor and remote municipalities in order to make small civil works more
   attractive for construction companies. Maintenance should be provided by municipalities
   after the life of the project in order to ensure sustainability.
5. The Government highlights the importance of conducting a high-quality social
   assessment and involving local communities during project preparation and
   implementation.
6. A clear and independent financial management framework on the Client side needs to be
   in place at the very start of the project in order to avoid bureaucratic bottlenecks and
   delays in payments and disbursements.
7. The early establishment of a strong project implementation unit within the implementing
   agency will be crucial in ensuring effective project execution in future operations. The
   Government also underlines the importance of Monitoring and Evaluation procedures to
   improve reporting and project management.
8. A contingency line of credit could effectively alleviate certain difficulties that slowed
   crisis response at the outset of the Project. This would be part of a risk financing strategy
   in the country.

   Summary of Borrower’s comments on Draft ICR

1. The GoB points out an inconsistency between the wording of Component 1 intermediate
   outcome indicator “Draft of legislation for incorporation of risk management in territorial
   planning submitted to the MPD for consideration” 16 in the PAD and the project’s
   Operations Manual. The Client explains that the 2012 Operations Manual refers to
   “methodologies” not “draft legislation”. Therefore, even though the Alpacoma and Oruro
   studies only provided methodologies to incorporate disaster risk management in
   territorial planning, the Client considers this indicator as fully achieved. The Bank’s team
   however, assigns a 50% achievement level since only recommendations for a draft
   legislation were submitted, not the actual draft legislation.
2. With regards to project management shortcomings identified within the implementing
   agency17, the GoB notes that Mid-Term Review results were not clearly communicated to
   the VPC.
3. The Client clarifies that not all municipalities have difficulties in maintaining riverbanks
   protection works18. This is only the case in small municipalities such as the ones included
   in the Project.
