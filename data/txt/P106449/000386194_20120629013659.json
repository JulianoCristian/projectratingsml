This is a level two\n            restructuring. There are no changes in the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) description or the main results\n            framework as the activities to be cancelled have been\n            completed by the government and funded by other sources. The\n            changes do not affect, alter, or trigger any additional\n            safeguard policy. The project was signed on February 11,\n            2008, and became effective on December 11, 2008. It has two\n            components: first component is strengthening the national\n            system for risk management, which has two subcomponents: (a)\n            policy development for sustainable reconstruction and (b)\n            institutional strengthening; and second component is\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction works, which has three\n            subcomponents: (a) execution of rehabilitation and\n            reconstruction works, (b) accompanying technical supervision\n            for the execution of the works, and (c) execution of small\n            mitigation and rehabilitation works. This restructuring\n            process (extension, reallocation of subcomponent proceeds,\n            and closing of activities) will enable the Government of\n            Bolivia (GoB) to complete the following activities: (a)\n            completion of the Alp coma Watershed Study and Oruro Land\n            Planning; (b) strengthening disaster risk management\n            capacity; and (c) completion of civil works to reduce\n            disaster vulnerability. All of the proposed changes have\n            been incorporated into the project operations manual and\n            endorsed by the project Executive Committee. The Bank\n            provided comments to the operations manual on April 15, 2012\n            and it is now waiting for the formal no objection request\n            from the GoB."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
