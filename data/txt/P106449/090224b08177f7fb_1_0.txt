                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During supervision missions conducted between May 21-29 and October 22-30, 2012, the GoB reported that: (i) strategic actions have been taken to speed up the implementation of
                         Component 1, and (ii) Under Component 2, a portfolio of 198 subprojects, amounting to approximately US$6.09 million from the credit, have been fully implemented in the
                         departments of Sta. Cruz, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Potosi, La Paz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija. In addition, 30 subprojects are being executed and 33 are being prepared for further

                         The project was restructured on July 3, 2012 to reallocate resources, cancel activities that were either funded by other sources or were not longer required (e.g. preliminary study on
                         risk financing strategy and preparation funds), and to extend the closing date to May 15, 2013 in order to complete key activities including: (i) completion of the Alpacoma Watershed
                         study and Oruro Land Planning (Component 1), (ii) strengthening disaster risk management capacity (Component 1), and (iii) completion of civil works to reduce disaster vulnerability
                         (Component 2).
