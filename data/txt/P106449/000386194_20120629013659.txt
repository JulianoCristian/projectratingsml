Does the restructured project require any exceptions to Bank policies?                                             N
Does the restructured project trigger any new safeguard policies? If yes, please select from the                   N
checklist below and update ISDS accordingly before submitting the package.

7a. Project Development Objectives
The PDO is still to support the implementation of the National Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction (PRRES) and strengthen the Disaster Risk Management institutional capacity at the national level.
The Project will continue contributing to restore access to basic infrastructure for a portion of the affected population
in five target regions, and to strengthen the Government’s ability at the national, sectoral, and municipal levels
throughout the country to respond to future disasters.

                                                      RESTRUCTURING PAPER

B. SUMMARY

1. This is a proposed Level Two restructuring. There are no changes in the PDO description or the main results framework as the activities to be
   cancelled have been completed by the government and funded by other sources. The proposed changes do not affect, alter, or trigger any
   additional safeguard policy.

2. The main changes to the Project and their rationale are the following:

   i.   Proceeds within Component 1 would be reallocated mainly to allow the completion of the Alpacoma Watershed Study and Oruro Land
        Planning. Similarly, some proceeds under Component 2 would be reallocated within its subcomponents in order to support the carrying out of
        civil works.

 ii.    Subcomponents 1.1.3, 1.1.5, and 1.1.6 will be cancelled entirely, and Subcomponents 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.4, 1.2.1, 1.2.3 and 2 (a), 2 (c), 3 will be
        partially cancelled, as shown in Table 1 (see also paragraph 10).

 iii.   The closing date for the Credits 4377-BO and 4440-BO would be extended from June 30, 2012, until May 15, 2013, to provide the
        Government of Bolivia (GoB) sufficient time to finalize all remaining Project activities. Two official requests from the GoB were received:
        (i) to cancel amounts (March 6, 2012), and (ii) to revise the amounts to be reduced, canceled or reallocated and to extend the project (May 22,
        2012).
                                                                           7
C. PROJECT STATUS

3. The project was signed on February 11, 2008, and became effective on December 11, 2008. It has two components: Component 1, Strengthening
   the National System for Risk Management, which has two subcomponents: (a) Policy Development for Sustainable Reconstruction and (b)
   Institutional Strengthening; and Component 2, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Works, which has three subcomponents: (a) Execution of
   Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Works, (b) Accompanying Technical Supervision for the Execution of the Works, and (c) Execution of Small
   Mitigation and Rehabilitation Works.

4. Following the effectiveness of the Additional Financing Credit (4440-BO) in June 2009, the Bolivia Emergency Recovery and Disaster Risk
   Management Project (ERDMP) is valued at SDR10.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, 40 percent of the value of the project, or SDR4.3
   million, had been disbursed.

5. During the most recent supervision mission (January 2012), the Project Coordination Committee indicated that they would mobilize the required
   resources to accelerate project implementation, particularly as pertains to Component 1 (Alpacoma Basin Study and Oruro Land Planning). In
   May 2012, the Bank granted a No Objection to the Terms of Reference for the implementation of both subprojects.

6. As of December 31, 2011, the GoB reported that under Component 2: Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, a total of 182 subprojects valued at
   US$6.5 million have been fully implemented in eight out of the nine departments of Bolivia: Santa Cruz, Potosi, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, La
   Paz, Beni, Tarija, and Pando. An additional group of 68 subprojects totaling US$3.6 million are currently being implemented. More than 256,428
   people have benefited from civil works such as riverbanks protection, improvement of roads and bridges, reconstruction of schools and irrigation
   systems.

7. There are no overdue audits. The 2010 audit report was received by the Bank on June 19, 2012 and it is under review.

D. PROPOSED CHANGES

8. Financing: The total cost of Component 1 (Strengthening the National System for Risk Management) would decrease as some of the
   subcomponents will be canceled. Similarly, the cost of Component 2 (Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Works) would decrease as some of the
   planned civil works will be cancelled. This restructuring process (extension, reallocation of subcomponent proceeds, and closing of activities)
   will enable the GoB to complete the following activities: (a) completion of the Alpacoma Watershed Study and Oruro Land Planning
   (Component 1), (b) strengthening disaster risk management capacity (Component 1), and (c) completion of civil works to reduce disaster
   vulnerability (Component 2). All of the proposed changes have been incorporated into the Project Operations Manual and endorsed by the Project
   Executive Committee. The Bank provided comments to the Operations Manual on April 15, 2012 and it is now waiting for the formal No
   Objection request from the GoB. Please refer to Table 1 for more details on reallocations and closings.

9. Reallocations: The proceeds for the Project would be reallocated as shown below:
                                                                         8
   i.   Component 1: In order to complete the Alpacoma Watershed Study, the team is proposing to reallocate 15 percent of the proceeds from
        subcomponent 1.1.4 (SDR 20,984) to subcomponent 1.2.2.
  ii.   Component 2: Some proceeds would be reallocated largely because of the need to support the carrying out of civil works. 100 percent of
        subcomponent 2(a)(i) (SDR 383,266) would be reallocated and a 59 percent of subcomponent 2(e) (SDR 163,158) would be transferred into
        subcomponent 2 (a)(ii). Similarly, 85 percent of subcomponent 2(c) (SDR 1,126,918) will be reallocated into both subcomponent 2(d)
        (SDR 1,074,645) and subcomponent 2(e) (SDR 52,273).

10. Cancellations: As the Project undergoes restructuring, some of the activities would be canceled without affecting the expected project result.
    The total amount requested to be canceled is SDR 3,936,099.19. These cancellations are shown below (percentage of subcomponent total
    amount to be canceled in parenthesis, further details in Table 2):
   Component 1:
         i. Subcomponent 1.1.1: Decrease by SDR 21,673 (60%).
        ii. Subcomponent 1.1.2: Decrease by SDR 134,326 (46%).
      iii. Subcomponent 1.1.3: Decrease by SDR 9,772 (100%).
       iv. Subcomponent 1.1.4: Decrease by SDR 121,877 (40%).
        v. Subcomponent 1.1.5: Decrease by SDR 231,827 (100%).
       vi. Subcomponent 1.1.6: Decrease by SDR 134,868 (100%).
      vii. Subcomponent 1.2.1: Decrease by SDR 5,673 (23%).
     viii. Subcomponent 1.2.3: Decrease by SDR 30,860 (15%).
   Component 2:
     i. Subcomponent 2 (a): Decrease by SDR 383,266 (37%).
     ii. Subcomponent 2 (c): Decrease by SDR 1,126,918 (85%).
     iii. Subcomponent 3: Decrease by SDR 3,199,134 (99%).
