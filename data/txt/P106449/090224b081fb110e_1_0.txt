                         In support of the implementation of the National Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (PRRES), the project will contribute to restore access to basic
                         infrastructure for a portion of the affected population in five target regions, and to strengthen the Government#s ability at the national, sectoral, and municipal levels
                         throughout the country to respond to future disasters.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has just been restructured following an official request from the GoB to partially cancel the credit. Despite the positive project implementation and approaching the end
                         target of achieved projects, the GoB requested a partial cancellation of US$1,028,120.00 from Component 2 (representing 10% from the total of the two credits). This is due to the
                         fact that some civil works could not be contracted on time to be concluded before the closing date.

                         At the time of preparation of this ISR the GoB: (i) has taken strategic actions to speed up the completion of Component 1, including the conclusion of the Alpacoma Watershed Study

                         amount to approximately US$7.76 million and have been implemented in the departments of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Potosí, La Paz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija. The
                         GoB is currently finishing the execution of an additional set of 18 projects that were delayed in the third and four packages and are scheduled to be concluded on September 30,
