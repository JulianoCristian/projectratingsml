the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) in\n            Senegal. The Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) was designed to\n            support the reform program introduced by the Government.The\n            objectives of the ERC were: (i) to support the\n            Government's reform program, and more particularly the\n            measures aimed at minimizing the negative social impact of\n            the devaluation in the short tern; (ii) to provide necessary\n            financial aid for the transition period, while follow-up\n            operations were being prepared; and (iii) to continue the\n            policy dialogue between the Governrment and IDA. Three\n            lessons can be drawn from implementation of the ERC: First,\n            Government's firm commitment to the reform program was\n            a key element in the success of the operation. Second.\n            budgetary support in a single-tranche disbursement was a\n            satisfactory response to an emergency situation. Third, as\n            far as poverty reduction is concerned, specific mechanisms\n            for targeting vulnerable groups should be identified\n            beforehand so that the impact on such groups can be maximized."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
