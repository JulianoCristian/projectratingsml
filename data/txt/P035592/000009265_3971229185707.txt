Credit Objectives
The ERC seeks to assist the Government of Senegal to deepen its
adjustment strategy and to ensure that gains in competitiveness are
consolidated, social sector expenditures for 1994 are protected in
real terms, and the adverse effects of the devaluation on vulnerable
groups are minimized.
Credit Description
The African Members of the Franc Zone decided to devalue their
currency, the CFA franc, effective January 12, 1994. The proposed
credit would support the post-devaluation reform program for 1994 as
outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policies
dated February 23, 1994, whose main objectives are private sector-led
growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Senegal Government has
already taken a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures to
regain and consolidate competitiveness. These measures include: (i)
the devaluation of the CFA franc from 50CFAF to 100CFAF/lFF; (ii) an
increase in the producer price of groundnuts of 43% and of cotton of
30%; (iii) a program of social measures to mitigate the effects of the
devaluation on vulnerable groups; (iv) prudent demand management
policies to reduce public sector absorption and limit public wage
increases; (v) reduction and simplification of tariffs and domestic
taxation; and (vi) protection of social sector expenditures in real
terms. The ERC is designed to support implementation of these
measures in 1994.
Implementation Arrangements (Procurement and Disbursement)
The proposed Credit would be of SDR18.2 million (US$ million
equivalent). Due to the urgent nature of the operation, the entire



credit is proposed for disbursement in a single tranche shortly after
effectiveness.   Proceeds of the credit would reimburse 1009 of the
foreign exchange costs of eligible imports of public or private sector
origin, except for negative list and imported goods already funded
under bilateral or multilateral credits. The proposed date of
eligibility would be set in light of the Government's preparation of a
deepened austerity program in August 1993. In order to permit timely
disbursements in the amounts needed to keep to program targets, the
full amount of the credit would be eligible for retroactive financing.
August 15, 1993 is proposed as the cut-off date for retroactive
financing.
Environmental Category
In conformity with IDA policies for adjustment operations, no
environmental rating has been assigned. However, the operation would
be consistent with IDA policy and would follow acceptable IDA
procedures.
