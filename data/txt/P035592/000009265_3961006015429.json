Franc Zone decided to devalue their currency, the CFA franc,\n            effective January 12, 1994. By shoring up support for the\n            measures taken in the aftermath of the devaluation, the\n            Economic Recovery Credit Project is a crucial element in\n            helping to deepen the adjustment program the Senegalese\n            Government has been pursuing since August 1993. The previous\n            internal adjustment programs of the 1980s were supported by\n            four Structural Adjustment Credits (SAL I-IV) as well as by\n            the IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). The\n            credit will support the post-devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policies, and, more particularly, the measures aiming\n            at minimizing the negative social impact of the devaluation\n            in the short term. The Government's program has also\n            obtained the support of and IMF Stand-by-arrangement. The\n            Senegalese Government has already taken a series of key\n            macroeconomic and structural measures to regain and\n            consolidate competitiveness. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            (ERC) is designed to support the implementation of these\n            measures in 1994. The main measures are: (i) devaluation of\n            the CFA Franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1 FF; (ii) increase\n            in key producer prices (groundnuts, cotton); (iii) a\n            substantial program of social measures to attenuate the\n            effects of the devaluation on the vulnerable groups; (iv)\n            prudent demand management policies to reduce absorption by\n            the public sector and limit wage increases; (v) reduction\n            and simplification of tariffs and domestic taxation; and\n            (vi) protection of social sector expenditures."}, "docdt": "1994-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
