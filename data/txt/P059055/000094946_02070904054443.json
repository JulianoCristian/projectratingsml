The project did not\n            focus on the issue of sustainability, given the nature of\n            the economic Recovery Credit. Overall, IDA performance is\n            rated satisfactory. Even taking into account the resource\n            constraints and circumstances prevailing in Tajikistan, the\n            overall performance of the Borrower must be rated\n            unsatisfactory. Projects such as this one have to be\n            designed with a great built-in flexibility in order to be\n            able to adequately address unforseeable needs as they evolve\n            from the reconstruction process. Such operations are\n            necessarily more resource intensive than traditional\n            operations and resource allocations for supervision should\n            be made accordingly on a case by case basis. Supervision\n            arrangements should also be tailored to the specific\n            circumstances of the project and provide for a substantially\n            larger involvement of Country Office staff in day-to-day\n            follow up and advisory support. the procurement arrangements\n            adopted for the project provide another example highlighting\n            the potential risks for conflict between IDA requirements\n            and the need for operational flexibility. While rational\n            from a policy point of view, the arrangements proved to be\n            too complex and cumbersome for the limited management\n            capacity of the project implementation unit (RPCU), and\n            rather than preventing mismanagement, opened the door to it.\n            IDA eventually agreed--too late--to revise the procurement arrangements."}, "docdt": "2002-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
