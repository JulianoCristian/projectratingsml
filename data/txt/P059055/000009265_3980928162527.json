The primary objectives are to 1)\n            support Tajikistan's government in its efforts to\n            mitigate the economic and social effects of the floods by\n            immediately repairing or rebuilding essential\n            infrastructure; 2) establish the conditions for a rapid and\n            effective resumption of economic exchanges and growth in the\n            rural areas affected; and 3) help reduce the risk of future\n            occurrence of similar damages. The project has two\n            components. Transport infrastructure provides for the repair\n            or reconstruction of about nine bridges and sections of\n            damaged roads in various regions of the country, including\n            the reconstruction of embankment protections (using\n            labor-intensive work methods) in the proximity of the works\n            implemented to prevent future damage from floods,\n            river-scouring or erosion. Other infrastructure provides for\n            the repair or reconstruction of infrastructure pertaining to\n            the sectors of agriculture (repair of flood protection dikes\n            and irrigation systems), power (repair of small rural\n            hydropower plants and transmission lines); and municipal\n            services (repair of water supply systems)."}, "docdt": "1998-08-03T00:00:00Z"}
