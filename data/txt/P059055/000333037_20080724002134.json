were as follows:\n            outcome was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the projects included: it is important\n            for the Bank to be at a disaster site early, but a false\n            sense of urgency may compromise the quality of what is being\n            constructed. Donor coordination is important not only with\n            respect to damage and needs assessment but also in the\n            transition from the relief to the recovery phase of a\n            disaster. The Bank would be well advised if it involved\n            local specialists in the identification and design o f flood\n            reconstruction projects. Under the EFAP, a Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) was set up under the executive\n            office of the President of the Republic. While in many\n            disaster situations a direct link to the highest levels of\n            power is important, line agencies in Tajikistan may be\n            better equipped for project implementation, given their\n            technical know-how, to provide for medium and long-term\n            rehabilitation needs. A water strategy that integrates flood\n            management with the Tajikistan's irrigation and\n            hydropower needs could prevent future flooding rather than\n            providing only temporary relief."}, "docdt": "2008-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
