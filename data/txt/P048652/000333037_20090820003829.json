were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural\n            countries, education is not only a technical-pedagogical\n            matter; the sociological realities play a defining role on\n            how to move forward. While there is widespread consensus\n            among experts that teaching and learning in a native\n            community language is critical to successful learning\n            achievements in the first years of education, parents in\n            Guatemalan indigenous communities requested that their\n            children be taught in Spanish, since it was perceived as the\n            way to overcome exclusion. In many instances, as expressed\n            by teachers in the schools visited during the Implementation\n            Completion Report (ICR) mission, parents were not convinced\n            of the critical importance of teaching children reading and\n            writing in their native indigenous language. In the process\n            of reforming the education sector, it is advisable to\n            simultaneously tackle several issues. In the case of\n            Guatemala, Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) focused on\n            modernizing the ministry and completing reforms at the\n            central level. This choice allowed substantial institutional\n            progress while diminishing the focus on other areas of the\n            project. Improvements to the multi-grade model started later\n            on during implementation, thus there were cohorts of\n            students who could have benefited from these activities if\n            they will have been initiated simultaneously. The\n            involvement of parents in selecting and hiring the teachers\n            contributed to bringing children to school and keeping them\n            there. Parents knew and therefore trusted the teachers and\n            felt their children were cared for, which contributed to\n            reducing dropouts. A good classification of schools as\n            monolingual, bilingual and/or multi-grade can help to place\n            the school under the appropriate unit within the Ministry of\n            Education; it can help provide the correct textbooks and\n            materials to the teachers and students. In the case of\n            Guatemala, it was observed that there is a serious\n            discrepancy between the profile information listed for\n            schools in the information system and the actual school\n            type. The books found in the schools were not the right ones\n            for the school profile and the linguistic reality of the\n            teachers and students was very different than the one\n            reflected in the system's classification."}, "docdt": "2009-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
