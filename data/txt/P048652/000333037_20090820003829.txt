Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Project had the following development objectives: (i) Improve coverage and equity
at the primary school level through the expansion and consolidation of PRONADE
schools (National Community-managed Program for Education Development) and by
providing scholarships for indigenous girls in rural communities; (ii) Improve the
efficiency and quality of primary education by supporting bilingual education, providing
textbooks and didactic materials in 18 linguistic areas, expanding multi-grade schools and
improving teachers# qualifications; (iii) Facilitate the joint design and execution between
MINEDUC and the Ministry of Culture and Sports (MCS) of a program to enhance the
goals of cultural diversity and pluralism contained in the National Constitution, the
Guatemalan Peace Accords, and the April 2000 National Congress on Cultural Policies;
and (iv) Assist the decentralization and modernization of MINEDUC by supporting the
ongoing efforts to strengthen the organization and management of the education system.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of project preparation, Guatemala's population was mainly rural with indigenous
communities making up the majority (about 48 percent). The nation had, and continues to have, a
great cultural and linguistic diversity. It is multiethnic, pluri-cultural and pluri-lingual, consisting
of Mayas, Ladinos, Xinkas and Garifunas. The economic and social contrasts were substantial,
particularly between urban and rural areas. Many social services, including primary education,
were not accessible to rural and indigenous populations due to cost and other factors. At the time
of Project approval, the average educational attainment for Guatemalans was three years, and less
than two in the least urban departments (Alta Verapaz, Quiche, Huehuetenango and Totonicapán).

The country was transitioning from over 30 years of civil war to a post-conflict society. In
December, 1996, the Peace Accords were signed between the Government of Guatemala (GoG)
and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, marking the beginning of a new national
development agenda that would prioritize the needs of the indigenous and the underserved
populations.

In the immediate aftermath of civil war, Guatemala was characterized by serious poverty and
inequality. The country had one of the highest illiteracy rates in Latin America (29.6 percent in
1999) and was significantly higher in rural areas, especially among women. Education Reform
was acknowledged as crucial to promote peace and equity, as well as improve literacy. Despite
efforts by the Government to expand access to basic education, problems of coverage, equity and
low quality persisted. In that context, the GoG's main strategy focused on: (i) providing universal
coverage for the first six grades; (ii) providing bilingual education; (iii) targeting to indigenous
populations and vulnerable groups and to females to promote gender equity; (iv) introducing
measures to improve quality and efficiency; and (v) institutional and administrative
modernization and decentralization with actions to foster greater community participation.

The Government chose to support the National Community-driven Program for Educational
Development (PRONADE) as the main model through which the expansion of coverage would
be accomplished in rural and isolated communities. PRONADE, supported at the time of
preparation by an ongoing Bank loan, was a community-based model that had been very effective
in increasing access to the first three years of primary education among these isolated
communities. Beginning in 1992 as an innovative pilot program in 19 rural communities, the
program evolved into a national strategy to provide access to educational services in rural,
indigenous and remote areas of the country.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

 The Project was a continuation of the Basic Education Reform Project (SCL-41670, under
implementation at the time of preparation), which supported the Ministry of Education's
(MINEDUC) efforts to achieve universal access to primary schooling; to improve equity and the
quality of education primarily in rural, indigenous areas of Guatemala; and to decentralize and
modernize the education administration system.




                                                  1
The Project had the following development objectives:

   1. Improve coverage and equity at the primary school level through the expansion and
      consolidation of PRONADE schools (National Community-managed Program for
      Education Development) and by providing scholarships for indigenous girls in rural
      communities;
   2. Improve the efficiency and quality of primary education by supporting bilingual
      education, providing textbooks and didactic materials in 18 linguistic areas, expanding
      multi-grade schools and improving teachers' qualifications;
   3. Facilitate the joint design and execution between MINEDUC and the Ministry of Culture
      and Sports (MCS) of a program to enhance the goals of cultural diversity and pluralism
      contained in the National Constitution, the Guatemalan Peace Accords, and the April
      2000 National Congress on Cultural Policies; and
   4. Assist the decentralization and modernization of MINEDUC by supporting the ongoing
      efforts to strengthen the organization and management of the education system.

The Project had the following key performance indicators:

Improve Coverage and Equity

       Increase coverage of rural primary enrollment in PRONADE schools from 24 to 27
       percent. (An additional 40,000 new rural students would be enrolled through the
       expansion of the PRONADE program.)
       Increase girls' primary school enrollment in poor, indigenous areas to reach 46 percent by
       the end of the Project due to quality enhancement, as well as coverage improvement.

Improve Equity and Efficiency

       Approximately 708,900 primary school children in indigenous communities are using
       new Math and cultural textbooks printed in their own native language (covering 18
       linguistics areas and reaching 3,300 classroom libraries in rural, indigenous areas).
       Approximately 2,000 new PRONADE teachers selected and appointed by the
       COEDUCAs (parent-school boards) and 3,500 non-PRONADE teachers are applying
       new teaching methodologies for multi-grade and bilingual education in the classroom.

Cultural Diversity and Pluralism

       Strengthen the policy framework and institutional capacity of MCS to coordinate
       activities with MINEDUC and other government institutions, particularly in promotion of
       multicultural and inter-cultural policies and programs within a framework of sustainable
       human development
       Design and implement four pilot programs that de-concentrate MCS cultural education
       services (including arts and sports education) to the municipal level, carried out in
       collaboration with local MINEDUC programs
       Design and implement a National Cultural Resources Information System (NCRIS) to
       include the modernization of the current cultural resource information systems within
       MCS; improved services to local museums, libraries and other cultural institutions; and
       establishment of a computerized contemporary cultural resource database .




                                               2
Decentralization and Modernization of MINEDUC

        Train staff at the central, departmental and pilot municipal levels and implement
        decentralization and de-concentration policies
        Strengthen the Educational Training and Development Department with qualified human
        resources at both the central and local levels--the Department would implement
        MINEDUC's new policies of multi-grade and bilingual education
        Design and implement the multimedia communication strategy for supporting
        MINEDUC activities, to reach Ministry employees at all levels, as well as communities,
        parents, teachers and students, specifically in targeted areas of the Project
        Upgrade the Education Management Information System (EMIS) and use the new
        applications and technology as a tool for uniform educational monitoring, feedback,
        reporting and decision making by departments.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

 The PDOs were not revised during the life of the Project. The key performance indicators
remained unchanged as well.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The Project identified the following beneficiaries:

        Around 40,000 children in poor, isolated, rural, and mostly indigenous, communities
        without a school, benefitting from the opening of PRONADE schools;
        Approximately 50,000 rural, indigenous girls who were not enrolled in school, or were in
        first grade or at risk of dropping out of school;
        3,500 teachers who were to receive training on issues related to bilingual intercultural
        education and multi-grade techniques;
        99,000 students in 3,300 rural schools, using the books in the school library;
        Municipalities, community representatives, residents, school teachers and education
        sector personnel would benefit from the pilot projects to de-concentrate the cultural
        educational services provided by MCS;
        About 1,300 communities would benefit from the creation of the COEDUCAs;
        All managers and administrative staff at the central and departmental levels (400 people);
        and
        Bilingual education staff at the central and departmental levels that were to receive on-
        the-job training to improve their capacity to administer and manage the bilingual
        education program.

1.5 Original Components

The Project contained four main components:

Component 1 ­ Universalization of Primary Education (Total Project Cost at Appraisal:
US$40.28 million). This component sought to continue to support the Government's efforts to
ensure universal access to primary education. It had two sub-components: (i) expansion of
enrollment capacity of primary schools in rural areas and marginalized communities through the
PRONADE program; and (ii) provision of scholarships for children of poor, rural families.


                                                 3
Component 2 ­ Improving the Quality of Education (Total Project Cost at Appraisal:
US$25.43 million). This component focused on improving the quality and efficiency of primary
education. It had three sub-components: (i) strengthening multi-grade strategies and bilingual
education primarily in rural communities; (ii) provision of educational materials (textbooks and
student guides) for monolingual and bilingual children; and (iii) training of teachers in multi-
grade methodologies and content areas, as well as the development of curricula for bilingual
schools.

Component 3 ­ Cultural Diversity and Pluralism (Total Project Cost at Appraisal: US$2.3
million). This component sought to support the institutional strengthening of MCS to coordinate
more effectively with MINEDUC and other government agencies. It included three sub-
components: (i) institutional strengthening of MCS, including the establishment of a Policy and
Planning unit and the preparation of a National Cultural Development Plan, in coordination with
MINEDUC and other agencies; (ii) de-concentration of MCS' cultural education services to the
municipal level; and (iii) development of the National Cultural Resources Information System
(NCRIS) to include the modernization of the existing MCS cultural resources information system,
provision of information to museums and libraries and establishment of a cultural resources
database on the diverse ethnic and linguistic groups of Guatemala.

Component 4 ­ Decentralization and Modernization (Total Project Cost at Appraisal:
US$13.87 million). The component would continue to support: (i) improving the managerial and
administrative capacity of the Ministry of Education, decentralization at the departmental and
local levels, with a special emphasis on the General Directorate for Bilingual Education
(DIGEBI); (ii) training of community associations (COEDUCAs) to manage and organize
PRONADE schools; and (iii) continued development and updating of an Education Management
Information System (EMIS).

1.6 Revised Components

The Project's components were not changed during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

While there were no changes in the basic design of the Project, the change of Government after
the 2003 elections resulted in some adjustments to Project activities. Over the first few months
after taking office in January 2004, the new administration focused on integrating its main
strategies for the education sector into the Project, in harmony with the PDO. The new
administration emphasized continuing the efforts towards reforming the education sector,
restructuring the ministry and modernizing its administration, strengthening participation and
improving the technical capacity of staff.

In Component 1, a pilot program known as the itinerant teacher program was put in place in 2004
to enable the creation of PRONADE schools in small communities with low enrollment. The
program allowed two communities with a reduced number of students to share a teacher. When
the teacher was at one of the communities, he/she left an assistant who could be a member of the
community or a member of the school council, in charge of the school. The pilot project was
carried out in 10 communities with counterpart funds and it lasted until Project completion.




                                               4
Change in the girls' scholarship program. The PAD foresaw that scholarships would be
awarded and managed under PRONADE by the parent school boards (COEDUCAs). This was
the case for the first year of implementation, when 14,000 scholarships were awarded and
financed with loan resources. In February 2004, the new administration decided to bring the girls'
scholarship program under the existing scholarship program in MINEDUC and finance them with
national budget funds. This freed up loan resources, which were then re-allocated to other Project
activities. The Bank and MINEDUC agreed the Project would provide technical assistance to
strengthen the scholarship unit and system in MINEDUC. The Project contributed to the
elaboration of a system to better target recipients in geographical areas with more vulnerable
populations, which included indigenous girls in rural areas.

In 2004, a pilot for distance secondary education (Telesecundaria or video-supported teaching),
was introduced in eight communities to address the need of students in rural and remote areas to
access secondary education. This pilot experience laid the ground for the Education Quality and
Secondary Education Project (Loan No. 7052-GU).

The new administration, taking office in January 2008, decided to institutionalize PRONADE.
PRONADE schools were to become part of the regular school system, but because 2008 was a
transition year, the process to absorb PRONADE teachers by the regular school system took place
during 2008 and 2009. Initially PRONADE teachers were hired under temporary contracts, and
then MINEDUC opened a competitive process to hire PRONADE teachers as regular teachers.
This process was about to be completed by the time of this ICR. The COEDUCAs were
converted into Juntas Escolares, school boards in traditional rural schools.

In line with the PDO, some new activities were introduced under Component 2 though the core of
the component remained as designed (rural areas and indigenous population focus; support for
bilingual education; support for multi-grade education and support for PRONADE). These were:
(i) a program focused on first grade (Salvemos el Primer Grado) was introduced to bring new
teaching methodologies to the classroom in language, communication and mathematics. The
focus was to improve student learning outcomes. The Project supported workshops for 1st grade
teachers and educational materials; (ii) pre-primary teachers in bilingual rural schools were
included in training activities, provision of classroom libraries and learning materials. Training
was provided to 1,900 teachers in bilingual schools and to 42 teacher trainers; and (iii) workshops
on intercultural bilingual education in 12 departments led by DIGEBI were carried out to
encourage more parent involvement and greater awareness on bilingual education issues. The
Government and the Bank agreed to focus the revisions of the teaching and learning materials on
four of the Mayan languages, aiming to cover over 80 percent of the indigenous population. This
decision was based on the need to prioritize and better achieve the PDO.

The new administration taking office in 2004 had a different vision and priorities (as expressed in
its Education Sector Management Strategy) than its predecessor, which caused Component 4 to
gain greater relative weight and importance in during project implementation. More resources
were allocated to the development of activities related to modernizing MINEDUC and its
administration. The component was originally designed around several inputs: training
MINEDUC personnel, information campaigns, and upgrade of the information system. The inputs
were maintained but framed into a strategic framework for institutional strengthening around the
following sub-systems: (i) leadership and strategic planning; (ii) decentralization and school
based management; (iii) results based management and (iv) human resources. The new
administration placed greater emphasis on strengthening the central level, believing a
strengthened core would allow for a gradual focus shift to the departmental and local levels.



                                                5
The Project's original closing date of April 30 2006 was extended twice, first to December 31,
2007 and then to December 31, 2008 so as to allow for sufficient implementation time for Project
activities to achieve the Project's development objectives.

The Loan was fully disbursed by Project completion. The Borrower's contribution was higher
than foreseen in the PAD (US$25.71 million versus US$20.34 million in the PAD). Total Project
cost reached US$87.86 million against an estimated US$82.50 million at the time of appraisal.

There were two reallocations of Loan proceeds. The first one took place in May 2003, as the
Government requested a reallocation of funds from Category 8 (Unallocated) to Categories 1 - 5
of the Loan Agreement. In January 2008, there was a second reallocation of loan resources: a
total of US$3.0 million from Category 2 (Goods) and US$ 3.39 million from Category 4
(Scholarships) were allocated to Category 4 (Consultant Services, Training, Fellowships,
Communication Campaigns, Research and Audits). This change resulted from the Government's
decision to finance the girls' scholarship program with national budget resources. The purpose of
the reallocation was to finance the implementation of Component 4; there was no change in the
scope of the Project and there were no Project cost savings. At the moment of request (December
2007), Components 1 and 2 had surpassed the targets set in the PAD, while Components 3 and 4
had not yet reached the set targets. The Borrower wanted to put emphasis on certain activities
before Loan closing, such as the Human Resource Management System, MINEDUC's Quality
Management System, teacher training and strengthening of the DIGEBI.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The following factors determined this rating:

The Project was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS- R98-175,175/2)
approved for the country. The CAS proposed to focus on education to achieve improved delivery
of basic social services and fulfill the commitments of the Peace Accords. The CAS expressed the
support of the Bank to continue the implementation of the on-going Basic Education Reform
Project, which supported the expansion of coverage in rural areas implemented by community-
managed schools and the continuation of this practice through this Project.

Solid preparatory work. The Government and the Bank had previously prepared and
implemented two basic education projects and a third one, the Basic Education Reform Project
(Loan N.7430-GT), was under implementation at the time of project preparation. Economic and
sector work was carried out during preparation, as well as different assessments of the Borrower's
capacity to implement the Project. Additionally, the Government undertook analytical work in
several program areas, such as multi-grade methodologies, PRONADE and learning materials,
among others.

Lessons learned from previous projects were taken into account for Project design. The
team focused on the lessons learned from the Basic Education Reform Project, under
implementation at the time. Lessons learned from the implementation of the PRONADE
component were incorporated into this Project, reinforcing the empowerment of communities as
an element of successful implementation.




                                                 6
The PAD attempted to provide a realistic analysis of the main risks affecting project
implementation. The availability of budget resources for counterpart funds and sustained
Government support for the main activities and programs supported by the Project were
highlighted in the PAD. The risk of not allocating enough government resources for PRONADE
to achieve its targets was rated as substantial. The PAD did not contemplate the scenario whereby
PRONADE would become institutionalized and streamlined within MINEDUC with a
reallocation PRONADE functions to different units within the Ministry.

Though PRONADE has been politicized since its inception, there was strong MINEDUC
commitment to the program during preparation. During the preparation period, Congress
debated the budget allocated to PRONADE and cuts to its budget were enforced, as indicated in
the PAD assessment of risks to the Project's activities. The budget cuts were due to in-country
political discussions and negotiations. It was generally perceived that the NGOs (Instituciones de
Servicios Educativos - ISEs) implementing some PRONADE activities were favoring certain
constituencies in the private sector and had affinities to one of the political parties. PRONADE
had been created by a government decree, not by a law approved by Congress, which placed that
program more as government policy rather than a national one. Therefore, while PRONADE
underwent a weakening of support during 2000, the program recovered support as the main
government model to deliver educational services to the most isolated and rural communities.
During preparation in 2001, the Minister of Education confirmed support for the program and
stated that it would continue to be the program of choice to expand enrollment in primary
education.

At the same time, preparation included the following:

Lack of baseline for the Project indicators at the time of approval. While both the
Government and Bank teams established very specific targets for outcome and output indicators,
the PAD did not include baseline measurements. This was partly due to the quality and reliability
of data available from MINEDUC at the time of preparation. As the information technology unit
in MINEDUC was strengthened and the EMIS upgraded during project implementation, an effort
was made to better define a baseline.

The indicators proposed to measure the PDOs were output indicators. This decision was
based ­ as mentioned above ­ on the quality and availability of information at the time of
preparation. While this choice facilitated monitoring the progress towards achieving the targets
set, the indicators proposed were not adequate to measure improvements in quality or efficiency
later on, at Project completion.

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation was Satisfactory, despite challenges encountered during implementation.

Delay in Project approval. Project implementation was affected by a delay of more than a year
in Project approval by the Guatemalan Congress. The Loan became effective in November, 2002
(18 months after Bank approval). Disbursements in the first year were delayed by six months,
which set the actual implementation lag to 18 months. After this initial delay, project activities
started strong in 2003 and implementation moved at a more brisk pace until Project completion.
Such was the case of PRONADE, which surpassed the targets set in the PAD for the first year of
implementation with 700 schools opened and 45,000 children reached.




                                                7
Change in Government led to intense dialogue with the Bank and alignment of the PDOs
with the Government sector development priorities. As a result of the 2003 elections, the
Government and the Bank worked closely to integrate the main features and elements of the new
education sector plan into the Project. The Government sector plan was viewed as coherent with
the PDO, focusing on the same groups of the population originally targeted by the Project.

Focus on the transformation and modernization of MINEDUC. The incoming administration
prioritized modernizing MINEDUC, aiming to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity
of the Ministry to better address the educational challenges of the country. It centered its efforts
on improving the Ministry first at the central level and then at the departmental level and so on.
Significant progress was achieved at the central level (in human resource management,
information systems, etc), sequentially reaching departmental offices, and then schools.

Strong support from the Minister of Education to PRONADE. The Minister of Education of
the 2004 incoming administration strongly supported the continuation of this program as the main
vehicle to expand access to schooling in rural and isolated areas. The Minister appointed a former
PRONADE director as Vice-Minister and a qualified director to lead PRONADE during her
tenure as Minister. In 2004, the new administration requested an evaluation of PRONADE to
better understand the perception of the program among the different stakeholders. The evaluation
showed that while communities valued the program, stakeholders were not properly informed
about its characteristics, its main features, and operation procedures, which had created a number
of myths about the program among stakeholders. The findings of the evaluation contributed to
shape MINEDUC's efforts to communicate information about this program to stakeholders.

PRONADE's controversial nature. In 1996, MINEDUC and the Commission of the Peace
Accords chose PRONADE, which was created in 1992 and inspired by other community-based
education programs in the region, to accomplish the objectives of these accords. Before Project
implementation started in 2001 and later during its initial implementation stages in 2003, the
program experienced moments of crisis. The administration, pressured by teachers unions,
promised to transform PRONADE schools into traditional schools, suspending teacher training
for PRONADE teachers. Shortly thereafter, after protests by PRONADE teachers, the President
promised to transform regular schools into PRONADE schools, which damaged the perception of
the program by stakeholders. The information campaigns carried out by MINEDUC contributed
to a better understanding of PRONADE and increased support among its main beneficiaries.

As was the case in other countries in the region, there was reluctance by certain stakeholders to
the creation of PRONADE schools during implementation. Regular teachers were suspicious of
the different hiring process for PRONADE teachers, and PRONADE teachers requested to be
granted similar benefits to regular teachers. PRONADE had some distinct characteristics as a
community-based management program: (i) teachers working in PRONADE schools were
graduated teachers (this is not always the case in similar programs in other countries); (ii)
participation of NGOs (Instituciones de Servicios Educativos- ISEs) in delivering training to the
parent-run school committees (COEDUCAs ­ Comité Educativo de Autogestión Educativa) and
(iii) a softer sense of community participation, not as strongly rooted from the bottom up in
Guatemala as in other countries in the region.

As mentioned in section 1.7, the Government elected in 2007 decided to institutionalize
PRONADE and transform the schools into regular schools. This decision was effective in January
2008, which was a transition year. MINEDUC assigned the functions of the PRONADE unit to
different directorates: DIGEPSA was to assume the tasks of community support; DIGEFOCE
would assume matters related to school boards; and DIGEACE would assume tasks related to


                                                 8
school planning and quality. The COEDUCAs were transformed into Juntas Escolares, which
already existed in regular schools. COEDUCAs were no longer responsible for teacher hiring,
firing or monitoring attendance. MINEDUC also initiated a reclassification of PRONADE
teachers. Initially these teachers remained in their positions with temporary contracts and then
later in 2008, MINEDUC launched the competitive process to complete their transformation to
regular teachers. The process was underway by ICR preparation.

Complexity of Bilingual Education issues. Parents in indigenous communities requested that
their children be taught in Spanish, as it was perceived as the way to overcome exclusion. In
many instances, as expressed by teachers in the schools visited during the ICR mission, parents
were not convinced of the critical importance of teaching children to read and write in their native
indigenous language.

Coordination challenges in the provision of training and distribution of teaching materials.
Coordinating the timely provision of books and teaching materials with the teacher training
sessions was challenging. The teacher guides for multi-grade schools were distributed in 2007,
not always on time for training sessions nor in sufficient quantities. The training sessions were
highly valued by teachers, who expressed their need to be further supported by MINEDUC
supervisors to follow up on what was taught.

Teacher strikes affected Project implementation. Teacher strikes took place in 2003 and again
in 2007. Strikes affected Project implementation initially, particularly the teacher training
sessions on multi-grade methodologies in 2007.

Focus on implementation of the Multi-grade subcomponent for mono and bilingual schools
after mid-term review. The Government focused on increasing enrollment through PRONADE
and on modernizing MINEDUC in the first years of implementation. During 2004, only a few
multi-grade program activities were carried out, such as re-printing of existing guides for first and
second grades. After the mid-term review however, the Government and the Bank focused on the
implementation of these activities to comply with the agreed upon commitments in this program
area.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

The Project dedicated a subcomponent to continue strengthening the education information
management system (EMIS). MINEDUC, with Bank support, had been steadily improving both
the hardware and software of the existing EMIS, along with the networks, servers, data collection,
and statistical analysis. During design, the Project focused on furthering these improvements,
especially on advancing the quality of the data gathered and analyzed; training staff in charge of
data gathering and analysis, and supporting the decentralization to both the departmental and
local levels.

The PAD foresaw monitoring the progress towards achievement of the PDOs through: (i) the
Project's progress reports to be prepared by the PCU; (ii) supervision missions; (iii) statistics
regularly produced by MINEDUC and, in particular, statistics produced by PRONADE and the
Department in charge of monitoring the education quality.




                                                 9
M&E Implementation and Utilization

The Project contributed to strengthening monitoring and evaluation by supporting the three
Directorates related to education information: The Directorate of Information Technology
(Dirección General de Informática- DINFO), the Education Planning Directorate (Dirección
General de Planeación Educativa - DIPLAN) and the General Directorate for Education
Evaluation and Research (Dirección General de Evaluación e Investigación Educativa ­
DIGEDUCA).

DINFO, started as a unit in 2003 with support from the Project, became a directorate in 2006 and
was further strengthened to gather and produce education data for other departments over the life
of the Project. DINFO was technologically well-equipped and worked in real time with the
educational information communication department. Over the life of the Project, there was a
change in culture within MINEDUC due to the use of technology and the training of Ministry
staff. At the departmental level, education data was made available online, though this practice
had not yet been adopted at the municipal level. Nevertheless, data gathered at the municipal
level and generated by PRONADE was made available to the education system in electronic form.

Since DIPLAN is the primary user of the EMIS, which is generated by DINFO, DIPLAN
personnel received training on data management. The EMIS is using a technological platform that
allows for the unification and cross-checking of existing databases. Thus, the quality of data had
improved by Project completion. Though data is still manually captured at the school level, the
gathering process has improved due to training of teachers, supervisors, and decentralized
MINEDUC personnel and the electronic capture of the hand-filled forms. Data is also reviewed
and "cleaned" twice a year, once when school begins and again when it ends.

MINEDUC maintains a public website that includes an annual statistical digest, from 1996 to
2007 and provides information on enrollment, repetition, dropout rates, etc. Though there are
some shortcomings (rural data is not always available since the information comes from the
National Statistics Unit-INE), the overall EMIS is adequate and used to some extent to inform
decision-making within MINEDUC.

DIGEDUCA, created in 2007, hosts the National Education Evaluation and Research System
(SINEIE), which gathers information on learning achievements and teacher performance. The
first phase of the system's design started in 2005, followed by the second phase in 2006. Since
2005, the SINEIE has carried out several evaluations: (i) census based Language and
Mathematics for 3rd grade in 2006 and 2007; sample based evaluation for Language and
Mathematics for 1st, 3rd and 6th grades in 2006, 2007 and 2008; (ii) evaluation of teachers aspiring
to become bilingual teachers in 2006, 2007 and 2008; and (iii) participation in international
evaluations. Though there were evaluations since 1998, the evaluation system as it exists today
was established in 2005. Since then, the evaluations carried out allow the comparison of learning
achievements, and their contents are based on the national curriculum and standards. In 2008, the
tests were revised against newly-defined standards and competencies. In 2008, the tests were
taken in the 19 Mayan languages for reading comprehension as well. The 2006 evaluation results
for the primary level have been released and the results for 2007 were partially available at the
time of ICR preparation.

The PCU regularly monitored Project achievements and reported on these to the Bank. Though
slowly benefiting from an improved EMIS, monitoring reports were weak in providing analysis to
realistically assess the progress towards PDOs. By Project completion, some challenges remained
regarding the generated data. These challenges were related to the need to continue cleaning up


                                                10
information, to accurately generate a classification of schools in the system that reflected the real
linguistic profile of the school and to use the information in the EMIS to inform MINEDUC
policies and strategies. There were six external evaluations of the Project's activities carried out
before completion (see Annex 9: List of Project Documents). The external evaluation on
PRONADE activities was not completed, even though data on the schools' performance was
captured in the 2006-2008 evaluations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project was given a Category C for environmental policy. The Project supported the
extension of the MINEDUC building as foreseen in the PAD, which resulted in the construction
of a new building. In hindsight, the Project should have been given a Category B for
environmental policy.

At the same time, the Indigenous People and Cultural Property safeguard was triggered under the
Project and the Bank team placed particular emphasis on compliance during Project design. The
Project was considered an indigenous project at the time of preparation so it did not include a
specific Indigenous Peoples Development Plan in the PAD. Component 1 concentrated on rural
and indigenous areas, seeking participation of rural parents, and on targeting indigenous girls in
rural communities for scholarships. Component 2 included indigenous communities as part of the
quality improvement efforts. The project design considered the lessons learned from the previous
project on how to target poor indigenous communities in Guatemala. The Project reached the
multilingual and indigenous communities in the rural areas of the country, achieving many of its
targets. The Vice Ministry for Bilingual and Intercultural Education was supported through the
Project, achieving improvements in institutional strengthening, while still facing challenges to
implement the bilingual education strategic plan and to function more effectively. The Project's
supervision team included an indigenous peoples specialist.

Procurement and Financial Management Issues. Procurement was rated as satisfactory for
almost the entire life of the Project. In 2007, procurement was rated as moderately satisfactory
due to weaknesses in internal controls identified by an annual Bank ex-post evaluation of Project
activities carried out during 2007. The PCU worked on improving its internal controls,
particularly in regard to the identification and evaluation of individual consultancies. A post-
review report, carried out in 2008, showed that the PCU had followed up on the observations
expressed by the Bank in 2007 and recommended to upgrade the status of the Project's
procurement to satisfactory. The review report concluded that the PCU had mostly complied with
the Bank's procurement procedures and it had complied with the Loan Agreement. There were no
outstanding procurement issues at completion. Regarding financial management, the reviews
carried out showed satisfactory results. The annual external audits did not raise qualifications.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Under the Government, which took office early in 2008, there has been continuity in the
modernization of MINEDUC, advancing the process of administrative procedures (ISO 9000)
accreditation to include other departments, and deepening the process within MINEDUC. The
directorates that were created or upgraded during the Project --DINFO and evaluations at
DIGEDUCA-- have seen a portion of their national budgetary resources increase, promoting the
institutionalization of activities supported under the Project. There has been further progress in
improving the EMIS with revision and fine-tuning of data, with the goal of using the generated
data to inform policy decisions.


                                                 11
The Bank is currently implementing the Secondary Education Project (Loan No. 7430-GU; see
section 2.1), which includes lessons and elements drawn from this Project. The follow up
operation continued the video-education pilot (Telesecundaria) and focused on addressing the
problem of lack of access to secondary education by students completing primary education. The
follow-up project continues to support improvements to the EMIS and expansion of its use within
all levels of MINEDUC.

As mentioned in sections 1.7 and 2.2 of this document, effective in January 2008, PRONADE
was streamlined into the regular basic education system. The functions of the PRONADE unit
were meant to be absorbed by different departments within MINEDUC. A strengthened ministry
opted for the integration of this program into the regular school system. PRONADE teachers
were being incorporated into the official teaching force by a merit competition system. The
salaries of PRONADE teachers are expected to be paid by the national budget under the same
budget line as regular teachers. MINEDUC was in the process of selecting and appointing
teachers to these former PRONADE positions at the time of ICR preparation. There have been
delays paying teachers working on PRONADE schools during the last few months during which
contracts were done month to month, until the conversion of the teachers' status was to be
concluded.

The COEDUCAs were transformed into Juntas Escolares, which existed in regular schools. This
means that parents will not have the responsibility to hire or fire teachers and monitor teachers'
attendance. MINEDUC's budget is expected to cover expenses for the schools in 2009: feeding,
school materials, books, etc, contributing to the sustainability of all of these achievements in the
medium term. While it is still early to assess the effects of such a change, there are aspects that
should be followed up on in the future, including teacher stability, the participation of parents and
communities in the schools, teachers' accountability, etc (see section 4 ­ Assessment of Risk to
Development Outcome).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the Project's development objective was high at the time of preparation and
remains high today, as expressed in the latest CAS of August 2008. The Project strove to expand
the coverage of basic education in rural and isolated areas through the expansion of the
PRONADE program and through the allocation of scholarships to rural and indigenous girls. The
Project focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of in-
service training to teachers and of learning materials, furniture and textbooks to schools, as well
as a revision of the multi-grade methodology. Finally, the Project strongly supported
strengthening MINEDUC at the central and departmental levels. These objectives were in line
with the Government's priorities at the time of the Project design and were in line with the core of
the program of the new administration taking office in 2002. These objectives continue to be a
priority for the Government that took office in January 2008. However differences exist in the
strategies to achieve similar objectives, the degree of decentralization at school level or of
participating parents and communities.

Project design was relevant, identifying activities that responded to the needs of Guatemala's
education sector and considering relevant experience ­ gathered through the implementation of
previous projects ­ in Guatemala and in other Central American countries.



                                                 12
Project implementation was initially delayed but moved quickly once the Project was approved.
Implementation was influenced by the need to introduce changes in 2004 to incorporate the new
Government's views and strategies for the education sector, which the Bank team did in a flexible
way. Since the Project was well designed and there was consensus on its objectives, the changes
allowed the Bank to better match the Project to the incoming administration's strategic direction
for the sector. Implementation of the multi-grade activities lagged behind other subcomponents
but the Bank and the Borrower dedicated significant efforts after the mid-term review to move its
implementation forward. There was never a need to amend the Loan Agreement, due to this
consistency. This is particularly important in a context where the Project was implemented under
three different administrations.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PAD set clear targets and values to measure the achievement of the PDOs. At the same time,
as previously mentioned, the PAD lists output indicators to measure the PDOs, rather than
outcome indicators as it would have been appropriate. As indicated in section 2.1, the reason for
this seems to have been the unavailability of quality data at the time of preparation. It should be
noted, however, that this choice of indicators is not unusual for education projects prepared at
around the period this one was prepared.

Improve coverage and equity at primary school level. The Project sought to ensure universal
access to primary education in Guatemala. The outcome indicator for this goal was to increase
enrollment in PRONADE schools from 24 to 27 percent, which required the enrollment of about
40,000 new rural students in PRONADE schools by Project completion. A total of 1,302 new
PRONADE schools were created with Project support, and a total of 90,380 new students were
enrolled in these schools, clearly surpassing the Project's goals. Based on MINEDUC data, in
2007 enrollment in PRONADE schools represented 24 percent of total rural enrollment in
primary schools (391,181 students in PRONADE schools, 1,629,645 in rural primary). In 2002,
rural PRONADE enrollment was 18.4 percent of total rural enrollment. In 2007, PRONADE
schools represented 26 percent of primary schools, 45 percent of multi-grade schools and had
18.6 percent of all primary students enrolled.

Net coverage for primary education increased from 84 percent in 1999 to 95.02 percent 2007.
Regarding pre-primary, net coverage went from 33.0 percent in 1999 to 48.21 percent.1

The outcome indicator for the goal of improving equity was to increase the enrollment rate for
girls in poor, indigenous areas to 46 percent by Project end. This goal was reached and by Project
completion girls' enrollment rate in poor indigenous areas increased from 37.5 percent in 2001 to
46 percent in 2008. The PAD envisaged awarding 50,000 scholarships to girls. By Project
completion, a total of 265,666 scholarships had been awarded to rural girls and the program was
institutionalized and financed by national budget resources. Loan proceeds financed 14,000
scholarships during the first year of implementation and the COEDUCAs managed them. As
previously stated, the Government decided to incorporate the girls' scholarship program into
MINEDUC's existing scholarship program after the first year of implementation and assumed full

                                                13
financing for it. The Project supported the elaboration of a scholarship manual and the
improvement of the database and selection and awarding criteria for the program.

Improve efficiency and quality of primary education. The Project sought to achieve this goal
by supporting bilingual education, providing textbooks and didactic materials in 18 linguistic
areas, by expanding multi-grade schools and by improving teachers' qualifications. The PAD set
output indicators to measure Project achievements. The Project aimed to have 790,800 students in
indigenous communities using new education materials elaborated with Project support and to
distribute 3,300 libraries in rural indigenous areas. By Project completion: (i) 3,300 classroom
libraries for multi-grade schools had been distributed; (ii) Math and Cultural textbooks in Spanish
for grades 1 to 6 and Math and Science and Technology textbooks for 4th, 5th and 6th grades in
four Mayan languages had been distributed (almost 8 million books); and (iii) over 2 million
multi-grade student guides were printed and another 2.78 million guides were re-printed, reaching
around 944,000 primary school students in rural and indigenous areas.

The bilingual textbooks were elaborated in four Mayan languages, covering approximately 85
percent of the indigenous population. The Borrower chose to concentrate the production of the
educational materials on these four, proceeding gradually given the capacity of DIGEBI. Despite
this accomplishment, the ICR mission identified several areas of concern: (i) the adequate display
of books in the classrooms; (ii) the use of the bilingual books and the multi-grade grade guides by
students and teachers in the classrooms; (iii) the distribution of books to schools to make sure that
the right books would get to the right schools (multi-grade books for multi-grade schools); (iii)
the classification of schools as monolingual or bilingual, which is based on the administrative
classification of the teacher's position versus the linguistic reality of the student community, to
provide the adequate support, training and materials to teachers and students.

The PAD aimed to have 2,200 teachers selected and hired by COEDUCAs. By Project closing, a
total of 3,061 teachers had been selected and hired by the COEDUCAs. The COEDUCAs paid
their salaries and controlled their attendance as well. The Project aimed to have a total of 3,500
non-PRONADE teachers trained and applying new teaching methodologies for bilingual and
multi-grade education. The number of teachers trained was about 14,200. Teacher training was
highly valued by teachers. During the ICR mission, teachers expressed their need for pedagogical
support from supervisors, considered critical to help them implement the new teaching
methodologies in the classroom. Since the training had taken place late in implementation in 2007,
MINEDUC did not have an opportunity to implement the support and follow up in schools.

Though the PAD did not include efficiency indicators to measure the impact of project activities,
the ICR team looked to the extent possible, into available data for improvements in quality and
efficiency by Project completion, focusing on PRONADE and comparing it to other rural schools.
(see Annex 10). Given the limitations due to lack of a baseline and data comparability, one could
conclude that there is lack of sufficient data to determine if PRONADE schools had an impact on
student repetition and dropout rates, as compared to non-PRONADE schools. Available data
shows that repetition rates were comparable to non-PRONADE schools in third and sixth grades,
while drop-out rates were lower among PRONADE students. At the same time, given that
PRONADE students tended to come from more disadvantaged backgrounds, simply maintaining
indicators aligned with the national average may be an achievement in itself.



In terms of student achievement, as measured by DIGEDUCA, urban students outperform rural
ones, who also outperform PRONADE students. Nonetheless, the available data indicates a


                                                 14
significant improvement in PRONADE student performance in the area of mathematics and
closing the gap with non-PRONADE rural students in the area of reading.

Overall for the period 1999-2007, the repetition rate for primary evolved from 17.9 percent to
15.8 percent while the dropout rate went from 10.40 percent to 5.49 percent.2

Facilitate the joint design and execution between MINEDUC and the Ministry of Culture
and Sports (MCS) of a program to enhance the goals of cultural diversity and pluralism.
The Project was successful in reaching the targets and outcomes it set in the PAD: (i) the policy
framework and institutional capacity of MCS was strengthened making it better prepared to
coordinate activities with MINEDUC and other actors and institutions, in particular regarding
multi-cultural and inter-cultural policies and programs. By Project completion, the Policy and
Planning unit of MCS was up and running and a National Cultural Development Plan (NCDP)
had been developed. The Project contributed to a review of the existing legal and normative
framework and the production of a set of recommendations for change, which were underway by
the end of implementation; (ii) six pilot experiences to de-concentrate MCS cultural education
services to the municipal level were designed, implemented and carried out with MINEDUC; and
(iii) a National Cultural Resources Information System (NCRIS) was designed with Project
support and it contributed to the upgrading of the existing system in MCS. By Project completion,
an internet cultural information portal had been designed and was operational, fulfilling the goal
of providing wider and better services to local museums, libraries and other cultural institutions.

Facilitate the decentralization and modernization of MINEDUC. The Project achieved the
targets set in the PAD for the agreed development outcome. The new administration adjusted the
activities designed in the PAD to better reach these outcome indicators in the context of their
strategic plan. It focused the Project on improving MINEDUC's systems in terms of quality and
accountability. The main achievements were:

        Increased focus on improving processes, quality and accountability within MINEDUC,
        starting at the central level, and the creation of a unit to manage and audit administrative
        processes (Unidad de Gestion de Calidad y Auditoria de Procesos which became a
        Directorate ­ Dirección de Desarrollo y Fortalecimiento Institucional). This contributed
        to the improvement of key processes: human resource and administration of personnel,
        acquisitions, inventories, general internal services, technology, communication and
        outreach to the public at the central and some departmental levels.
        Progress towards decentralization of MINEDUC included several products: a diagnostic
        of the organizational structure; plan to restructure the different departments with
        personnel profiles; the elaboration of a strategic operational plan for the departments;
        elaboration of a training plan for their personnel; and an elaboration of a plan to
        strengthen the supervision system.
        Institutionalization of DINFO: This was key in the modernization of MINEDUC. This
        directorate provides communication and technical support for the different units within
        the Ministry and develops applications and process data for other departments. By Project
        completion, it was staffed with 48 well-qualified personnel and it had experienced an
        upgrade in the communication infrastructure: all 22 departmental offices were connected,

        as well as 93 municipalities and 4 metropolitan offices. It offered internet services, email,
        anti-virus, and access to several applications through intranet. The Project also supported
        an upgrade to the hardware and the development of over 60 applications, such as contract
        administrations related to educational statistics, internal document management, etc.
        Placing of the educational statistics into the Educational Planning Directorate in May
        2006.
        Strengthening the Human Resource System: with Project support, it was possible to
        strengthen the management of the system by better organization, systematization, use of
        technology and de-concentration of administrative processes related to personnel. These
        were: hiring, selection, training, reallocation, remuneration, assessment and evaluation
        and disciplinary processes.
        Infrastructure census of schools using a geo-referenced system.

The main achievements were implemented at the central level, and then trickled down to the
departmental level. There was gradual progress towards decentralization. By project completion,
some challenges remained: (i) the need to follow up with staff after training to support the
consistent application of decentralization policies; (ii) the need to continue the strengthening of
DIGEBI to achieve the implementation of bilingual and multi-grade grade policies; and (iii) the
need to deepen the improvement of the EMIS to get good quality and reliable data and to support
its use for monitoring, providing feedback and decision making.

3.3 Efficiency

An economic analysis was not carried out for this ICR. The Project had an economic analysis on
cost-effectiveness of Project-financed activities. The PAD foresaw quantifiable economic benefits
deriving from a combination of: (i) higher coverage and equity through the expansion of
PRONADE; (ii) the provision of scholarships to needy female students; and (iii) improving the
efficiency and quality of primary education through the provision of teaching inputs (textbooks
and training). The benefits would be measured by the increase in productivity of those who
complete primary education, as measured by the increase in their earning potential.

Though an economic analysis was not performed, there are several facts that could point to the
achievement of positive economic benefits from Project interventions. Enrollment rates for pre-
primary and primary education increased, with support from Project resources during the
implementation period. Existing evidence shows that preschool attendance increases preparedness
of children for first grade, particularly where repetition rates are historically higher, and
contributes to better educational attainment. Repetition rates for 6th grade in rural schools slightly
improved between 2004 and 2007. Though the slight improvement cannot be attributed only to
PRONADE, the fact that between 2004 and 2007 PRONADE schools were open in remote rural
areas and students with less level of preparedness entered the system without deterioration in
overall repetition rates points out to positive benefits for the education system achieved through
Project interventions. PRONADE schools had a higher number of school days (180 days) than
regular schools and were less affected by teacher strikes. It could be assumed that, relative to
regular schools, students were getting more educational services by dollar spent in the
PRONADE schools.


The social impact of the Project is expected to be positive. The Project continued to support the
provision of educational services to a group of children who traditionally lacked access to
schooling. By improving enrollment in rural areas, mostly in indigenous ones, the Project



                                                 16
contributed to improving equity and, presumably, to closing the gap in terms of access between
rural, indigenous populations and urban ones. The creation and functioning of the COEDUCAs
contributed to create social capital, to empower the parents and their communities and to enhance
accountability within the school community, as shown by the evaluation of the school
management modalities supported by the Project (see Annex 9).

The financial burden of the Project was manageable during the life of the Project. The
Government's counterpart funds reached US$25.71 million, compared to US$20.34 million
estimated at appraisal. The disbursement of counterpart funds was done over a period of 5.5 years.
The Project has generated recurrent costs for the country's budget due to the salaries of the new
PRONADE teachers. The country's education budget will absorb the cost of the new positions
during the course of 2009 and was already gradually absorbing the cost of the temporary
contracts signed with the PRONADE teachers as they were being transformed to regular teachers
and inserted into the system.

Project/Component Cost

Component 1: Universalization of Primary Education was estimated to cost US$40.28 million.
By Project completion, it had spent 73 percent of the appraisal estimate while it surpassed
achieved all of the component targets. Part of the reason was the decision to finance the girls'
scholarships with national resources after the first year of implementation. Resources from this
component were reallocated to institutional strengthening activities.

Component 2: Improving the quality of education was estimated to cost US$25.43 million. By
Project completion the actual cost of this component reached 124 percent of the estimate. This is
consistent with the output indicators, which shows the purchased and distribution of greater
quantities of education materials and books than anticipated, as well as many more teachers
trained.

Component 3: Cultural Diversity and Pluralism resulted in utilization of 82 percent of the
estimated costs, while meeting all established targets.

Component 4: Decentralization and Modernization of MINEDUC was estimated to cost
US$13.87 million. By Project completion it had cost 173 percent of the appraisal estimate. This is
consistent with the emphasis placed by the incoming administration on the institutional
strengthening aspects of the Project, and the achievements under this component not originally
specified in the PAD (human resource system, DINFO, etc) as explained in section 1.7.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The relevance of the Project's development objective was high at the time of preparation
and remains high today. Project activities responded to the needs of the Guatemalan education
system and were consistent with the CAS.

The Project's overall outcome rating is Satisfactory. The Project achieved most of the targets set
out in the PAD. Project interventions, through the provision of inputs and training, contributed to
improve the situation and context in primary schools in rural areas. The Project increased access
to education for many children who lived in rural areas lacking educational services. The Project
supported the strengthening of the institutional capabilities of MINEDUC, through improved and
accredited administrative processes and information systems.


                                                17
The quality improvement activities achieved the targets set in the PAD, providing outputs that
were important to lay a foundation for future accomplishments in teaching and learning. The
PAD did not propose indicators that could have been used to measure achievements in quality
and efficiency, such as primary completion rates or the results of learning outcomes evaluations
that could be attributed to the Project. Areas for improvement were indentified during the ICR
mission, such as the distribution of learning materials, their use in classrooms, and the application
in the classroom of the content of the training given to teachers.

The Project contributed to the implementation of the national curriculum and to the preparation of
a pre-school curriculum, which was not originally envisaged during preparation. The Loan
financed classroom libraries, with textbooks in Spanish and Mayan languages that were
distributed to children who did not previously have educational materials. All multi-grade and
bilingual schools received the educational materials developed with Project support. School
furniture for multi-grade schools was financed as well.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project focused its interventions in rural, isolated and indigenous areas, targeting indigenous
children and their communities. It placed emphasis on increasing access to school for rural and
indigenous girls. During Project implementation, as mentioned in Section 3.2, more than 90,000
children living in indigenous and rural communities enrolled in PRONADE schools and more
than 265,000 girls in these communities were recipients of scholarships, which allowed them to
attend and stay in primary schools. Furthermore, the institutionalization of the scholarship
program and the better definition of selection criteria benefited not only rural girls but all
scholarship recipients during the implementation period. These achievements contributed to
improve equity and to close the gap between urban and rural children, as well as between boys
and girls.

Additionally, parents hired 3,061 teachers to work in the indigenous communities where many of
them were from and they were trained to work with their COEDUCAs. The fact that teachers
were selected by parents was positive. Parents felt more comfortable sending the girls to school
as they perceived that the children would be better treated. Apart from the PRONADE teachers,
all teachers working in multi-grade grade schools received training.

The creation of the COEDUCAs was positive for the communities. Parent members received
training, they were given the responsibility of hiring and firing teachers and increased
accountability. Parent participation in many aspects of school management was positive,
providing key support to schools with very little resources. Parent involvement contributed to
hold teachers accountable for their work, in remote communities, which likely contributed to
sustain, if not improve, the main education indicators.




(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project put forth significant efforts to strengthen, modernize and change MINEDUC to
facilitate the better provision of educational services.


                                                 18
        The Project dedicated two components to activities geared to improve the institutional
        capacity of MINEDUC and MCS. Output indicators were included to monitor the
        progress towards this goal.

        The most remarkable accomplishments in terms of institutional strengthening were
        achieved in MINEDUC. The 2002 administration's strong focus on modernizing
        MINEDUC was fruitful and it brought a reorganization of MINEDUC that led to
        improved functions in the following areas:

                I.     General Directorate for Information Systems
                II.    Evaluation System
                III.   Planning, including education statistics
                IV.    Human resource management
                V.     PROCESS ISO 9000 for key functions and
                VI.    Decentralization with 5 departments

        Databases in MINEDUC were integrated with Project support. By Project completion,
        there was a unified information system, with some shortcomings but much improved.

        MCS' strategic framework was enhanced and its information and communication
        infrastructure was improved.

        Communities were strengthened under PRONADE. Parents received training on
        administrative matters related to the creation of the school and its management. Though
        members of COEDUCAs rotated, they remained close to the schools, helping new
        parents as members of the COEDUCAs. The COEDUCAs were transformed into Juntas
        Escolares by Project completion.

Decentralization of functions to Departments was initiated during implementation. MINEDUC
envisages the continuation of this process, further expanding the decentralization of functions to
the remaining Departments in the coming years.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

        Design of a strategy for pre-primary education since most multi-grade schools included
        pre-school children.

        Finalization and implementation of the CNB. MINEDUC also developed a curriculum for
        pre-primary with support from the Bank, Canada and other international actors.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

ICR Rating: High



                                                 19
The assessment of risk to the achievements of the Project is rated as high. The main risk comes
from the changes regarding PRONADE. The decision to institutionalize the program has positive
effects (such as the continuation of the schools created under PRONADE, the conversion of the
status of teachers) and corroborates the commitment of the new authorities to increasing
enrollment in primary education in rural and indigenous areas. Nevertheless, given: (i) how recent
these changes have been; (ii) the fact that there was no evaluation of PRONADE by Project
completion; and (ii) the changes are still being implemented, it is too early to assess the impact of
this decision on Project achievements and the education system as a whole. It would be advisable
to follow up in the coming months, on the following topics in rural schools, particularly
PRONADE ones:

        Evolution of coverage in rural and indigenous areas
        Retention of girls in pre-primary and primary schools given that parents will no longer be
        in charge of hiring teachers
        Number of school days during the school year
        Teacher attendance
        Accountability of schools at local level
        Community participation in school management and decentralization of education at the
        local and school levels.

Furthermore, there have been delays paying teachers working on PRONADE schools during the
last few months during which contracts were done month to month, until the conversion of the
teachers' status was to be concluded.

Institutionally, MINEDUC has been strengthened in terms of administrative, management, and
information capacity under the Project, which would be beneficial to support the achievements
under the Project. MCS experienced an improvement in terms of institutional capacity and it
would be expected that this would contribute to promote multicultural programs.

The ICR team believes that there are greater difficulties in translating the achievements under the
quality component into improvements in the quality of learning. There are challenges ahead to
deepen the improvements in multi-grade methodologies, in achieving a systematic use of the
learning materials in the classrooms and in bringing to the classrooms the content of teacher
training provided under the Project.

The achievements in multicultural education should be further supported in the future, in order to
sustain them. Though the Project supported strengthening DIGEBI, sustainability of these gains
will require political and financial commitment in the future.




5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry



                                                 20
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team worked closely with the Borrower during the design of the Project, jointly
identifying key issues, defining the strategy on how best to address these issues, and designing
the interventions to be supported by the Project. The Bank and the Borrower had been working
together on the implementation of several projects, in particular the education reform project,
under implementation at the time of preparation. That Project was supporting the implementation
of the PRONADE program as the main vehicle to expand access to education in rural and
indigenous areas. The Bank sought to establish strong support for the program from the Borrower.
The team met with members of Congress, the Ministry of Finance, SEGEPLAN and the Ministry
of Education to raise concerns over the budget support for PRONADE. The preparation benefited
from the participation of a seasoned group of experts, with experience in other countries in and
outside of the region.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's supervision is rated Satisfactory as well. The Bank team was helpful and worked
closely with the incoming administrations, both in 2002 and in 2007, to ensure a smooth
transition and an adequate connection between the development objectives for the Project and the
strategic and sectoral priorities of the incoming administrations.

The team carried out intense supervision, with missions and follow up from headquarters in the
early stages of the Project, until it was finally approved by the Guatemalan Congress and
implementation could start. The Bank maintained a constant dialogue with the Borrower, trying
to provide as much support as possible to enable the Project to move forward. The staff in the
field office provided timely support to the headquarter team and facilitated a fluid dialogue with
the Borrower.

During Project supervision, there were three different team leaders. The transition from one to the
next did not seem to cause delays in implementation. Team leaders were proactive and worked
closely with the Borrower to identify annual operational priorities and how to implement them,
contributing to achieve a high level of implementation from early on in the Project. These efforts
possibly contributed to making up the substantial delay in the startup of implementation.

The team visited schools and met with stakeholders. Overall, the team supported the Borrower in
achieving good implementation of project activities, providing technical assistance and advice in
the revision of terms of reference for training activities and evaluation of the Project components.




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory based on the following:



                                                21
        Solid Project preparation, based on good quality sector work, with close collaboration
        with the Borrower
        Extensive, timely and accurate support from the task manager, based in the country
        Frequent and well staffed missions during supervision and follow up on issues identified
        during supervision missions
        Good fiduciary technical assistance
        Visits to schools and meetings with stakeholders, to identify key bottlenecks to
        implementation faced by the schools and communities.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's performance during preparation and implementation is rated as satisfactory,
with some qualifications. There were three different administrations during the life of the Project.
In general, the three administrations showed commitment to the PDOs and worked closely with
the Bank to approve and implement the Project. During preparation, there were concerns over the
budget cuts for PRONADE in Congress. The strong commitment expressed by the Government
for PRONADE during the preparation phase was crucial to achieving a sound and consistent
design.

Though there was good continuity and support for the main goals of the Project, the incoming
administration in 2008 decided to institutionalize PRONADE and to integrate the program into
the regular educational system to provide services to rural and isolated communities. The
Government assigned the functions of the former PRONADE unit to different departments in
MINEDUC, which are in charge of all type of schools, not just PRONADE schools. As
mentioned in section 2.5, it re-classified PRONADE teachers, changing the budget line to finance
their contracts and it opened a competitive process to select and hire former PRONADE teachers
as regular teachers. The Government gave DIGEPSA the responsibility for community
participation, which PRONADE held previously. The qualification to the satisfactory rating is
based on the Government's decision not to carry out a separate evaluation of the PRONADE
program upon Project completion. While PRONADE had been mainstreamed into MINEDUC,
which could bring positive effects by eliminating the perception of PRONADE as a separate
program, it has prevented the assessment of its impact, which would allow the Government to
extract useful lessons for the future.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was implemented by MINEDUC and MCS. Each of them had a PCU. Overall,
MINEDUC's implementation performance is rated as satisfactory. MINEDUC was able to
implement the Project's main activities reaching, and in most cases surpassing, its targets.
MINEDUC directorates were very involved in preparing the Project. Its technical staff
conceptualized the Project, which was a continuation of the on-going project, with the help of
experts and consultants from other countries in the region

Project implementation was the responsibility of the PCU, which managed the daily operations
and liaised with the technical units of the Ministry, while coordinating the operational and
fiduciary aspects of the Project. By Project completion, just a core group of staff remained, and



                                                22
the capacity had been streamlined into the MINEDUC's technical units. While there was some
turnover of staff, which is normal when there are changes of administration, there was a good
degree of continuity among key staff during implementation.

Regarding fiduciary matters, procurement and financial management were mostly satisfactory.
Procurement was rated as moderately satisfactory in two ISRs. As mentioned in section 2.4, the
PCU addressed the issues pointed out by the Bank and the 2008 independent post review
recommended upgrading this rating to satisfactory. Financial management was rated satisfactory
at all times. Audit reports were presented on time and they did not present qualifications.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory:

         Borrower ownership and commitment during preparation
         Commitment to the PDOs by three different administrations
         Despite the initial delay, Borrower's ability to implement the Project in an adequate
         period of time, with full disbursement of the resources, meeting or surpassing the PAD
         targets
         Availability of counterpart funds throughout implementation
         Development of the EMIS and use of the educational data to inform decisions

6. Lessons Learned
Design

Pilot experiences facilitate implementation. The Project based its design on lessons from
previously implemented projects and on the pilot experience of PRONADE. Once the Project was
approved, PRONADE activities moved quickly, achieving the established targets earlier than
planned.

Choosing the right indicators is important for monitoring progress during the life of the
Project and for assessing impact at closing. The Borrower and the Bank agreed on a set of
indicators to monitor the progress of Project activities. The indicators to measure the achievement
of PDOs were output indicators. While these indicators are helpful to monitor tangible
implementation progress, they are not necessarily good proxies for measuring certain
development objectives.

Importance of including measures to mitigate political changes and risks associated with a
Project that supported a different employment standard for a group of public servants, in this
case teachers. The Project did not include a strategy to ensure formal participation of different
stakeholders. The participation of stakeholders has the potential of protecting certain project
activities from political and economic instabilities, as well as reducing opposition from specific
groups.
Implementation

Changes in education policy should be expected when there is a change in government,
especially if innovations are tested through projects. In the case of Guatemala ­ as is the case in
other countries - the incoming administrations adjusted the Project to their sector policy priorities.



                                                 23
As such, projects should be designed with sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing strategies and
priorities, when those are considered technically appropriate.

Importance of closely monitoring the expansion and maturation of the community-based
education models. Community­based education models are born outside of the bureaucracies of
the ministries of education and the ministries have adopted them gradually and in different ways
depending upon each country's experience. The experience of institutionalization of the main
models in Central America (PROHECO, EDUCO and PRONADE) has been different. The fact
that PRONADE was the result of a government agreement, but not created by a law, risked its
status making it rather simple for the model to be changed and/or eliminated..

Dialogue and understanding with teachers unions is crucial to the survival of the community-
based education programs. Though in all countries the community-based programs have brought
conflict with the unions (due to different hiring methods, salaries, teacher status, etc),
commitment by the government and good and longstanding dialogue with the unions can help
overcome the conflicts related to teacher status.

In multi-ethnic and multi-cultural countries, education is not only a technical-pedagogical
matter, the sociological realities play a defining role on how to move forward. While there is
widespread consensus among experts that teaching and learning in a native community language
is critical to successful learning achievements in the first years of education, parents in
Guatemalan indigenous communities requested that their children be taught in Spanish, since it
was perceived as the way to overcome exclusion. In many instances, as expressed by teachers in
the schools visited during the ICR mission, parents were not convinced of the critical importance
of teaching children reading and writing in their native indigenous language.

Education reforms should not be linear. In the process of reforming the education sector, it is
advisable to simultaneously tackle several issues. In the case of Guatemala, MINEDUC focused
on modernizing the Ministry and completing reforms at the central level. This choice allowed
substantial institutional progress while diminishing the focus on other areas of the Project.
Improvements to the multi-grade model started later on during implementation, thus there were
cohorts of students who could have benefited from these activities if they would have been
initiated simultaneously.

Focusing on improving the quality of bilingual education is essential to improve the overall
quality of the education system. For Guatemala, improving the quality of teaching and learning
in bilingual schools is the only way to eventually improve the quality of the whole education
system. This means strengthening DIGEBI to be able to implement a strategy for bilingual
education, and provide quality training for its teachers with timely distribution of adapted
textbooks and learning materials. During the Project, the preparation of textbooks and guides in
Mayan languages took long and opportunities were missed. It is important to provide training to
teachers in the native language in which they are supposed to teach. Together with this,
MINEDUC's should accompany teachers during and after training, which is crucial to help
teachers adapt the new methodologies to the classroom. It is key for teachers to teach in their
native language. As it is now, there is simultaneous translation in the classroom, thus difficulties
of comprehension abound and reading and writing are delayed.

Need to work with parents to keep the children in schools. The involvement of parents in
selecting and hiring the teachers contributed to bringing children to school and keeping them
there. Parents knew and therefore trusted the teachers and felt their children were cared for, which
contributed to reducing dropouts.


                                                24
Need to improve teacher preparation to improve the quality of education. To achieve results and
improve the quality of teaching and learning in the classrooms, there is a need to tackle teacher
preparation and not only training. The teachers in Guatemala are graduates from high school and
not from universities. There is a need to better prepare them to increase the quality of teaching
contents and methodologies. Though there are escuelas normales to train teachers in multi-grade
in Guatemala, these should be improved. Analysis of the profile of multi-grade grade teachers is
needed to create better programs for teacher education.

Importance of providing inputs simultaneously to achieve sought goals. In order to improve the
quality of education, the different project inputs should be provided in a coordinated and timely
manner. Teachers received their training, but in some cases the educational materials had not
arrived or they arrived late or in other cases they were not the correct ones, or all of the books in
the packages did not arrive. This was detrimental to the impact the training could have had in the
classroom.

Classifying schools can help to improve the quality of education. A good classification of
schools as monolingual, bilingual and/or multi-grade can help to place the school under the
appropriate unit within the Ministry of Education; it can help provide the correct textbooks and
materials to the teachers and students. In the case of Guatemala, it was observed that there is a
serious discrepancy between the profile information listed for schools in the information system
and the actual school type. The books found in the schools were not the right ones for the school
profile and the linguistic reality of the teachers and students was very different than the one
reflected in the system's classification.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower provided few comments to the draft ICR. In general, they expressed their
agreement with the content and information included in the ICR. They recognized the ICR
presents the achievements of the Project and its contribution to the Guatemala Education System.
These comments were taken into consideration to improve the quality of the document.

The Borrower provided its contribution to the ICR, which is included in Annex 7 in English and
the original one in Spanish is in the Project's files.

Summary of Borrower's Contribution:

This Project was a continuation of the Basic Education Reform Project (IBRD-4167-GU), which
supported MINEDUC'S efforts to achieve universal access to basic education, to improve the
equity, quality and cultural diversity of education, especially in rural indigenous areas of
Guatemala, and to decentralize and modernize the administrative system of education.

The project experienced some changes to its original design. Additional activities were added to
some subcomponents, resulting in a redistribution of Loan resources among several components.

The goals of coverage in rural primary education through PRONADE doubled. This was achieved
by the creation of PRONADE schools, the payment of teachers' salaries, and the provision of
teaching and learning materials, achieving the goals set in the Annual Operational Plans. The



                                                 25
targets set for the scholarship program for rural girls were also surpassed. Of the 50,000 initially
planned, 14,000 were financed with Project resources, while the rest were paid with national
funds.

The project surpassed its targets during the implementation period 2002-2007, concentrating most
of its interventions in the years 2005-2006 and achieving high financial execution (99.99%). Both
aspects were essential to move closer to achieving the Millennium Goal of improving primary
completion rates by the year 2015. The Project contributed to increasing coverage in rural areas
(with an emphasis on reaching indigenous girls), improving the quality and equity of primary
education, especially EBI, and using innovative educational technologies. The Project also made
gains in optimizing inter-institutional coordination among the ministries in carrying out projects
and joint actions, and in modernizing and decentralizing the management of the education system.

The main lessons learned are:

PRONADE as a transitional solution to increase coverage. The National Community-managed
Program for Educational Development has been a vehicle to expand coverage, however, the
teachers unions and other groups in civil society do not agree with this modality because they
perceive the program as lacking social and civil coverage for teachers. Once this Program is no
longer in operation, these aspects need to be taken into consideration as to how they affect
program sustainability.

The scholarships are designed to compensate families, not to directly aid the children. The
scholarships have resulted in immediate compensations to the families to make up for the
opportunity cost of not sending their children to work, especially girls, which gives parents an
incentive to send them school.

The changes of Government every 4 years affect, delay, or modify the achievements and
implementation of Projects under way. The original design of the IBRD 7052 Project had to be
renegotiated during its execution with at least two different administrations of differing political
orientation. Future projects should thus consider this variable and have an alternate strategy that
minimizes delays and adjustment processes that affect the normal development of a project.

A growing and sustained support for EBI should be maintained to make it successful. All
administrations, regardless of their political orientation, have backed the implementation of the
EBI pedagogical model. However, this support has not always translated into the institutional
support, skilled human resources, and budget needed to address educational demand with
relevance and quality. Government efforts should continue to support EBI to ensure that this
modality becomes a program supported at the national level and provides the best alternative to
address the needs of indigenous communities with relevance and quality.

Need to consider a flexible EBI. It is generally accepted that the Intercultural Bilingual
Education taught in an indigenous language (L1) in the first grades is the best choice to achieve
better comprehension of the Spanish language (L2) in indigenous communities. However, parents
also have the constitutional right to choose the education given to their children. It is a fact that
several indigenous communities disagree and formally oppose the teaching of their native tongue
to their children, requesting instead that they are taught in Spanish and English, as well.

Investment in technology is highly productive and a key factor in modernization. The
experience of MINEDUC in strengthening the technological processes of the institution
demonstrated the importance of having an adequate strategy for the use of technology as a key


                                                 26
support to any process of institutional modernization. Investments in the infrastructure of
telecommunications, computers, and the development of applications had a significant impact not
only on the delivery of services to internal and external clients, but on all the sub-systems of work
that operate within MINEDUC: human resources, internal communications, client services,
training, etc.

In terms of the Ministry of Education and Bank's performance, the government's contribution
considers that MINEDUC's performance noteworthy in the management, administration and
financing of the Project, showing high levels of efficiency and fulfillment of its commitments in
terms of counterpart funds. The inter-institutional relationship between the World Bank and the
Ministry of Education throughout the life of the Project was very constructive, productive, and
proactive, creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a positive relationship,
which allowed for successful Project management and the attainment of Project objectives. The
Bank maintained constant presence through different Field Missions and through meetings with
MINEDUC management, technical personnel, and consultants.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 - Universalization of Primary Education (Actual cost: US$29.60 million versus
US$40.28 million).

This component achieved its objectives of increasing coverage and equity through the expansion
and consolidation of the PRONADE schools (National Community-managed Program for
Educational Development). This component supported the Government's efforts towards
universal access to primary education.

Subcomponent A: Expansion of enrollment capacity of primary schools in rural areas and
marginalized communities through the PRONADE program.

The Guatemalan National Community-driven Program for Educational Development
(PRONADE) began in 1992 as a strategy to increase access in rural and remote areas. It evolved
from a small, innovative pilot program in 19 rural communities to a nationwide program enrolling
close to 400,000 children in 2007. This represented 17% of the primary enrollment of the country.
In 2007, almost 25% of primary schools in the country were PRONADE schools: 4,683
PRONADE Schools and 15,209 Official System Primary Schools. The program was
institutionalized in January 2008. The government taking office in 2008 absorbed the PRONADE
schools into the regular system. Annex 10 provides more information on PRONADE and its
achievements.

This subcomponent supported the expansion of PRONADE schools as the strategy to increase
coverage in rural and indigenous areas. It surpassed all of the targets set in the PAD, in most
cases by mid-term review. The table below shows the main outputs of this sub-component:

There was an evaluation of PRONADE carried out around the time of the mid-term review of the
initial pilot experience. The analysis undertaken at the time showed that the PRONADE schools
were being open in the areas targeted by the Project, rural and mostly indigenous parts of
Guatemala. Since at mid-term review the program had already surpassed and doubled its targets,
it concentrated on improving the quality of the PRONADE schools and on progressively
institutionalizing the program within MINEDUC. There was not a final evaluation of the
PRONADE program at Project completion.

The PRONADE program was very effective at reducing the gaps in primary enrollment between
urban and rural areas in Guatemala. Moreover, the program proved to be successful in the
following specific areas3:

              Effective school days in the PRONADE system were equal or closer to the official
              requirement of 180 days. By contrast, children in the official system were in school
              for an estimated average of 110 days;
              The program boosted the enrollment rate for children aged 7-10. It also increased
              enrollment for 11 and 12 year olds, who were susceptible to dropping out;
              The monetary cost for the family was considerably lower than in the official system
              (before the free enrollment in schools approved by the government in 2008);
              The Primary Education net enrollment rate increased from 85.43% in 2000 to 95% in
              2007; and
              The PRONADE program disproportionately benefited poor, hard-to-access, low-
              density, indigenous areas where supply of primary education services was previously
              lacking.

PRONADE underwent changes during 2008. The current government administration
announced a strategy to institutionalize the PRONADE program as an integral part of MINEDUC.
MINEDUC announced the conversion of all PRONADE positions (identified as budgetary code
029) into regular civil service teacher positions (identified as budgetary code 011). MINEDUC
called for approximately 14,000 additional 011-type contracts during the calendar year 2009.
This process was competitive. There was no assurance that all of the PRONADE teachers were to
be converted to 011-type contract. The process was to be completed by the second half of 2009.
The current government administration did not hire the ISEs for school year 2008 but instead
allocated their functions to the regional education supervisors. Functions that were previously
assumed by the PRONADE unit in MINEDUC were reallocated to other units within the Ministry.

Subcomponent B: Provision of scholarships for children of poor, rural families. This
subcomponent achieved its objectives and targets. The main outputs of this subcomponent are
shown below.

During the first year of implementation, Project resources financed around 14,000 scholarships
for girls in indigenous and rural areas. After that year, MINEDUC opted to include this
scholarship program within the general scholarship program managed in MINEDUC and
financed with national budget resources. The Project then concentrated its support on the
development of the database and the criteria for awarding the scholarships. By Project completion,
the scholarship program for girls was institutionalized within MINEDUC and financed by budget
resources.

The Project contributed to establish a solid management of the scholarship program by
MINEDUC. This is significant when taken into account that MINEDUC was to manage the
scholarship program for girls for the first time in 2001.

Component 2 ­ Improving the Quality of Education (Actual cost: US$31.67 million versus
US$25.43 million in the PAD). This component focused on improving the quality and efficiency
of primary education. It had three sub-components: (i) strengthening multi-grade grade strategies
and bilingual education, primarily in rural communities; (ii) provision of educational materials
(textbooks and student guides) for monolingual and bilingual children; and (iii) training of
teachers in multi-grade grade methodologies as well as in content areas and development of
curricula for bilingual schools.

The component was successful in achieving the targets it set for its main sub-components as
shown in the table below.

Futuro" Program (not PAD target)

The activities around the multi-grade grade schools experienced delays during the first two years
of implementation. Initially, there were organizational issues around the PCU and the
operationalization of the activities within MINEDUC. From 2005 on, the Borrower and the Bank
team placed strong emphasis on developing the activities under each of the sub-components.

In the case of sub-component A, the project succeeded in providing classroom libraries and
furniture for bilingual and monolingual multi-grade grade schools to support better
implementation of the multi-grade grade model. It also supported the revision of the existing
student workbooks and teacher guides, their printing and distribution for monolingual multi-grade
grade schools, under DIGECABE responsibility. For bilingual, multi-grade grade schools, the
Project supported the development, acquisition and distribution of teacher guides and student
workbooks. Out of the 3,300 schools benefited, 1,170 were bilingual schools under DIGEBI's
responsibility.

Under Sub-component B, the Project supported revision of the existing textbooks, to better
reflect the new curriculum. It supported the acquisition of textbooks and educational materials for
multi-grade grade bilingual and monolingual schools. The Project supported the design, printing
and distribution of textbooks in two subjects (math and culture) in the 4 main Mayan languages,
covering around 85 percent of the indigenous populations.

Regarding the bilingual multi-grade grade materials, though there was significant progress
achievement of all of the aims did not occur. Out of the package for 2nd to 6th grade and for pre-
primary and six grade (guides to learn to read and write), which aimed to be 52 different guides
and 16 modules for teacher training, the actual product was somehow reduced: 2 modules for
training teachers and 12 guides translated to Mayan languages for 2nd and 3rd grade. A set of
modules ("Dame la Mano") for pre-primary were distributed in 12 linguistic communities. There
were six decentralized projects implementing EBI in six departments in multi-grade grade schools
(in Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Sololá, Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán). These
sub-projects covered approximately 1,043 teachers, 22,300 students in 272 schools in 45
municipalities.

The main achievements under this component were to acknowledge that the multi-grade grade
education in Guatemala is largely an indigenous area; all multi-grade grade schools were
equipped and received materials; there were guides produced in the main 4 Mayan languages.
This was lead by the DIGEBI. There were still some shortcomings such as not linking the
linguistic profile with the materials distributed in the schools. This was observed during the visits
to schools by the ICR team.




                                                 32
Under subcomponent C teachers were trained in multi-grade grade methodologies both in
monolingual and bilingual schools in 2007. The Project provided technical assistance to develop a
program to train trainers. In 2003 and 2004, a group of 4 consultants was hired within DIGEBI
and a total of 150 teachers were trained in interactive groups in Quetzaltenangeo, Chimaltenango
and Quiche, in the use and creation of educational materials and in the use of the native language.

The teacher training was positive, though there were shortcomings as well: teachers were trained
in the use of the multi-grade grade methodology in Spanish and not in the Mayan language. There
were no ISEs who could deliver the training in the Mayan language.

DIGEBI was not able to absorb all that was produced by the multi-grade grade activities under
the Project and there has not been much follow-up by DIGEBI and DIGECADE. DIGEBI hired
consultants to translate and adapt the multi-grade grade educational materials to the Mayan
languages for pre-primary and 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades.

Under this component there was training of 10,276 teachers for first grade in all official schools.
Under the program "Salvemos el primer grado," teachers were to be used in active teaching
methodologies to make better use of educational materials, combined with assessments of
learning at this grade and follow up as the students move up to higher grades.

Component 3 ­ Cultural Diversity and Pluralism (Actual cost: US$1.90 million versus US$2.3
million in the PAD). It would support the institutional strengthening of MCS to coordinate more
effectively with MINEDUC and other government agencies. It included three sub-components: (i)
institutional strengthening of MCS including the establishment of a Policy and Planning unit and
the preparation of a National Cultural Development Plan, in coordination with MINEDUC and
other agencies; (ii) de-concentration of the MCS cultural education services to the municipal
level; and (iii) development of the National Cultural Resources Information System (NCRIS) to
include the modernization of the existing MCS cultural resources information system, provision
of information to museums and libraries and the establishment of a cultural resources database on
the diverse ethnic and linguistic groups of Guatemala.

The main products of this component were:

        The creation of a "Policy and Planning Unit" in MCS, adequately staffed to coordinate
        with MINEDUC and other institutions;
        The design and implementation of six pilot experiences to decentralize educational
        services to departments and municipalities.
        Design of a National Information System for Cultural Resources (SNIRC);
        Training workshops for MINEDUC and MCS personnel to better understand and
        implement policies;
        Development of a Long Term National Plan for Cultural Resources, elaborated in
        consensus with relevant institutions and stakeholders;
        Implementation of a legal framework for the MCS, and draft Law for Cultural Heritage in
        Antigua, Law for Intangible Heritage and Law for Public Events;
        Evaluation of the institutional strengthening in MINEDUC and MCS, especially around
        areas of common work;
        Development and implementation of the Web site for MCS (www.mcd.gob.gt) which
        provides information on cultural events, current developments and connections to
        libraries and museums; and
        Development of a database of ethnic cultural resources made accessible on the website.



                                                33
Component 4 ­ Decentralization and Modernization (Actual cost: US$24.07 million versus
US$13.87 million in the PAD). This component was to support: (i) improving the managerial and
administrative capacity of the Ministry of Education, decentralization to the departmental and
local levels, with a special emphasis on the General Directorate for Bilingual Education
(DIGEBI); (ii) training of community associations (COEDUCAs) to manage and organize
PRONADE schools; and (iii) continued development and updating of an Education Management
Information System (EMIS).

This component was successful in achieving the targets established in the PAD and in most cases,
surpassing them.

Subcomponent A ­ Strengthening of MINEDUC's management capacity at the local,
departmental and central levels. The Project successfully supported the continued improvement
of the management and administrative processes system at the central, departmental and local
levels. The scope and achievements of this subcomponent were clearly marked by the
administration that took office in 2004. The focus was strongly placed on strengthening capacity
at the central level, progressively moving to decentralized levels. The following activities were
achieved under this subcomponent:

        Strengthening of DIGEBI: the PAD aimed to strengthen DIGEBI at all levels and in all
        areas to respond to its responsibilities in the management of the multilingual-
        multicultural education program. A Strategic Plan for DIGEBI was produced with
        support of the Project, though efforts to strengthen the unit have not translated into
        significant action forward. However, DIGEBI was improved over the life of the Project.
        Before 2003, DIGEBI worked with regular grade schools and not with multi-grade grade
        schools. The schools under this directorate were handled without a multi-grade grade
        focus. By Project closing, there was a multi-grade grade unit within DIGEBI and its
        personnel had been trained. Nevertheless, while progress was achieved at the central level,
        there has been less progress at the departmental level and with parents.

        Improvements in DINFO: the PAD sought to achieve improvements in the education
        management information system. The Project contributed to decentralize education
        database management to the departmental level, providing equipment to four
        departmental and some municipal offices. The Project provided technical assistance to
        improve data collection instruments, analysis and software. DINFO provides technical
        support and communication services, applications development and data processing. All
        of these services have been certified under ISO 9000. The directorate has been adequately
        staffed with a total of 48 qualified people. The communication infrastructure has
        improved significantly: there are 22 departmental directorates and 93 municipalities
        connected to the central level; a video conference office at central level was established;
        and networks were improved--an estimated number of 2,474 users connected to the
        network evenly divided between the central and decentralized levels. They have
        developed more than 60 applications on the web (for contract administration, education
        statistics, etc). The management of education statistics has been moved to the Directorate
        of Planning (DIPLAN). The unit has been institutionalized and financed by the budget
        since 2006 and has increasingly seen its allocation augmented.

        Strengthening the human resource system: the Project contributed to develop an
        integrated human resource system, which addressed the weaknesses identified in the
        system. It contributed to modernize the legal framework and processes regarding hiring,


                                               34
   training, administration, reallocation, payments, assessments and disciplinary actions. An
   electronic system for human resources was put in place (substituting manual processing)
   called e-SIRH, and this allowed integration with other areas of MINEDUC. Ten modules
   were developed, as well as a pilot program to audit the salaries of 4,000 teachers and
   1,000 schools. Electronic conversion of 76,000 files managed by the Junta Calificadora
   de Personal was carried out in addition to themodernization of the Junta Calificadora de
   Personal, with improvements to their physical infrastructure and equipment. Lastly, the
   functions of the Junta Calificadora were decentralized to the departmental directorates
   and a study to restructure MINEDUC's staff and salary structure was elaborated.
   Progress has been significant and there are actions identified to continue developing more
   modules.

   Strengthening of the policy, planning, and evaluation functions of MINEDUC. The
   Project supported the following accomplishments:

   (a) Institutionalization of the Quality Management Unit at the central level, which
      became the Directorate for Development and Institutional Strengthening (DIDEFI).
      This unit focused on strengthening the internal processes at MINEDUC's central level
      and in five Departmental Directorates (Quetzaltenango, Baja Verapaz, Retalhuleu,
      Sacatepequez and El Progreso). It achieved the accreditation of these management
      processes in the ISO 9000, internationally recognized as a standard of quality. The
      main processes to be accredited were: human resources, acquisitions, inventories,
      budget execution, legal opinions, and services to the public, among others. The main
      implications of this improvement were: (1) greater efficiency and efficacy across
      MINEDUC; (2) development of a culture focused on prevention of problems and on
      continued improvements; and (3) the development of a platform that will allow the
      continued improvement of internal processes at all levels.

   (b) Progress towards better coordination with departmental directorates.

   (c) Training of administrative personnel at the central and departmental levels: a wide
      training process of all administrative personnel at the central and departmental levels
      and of 12,000 teachers of pre-primary and primary as well as supervisors was carried
      out. The training focused on attitudinal changes and was called: "Talleres sobre 21
      claves para el éxito."

   (d) Creation of the Directorate for Education Evaluation and Research (DIGEDUCA):
      the project contributed to the conversion of the existing information system SINEIE
      into a directorate, created in 2007 (government agreement 377- 2007). The Project
      supported hiring personnel and carrying out some evaluations. Since 2006,
      DIGEDUCA has carried out several evaluations each year that allow comparisons:
      sample based evaluations for 3rd and 6th grades in primary, evaluations of teachers
      aspiring to bilingual positions and teacher assessment (evaluación de graduados,
      studying those who will become teachers).

    (e) Rehabilitation of the existing MINEDUC building and construction of a new block
       of offices in Guatemala City.




                                          35
Subcomponent B ­ Social Communication Campaigns: the Project contributed to the creation
and implementation of eighteen communication campaigns to inform the general public about
progress and achievements made in the education sector.

Subcomponent C ­ Education Management Information System (EMIS). This subcomponent
supported the improvement in the EMIS. By Project completion, there had been significant
improvements in the quality of data entered in the system, in the decentralization of data
collection and management and in the availability and use of education data generated by the
system, using the "business object" tool and MINEDUC's website. There was improvement in
the information system for human resources as mentioned above and in the conversion to
electronic management of the above mentioned administrative processes.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Original version in Spanish in Project files

This Project was a continuation of the Basic Education Reform Project (IBRD-4167-GU), which
supported MINEDUC'S efforts to achieve universal access to basic education, to improve the
equity, quality and cultural diversity of education, especially in rural indigenous areas of
Guatemala, and to decentralize and modernize the administrative system of education.

I.      Changes to Project Components

The project experienced some changes to its original design. Additional activities were added to
some subcomponents, which resulted in a redistribution of Loan resources among several
components. The main changes are described below.

Component I: Coverage and Equity: Scholarships for rural and indigenous girls were
transferred to the Scholarship Unit within MINEDUC, which manages scholarships financed with
different resources.

Component II: Improving the Quality of Education: (i) A pilot program to teach secondary
students through video-supported education (Telesecundaria) was designed in 2005, to be
implemented in eight community-managed schools in Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán; (ii)
implementation in 2007 of 6 pilot EBI subprojects for decentralization to the departments of
Sololá, Quetzaltenango, Totonicapán, Chimaltenango, Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz; and (iii)
implementation of a strategy to Save the First Grade (2004) by applying new methodologies of
teaching and learning for Communication, Language and Mathematics. The purpose was to
improve learning and retention rates, reacting to the results of the 2004 evaluation of the National
Evaluation Program for Educational Achievement­PRONERE, which showed major learning
deficiencies among rural students.

Component III: Cultural Diversity and Pluralism

Subcomponent "A" Planning and Inter-institutional Governmental Coordination: The
implementation of the Program for the Management of Cultural Development was considered
effective ; long run consolidation of the sustainability of the National Cultural Development Plan
by means of decentralizing the operation of the Cultural Development Units to the local level;
and the achievement of Guatemala assuming the leadership in the implementation of the Cultural
Strategic Plan of Central America.

Subcomponent "B" Decentralization of Cultural Educational Services. Development of joint
pilot projects in 2007 (which consisted of classroom art projects, choirs, bands and orchestras)
and implementation of a methodology to design educational art projects, in order to consolidate
the coordination of the NMDC and MINEDUC within the framework of the National Long-term
Plan for Cultural Development and the National Arts Education System.

Subcomponent "C" National Cultural Information System: Development of the virtual internet
portal of the Ministry of Culture and Sports­NMDC- of the National Information System of
Cultural Resources, and promotion of access by different relevant actors; dissemination of
educational documentaries; publishing of the policy of the NMDC; publication of research carried
out by the Socio-cultural National Research Council and of the Department of Informatics of the
NMDC.



                                                42
Component IV: Decentralization and Modernization

        (a) Strengthening of the administrative management of the School Boards and of
            PRONADE (2005), supporting decentralization of MINEDUC. In 2007 school
            management is promoted, as well as PRONADE school boards;

        (b) Program for Quality Management (2005) in order to implement a SGC based on the
            standard ISO 9001:2000 at the central level and in DDE's, and to achieve
            international certification. In 2006, a process map was created detailing 25
            procedures in 20 units at the central level and in 5 Departmental Bureaus;

        (c) Support for the New Management Model (2005), to achieve attitudinal change and
            raise awareness among regular staff at the central level, departmental bureaus of
            education, and 1st and 2nd grade teaching staff. Reorganization of the functional
            structure of the area of general management and its linkage to the administrative and
            technical support areas. In 2006, a Change Team is created in order to coordinate and
            monitor the reengineering and ministerial restructuring in coordination with the
            program for Quality Management;

        (d) Support for a group of selected schools "Schools of the Future" (2005), through the
            use of technology. In 2006, this program was extended to rural multi-grade schools in
            Alta Verapaz, Suchitepéquez, Santa Rosa, Quiché, and Petén;

        (e) Expansion of the program (2005) to strengthen the areas of management (equipment),
            institutional reputation, and inter-institutional coordination;

        (f) Implementation of a "Geo Referential System of Educational Intelligence" (2006);

        (g) Coordination of the National System for Evaluation and Educational Information
            (2006) to generate information on student performance;

        (h) Modernization of the Human Resources Management System (2006): this entailed
            updating personnel data, deconcentration of file analysis, evaluation processes,
            decentralization of payroll digitalization of new personnel files, decentralization of
            the information system and processes in the DDE, etc.


II.     Principal Achievements of the Project by Component

Component I: Coverage and Equity: The goals of coverage in rural primary education through
PRONADE doubled. This was achieved by the creation of PRONADE schools, the payment of
teachers' salaries, and the provision of teaching and learning materials, achieving the goals set in
the Annual Operational Plans, as shown below:

     located in 203 municipalities, with 6762 trained teachers and 3,372 delivered computers, benefiting
     150,460 students. These schools were to be financed by national budget resources before Project
     completion

  Component IV: Decentralization and Modernization of MINEDUC: This component
  contributed several reforms and innovations both at the central and the departmental levels, as
  well as the construction of a main Office Building, identified as Phase II, that gave the Ministry
  of Education a new internal and external image and notably improved its operation, efficiency
  and administrative effectiveness.

                                   One of MINEDUC's most important achievements was the
                                   establishment of an Evaluation System of School Performance at
National Evaluation System
                                   the national level of student degree candidates, 3rd and 6th graders
                                   and the evaluation of educators.
MINEDUC's building, Phase II       MINEDUC's building was designed, constructed and equipped.

  As a result of the process of reengineering, a new organization chart, and a new Internal Organic By-
  law were put in place as of August 2007 (Governmental Agreement 377-2007), which resulted in
  several reforms, including the unification of the scattered functions of purchasing and finance into two
  regulatory entities: Director of Purchases and Acquisitions­DIDECO - and Director of the Financing
  Unit­DIDEFI.

  The new building housing three independent bodies and four levels was constructed and is in use. The
  building was designed using 21st century architectural guidelines and standards, while maintaining the
  feel of a 20th century building. The building is home to the technical and administrative arms of:
  PRONADE, DIGEEX, DICADE, School Management, DIGEBI, Library, Archive of the Ministry,
  Conference Rooms, and Safety. In addition, the building has two basement parking lots with space for
  144 vehicles. This investment has represented for the Ministry of Education a significant cost reduction
  because it allows them to stop renting offices for the Directorates.


                                                  47
The "Educational Management Information System" subcomponent achieved the following results: (i)
the quality of data entry was improved and decentralized; (ii) statistics are available and presentable
using the Business Objects tool on the ministry's webpage; (iii) the administrative processes of the
Information and Automation System was strengthened at both the central and departmental levels
through the use of Intranet.; and (iv) in the management of Human Resources, a subsystem of
accessible information is available at departmental headquarters and with salary scales already
transferred from the Ministry of Finance.

The ISO Quality Management subcomponent obtained quality assurance such that MINEDUC
became the first Governmental Institution to certify its management system at the national level
and in five Departmental Bureaus of Education (Quetzaltenango, Retalhuleu, Baja Verapaz,
Sacatepéquez and El Progreso) under the requirements of the Standard ISO 9001:2000, which in
turn is accredited by two international entities. Thus, the Ministry is the only Central American
Institution accredited under the English scheme UKAS and the North American scheme ANAB.

III.    Impact and Sustainability of the Project

The project surpassed its targets during the implementation period 2002-2007, concentrating most
of its interventions in the years 2005-2006 and achieving high financial execution (99.993%).
Both aspects were essential to move closer to achieving the Millennium Goal of improving
primary completion rates by the year 2015. The Project contributed to increasing coverage in
rural areas (with an emphasis on reaching indigenous girls), improving the quality and equity of
primary education, especially EBI, and using innovative educational technologies. The project
also made gains in optimizing inter-institutional coordination among the ministries in carrying out
projects and joint actions, and in modernizing and decentralizing the management of the
education system.

The case studies carried out on quality and efficiency interventions, as well as the testimonies of
educators, directors, supervisors, administrative employees, parents and, in some cases students,
attest to the positive impact of the project on improving the quality of teaching and learning, in
both the life of beneficiaries, and in the communities.

MINEDUC now has a modern, decentralized, and de-concentrated management system. This
benefits both internal and external users who can access and use new applications and technology
as tools for monitoring the education system, providing feedback, preparing reports and making
decisions.

In a country like Guatemala, where the demand for education far exceeds the supply, especially in
bilingual and intercultural primary education, the positive impact achieved by the Project is
linked to specific Government actions aimed at the institutional sustainability of activities
financed by the `regular` budget.




                                                48
The sustainability of a project is normally defined by the need to make a transfer of
responsibilities for the execution of given actions for which there is expected to be a degree of
functional or operational continuity. In terms of projects with more than one executing or
financing body it can imply at least two things: i) the execution of activities must be delineated to
a permanent implementing agency and be given some initial and ii) continuity of actions and
processes needs to be agreed upon and achieved so that the final objectives of an action are
reached. By Project completion, concrete actions were established towards achieving
sustainability of project interventions and an enabling environment in order to continue to build
on the interventions carried out.

Some key factors that contributed to the successful execution of the four components of the
project were the significant increase in national financing for girls' scholarships, the intercultural
bilingual education activities and the gradual fulfillment of the commitments of the Peace
Agreements.

With regard to Component I, having surpassed its targets, its performance indicators show an
impact of project activities on efficiency and on the increase in coverage in rural areas. The
Project contributed to diminishing child labor through granting more than 289,333 scholarships to
indigenous girls. This had a favorable multiplier effect on the girls' families and the rural
communities in which they lived; the project thus changed the living conditions of these
populations.

More than 1,300 communities benefited from the Project with the creation of schools that brought
employment opportunities to the communities, through the hiring of teachers. This contributed to
improve the socioeconomic status of these populations. Parents received training on school
management, which contributed to build capacity and enhance competencies in the communities
that will foster the sustainability of these achievements in the rural education system.

In Component II, the strengthening of the multi-grade school model, EBI multi-grade through
the provision of inputs and training achieved a quantitative and qualitative positive impact that
has contributed to an improvement in the learning, education and in the quality of life in rural
areas.

The Multi-grade modality was strengthened through the provision of trainings in "Active
Methodology", which was a common key element for the modalities EBI (intercultural bilingual
education), EDF (Escuelas de Futuro- Schools of the Future) and the PRONADE schools. The
modality is being used by all the trained teachers and students. The EBI modality mainly
supported with training, texts, libraries, bilingual self-learning guides and other inputs,
concentrated on the main 4 Mayan languages (Kiché, Kacqchikel, Queqchi and Mam). The EBI
modality was implemented in the first three grades of elementary and has presented varying range
of use for both Spanish and Mayan languages: from the intense use of the spoken mother and
written tongue, going through bilingual balanced forms, to the use of Spanish as the first language
and indigenous language as a second language, according to the unique make up of each
classroom. There are cases of EBI schools, however, where Spanish is the main language used
due to request of the community. The EDF modality (Schools of the Future), showed very
favorable educational performance results for teachers and students.

The pedagogical models Multigrade, Intercultural Bilingual Education, EBI-Multi-grade and
Schools of the Future, reveal advances in systematization, conceptualization, theorization and
methodological, pedagogical, organizational and operational development. Its implementation has
contributed to the improvement of the national educational system, with implications toward the



                                                 49
private sector concerning the National Curriculum and its related aspects, especially training,
inputs and evaluation system. Upon comparing these modalities with those of other countries with
conditions similar to Guatemala, the elements that have not been incorporated from those are few.

The achievement of Project goals for this component is valid and has been documented.
Interventions took place mainly from mid 2006 to September 2007, and the quality of the
materials was evaluated as acceptable and pertinent. The case study of the Telesecondary-
PRONADE pilot subproject in 8 rural communities of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán; where 4
of them belong to 4 of the municipalities with the most extreme poverty in the country
(Totonicapán, 6º; San Francisco El Alto, 8º; Momostenango, 10º, and Santa María Chiquimula,
11º places; respectively), demonstrated that this methodology would have notably improved
Basic Cycle coverage , as was the case of S.M. Chiquimula, where in 2006, 29 students graduated
from the basic cycle, while the Instituto del Paraje Xecruz de Telesecundaria-PRONADE in 2007
supported by the pilot project, graduated 10 students (about 1/3 of the previously mentioned
graduates). The parents expressed a view that the pilot contributed to improving students' self-
esteem, especially among female students, and to increasing access to low cost education. It has
acted as a mechanism of social protection for students, their families, and the community.

Component III: Cultural Diversity and Pluralism. All activities under this component were
carried out and the objectives and goals for more than half of the activities were surpassed,
contributing to long-term cultural enrichment, the building of human capital, the modernization
and decentralization of the Ministry of Culture and Sports, and cultural diversity and pluralism.
As permanent and visible results, the inter-institutional coordination of the Ministry of Culture
and Sports with the MINEDUC must be mentioned, as well as the National Long-term Cultural
Development Plan that governs the programs, projects, and budget of the cited NMDC, the
successful webpage of this ministry, which shows growing activity in line with the school cycles
and which has already reached a significant international audience, and the development of
decentralized intercultural pilot programs that generated diversity teaching tools in a non-random
fashion.

Evaluation of Component IV: Decentralization and Modernization of the Ministry of
Education. Three aspects were evaluated: a) MINEDUC's institution building; b) strengthening
of the Intercultural Bilingual Education Directorate and of 6 Educational Departmental offices
EBI; and c) the strengthening of school management under COEDUCA and the School Boards.

        (a) MINEDUC's Institution building: Institutional strengthening, which included the
            construction of a new building, encompassed five areas: human resources,
            communication, informatics and an educational information system, reengineering,
            and quality ISO. The latter two were related to all five areas and to the remaining
            administrative and financing functions of the Ministry. The evaluation of the
            component achievements is very positive, as these attainments have transformed
            MINEDUC into a qualitatively different institution, with modern systems and
            processes, automated and de-concentrated, dynamic and efficient.. MINEDUC has
            reliable information on its personnel, an inventory of infrastructure, a new
            information system for the education system with recent and accessible statistics
            available online, a portal with broad information accessible by the educational system
            and the public, an evaluation system, educational research based on international
            standards, and a national computer network with extensive backing of personnel.
            The principal administrative processes at the central level and in the first five
            departments are operated under ISO standards of quality. The evaluation concludes




                                               50
           that MINEDUC is a paradigm to follow for other governmental institutions in
           Guatemala.

       (b) Evaluation of the Institution Building of DIGEBI. Institution building efforts
           covered the organization's principal technical, administrative, and financing areas.
           The evaluation study included a general review of the EBI Latin American model for
           all the languages from the pre-primary level up to some areas of the diversified
           secondary level, decentralized in its management and curriculum, with social
           participation and subject to social control; coordinated with standardizing organs, of
           linguistic development, and for teaching EBI formation in the university. The
           evaluation reviews the Guatemalan ideal model of EBI that affirms values and the
           oral and living transmission in the school area, with contents of own culture, with
           voice mechanisms and social citizen consensus-building (parents, communities) and
           political, with contents that strengthen the national unit and the respect for cultural
           diversity, with contracting and training of master- bilinguals, staff members and
           indigenous technical personnel, with scholarships and study exchanges, with teaching
           language in the native tongue of the child, with learning in two or more languages,
           including ways of learning and teaching the indigenous populations; with EBI
           monitoring and development of EBI indicators and accompaniment of teachers in the
           classroom.

           The evaluation considers that the institution building of DIGEBI was timely and
           pertinent to rationalize its processes, the management of intercultural bilingual
           education and the provision of educational inputs.

           The Project supported the strengthening of six authorities of Intercultural Bilingual
           Education corresponding to the departments of Chimaltenango, Quetzaltenango,
           Totonicapán, Sololá, Alta Verapaz, and Baja Verapaz through the implementation of
           six decentralization subprojects, in order to implement EBI in the classroom and to
           promote the extension and integration of intercultural bilingual education.

       (c) Evaluation of the Strengthening of School Management. Finally, the
           strengthening of the self-managed educational committees (COEDUCAs) for the
           community-based management schools and of the School Boards (Juntas Escolares)
           was carried out with the support of educational service institutions (ISE). It was
           thanks to this support that both modalities of school management improved their
           performance. The evaluation contributes recommendations in order to optimize
           community participation of the COEDUCA, releasing them from the duty of
           managing teachers' salaries so that they can concentrate their interventions on
           management activities.

IV.    Lessons Learned

Component I: Coverage and equity

PRONADE as a transitional solution to increase coverage. The National Community-managed
Program for Educational Development has been a vehicle to expand coverage, however, the
teachers unions and other groups in civil society do not agree with this modality because they
perceive the program as lacking social and civil coverage for teachers. Once this Program is no




                                              51
longer in operation, these aspects need to be taken into consideration as to how they affect
program sustainability.

The scholarships are designed to compensate families, not to directly aid the children. The
scholarships have resulted in immediate compensations to the families to make up for the
opportunity cost of not sending their children to work, especially girls, which gives parents an
incentive to send them school.

Component II: Quality and Efficiency

    (a) The changes of Government every 4 years affect, delay, or modify the achievements
        and implementation of Projects under way. The original design of the IBRD 7052
        Project had to be renegotiated during its execution with at least two different
        administrations of differing political orientation, which means that future Projects should
        consider this variable and have an alternate strategy that minimizes delays and adjustment
        processes that affect the normal development of a Project.

    (b) A comprehensive strategy of technical assistance directed to COEDUCAs and
        School Boards should be articulated. Project activities were implemented by members
        of the COEDUCAs and Juntas Escolares, with very low levels of schooling and literacy,
        which limited their contributions to pedagogical and methodological areas.

    (c) A growing and sustained support for EBI should be maintained to make it
        successful. All administrations, regardless of their political orientation, have backed the
        implementation of the EBI pedagogical model. However, this support has not always
        translated into the institutional support, skilled human resources and budget needed to
        address educational demand with relevance and quality. Government efforts should
        continue to support EBI to ensure that this modality becomes a program supported at the
        national level and provides the best alternative to address the needs of indigenous
        communities with relevance and quality.

    (d) Need to consider a flexible EBI. It is generally accepted that the Intercultural Bilingual
        Education taught in an indigenous language (L1) in the first grades is the best choice to
        achieve better comprehension of the Spanish language (L2) in indigenous communities.
        But, parents also have the constitutional right to choose the education given to their
        children. It is a fact that several indigenous communities disagree and formally oppose
        the teaching of their native tongue to their children, requesting instead that they are
        taught in Spanish and English as well.

Component III: Cultural Diversity and Pluralism

Global impacts. It is expected that the cultural projects will provide a significant contribution to
the global cultural situation of the country. The cultural projects made valid contributions to the
cultural context of the country in the long-term, in terms of cultural enrichment, human capital
through the construction of citizenship, the modernization and decentralization of the State and
the cultural diversity and pluralism in the country.

Enthusiasm for subcomponent goals. There was strong identification with the goals of the
components at all levels of the MCS. Participants were always motivated and put dynamic efforts
in achieving the component's goals. It is expected this will favor sustainability and enhance
support for the implementation of projects of this nature in the future.


                                                52
Pilot project of cultural decentralization was highly participatory at the local level. Upon
carrying out the pilot experiences at the municipal level, there was success in the presentations
with great attendance by participants. They were perceived as great tools to improve national
identity. This points out that if these projects were to be sustained, managed and expanded in a
programmed form and scheduled adequately, they would compensate the lack of cultural events
in the communities, would promote interest in cultural aspects and would be catalysts of inter-
culturalism, diversity and tolerance.

In the component IV Decentralization and Modernization of MINEDUC

    (a) Investment in technology is highly productive and a key factor in modernization.
        The experience of MINEDUC in strengthening the technological processes of the
        institution demonstrated the importance of having an adequate strategy for the use of
        technology as a key support to any process of institutional modernization. Investments in
        the infrastructure of telecommunications, computers, and the development of applications
        had a significant impact, not only on the delivery of services to internal and external
        clients, but on all the sub-systems of work that operate within MINEDUC: human
        resources, internal communications, client services, training, etc.

    (b) Sensitization from the Beginning. As with the reengineering project, the
        implementation of the Quality Management System had the backing of the top authorities
        at MINEDUC. However, the program faced the natural resistance to change among
        middle management of the Ministry and operational personnel. This resistance was
        overcome through a program of sensitization and intensive training implemented in
        parallel to the diagnostic phase. The need for an initial sensitization process is a valuable
        lesson learned for this type of process.

    (c) It is important to measure the impact of communication activities and the cultural
        relevance of campaigns in order to ensure their effectiveness and the achievement of
        expected results. Every massive media campaign requires high investment volume. It
        becomes necessary to evaluate the effectiveness achieved by the messages vis-a-vis each
        audience and to determine the cost­benefit of the investment.

    (d) It is necessary to harmonize the decisions regarding EBI with civil society's opinions.
        Although there was good use of time during the restructuring of EBI, the requests and
        perceptions of civil society should have been taken into account, to ensure a more
        cohesive process.

    (e) The time horizon of EBI strategies should be long-term. All relevant education
        stakeholders have agreed that EBI is needed to improve teaching and learning in
        Guatemala. The process should consider the school as a whole and not just focus on the
        classrooms. Successful schools should be identified as examples to be visited by teachers
        and communities.

    (f) It is desirable to have EBI experts in Departmental offices as supervisors. The
        education system has much difficulty providing support and monitoring to schools, due to
        the lack of resources to finance supervision activities.

V.      Recommendations for a Plan of Action

Expansion of Coverage

        The impact evaluation recommended applying flexible criteria to extend EBI. It should
        consider expanding EBI models to primary levels and to the basic cycle in secondary if
        requested by the communities.

        Need to increase and budget resources for trainings in Active Methodology in Multi-
        grade schools and for pedagogical inputs. Teachers apply it insufficiently in the
        classroom. The training has international recognition and proven efficiency and
        effectiveness in improving teaching and learning.

        Increase and sustain the resources to qualify and equip many new EDF schools, train
        teachers, students, and parents, since there is a significant unsatisfied demand, especially
        because parents tend to require that their children learn to use computers, even in rural
        areas.

        Continue to extend the Telesecondary modality to new geographical areas and give it
        priority to be implemented immediately. The Telesecondary program is a good option to
        meet the growing and highly unsatisfied demand that currently amounts to two-thirds at
        the national level.

Administration

        Strengthen joint school management, but consider its gradual de-concentration.

        Analyze and redefine the criteria to better define and identify EBI schools to be able to
        develop better strategies of planning and intervention.

        Provide sustainability and sufficient resources to the areas supported by the Project,
        regarding Reengineering-Quality ISO, both to maintain the level of modernization by
        replacing equipment when needed, and introducing improvements to maintain the
        certification reached, since high internal savings, reduction of costs have been achieved
        with these interventions, as well as the building of social character.

Finance

        Delegate greater responsibilities in decision-making, as well as budgetary management,
        to each of the 13 Departments, which have EBI responsibilities, so they assume the
        responsibility for its implementation and the provision of pedagogical inputs (training,
        texts, materials, etc.) in each one of its jurisdictions and, gradually, in all the pedagogical
        modalities.

Performance of the Ministry of Education

The performance of MINEDUC was noteworthy, in the management, administration and
financing of the Project, showing high levels of efficiency and fulfillment of its commitments in
terms of counterpart funds.




                                                 54
The Ministry of Education expanded the original objectives of the Project and the logical
framework, without reducing counterpart funds or eliminating budget line items, and this
represented a greater achievement of results and thus a greater impact on educational coverage.

The macro educational issues and their specific subcomponents were inserted to a great extent in
the institutionality of the Ministry of Education, ensuring that the original investments are now
sustainable in the long run and are part of educational policies, commitments that are assumed
beyond the current ministerial and governmental administrations.

The performance of the Ministry of Education is highly satisfactory in the execution and
management of this Loan, which is reflected in the physical results obtained that surpassed the
established goals, in the management of the same through professional specialists in each branch
of the Project and in an efficient use of the financial resources which is reflected in the different
Audits to which the Project was subjected throughout its life.

PERFORMANCE OF THE FINANCIAL ENTITY (WORLD BANK)

The inter-institutional relationship between the World Bank and the Ministry of Education were
throughout the life of the Project very constructive, productive, and proactive creating an
environment conducive to the establishment of a positive relationship, which allowed for
successful Project management and the attainment of Project objectives. The Bank maintained
constant presence through different Field Missions and through meetings with MINEDUC
management, technical personnel and consultants.

The Bank granted clearance for requests in a timely manner and with the technical considerations
that each case warranted. Furthermore, the Bank made available to MINEDUC specialized
technical assistance when necessary and maintained communication at all times.

The Bank facilitated the necessary adjustments to education strategies, monitoring to ensure that
the development objectives of the Project were kept within the Project's logical framework and
that new strategies were consistent with this framework as well.

Annex 10. Assessing the Impact of PRONADE Schools in Guatemala Rural
Education

The objective of this annex is to analyze the performance of PRONADE schools compared to
schools at the national and rural level. For this purpose, it analyzes levels of coverage by sector
(urban-rural), gender, and geographical regions, as well as indicators of student achievement. In
order to compare the relative performance of PRONADE schools, the analysis reviews data from
third and sixth grades. Data was provided by the MINEDUC through the Plataforma Integrada
de Información Social de Guatemala. The analysis is complemented with the results of reading
and math achievement tests of a sample of schools. Another source for this annex is the case
study carried out on the school-based management modalities.

I. General Description of PRONADE Program

Background

The PRONADE community-based school system was the main education model adopted by the
Government to increase coverage and improve the quality of the first years of primary education
in rural and isolated areas of Guatemala, especially targeting female students. PRONADE started
with 19 pilot schools in 1992, and their number increased to 4,683 schools in 2007--representing
25 percent of total primary schools and 33 percent of primary schools in rural areas. PRONADE
schools enrolled 456,058 students in 2007, representing 17 percent of total primary education
students and 29 percent in rural areas. This model has coexisted with other traditional ones.

Implementation arrangements

PRONADE schools were located in indigenous and rural areas. In principle, the schools were to
be located at least three kilometers away from the nearest public primary school. In addition, the
community where the PRONADE school was located had at least 25 primary school aged
children (7-12 years old).

Communities received financing directly from the MINEDUC to cover teacher salaries, learning
materials and school meals. Each community was represented by a Parent School Board (Comité
Educativo de Autogestión Educativa, COEDUCA) responsible for the school management and
teacher hiring. Parents and teachers were given administrative, financial, and pedagogical training
by the Education Services Institutions (Instituciones de Servicios Educativos, ISEs).

Teachers

PRONADE teachers were hired under temporary employment contracts, and their salary and
benefit structure was different from the official teachers' system. In particular, PRONADE
teachers:

   i)      Were hired by communities under a one-year renewable contract.
   ii)     Received a monthly salary equivalent to a first level official system teacher (grade A,
           with one to four years of teaching experience), regardless of the years of teaching
           experience. They received a complementing bonus representing 7% of their annual
           income. The PRONADE system did not increase teacher salary according to years of
           experiences, whereas the official teachers' system does at a rate of 25% every 4 years.
   iii)    Starting in 2006, they had a private medical expenses insurance service.
   iv)     Did not receive formal pension benefits -- supposedly their total compensation had
           been leveled with the official teachers.

II. Analysis of PRONADE schools relative performance.

Enrollment and efficiency

Net enrollment in Guatemala increased from 85 percent to 95 percent between 2000 and 2007. In
a country with a large rural population, Government effort has been directed at increasing
enrollment in the rural areas,
as indicated in Figure 1.
Total enrollment in rural and
urban areas was similar in
1992 (around one million
students each). By 2007
rural enrollment already
accounted for 60 percent of
total enrollment. Along with
the increase in enrollment,
there has been an advance on
school efficiency indicators
at the national level: grade

out rate from 8.6 to 6.1 in
similar period.

A similar trend is observed in primary schools: enrollment in urban areas has increased from
approximately 570,000 students in 1992 to 710,000 in 2007 (a 25 percent increase), whereas
enrollment in rural areas grew from 776,000 to 1.7 million students in the same period (125
percent). Primary level enrollment in rural areas represented 70 percent of total primary school
enrollment in 2007, compared to 52 percent in 1992. Similarly, performance indicators have also
improved but the gap between rural and urban sectors has only been slightly reduced. In 1992,
the repetition rate in rural primary schools was 18.7 percent and has been reduced to 13.1 in 2007,
compared to 12.8 to 7.7 percent in the case of urban areas. In the case of dropout rates, rural
schools improved from 10.6 to 7.0 in the same period, while urban schools have kept it around
4.8 percent.

PRONADE has contributed to increasing coverage in rural primary schools by enrolling 90,613
additional students and adding 1,302 schools to the education system. Due to the absence of
baseline indicators measuring PRONADE school efficiency indicators or student performance, it
is difficult to determine if these schools also contributed to improve education quality in rural
areas. Nonetheless, the main argument in this analysis is that PRONADE schools--given that
they represent a significant part of rural primary enrollment--had an important role at increasing
enrollment in rural areas, while slightly improving or maintaining school efficiency indicators.
Given the student population enrolled in PRONADE schools, this is in itself an achievement.
Regarding student achievement, lack of long-term comparable data make difficult to assess the
impact of PRONADE schools, but data shows that the gap in student achievement between rural
and urban areas are still significant.

  In order to further this argument, Table 2 compares PRONADE school coverage, repetition and
  dropout indicators against national indicators shown in Table 1. Three main trends emerge from
  these indicators: (1) urban schools have lower repetition (in third grade) and dropout rates than
  rural schools; (2) repetition rates had a very slight decrease between 2004 and 2007, while
  dropout rates had a small increase; and (3) sixth grade enrollment in rural areas corresponds to
  less than 60 percent of enrollment in third grade, whereas in the case of urban areas this
  difference never exceeds 25 percent.

  In this context, it is worth looking into the performance of PRONADE schools compared to other
  rural and urban schools Table 2 provides a comparison between PRONADE and other rural
  primary schools (both added represent the total number of students in rural areas).

       Rural coverage increased from 2004 to 2007 and although PRONADE schools increase
       its relative participation compared to other schools in rural areas in some cases, the
       growth trend between both schools is similar. From 2004 to 2007, PRONADE schools
       enrolled 9,700 and 5,700 additional students in third and sixth grade respectively, increasing
       its participation in total rural coverage from 22 to 24 percent in third grade but reducing its
       participation from 23 to 21 percent in the case of sixth grade students. In the case of female
       enrollment in rural areas, PRONADE increased its participation from 22 to 24 percent in third
       grade and reduced its participation in sixth grade from 22 to 20 percent. Therefore,
       PRONADE had an equally important role as regular rural schools in increasing rural
       enrollment.

       Grade repetition rates in rural areas for the third and sixth grade have only slightly
       changed. From 2004 to 2007, overall primary level repetition rates in rural areas have been
       reduced from 15.3 to 13.1 percent. However, repetition rates in third and sixth grade have
       remained almost unchanged (under one percent in rural and urban areas). This suggests that
       repetition rates in Guatemala are higher in lower grades. This conclusion is similar for both
       gender groups.

       Dropout rates have slightly improved in the case of PRONADE schools. PRONADE
       schools' dropout rates slightly declined between 2004 to 2007 for both male and female
       students. At the same time, there was an increase in urban schools and rural non-PRONADE
       ones. However, this reduction was too small to offset the overall increment of dropout rates


                                                   62
    in rural areas, which increased from 5.3 to 6.0 percent. Moreover, dropout rates are, on
    average, higher in rural areas than in urban ones, suggesting that the gap between both areas
    has not been closed, although it has reduced slightly.

Quality

In the case of student achievement, data available allows comparing math and reading exams
from a sample of students from PRONADE, urban and other rural schools, though with some
limitations. Comparable data is only available for multi-grade schools for 2006-2007, but data in
2006 allows comparing with other schools in the system. In general, student achievement has
been grouped into four categories: (i) failing, (ii) to improve, (iii) successful, and (iv) excellent.
Table 3 includes the results of a sample of students at the national level.

Table 4 shows the assessment results comparing PRONADE students to those of other rural
students and to urban students. In 2006, with data available at the national level, PRONADE
students achieving successful and excellent in reading totaled 15.6 percent, compared to 23.5 in
non-PRONADE rural students and 41.1 percent in urban students. In mathematics PRONADE
students had a smaller gap with non-PRONADE rural students but a very large gap with their
urban comparison: PRONADE students totaled 25.4 percent in successful and excellent,
compared to 29.3 percent in non-PRONADE rural students and 45.3 percent in urban students.

In terms of gender differences, among PRONADE students males and females had similar results
in reading tests but males had a stronger performance in mathematics. At the same time, non-
PRONADE female students had significantly better results than PRONADE female students:
16.2 percent of PRONADE students totaled successful and excellent in reading, compared to 31.3
percent non-PRONADE students. In mathematics, 20.5 percent achieved successful and
excellent, compared to 40.5 percent of non-PRONADE female students. These gaps are much
smaller, and sometimes favoring female students, when comparing only non-PRONADE students.

  In the case of 2007 data, available only for multi-grade schools, 13.7 percent of PRONADE
  students achieved successful and excellent grade, while 16.9 percent of non-PRONADE school
  students achieved similar grade in reading test. This situation compares to 45.6 percent in math
  tests in PRONADE schools and 49.5 percent in NO PRONADE schools. Although data does not
  allow for an accurate comparison (not the same schools or the same students), 4 PRONADE
  students in 2007 did better than the previous year in math test: 35.4 percent of students achieved
  successful and excellent in 2006 compared to 45.6 the following year. The situation is similar
  when comparing achievement rates between female and male students across years. However,
  this is not the case in the reading test, where the percentage of students practically not changed.
  Another observation, with the caveat of the comparison problems, is that the performance gap
  between PRONADE students and non-PRONADE rural students seem to have been reduced
  between 2006 and 2007 in the reading assessments, while remaining stagnant in mathematics.

   Achievement tests were performed in a sample of schools, and they include some PRONADE schools.
  Since the sample was not specifically planned to test PRONADE school students achievement, the analysis
  selected PRONADE schools among the sample and compared to other schools. Therefore, it may be the
  case that PRONADE schools within this sample are not strictly comparable.

In general, this result is consistent with those of Valerio and Rojas (2004) who found that average
scores for PRONADE students are lower than other public schools in urban and rural areas, but
this factor may be explained by the "lower base from which many of the PRONADE students
begin, and the relative disadvantaged position of the communities from where the students
come."5 A previous study,6 using test instruments developed by the UNESCO's Regional Office
in Latin American and the Caribbean (OREALC), found that PRONADE's students scored lower
than other comparable rural schools. Nevertheless, when these results corrected to include
student's background factors, the study found that PRONADE students achieved higher scores in
Spanish tests.

Given the above data, including the comparison limitations, one can conclude the following:

        PRONADE clearly contributed to primary school coverage in Guatemala. Given
        MINED's criteria for opening such schools, it is safe to assume that PRONADE reached
        remote areas that had lacked access to schooling before. This is likely the greatest
        contribution of these schools to Guatemala.

        There is lack of sufficient data to determine if PRONADE schools had an impact on
        student repetition and dropout rates, as compared to non-PRONADE schools. Available
        data shows that repetition rates were comparable to non-PRONADE schools in third and
        sixth grades, while drop-out rates were better among PRONADE students. At the same
        time, given the student group covered by PRONADE schools, simply maintaining
        indicators aligned with the national average may be an achievement in itself.

        In terms of student achievement, overall rural student performance is inferior to their
        urban counterparts. PRONADE students also fare slightly worse than their rural
        counterparts. Nonetheless, the available data indicates a significant improvement in the
        area of mathematics and closing the gap with non-PRONADE rural students in the area
        of reading.

School- based management through the COEDUCAS: an explanation of the PRONADE
school performance?

Parents' school boards in PRONADE schools (COEDUCAS) were an innovative school
management modality implemented as part of the project. In a case study carried out in 20087
MINEDUC analyzed the COEDUCA model as well as regular schools (Juntas Escolares).

Some of the main characteristics of the Parents' school boards in PRONADE schools
(COEDUCAS) were:

       MINEDUC had a contractual relationship with the COEDUCA and the COEDUCA had a
       contractual relationship with the teachers. The contract defined the rights and obligations
       of each part. Parents had the responsibility to hire, pay, renew contracts, and fire teachers.
       Contracts were signed for one year and could be renewed by the COEDUCA.

       Teachers in PRONADE schools did not participate in the COEDUCAs, while teachers in
       regular schools had representatives in the Junta Escolar, which in principle would give
       parents greater independence versus teachers.

       In the case of PRONADE schools, supervision was done through the system created
       under PRONADE. PRONADE developed a well integrated supervision system, which
       was applied to follow up and support school management and involved all actors
       (teachers, students, schools and the COEDUCAS). This system was not under the
       umbrella of the departmental offices while the regular schools, its teachers and Juntas
       Escolares were supervised by the departmental offices.

School-based management through COEDUCAs brought the following results and lessons:

       COEDUCAS proved to be part of an effective strategy to decentralize resources and
       competencies from the state to civil society. The strategy was effective to increase access
       to primary education in rural areas and better focus MINEDUC's resources on the poorer
       populations.

       MINEDUC delegated all of the functioning aspects of the PRONADE schools to the
       COEDUCAS. The scope of responsibility of the COEDUCAS was broader than the
       scope of the Juntas Escolares (as indicated above) which managed the financial resources
       allocated to the schools for support programs.

       Rural communities strengthened its organizational and participation levels as a result of
       being responsible to manage school matters. There was a qualitative change in the
       community's organizational arrangements and in the participation arrangements as well.
       The study found the school boards worked with adequate levels of local democratic
       participation.

       Parent participation in the school life increased as a result of their involvement
       participation in the COEDUCAS. This brought two positive effects: a higher number of
       school days ­ which reached 180 in the case of PRONADE ­ and greater flexibility in the
       school calendar, in some instances, to better adapt to the needs of the community.

         Parents, through the COEDUCAs, have exerted a positive pressure on the teachers,
         pushing teachers to fulfill their obligations. This was due to their power to hire, pay,
         renew contracts, and fire teachers8.

         Parents demonstrated strong interest in managing the resources decentralized by
         MINEDUC. This contributed to improve the management of school resources,
         encouraging greater control on how the resources were spent.

         The main elements of a COEDUCA successful operation were: (i) team work and
         collaboration between parents, teachers and community members; (ii) participation in
         training workshops; and (iii) good follow up by the ISE.

         COEDUCAS have created social capital in the communities they worked for a longer
         period of time and the communities have viewed them as enabling local development.

  Juntas Escolares are school boards which were created in regular schools to decentralize some functions
to schools. According to the study previously mentioned on school-based management modalities, parents
in the Juntas Escolares exerted certain pressure on teachers by monitoring teachers' activities through their
presence in the schools. This contributed to improve the quality on the service provision.
