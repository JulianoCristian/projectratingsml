assist the Government of Tonga (GoT) to implement key\n            aspects of its medium-term reform agenda, while providing a\n            predictable flow of resources in a challenging fiscal\n            environment. Tonga's economy is beginning to recover\n            from the series of crises that have buffeted it in recent\n            years, but the incipient recovery is dependent on external\n            support. Tonga is a small, remote economy that is highly\n            vulnerable to external shocks and dependent on a limited\n            number of sources of foreign exchange. In recent years,\n            Tonga has undertaken a number of important public sector and\n            economic reforms, but robust economic growth has remained\n            elusive. Over the last four years, the series of crises that\n            have buffeted the Tongan economy have caused economic\n            contraction, a significant fiscal gap, and rising poverty.\n            The multi-year programmatic series of operations will assist\n            the GoT to appropriately sequence key public sector and\n            economic reforms over a medium-term time horizon, while\n            supporting the GoT's capacity to deliver services in a\n            challenging fiscal environment. The operation carries a high\n            risk on account of the limited institutional capacity of the\n            GoT, the recent nature of Tonga's political reforms,\n            and Tonga's uncertain external environment."}, "docdt": "2011-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
