             Tonga: Economic Recovery Operation (Development Policy Grant)

                                 SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

                                 Meeting of Executive Directors
                                           November 22, 2011


       The Executive Directors approved the Economic Recovery Operation (Development
Policy Grant) for the Kingdom of Tonga in the amount of SDR 5.8 million (US$9 million
equivalent) on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum
(IDA/R2011-0296).

        Executive Directors expressed support for the Economic Recovery Operation and
recognized the importance of the Government’s reform measures being implemented in response
to the exogenous shocks that have buffeted the Tongan economy in recent years. Directors
welcomed the close collaboration among development partners and emphasized the importance
of further progress with structural reforms to enhance Tonga’s long-term growth prospects.
Given Tonga’s high risk of debt distress, Directors noted the importance of Tonga’s commitment
not to undertake new borrowing until debt is brought back within acceptable limits. Directors
also encouraged continued attention to private sector development, renewable energy and
disaster risk mitigation.
