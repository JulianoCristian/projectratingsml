           follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: budget support can serve as a\n            solid platform for government-donor dialogue on economic\n            policy issues. An important benefit of the project was\n            increased and more open policy dialogue with government on a\n            range of economic management issues, including public debt\n            and new borrowing, expenditure allocations and priorities,\n            and economic reform priorities. Adequate investment in\n            policy dialogue is vital but resource intensive. Success of\n            the program relied on development of close working\n            relationships with both government and other donors\n            providing budget support. Project-level engagement can\n            assist in identifying key priorities to be supported through\n            policy-based operations. Close coordination and engagement\n            with other development partners in the identification of\n            policy priorities is useful in sectors where the Bank has\n            limited knowledge and engagement. Coordinated management of\n            international aid flows, in the context of prudent fiscal\n            policy, can provide vital support in mitigating the impacts\n            of external shocks in the Pacific Islands."}, "docdt": "2013-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
