H. Restructuring (if any)
1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Tonga is a small, remote economy that is highly vulnerable to external shocks and
dependent on a limited number of sources of foreign exchange. Tonga has a very small
population of 104,000 and is extremely remote from its major markets. Small size and remoteness
combine to push up the cost of economic activity, limiting the scope for Tonga’s exports of goods
and services to be competitive in world markets, and to raise the cost of public services. Like
other small, remote economies, Tonga depends on a limited number of sources for its foreign
exchange earnings – the main one being remittances from the large number of Tongans who live
and work abroad, which have averaged around 30 percent of GDP over the last decade. The
openness of Tonga’s economy and the lack of diversification of its sources of foreign exchange
make Tonga highly vulnerable to external economic shocks. Its geographical characteristics also
make it highly vulnerable to natural disasters.

2.       The Tongan economy entered the global economic crisis in a vulnerable state.
Remittance flows to Tonga peaked as a proportion of GDP in 2004/05, following which they
declined substantially in the years prior to the global economic crisis – possibly reflecting the
aging of emigrant stocks and weakening relationship links. With heavy reliance on imported food
products and energy, the global food and fuel crisis led to inflation of 12 percent in 2008. Price
hikes disproportionately impacted on poor, urban households – highly reliant on cash incomes in
the absence of subsistence opportunities – and the current account deficit widened to 14.7 percent
of GDP by 2009. Growth momentum was further weakened by a contraction of domestic credit
following a poorly-judged lending surge on behalf of commercial banks in late 2007 and 2008.
Non-performing loans peaked at 20 percent in mid-2009, with a 25 percent contraction in credit
to the private sector between 2008/09 and FY2010/11, as banks became increasingly risk-averse.
The Government contracted a large loan in 2007 from the China EXIM bank for reconstruction
work in Nuku’alofa following civil disturbances in 2006, reducing capacity for sustainable
additional borrowing.

3.      The global economic crisis had a severe impact on remittances and exports. With
economic slowdown in key remittance sending countries – the US (where over 50 percent of
Tonga’s remittances originate), New Zealand and Australia – the decline in remittances
accelerated. From 31.1 percent of GDP in FY2007/08, remittance receipts fell by 13.6 percent
and 10.1 percent over the next two years, to reach 22.5 percent of GDP in FY2009/10. At the
same time, with New Zealand, Australia, and the United States also being Tonga’s largest tourist
markets, Tonga’s tourist receipts declined by 13.3 percent in FY2009/10. Led by falls in
agricultural and fish exports, merchandise exports also continued their declining trend in
FY2008/09 and FY2009/10.

4.      Natural disasters contributed to hardship and impeded economic management. In
September 2009, Tonga was buffeted by a tsunami, causing loss of life and significant material
damage, particularly in the outlying Niuas island group. In February 2010, a cyclone affected the
whole of the archipelago, with the worst impact in the Vava’u island group, causing widespread
material damage. In February 2011, a cyclone hit the Ha’apai island group, causing significant
damage to infrastructure and housing. In February 2012, cyclone Jasmine caused widespread
flooding in Nuku’alofa and associated damage to property and businesses. Aside from the private
costs of the natural disasters, these events caused periodic diversion of public resources away

from implementing the development program of the Government and towards immediate
reconstruction needs.

5.      The crisis had a major impact on Government revenues. In FY2008/09 and
FY2009/10, tax revenue fell 6.4 and 11.3 percent in nominal terms. Falling remittances fed
through into declining imports, and consequent reductions in consumption tax, import duty and
excise revenue. While revenue policy settings remain appropriate and in line with regional
comparators, the revenue impacts of remittance declines have generated pressure to consolidate
expenditure and identify alternative financing sources.

6.      The programmatic series of two Tonga Economic Recovery Operations were
designed to support the Government of Tonga in implementing key aspects of its medium-
term reform agenda, while providing a predictable flow of resources in a challenging fiscal
environment. The operations were implemented to help meet a clear need for budget support in
the context of lingering impacts of the global economic crisis and the weak global recovery,
including rising poverty, falling remittance flows, a large contraction in tax revenues, and poor
export performance. The operations supported the reform agenda of Tonga’s first majority-
elected parliament at a critical juncture in Tonga’s development process.

7.       At appraisal, Tonga’s economic prospects were expected to improve, but downside
risks were recognized. Tonga’s economy was expected to grow by 1.7 percent in FY2011/12
and by about 1.8 percent over the medium term, underpinned by sustained high levels of external
support. The projection for FY2011/12 was based on modest recoveries in tourism and remittance
receipts, significant levels of budget support to finance government expenditure, and high levels
of construction activity financed by the China EXIM bank loans for civil works in and around
Nuku’alofa.1 Inflation was expected to remain at around 5.8 percent, as a result of continued high
global commodity prices, particularly for food and fuel, and reflecting historical trends. Fiscal
pressures were expected to be met through both ongoing budget support assistance and fiscal
consolidation on both the revenue and expenditure side – specifically through successful
implementation of a public sector hiring freeze and various revenue administration and policy
reforms. The risks associated with continued poor performance in remittance and exports, and
vulnerability to broader global conditions, were explicitly recognized in both relevant IMF
Article IV reports and in the program documents.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.      The PDO for the operations was to “assist the Government of Tonga to implement
key aspects of its medium-term reform agenda, while providing a predictable flow of
resources in a challenging fiscal environment”. Key outcomes and indicators were specified
against each of the policy areas (see Section 1.5) and are listed in the table below:

  Following the initial loan for reconstruction of Nuku’alofa following the 2006 disturbance, an additional
loan was contracted for a major road project in 2010.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

9.     The Program Development Objective was not revised. Several Outcome Indicators
were revised, however. The following table lists outcome indicators that were removed between
Board approval of the first and second operations and an explanation for these changes.

Removed Outcome Indicators                    Explanation

                                              outcome indicators were dropped from the program document for
                                              the second operation.

                                               These outcome indicators were to have been achieved through
                                              the following proposed trigger for the second operation: “The

                                                         3
                                            A tariff review was required to inform the development of a new
                                            electricity tariff. Cabinet agreement to that review was included
                                            as a prior action under the first economic recovery operation. Due
                                            to implementation delays, however, including in the mobilization
                                            of required technical assistance from development partners, the
                                            review was not completed in time for the implementation of a
                                            new tariff within timeframes for the second operation.

                                            The review has now been completed and is being considered by
                                            Government and donors. Changes to the electricity tariff based on
                                            review findings are expected over the next 18 months, following
                                            necessary consultation.

                                            Due to Government’s implementation of a Community Service
                                            Obligation for Tonga Power Limited, full cost recovery has been
                                            achieved. Grant-financed construction of solar generation assets
                                            has proceeded, leading to diversification in the energy mix. This
                                            progress occurred despite the fact that the tariff review was
                                            completed and revisions to the tariff not implemented.
The existing public enterprise              This outcome was expected to be achieved partly through the

to reduce their share to one third of the
portfolio                                   Progress towards privatization was slower than expected due to
                                            changes in Government policy regarding the appropriate scope of
                                            private participation. The Government, with IFC support,
                                            remained committed to some form of public-private partnership.
                                            But the action could not be completed in the timeframes required
                                            by the second operation, given the time required for full
                                            consideration of options and necessary due diligence.

                                            The Government has since agreed to proceed with a concession
                                            contract for private participation in the Dateline Hotel. This
                                            policy action has been supported under a subsequent series of

Additional Outcome Indicators             Explanation
Growth in the cost of exemptions is       Under the first operation, a trigger was included regarding the
curtailed                                 implementation of reforms recommended by an ongoing tax
                                          policy and administration review. This review had been
                                          completed by the time of the second operation, leading to the
                                          inclusion of a more specific prior action: “Details regarding the
                                          cost by category of tax expenditure during the previous year have
                                          been published in the annual budget statement for FY2012/13”.

                                          This outcome indicator was therefore included to measure the
                                          impact of increased transparency in stemming the granting of
                                          exemptions.
Costs of doing business are reduced       Given unexpected delays in progress against certain reforms in
                                          the energy sector, the Government agreed to prioritize other
                                          structural reforms, including to the business regulatory
                                          environment. An additional policy action was included in the
                                          second operation: “The Recipient’s Cabinet has approved the
                                          submission to parliament of legislative changes to reduce the
                                          number of business license classes and extend license duration”.

                                          This outcome indicator reflects the improvements to the business
                                          regulatory environment expected to be achieved through this
                                          additional action.

                                          portfolio of SOEs discussed above.


11.    The full list of revised outcomes and indicators as approved for the second operation
are shown in the table below:

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

12.     Four Policy Areas were initially identified: i) Strengthening Public Financial
Management; ii) Strengthening Fiscal Policy; iii) Promoting Structural Reform; iv) Supporting
Social Protection.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

13.      During approval for the second operation, the “Supporting Social Protection” policy
area was dropped. This reflects Government’s decision that it was not able to proceed with
implementation of the community public works scheme in the absence of expected donor
financing. Implementation of the community public works scheme was the only policy action in
this policy area.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

15.    Political commitment remained strong in relation to PFM, fiscal policy, and
business environment reforms. This commitment was maintained for three main reasons:

        Firstly, unfavorable economic conditions encouraged continued political focus on PFM,
         fiscal policy, and business environment reforms. Remittance and tourism receipts
         continued to decline in real terms throughout the period of the program, placing pressure
         on government revenues. With limited space for new borrowing and pressure to maintain
         public services in the face of declining revenues, Government remained committed to
         ensuring efficient use of available resources, raising revenue from new sources, and
         opening new avenues for economic growth. In the context of declining real Government
         expenditure, difficult reforms were successfully implemented, including the exertion of
         control over wage bill growth and use of the contingency fund, while new external
         borrowing was avoided.


                                                             8
           Secondly, supported policy areas and actions reflected the genuine priorities of the
            Government and were championed by successive Ministers of Finance. 2 The program
            was designed to support Government’s reform program through a coordinated process of
            policy dialogue between government and donors. A Government/donor committee was
            established to facilitate policy dialogue between Government and donors, chaired by the
            Secretary of Finance. Through this process, the Ministry of Finance maintained a strong
            voice in identifying a limited number of its own reform priorities for inclusion as prior
            actions for budget support. Successive Ministers of Finance, as key champions of
            supported reforms, provided important political support and were repeatedly consulted
            during program design. This process ensured that problems with the implementation of
            policy actions within the Minister of Finance’s areas of responsibility could be addressed
            at an early stage.
           Thirdly, donors working on economic and business environment reforms coordinated
            closely to support the process. Donors worked together to develop a joint policy matrix,
            with several donors providing budget support against the same policy actions and using a
            common monitoring framework. Donors conducted several joint missions during the
            preparation of both operations to ensure joint understanding of the process and monitor
            progress with implementation of policy actions. Close coordination ensured clear and
            open dialogue with Government, avoided proliferation of policy actions, and ensured
            reform efforts were targeted towards a small number of shared priorities.

16.      Political support for reforms in the energy sector was uneven. Between the first and
second operations, emphasis moved significantly away from planned reforms in the energy sector.
This reflected the absence of a political champion for energy reforms and disagreements at the
political level regarding the appropriate model for energy sector development in Tonga. As a
consequence, progress with revising the electricity tariff and implementing broader petroleum
sector regulatory reforms took longer than initially expected and these triggers were dropped. The
Bank has continued to support progress in these areas under a subsequent DPO series as well as
through TA and project-level engagements.

17.     The operation drew on extensive background analysis. The operation was informed by
extensive analytical work and knowledge acquired through existing project engagements in all
policy areas. PFM and fiscal reforms were informed by a World Bank expenditure mapping
exercise, which provided a detailed picture of budgetary allocations and execution performance
over the previous decade. Reforms in the energy sector were informed by World Bank energy
sector TA, relating to both petroleum sector and electricity reforms. Revenue reforms were
informed by a detailed IMF/PFTAC review, with World Bank participation, completed in 2011.
Structural reforms, including reform of SOEs, were informed by ADB analytical products and TA
engagements. Existing knowledge and relationships helped ensure that policy actions were well-
focused and that reforms could be supported through technical assistance when required.

18.      Risks relating to capacity constraints were identified and planned for, but capacity
gaps slowed progress in some areas. The team accurately identified potential risks from
capacity constraints within the Tongan Government. While many highly skilled and committed
officials played key roles in implementing supported reforms, staff shortages and high turnover
led to problems in several areas. Failure to maintain progress with quarterly fiscal reports and

reporting on tax expenditure in the budget statement reflected the departure of key staff from the
Ministry of Finance’s budget team. Energy sector reforms were hampered by a lack of capacity
within the Tonga Energy Roadmap Implementation Unit. Donors, however, coordinated carefully
to ensure sufficient technical assistance was available to support other reform actions that strained
available government capacity. At various times, technical assistance from the World Bank,
Asian Development Bank, and IMF/PFTAC was provided to the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Revenue, the Tonga Energy Roadmap Implementation Unit, the Ministry of
Commerce and the Ministry of Public Enterprises to assist with reforms included in the joint
matrix. The need for technical assistance support was explicitly recognized by donors and
Government from an early stage, with technical assistance requirements being defined as policy
actions were agreed. Without this assistance, progress against more actions may have been
delayed given very thin capacity in many areas of the Tongan bureaucracy. The program
document also explicitly recognized the need for flexibility in the choice of actions, given the
inevitable risks associated with very thin capacity in Pacific Island contexts.

19.      Other identified risks did not pose major obstacles to program implementation.
Risks were also identified in relation to: i) political instability following recent democratizing
reforms; ii) exposure to external economic conditions and shocks; and iii) reliance on continued
grant support for the maintenance of fiscal sustainability. A Cabinet reshuffle occurred during
preparation of the second operation, leading to a change in the Minister of Finance. Government
commitment to reforms remained strong, however, as discussed above. This reflected the team’s
efforts to build support and consult widely beyond the Minister of Finance when selecting reform
actions. While external economic conditions remained unfavorable, Tonga did not face major
economic shocks or natural disasters. Unfavorable economic conditions and fiscal pressures may
have contributed to stronger reform commitment. Donors were able to mobilize required project
and budget support grants to avert the need for large fiscal contraction during the term of the
program.

20.      The design of the operation was satisfactory. The program was designed as a
programmatic series of two operations, with a focus on PFM, fiscal policy, structural, and social
protection reforms. These policy areas were highly relevant, given the context of economic slow-
down and fiscal pressures driven by the decline in remittance and tourism receipts. The objectives
of improving efficiency in the use of public resources, expanding the revenue base, opening new
opportunities for growth through structural reforms, and supporting social protection reflected a
coherent response to the challenges faced by Tonga. While the second operation saw some
narrowing of focus, with actions relating to the energy sector and social protection being dropped,
this was an appropriate response to unforeseen changes in circumstances – specifically, capacity
constraints to and uneven political support for energy sector reforms, and a shortfall in resources
available to the Government of Tonga to implement the planned community public works scheme.
The need for a flexible approach and the risks associated with capacity constraints in a small
Pacific Island Country context were clearly identified at the outset.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

21.      M&E design was intended to reflect a collaborative and coordinated approach
between donors and government. The Budget Support Management Committee was established
during the first operation as a means of both reaching agreement on policy actions to be included
in the joint policy matrix between government and donors and monitoring progress against
actions. Secretaries of all relevant ministries were represented on the committee, along with the
World Bank as coordinating donor. Budget Support Management Committee meetings were to be
held bi-monthly and allowed progress towards policy actions to be regularly monitored and


                                                 10
technical assistance to be mobilized when problems arose. The approach was intended to reflect
the status of the joint policy matrix as a statement of government’s own policy priorities, with the
Budget Support Management Committee allowing information sharing both with donors and
within Government on progress with reform implementation.

22.      M&E design was intended to avoid additional burdens on overstretched
government capacity. M&E was intended to be undertaken largely through the same mechanism
used for program design (i.e. the Budget Support Management Committee). Donors also worked
hard to harmonize outcome indicators and evidence requirements for prior actions. This approach
reflected the importance of streamlined M&E approaches in data-poor and thin-capacity Pacific
contexts, where elaborate quantitative M&E frameworks would risk distracting available capacity
from program implementation.

23.      Implementation of M&E was generally effective. The Budget Support Management
Committee approach worked well as a mechanism for information sharing and coordination.
Through Budget Support Management Committee meetings, the Bank was able to effectively
monitor progress against reform actions, collect evidence of reform implementation, and gather
data to monitor progress against outcomes. The process, however, was resource intensive for both
the Ministry of Finance, as secretariat for the committee, and for the Bank as coordinating donor.
Large investment in the establishment of this committee during the early stages of the process is
likely to have been worthwhile, however, with resource requirements on both the Bank and the
Ministry of Finance subsequently declining as the process (including institutional procedures of
participating donors, data needs, and information requirements) came to be better understood by
all parties.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

24.     A follow-up series of development policy operations is now underway. The World
Bank has prepared a programmatic series of two development policy operations focused on the
same policy areas. The new series provides a continuation of budget support assistance into
subsequent fiscal years. The new program will build on the achievements of the first
programmatic series. Key reforms expected to be supported by the new series of development
policy operations include: i) further PFM reforms, including the implementation of tighter
controls on the use of the contingency fund; ii) cabinet agreement to a new procurement reform
action plan; iii) preparation of legislation for the natural resource and presumptive tax regimes
following policy decisions supported under the previous series of operations; iv) restructuring or
the introduction of private participation in the operation of key SOEs, including Tonga
Telecommunication Corporation and the International Dateline Hotel; and v) further progress
with business licensing reforms, including the introduction of an online system for registration of
business names.

25.     The new series of development policy operations has benefited from the
coordination and monitoring arrangements developed under the previous operations. Policy
actions for the new series of operations were agreed through the Budget Support Management
Committee. The proven success of this mechanism has encouraged continued participation by
other donors providing budget support in the development of a joint policy matrix through
coordinated dialogue. The European Union, the Asian Development Bank, and AusAID are now
providing budget support assistance alongside the World Bank against the joint policy matrix.

3. Assessment of Outcomes


                                                11
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance to Country Priorities

26.      The program was relevant to country priorities as stated in the national
development plan - the Tonga Strategic Development Framework. Public financial
management reforms were generally aligned with the objective of good governance specified in
the development strategy, particularly with respect to accountability and transparency, as well as
the enabling theme on good fiscal management. The fiscal policy reforms aligned with enabling
themes on good fiscal management and the efficiency and effectiveness of government. The
structural reforms were aligned with private sector and infrastructure objectives, as well as the
enabling theme on public enterprises. Social protection reforms were aligned with the first
objective, of building strong, inclusive communities.

27.     The program was relevant to immediate challenges and priorities. Policy areas and
actions were focused on addressing immediate challenges in the context of declining remittances
and tourism receipts. The Bank and Government shared a common concern with improving
efficiency in the use of public resources, supporting a recovery in government revenues, and
opening opportunities from new sources of private sector growth. Extensive dialogue with
government through the Budget Support Management Committee process was useful in ensuring
continued consensus regarding policy priorities. Government’s broad commitment to

Relevance to Bank Priorities

28.      The program was well-aligned with Bank priorities as stated in the CAS. The first
theme in the CAS is supporting policy reform to strengthen economic growth prospects and to
improve service delivery. The program contributed mainly to this theme through focus on policy
actions aimed at: i) strengthening critical aspects of public financial management; ii) supporting
fiscal policy reforms that underpin the delivery of services, including revenue effort, expenditure
quality and control of the civil service wage bill; and iii) supporting essential structural reforms,
including in the energy sector, in the public enterprise portfolio and in private sector development.
Development policy operations are specifically mentioned in the CAS as a potential mechanism
to support policy engagement and vital reforms.

29.     The operation was aligned with other Bank operations in Tonga. The program
occurred during a period in which the Bank was rapidly scaling up its investments in Tonga,
especially in the roads, aviation, and energy sectors. Through the program of DPOs the Bank was
able to influence key policy issues to support the achievement of development objectives from
investment projects. At the same time, project engagements provided a knowledge base from
which to engage in discussion of policy priorities across a broader range of areas. The program of
DPOs served a useful purpose in broadening the Bank’s policy dialogue with government to
include macroeconomic challenges and fiscal management issues where the Bank has since
become an important partner.

Relevance of Design and Implementation

30.     Program design was appropriate to context. Building on lessons learned in other small
Pacific Island Countries, both operations focused on small number of strategic policy actions
(seven policy actions supported under each operation). Policy actions were selected to take
account of capacity constraints facing government, ensuring that actions could either be delivered
with available capacity or that additional technical assistance would be available from


                                                12
development partners. With several donors providing budget support, heavy emphasis was
appropriately placed on coordination to avoid the proliferation of policy actions and the diffusion
of reform capacity. Monitoring arrangements were appropriate and relatively streamlined, with
the Budget Support Management Committee serving as a mechanism for agreeing policy actions
between donors and Government, mobilizing required support, and monitoring progress.

31.     Relevance of outcome indicators was somewhat mixed. While most outcome
indicators represented a clear and measurable metric for assessing progress towards development
objectives, others were not as clear and not as strongly linked to development objectives as they
might have been. With hindsight, the outcome indicator for control of the wage bill was specified
inappropriately, with greater-than-expected progress towards the specified outcome (limiting
overspending in the wage bill) leading to an underspend that exceeded the target variance (the
underspend was greater than the variance allowed for in the outcome indicator, which was based
on the implicit assumption of continued overspending).


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

32.     Progress towards Program Development Objectives is assessed in terms of
achievement of the program’s outcome indicators. The PDO for the program was quite broad
and framed as an input. Progress towards this objective is not easily assessed. For this reason,
achievement of the PDO is assessed in terms of the progress towards outcome indicators. As
discussed above, outcome indicators were adapted to changing circumstances between the first
and second operations. The following table shows baselines, targets, and a rating for all outcome
indicators included under both the first and second operations.

33.     Adequate progress was achieved against outcome indicators in the area of
‘strengthening public financial management’.

      Progress towards increased budget credibility was achieved, with variance in the primary
       expenditure composition exceeding the overall variance by less than 5 percent in
       FY2011/12 and in FY2012/13. This reflects continued efforts by the authorities towards
       close monitoring of expenditure at the ministry level, with Ministry of Finance officials
       periodically briefing Cabinet on budget execution trends. The outcome also reflects
       reduced allocations to the “contingency fund” – historically used to finance a broad range
       of between-budget expenditures, rather than just unavoidable contingencies – from
       TOP$6 million in FY2009/2010 to just TOP$2 million by FY2012/2013. The rating for
       achievement against this outcome indicator is highly satisfactory.

      Public access to key fiscal information increased during the FY2012/13 budget, but these
       gains were not sustained. For the FY2012/13 budget process a complete set of budget
       documents were able to be obtained by the public through the Ministry of Finance
       website at the time it was submitted to the legislature. In the FY2013/14 budget, however,
       while the approved budget was made publicly available, the budget proposal was not
       made publicly available. In-year budget execution reports were prepared and routinely
       made available to the public on the Ministry of Finance website (within one month of
       their completion) until the second half of FY2012/13, when staff changes led to delays in
       the preparation of reports and staff capacity was diverted during the budget process, amid
       significant staff turnover and several vacancies. Year-end financial statements for
       FY2011/12, however, were made available to the public through government gazette
       within six months of completed audit. The rating for achievement against this outcome
       indicator is moderately unsatisfactory.

34.     Significant progress was achieved against outcome indicators in the area of
‘strengthening fiscal policy’.

      The specified outcome target was over-achieved (the outturn for the government-funded
       public service wage bill was less than the budgeted allocation) and the associated policy
       outcome of wage bill control has been achieved. This is largely due to the
       implementation of the prior action relating to centralization of hiring authority within the
       Ministry of Finance and the Public Service Commission. In contrast to the historical
       experience of the wage bill exceeding initial appropriations because of inadequate
       controls, variance in both FY2011/12 and FY2012/13 was due to substantial under-
       expenditure in the context of the recently-implemented hiring freeze. The hiring freeze
       has been effective in arresting uncontrolled growth in the wage will, with all
       establishment appointments now requiring joint approval of the Public Service
       Commission and the Ministry of Finance. All new appointments continue to be required
       to meet objective criteria for ‘vital’ appointments as assessed by the Public Service
       Commission. The rating for achievement against this outcome indicator is satisfactory.

      The cost of exemptions on consumption tax and duties decreased as a proportion of total
       revenue from consumption tax and duties to 28 percent in FY2011/12 and 23 percent in
       FY2012/13. The supported policy action relating to increased transparency regarding tax
       expenditures has contributed towards the achievement of this outcome. Progress is also
       due to reduced implementation of additional exemptions under a newly established
       government revenue committee (comprising the Secretaries for Finance, Commerce and



                                               17
       Revenue). The creation of this committee, which formed part of the Bank’s dialogue with
       the Government, has facilitated more coherent and coordinated advice to cabinet on the
       revenue implications of exemption decisions. The rating against this outcome indicator is
       highly satisfactory.


35.      Significant progress was achieved against outcome indicators related to ‘structural
reform’. Outcome indicators were specified in relation to business environment reforms, energy
sector reforms, and SOE reforms.

      Business environment reforms. While the outcome target for reduction in business
       license fees was not achieved, business license fees have been substantially reduced
       nonetheless, following completion of the prior action relating to business license
       regulatory reforms. Following reforms to the license regime, the costs of a business
       license have been reduced from TOP$138 to TOP$115 – a 17 percent reduction
       compared to the target reduction of 23 percent. The business license fee reported in the
       DBS 2012 was incorrect, leading to the baseline for the indicator being set at TOP$130
       rather than the actual applied business license fee of TOP$138. Had the baseline been set
       using accurate information, the target may have been achieved. Business license changes
       have also provided important improvements to the ease of doing business that are not
       captured by the indicator. Reforms supported under the operation allow all firms to
       operate with a single business license, rather than requiring multiple licenses for different
       activities. License processing times have also been reduced, with an online system soon
       to be implemented that is likely to lead to further cost reductions. The rating for
       achievement against this outcome indicator is satisfactory.

      Energy sector reforms. In accordance with the specified prior action, petroleum pricing
       templates were revised to ensure that the retailer’s margin for petroleum is now set on a
       per-liter rather than a percentage-of-cost basis. These regulatory changes are being
       applied, leading to closer alignment between energy prices faced by consumers and the
       cost of supply. The rating against this outcome indicator is satisfactory. The planned
       revision of the electricity tariff – originally identified as a trigger for the second operation
       – did not occur, however, due to weak capacity within the TERM-IU, delays in
       mobilizing technical assistance, and a lack of political consensus regarding the
       appropriate direction of broader energy sector reforms. The new tariff was expected to
       deliver 100 percent cost recovery while also creating incentives for greater utilization of
       renewable energy generation by the vertically-integrated utility and introducing measures
       to protect the poor. Despite the fact that a revised tariff design has not yet been
       implemented, progress towards both outcome indicators was achieved. Renewable
       generation capacity has been increased, with a 1MW solar plant now despatching to the
       Nuku’alofa grid, and is providing lower cost energy than existing diesel plants. Tonga
       Power Limited is now also fully recovering the long-run costs of electricity generation
       through a combination of electricity tariff revenues and an explicit public service
       obligation subsidy to Tonga Power Limited, under a specific appropriation in the annual
       budget. Achievement against outcome indicators relating to cost recovery from electricity
       tariffs and dispatch of lowest-cost generation is rated as satisfactory.

      State-Owned Enterprise Reforms. In accordance with the specified prior action, financial
       accounts of Tonga Power Limited, the Tonga Water Board, Tonga Airports Limited,
       Ports Authority of Tonga, Tonga Post Limited, and the Tonga Development Bank were
       made publicly available on their respective websites within 6 months of the end of


                                                 18
        FY2010/11. Progress has been sustained, and audited accounts for the FY2012/13 year
        are soon to be made available. The rating for achievement against this outcome indicator
        is satisfactory. The program was also initially intended to support privatization of the
        International Dateline Hotel, contributing to a reduction in the number of SOEs
        undertaking commercial activities. The trigger relating to privatization of the
        International Dateline Hotel was dropped, however, in order to provide government with
        additional time to consider a broader range of options for private participation. Despite
        this, significant progress has been achieved with the SOE reform agenda during the term
        of the program. Seastar – a fisheries SOE – is no longer operating, and the Ministry of
        Public Enterprises is working towards liquidating associated assets. Tonga Print has been
        merged with Tonga Post. Tonga Investments Limited has ceased operations, with most of
        its assets liquidated. SOEs competing with private sector providers of the same service
        and not providing a clearly identified public good comprise four out of a total SOE
        portfolio of 13 public enterprises. 4 On this basis, the rating for achievement against this
        outcome indicator is satisfactory. Progress is now occurring in relation to the
        introduction of private participation in the operation of the Dateline Hotel, with a request
        for expressions of interest in a concession contract over the hotel recently issued.

36.     Progress was not achieved against outcome indicators relating to ‘improving social
protection’. The planned community public works scheme was not implemented, with expected
donor financing not forthcoming. Given that this was beyond Government’s control, this
outcome indicator is left unrated. In the absence of progress towards implementation of the
community public works scheme, however, Government has taken steps to improve social
protection through the introduction of alternative social safety net schemes for the disabled and
the elderly.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Satisfactory

37.      The rating for relevance is ‘satisfactory’. The program was implemented during a
period when Tonga faced rapidly declining remittances and falling tourism receipts, placing
immediate pressure on revenues and endangering the delivery of basic services. Through the
program, vital resources to maintain service delivery were mobilized in the face of real revenue
declines. The program provided support to the first government of Tonga to be elected following
broad democratizing reforms, in the context of recent civil service strikes and popular unrest. The
program policy areas and actions were coherent and focused. They combined actions to improve
efficiency in the use of public resources with actions to broaden the revenue base and support
broadened economic growth and opportunities. The program also initially supported specific
measures to assist the poor and vulnerable in the context of increasing poverty and hardship. In
hindsight, outcome indicators could have been applied more consistently between operations and
some of the outcome indicators could have been better specified. But inconsistency in outcome
indicators generally reflected necessary changes in the actions supported by the program. The

 Tonga Timber Limited, Shipping Corporation of Polynesia, International Dateline Hotel, and Tonga
Market Limited. Tonga Investments Limited, Tonga Print, and Seastar are no longer operating as SOEs. An
additional SOE, Tonga Cable Limited, was established during the term of the project, but serves a clear
public good role and is soon to be restructured to allow increased private participation.



                                                  19
range of final indicators provided an adequate basis for assessing progress towards development
objectives.

38.      The rating for achievement of PDOs is ‘satisfactory’. The program development
objective was specified quite broadly, reflecting the broad goals of the DPO program, and did not
facilitate direct assessment of progress. Significant and measurable progress towards outcome
indicator targets was achieved across all policy areas, however, with the exception of social
protection. Achievement of outcome indicator targets in the energy and SOE sector was not easily
attributable to policy actions supported by the program. Conversely, the program supported
policy actions in relation to the wage bill and business license reforms that had substantial
positive impact, despite outcome indicator targets not being fully achieved. Overall, the program
achieved the intended objective of assisting government in implementing key aspects of its
reform agenda while providing a predictable flow of resources in a challenging fiscal context.
Improvements were made in various areas of fiscal transparency, although some of these gains
were not entrenched over the medium term. In fiscal policy, supported reforms led to greater
control over the wage bill while the cost of exemptions declined and improvements in tax policy
were progressed. In structural reform, important gains were made in reducing the time and costs
associated with obtaining a business license. Delays in electricity tariff reform did not prevent
broader progress towards the achievement of full cost recovery on behalf of the energy utility,
while diversification of the energy mix towards renewable sources was achieved. In social
protection, however, government’s decision not to implement the planned community public
works scheme in the absence of expected donor support undermined expected social protection
benefits.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

39.      The program is expected to have had a positive impact for poverty reduction.
Budget support, including that mobilized through other donors under the program, helped the
Government to maintain the provision of core services to the public in the context of significant
revenue declines. Government was able to accumulate modest cash reserves and avoid cash
rationing that has disrupted service delivery in the recent past. Fiscal policy reforms, including
implementation of effective control over the wage bill and the reduction in the costs of
exemptions, have provided further fiscal space at a time when government is prioritizing
allocations to basic social services. Over the medium- and long-term, improvements in budget
transparency and the governance of public enterprises may improve accountability and efficiency
in the use of public resources, contributing to greater equity of public resource use following
recent democratizing reforms. Improvements in the business license regime are aimed to
contribute to faster private sector development with the potential for additional job creation.
Lower and more stable energy prices arises from regulatory changes are expected to reduce the
share of household incomes required for energy needs, allowing increased consumption of other
basic needs, and reducing exposure to severe hardship during periods of high imported energy
prices.

40.     Reforms are expected to have had a positive impact on women. Reforms to the
business license regime addressed some of the regulatory constraints cited as barriers to business
development by women in Tonga in a recent IFC study, where accessing business licenses was
considered an especially onerous process. This reform is considered to have disproportionately
benefited women, given that women: i) have less time available to deal with business license
processes because they spend a disproportionate amount of time engaged in unpaid work within


                                               20
the household; ii) are more likely to suffer from harassment from regulatory officials; iii) have
less exposure to and confidence in dealing with officialdom and less sophisticated networks for
obtaining permits and licenses; iv) have less access to information about permits and licenses than
their male counterparts; and v) have less disposable income with which to meet the costs of
license fees. Budget transparency reforms will, over the longer-term, build accountability on
Government for adequate resourcing and efficient delivery of social services to improve women’s
health and education outcomes.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

41.     The program has had direct and indirect impacts on institutions. Technical
assistance provided to the achievement of policy actions supported increased organizational
capacity within the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Revenue. Technical assistance was
provided to support the development of in-year fiscal reports, review existing tax exemptions, and
provide policy advice on tax policy changes. More generally, the program has supported the
development of institutional capacity, in the form of the Budget Support Management Committee,
to manage multi-donor budget support processes, which are likely to provide a vital source of
resources over the medium-term. Through the operation of this committee, government has been
able to ensure policy actions for budget support are limited in number and aligned with
government priorities. Processes have also been established to facilitate the meeting of all donors’
information and procedural requirements without imposing undue strain on Tonga’s thin
bureaucratic capacity. The usefulness of the committee has been acknowledged by both
government and donors and the committee is likely to remain the primary mechanism for policy
dialogue around budget support over the medium-term.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

42.     The program supported increased dialogue with government on a broad range of
economic issues. Through the joint-donor budget support process, the Bank was able to engage
on a broad range of economic policy issues. The Bank and ADB became trusted sources of advice
for officials within the Ministry of Finance. Through the Budget Support Management
Committee and discussions with political leaders related to the budget support process, donors
were able to convey joint messages on broad economic issues (such as debt management and tax
exemption reforms) where there was no direct project-level engagement. This contributed to a
broadening of the Bank’s relationship with the client and more open and frank policy dialogue.
Such engagement facilitated the provision of technical assistance on key policy issues, for
example policy dialogue around tax reform has led to joint IFC/World Bank work reviewing
existing exemptions.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Substantial

43.     Likelihood of reforms being sustained is heavily dependent on a range of factors.
Risks include capacity risks, macroeconomic risks, and political risks.

       Tonga faces the capacity constraints common in small Pacific Island Countries.
        While many staff are highly trained and extremely competent, staff turnover is very high.
        In the current context of wage bill constraint, and with a limited numbers of specialists
        available to play particular roles within government, vital positions sometimes remain


                                                21
        unfilled for significant periods. Staff turnover in the Ministry of Finance constituted an
        important barrier to the achievement of some outcome indicator targets. Staff shortages
        and changes could pose risk to process-based reform measures supported through the
        program, including those related to fiscal reporting, improvements in budget execution,
        and publication of SOE financial statements.

       Tonga continues to face major macroeconomic challenges. Remittances have not
        recovered to pre-crisis levels and are not expected to do so. Tonga now faces a significant
        challenge in achieving required fiscal consolidation while broadening its economic base
        and identifying new sources of growth. In the current context, Tonga remains extremely
        vulnerable to external economic shocks and natural disasters which could both distract
        available capacity from maintaining the gains achieved under the program and generate
        political pressure to reverse important reforms, especially in the energy sector.

       A general election will take place in Tonga in 2014. This will be only the second
        election since important democratizing reforms in 2010. Political dynamics are not yet
        understood, and Tonga lacks a strong political party system. Political pressures in the
        lead-up to and aftermath of elections may slow progress with the current reform agenda.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

44.      Bank performance was satisfactory in ensuring quality at entry. The Bank worked
closely with government and donors to ensure that the program was tightly focused on
government reform priorities. The Bank’s effectiveness in this coordinating role was appreciated
by government and development partners. Choice of prior actions was informed by analytical
work carried out by the Bank and other partners such as ADB and PFTAC. Expectations were
realistic regarding the likely possible pace and extent of reform. Risks were clearly identified and
made explicit in formal program documentation. The level of ambition was appropriate, striking a
balance between optimism and realism. The program development objective was formulated quite
broadly and as an input. Further, some outcome indicators were imperfectly matched to the
outcomes being sought. This, however, was to some extent inevitable in the context of severe data
constraints and process-based actions. Outcome indicators changed between the first and second
operations, reflecting some flux in the actions being supported and Government’s broader reform
program. Nonetheless, the outcome indicators presented in the program documents provided an
adequate basis for assessing progress.

(b) Quality of Supervision

45.      Bank performance was satisfactory in supervision. The Bank invested heavily in
supporting the government in implementing reforms and monitoring progress. Appropriate
technical assistance was mobilized, and through multiple missions the Bank built strong
relationships with key staff of implementing agencies and developed an adequate understanding
of progress and constraints. Through the Budget Support Management Committee, the Bank
helped build a shared understanding of the extent of progress, key risks, and required corrective
actions between government and donors. Throughout implementation, the Bank continued to play




                                                22
an important coordinating role between Government and development partners. An ISR was
completed in mid-2012.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

46.      Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. Because Bank performance for
Quality at Entry was rated Satisfactory and Quality of Supervision also rated as Satisfactory,
overall Bank performance was rated Satisfactory in accordance with the harmonized evaluation
criteria guidelines for ICRs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

47.      Overall borrower performance is rated as satisfactory. The program was
implemented during a period in which government faced several serious challenges, including
declining revenue and increasing poverty. Government worked closely with the Bank to leverage
the possible benefits of the program both in terms of fiscal resources through budget support, and
also in terms of additional impetus for planned reforms. Government was very active in
developing the joint policy matrix and pressing for multi-donor budget support, and pursued an
open and constructive dialogue with donors regarding a broader range of macroeconomic
management and fiscal policy issues throughout the process. The current Minister of Finance was
a key champion of reform and remained strongly committed to delivering reforms under his
jurisdiction. High staff turnover and the departure of several key officials involved in the
development of the budget support program within the Ministry of Finance constituted an
unfortunate and largely unavoidable constraint to the full achievement of all outcome indicator
targets under Ministry of Finance control. Commitment and effort of officials in the Ministry of
Commerce and the Ministry of Public Enterprises was a key factor in the achievement of several
outcome indicator targets. Political commitment was more variable in relation to energy sector
reforms, with inertia and important inconsistencies emerging in the desired direction of reforms.
While policy actions in the energy sector had to be dropped, sufficient reform progress was
achieved to see outcome indicator targets met.

6. Lessons Learned

48.    Experience with the program largely reinforced lessons learned during previous
development policy lending operations in small Pacific Island Countries. These include:

    Budget support can serve as a solid platform for government-donor dialogue on
     economic policy issues. An important benefit of the program was increased and more open
     policy dialogue with government on a range of economic management issues, including
     public debt and new borrowing, expenditure allocations and priorities, and economic reform
     priorities. Through contact with officials and ministers in preparation and implementation of
     the operation, the Bank became a trusted source of advice on a broader range of economic
     issues. Budget support discussions became a key forum for conveying coordinated donor
     perspectives on major economic issues, supporting reformers within government.

    Adequate investment in policy dialogue is vital but resource intensive. Success of the
     program relied on development of close working relationships with both government and
     other donors providing budget support. Through the Budget Support Management



                                               23
     Committee, the team were able to ensure that a small number of policy actions were
     supported in areas that were closely aligned to Government priorities. This prevented a
     proliferation of policy actions and a diffusion of scarce reform capacity, despite the fact that
     four donors were providing budget support. This was only possible through the allocation of
     sufficient resources to finance staff time and missions for dialogue purposes.

    Project-level engagement can assist in identifying key priorities to be supported
     through policy-based operations. Prior project engagement provided a vital foundation for
     identifying key policy reforms to drive further progress in important sectors, assisting the
     implementation of the reforms, and tracking progress closely with relatively little additional
     monitoring effort.

    Close coordination and engagement with other development partners in the
     identification of policy priorities is useful in sectors where the Bank has limited
     knowledge and engagement. In key sectors where the Bank did not have active project or
     policy engagement, task teams drew selectively on analytical work and advice from other
     development partners to quickly build knowledge and make judgments regarding policy
     priorities across a broad range of sectors. The task team worked very closely with the ADB
     and IFC in the area of public enterprise reform and PFTAC in relation to revenue reforms.

    Coordinated management of international aid flows, in the context of prudent fiscal
     policy, can provide vital support in mitigating the impacts of external shocks in the
     Pacific Islands. Without the budget support provided to Tonga, the impacts of economic
     shocks would have been more extensive and prolonged. Development assistance played a
     vital role in financing essential government services, while maintaining macroeconomic
     stability.

49.      In addition, the program illustrates the importance of flexibility in the design of
programmatic DPO series in Pacific contexts. The program relied on the ability to significantly
modify indicative triggers when it came to identifying prior actions for the second operation. In
the context of political fluidity, macroeconomic vulnerability, and capacity constraints, such
flexibility is likely to be a required feature of budget support programs in small Pacific Islands.
Even with the provision of substantial technical assistance to the achievement of reform actions,
unforeseeable capacity gaps arising from the departure of key staff substantially slowed progress
in key areas. Capacity risks cannot be entirely mitigated through provision of technical assistance,
and programs may need to be designed to take account of capacity gaps as they emerge. The need
for such flexibility can usefully be reflected in the selective choice of program outcome indicators
and Program Development Objectives that would remain relevant across operations under a
plausible range of changes to policy actions.

-   The Government of Tonga wishes to thank the World Bank for this budget support
    operation. It came at a time when it was most needed and while the change in the
    country’s debt sustainability assessment affected the grant status of the operation,
    this will help build much needed reserves.

-   The government welcomes the way in which the disbursements were made, it was fast
    and fairly simple to undertake. The prior conditions and performance indicators
    mutually agreed to between the Government and the World Bank were designed to
    support the ongoing reform program lead by Government.

-   The government is grateful for the support and leadership role the World Bank
    provides on behalf of the other development partners through the Budget Support
    Management Committee responsible for the monitoring and implementation of the
    Joint Reform Policy Matrix.

-   This modality is consistent with the emphasis on country ownership, systems and
    capacity, key elements of the Paris Declaration. It also enables a focus on overall
    progress and direction rather than on individual project results and contributes to
    longer term sustainable development.

-   The government foresees the use of this model into the future as through this process
    progress has been sustained

-   Government welcomes proposals and new ideas on possible reform actions for
    further discussion.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Summary of Australian Government comments

General
 The Australian Government welcomes the leadership role played by the World Bank
   in coordinating joint donor budget support for Tonga. In our view, the Tonga model
   of joint donor budget support has worked well: it has helped drive important
   economic and public sector reforms in Tonga, notably better prioritisation of public
   expenditure, revenue strengthening and reform of state-owned enterprises.
 Key to the success of the program has been the strong ownership and support for the
   program within the Tongan Government, both at the political level and from officials.
   Notable successes include a commitment to ‘no new debt’, reduction in the costs of
   doing business, implementation of tax legislation and increases in the transparency of
   budgetary processes, including the publishing of audited financial statements. The
   recent progress with introducing private participation in the management of the
   Dateline Hotel is also noted, given earlier setbacks.
 Another important contributor to program success has been effective coordination and
   dialogue through the Budget Support Management Committee and joint donor
   missions. Australia has appreciated the opportunities provided for productive
   coordination, joint missions and information sharing.
 In our view, the World Bank’s Independent Completion Report is an accurate and
   useful document. Lessons learned will be incorporated into broader budget support
   arrangements in the Pacific, financed by the Australian Government.

Changes to Performance Triggers under the Policy Matrix
 To date, Australia believes changes to performance triggers and policy actions have
   been generally justified and appropriate, given the inherent need for flexibility in a
   small state context. However, if too frequent or significant, the changing and
   dropping of actions risks undermining the credibility of the program. It will be
   important for donors to work closely with the Tongan Government to minimize such
   changes under future programs.
 Australia agrees that changes to triggers in the energy sector have reflected uneven
   political support. Future operations could usefully encourage accelerated reform
   progress in this area, including much-needed reforms in areas other than renewable
   energy (which has so far been the focus). We note that the previously dropped
   triggers will be included in the next iteration of the matrix, which is supported and
   will build on progress achieved to date.

Policy Actions and Lessons Learned
 Australia recognises the importance of the analytical work undertaken by the Bank to
   underpin this program, in particular the expenditure mapping work. It may be useful


                                            30
    for this to be updated. Australia would welcome any joint analytical work in the
    future.
   Success of measures to control the wage bill is notable. However, the ICR could
    perhaps also describe some of the less-desirable consequences of the current freeze,
    such as an increase in the use of ‘daily paid’ staff and capacity gaps arising from a
    large number of vacant positions. These issues will need to be addressed going
    forward. The upcoming World Bank remuneration review may be a useful vehicle for
    constructive recommendations in this area.
   The lessons learned are accurately reflected in the document, especially in relation to
    the importance of policy dialogue and the ‘buy-in’ that this achieves.

Future Operations
Australia supports continued World Bank involvement in joint-donor budget support in
Tonga. Appropriate areas of focus under subsequent operations might include:
 Debt management. With recent changes in Tonga’s rating for risk of debt distress, it
   is likely that Tonga will begin to access concessional debt from multilaterals over
   coming years. Future operations could support Government’s intention to develop a
   debt policy to guide the use of concessional debt in order to ensure long-term debt
   sustainability.
 Expenditure quality, fiscal transparency and budget execution. Progress has been
   made in these areas (including controls on the use of the contingency fund) which
   should be continued and built on. Policy decisions outside the scope of the matrix,
   however, could jeopardise this program. Australia would welcome ongoing attention
   to policy actions and performance indicators in future operations that ensure the
   improvements in expenditure quality are maintained and further progressed.
 Gender. Gender issues are a joint priority of Australia and the World Bank and it
   would be useful to see a more direct focus on gender related actions in future
   operations.
 Procurement. Significant progress has been achieved to date, and it would be useful
   to maintain momentum under future operations.
 Revenue reforms, including reform of the exemptions regime. Significant
   progress has been made in this area and the upcoming World Bank review of tax
   incentives may provide additional momentum for much-needed consolidations in tax
   expenditure.
 Private sector development reforms have been supported and successful to date,
   albeit in a challenging environment. Australia would like to see this focus continue.
