                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The operation will assist the Government of Tonga (GoT) to implement key aspects of its medium-term reform agenda, while providing a predictable flow of resources in
                         a challenging fiscal environment. Over the last four years, Tonga’s economy has been hit hard by a series of crises, which have caused the economy to contract, a
                         significant fiscal gap to emerge, and poverty to increase sharply. At the same time, Tonga has made the transition to a more democratic political system. The operation
                         provides the Bank with an opportunity to support key public sector and economic reforms at a critical juncture in Tonga’s development process. The policy areas the
                         operation will support are: (i) strengthening public financial management; (ii) strengthening fiscal policy; (iii) promoting structural reform; and (iv) improving social
                         protection.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the implementation of this operation is more than satisfactory. The Government of Tonga has implemented key aspects of its medium-term reform agenda, in a challenging
                         fiscal environment. Over the last four years, Tonga’s economy has been hit hard by a series of crises, which have caused the economy to contract, a significant fiscal gap to emerge,
                         and poverty to increase sharply. At the same time, Tonga has made the transition to a more democratic political system. Under the operation, the Bank is supporting key public sector
                         and economic reforms at a critical juncture in Tonga’s development process. The policy measures that the Government of Tonga has implemented are in the areas of: (i)
                         strengthening public financial management; (ii) strengthening fiscal policy; (iii) promoting structural reform; and (iv) improving social protection.
