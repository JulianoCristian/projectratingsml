Memorandum. Executive Directors\n            expressed support for the economic recovery operation and\n            recognized the importance of the Government's reform\n            measures being implemented in response to the exogenous\n            shocks that have buffeted the Tongan economy in recent\n            years. Directors welcomed the close collaboration among\n            development partners and emphasized the importance of\n            further progress with structural reforms to enhance\n            Tonga's long-term growth prospects. Given Tonga's\n            high risk of debt distress, Directors noted the importance\n            of Tonga's commitment not to undertake new borrowing\n            until debt is brought back within acceptable limits.\n            Directors also encouraged continued attention to private\n            sector development, renewable energy and disaster risk mitigation."}, "docdt": "2011-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
