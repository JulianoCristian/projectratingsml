APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project to expand the power
generation capacity and to extend and rehabilitate the distribution facilities-
of the Administracion General de las Usinas y los Telefonos del Estado (UTE)
of Uruguay. A US$18 million Bank loan is proposed to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the Project.
ii.       Between 1950 and 1956, the Bank made three loans totaling
US$64 million to UTE, Uruguay's Government-owned power and telecommunicatione?
enterprise.  The proposed loan would be the first to UlE after an interruptic.-
of 1 years, due to Uruguay's poor economic performance, and UTE's unsatis-
factory financial position and inefficient management. In 1968, after a
decade of inflation and economic stagnation, the Uruguayan Government took
drastic measures to reduce inflation and to correct the distortions in the
country's economy. These governmental measures, together with significant
steps taken by UTE in 1969 and early 1970 towards improving its financial
position and its organization and management, made it possible for the Bank
to consider lending again to UTE. However, the enterprise still needs much
institutional improvement: the organization should be simplified, the staf2
reduced and restructured, orderly planning resumed, and the accounting syster
reorganized. These improvements are expected to start under the Project.
iii.      UTE's construction program for the period 1970-73 is estimated to
cost Ur$35.6 billion (US$142 million) of which Ur$25.2 billion (US$101 millicnr
is for power and general services and Ur$10.h billion (US$41 million) is for
telecommunications. The proposed Bank Project would cost Ur$5.6 billion
(US$22.6 million). The Project includes: (a) the 100 MW sixth unit at the
Batlle plant in Montevideo; and (b) an expansion and rehabilitation program
for the Montevideo distribution system. All the equipment included in the
Bank Project would have to be imported. Design and supervision for the stean
plant would be carried out by consultants, and for the distribution investnene.
by UTE. Consultants would also be employed under the I roject to assist UTE Ln
defining a generating plant program for the next decade, in reorganizing its
accounting system, and in further improving efficiency.
iv.       UTE's financial position, which at the time of the appraisal waS
poor as a result of inadequate tariffs and weak financial management, is
expected to improve during 1970 as a result of tariff increases of about
30% in 1969 and 45% in 1970. The rate of return on the power rate base,
',1hich includes revalued net fixed assets and provisions for inventories and
working capital, is expected to improve from 4% in 1969 to 10% in 1970 and
to remain satisfactory thereafter. UTE's financing plan for the period
1970-74 is satisfactory.



- ii -
v.        The proposed Bank loan would finance the CIF cost of equipment
contracts to be awarded after international competitive bidding. The loan
also would finance the foreign exchange cost of erection and civil works
contracts for the 100 MLT unit (also awarded after international competitive
bidding), consultants' services, and the interest on the loan during construc-
tion.
vi.       The 100 M1  sixth steam unit at Batlle is the lowest cost solution
for meeting the increased demand from 1973 to 1976 for discount rates up to
13%. The incremental financial rate of return on this unit is 14%; on the
distribution rehabilitation and expansion program, the incremental return is
10%.
vii.      Besides helping UTE improve its financial position and carry out
urgently needed generation expansion and distribution rehabilitation, the
loan would renew the Bank's relationship with the enterprise.  Through the
follow-up provided by project supervision, the Bank would help UTE implement
the measures described in this report and encourage the enterprise in con-
tinuing its efforts to improve efficiency.
viii.     The Project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$18
million equivalent to UTE for a term of 25 years, including a grace period
of 4L years.

USINAS Y TFLEIONOS DEL ESTADO (UTE)
APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Administracion General de las Usinas Electricas y Telefonos del
Estado (UTE), the Government-owned autonomous power and telephone enterprise
in Uruguay, has requested the Bank to assist it in financing its program of
expansion and rehabilitation of its power generation and distribution
system. This report appraises a US$22.6 million power project for 1970-73.
Thc Project represents 16% of UT3's total investueint prpgram for the
same period. A loan-of US$18 million is proposed.
).02      UTE has received three previous Bank loans in the total amount of
US$64.0 million: loan 30-UR for US$33 million in 1950; loan 132-UR for
US$5.5 million in 1955; and, loan 152-UR for US$25.5 million in 1956. On
October 31, 1970 the amount outstanding on these loans totaled US$25.4 million.
1.03     All the above loans were made at a time when UTE was reasonably well
managed and in a fairly strong financial position. They helped UTE expand
its generation, transmission, distribution and telephone facilities, and
enabled it satisfactorily to meet the demand. However, during the past ten
years, successive governments denied the enterprise timely and adequate tariff
adjustments despite rapid inflation. During the same period UTEts administration
became increasingly inefficient.  By the end of the 1960's UTE was grossly
overstaffed; its financial position was poor and earnings were unsatinfactory;
the power expansion program had fallen far behind schedule forcing UTE to
;Ipose stringent restrictions on power consumption several times; and power
service was characterized by low voltage and frequent interruptions.
1.04     Although the Bank has considered lending to UTE for the past several
vears, no loan has materialized because of both the countryts and the
anterprise's poor performance. For six months in 1969, the Bank provided the
3ervices of Mr. R. Salazar, General kanager of the Empresa Nacional de
Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA) of Chile, to assist UTE in drawing up a set of
m.easures whose implementation would create the basis for new Bank lending.
The proposed measures included new tariff regulations (paragraph 3.21),
reorganization (paragraph 3.06), a new division of responsibility between
Board and Management (paragraph 3.05), and a temporary halt in the contracting
of medium-term debt. By early 1970 the Government and UTE had taken significant
steps towJards financial and organization recovery. In order to encourage
JTE's further recovery, the Bank then decided to appraise a power project.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a missicn comprising
"Ilessrs. R. Ribi, E. Wessels, and V. Nercissiantz, which visited Uruguay
Lluring March 1970.

2. BAC0KGItOUND
2.01      Uruguay has about 2.9 million inhabitants.  Approximately 50%
of this population is concentrated in and around Montevideo; 20% lives
in 15 towns of 20,000 to 60,000 inhabitants while the remaining 30% is rural.
2.02      From 1955 until 1968 Uruguayts GDP has remained almost constant
at about US$1.6 billion and the per capita annual income declined from
US$720 to US$590. This decline would have been even worse if Uruguay had
not one of the lowest population growths in the Americas (1.4% per year).
2.03      Per capita electric energy consumption increased at a rat,e of 6% per
year from 224 kWh in 1950 to 400 kWh in 1960.  During the sixties the
growth slowed down to 4% leading to a consumption of 570 kWh in 1969 which
is still well above the average of approximately 450 kWh for Latin America.
Telephone density was about 5.8 telephones per 100 inhabitants in 1962; it
increased to 7.3 telephones per 100 inhabitants by 1967 and has remained at
about that level, which compares favorably with the average for Latin America
of about 2.5 telephones per 100 inhabitants in 1968. The above figures for
energy consumption and telephone density in Uruguay do not reflect the quality
of the service, which is poor for both electricity and telephones (paragrap2a
3.15 and 3.16).
2.04      The most significant cause of the economic stagnation has been
the country's failure to develop its main resources, livestock and meat
processing, which account for 85% of Uruguay's export earnings. Instead,
the Government stimulated light manufacturing industries and grain production
to replace imports. With the end of the Korean war and the drop in wool
prices Uruguay's economic situation began to deteriorate. About 1960
sharp inflation set in. It averaged 60% per year during the period 1964-1969
and reeched a peak of 64% for the first half of 1968. In June 1968, the
Government temporarily froze wages and prices. After this measure succeeded
in slowing down inflation, the Government began correcting the distortions
in the economy that had been mainly responsible for stagnation and inflation5
The success of the first steps and the Government's determination to continve
its efforts towards recovery have made it possible for the Bank to resume
lending to Uruguay.

3. TIH BORROWER
General
3.01      UTE, the proposed Borrower, is in charge of the public power
supply and telephone service in Uruguay. In 1969 it had about 703,000
power customers to whom it supplied 1,626 GWh, which is 95% of Uruguay's
total electric energy consumption; only about 80 GWh (5%) was produced in
captive plant owned mainly by large industries in IMontevideo. In the recent
past, growth of UTE's power sales was slow because of Uruguay's stagnant
economy, and irregular because of repeated power shortages. It averaged
3.4% over the period 1965-69 (Annex 1).  In the telephone sector UTE
served about 150,000 subscribers in 1969; the number of call units has
increased by 5.1% per year over the past five years (Annex 4).
3.02      Administracion General de las Usinas del Estado, the predecessor
of UTE, was founded in 1912 and assigned the responsibility for public
power supply. In 1931, the institution was modified by adding the telephone
service to its activities, and its name was changed to Administracion
General de las Usinas y los Telefonos del Estado (UTE). Presently, UTE
also provides the international telephone services, and a recent decree has
1t4ven it the responsibility for telex services. UTE's activities, respon-
sibilities and organization are defined mainly by the Uruguayan Constitution,
Laws of 1912 and 1931, and a 1919 Decree.
Board and Management
3.03      The enterprise is controlled by a Board of Directors comprising
five members appointed by the President of the Republic. Three Board
members including the Boardts president are chosen from the party which
has the majority in Parliament; the other two belong to the minority party.
Board members serve four-year terms, usually coinciding with the Govern-
ment's term. The present Board was appointed in 1968 in conjunction with
the Government's decision to enforce, within the autonomous enterprises,
the measures required for Uruguay's economic recovery.
3.04      The Board not only defines UTE's policies and supervises operations,
but also has extensive executive functions. In fact, meeting daily, it
has participated to an unusual degree in the operational decisions of the
enterprise. This interference in management, together with the fact that
the Board's composition is decided along political lines, caused long
delays in reaching decisions on even relatively trivial operational matters.
This situation was aggravated by the fact that because there was no General
Manager, the five 'divisional managers reported directly to the Board.
3.05      The Bank's consultant, Mr. Salazar, proposed that day to day
management of UTE be delegated by the Board to a General Manager. This
recommendation was accepted by the Government and UTE, and in September 1969
an able former member of the Board was appointed to this office. The
General Manager has made considerable progress in coordinating UTE's oper-
ations, and further improvements are expected to take place during the con-
struction of the Project. During negotiations it was agreed that the Bank
would be consulted prior to any new appointment to the position of



-4 -
Gencra  i Manager. The General Nunagerts authority and the precedures to
expedi ;e the routine decisions which the Board is legally bound to take
are defined in four Board resolutions of 1969 and 1970. Any modification
of these resolutions without Bank concurrence would be an event of default
under the proposed Loan Agreement.
Organization and Personnel
3.06      UTE's organization was recently redefined by modifying its structure
and reassigning key personnel. The new operations divisions (generation
and transmission, distribution, and telecommunications) are responsible for
planning, construction and operations in their respective fields; general
services are provided by the finance, personnel, procurement and auxiliary
services divisions. The General Manager, assisted by a group of advisers,
coordinates the activities of the divisions and is responsible for decisior.~
affecting UTE as a whole, insofar as such decisions have been delegated
by the Board.
3.07      The new organization became effective in February 1970 and UTE
will undoubtedly have to implement further adjustments to make it work
snoothly. Coordination of planning should be strengethened and certain
activities of the auxiliary services division (printing, manufacture of
concrete poles, etc.) should probably be carried out by contractors. UTE
has agreed to carry out during 1971 studies to improve further the effic-
iency of its organization, to consult with the Bank on the conclusions of
the studies, and to implement improvement programs satisfactory to the Bark.
UTE has also agreed to engage consultants to assist in the selection of
data processing equipment by the second half of 1971.
3.08      UTE is grossly overstaffed and the distribution of the personnel
between professionals, administrative personnel and laborers is out of
balance. In 1969 UTErs personnel comprised about 15,800 persons, distributed
approximately as follows:
Telecommuni-   General
Power     cations       Services      Total        %
Professionals           90         30          120            240       2
Administrative
Personnel        1,500         750       1,970           4,220     27
Laborers            5,210       4,220       1,910          U1,340      71
Total            6,800       5,?000      4,000          15,800    100
UTE's overstaffing is due to short working hours (five hours a day, five days
a week), narrow job descriptions, lack of incentives, and poor wages.
Recently UTE established incentives to induce selected personnel to work
eight hours a day. This measure was successful, since most of the super-
visory personnel agreed to do so. During negotiations UTE agreed (a) to
maintain incentives inducing personnel to work eight hours a day and to modlf"y
job descriptions as necessary, (b) to continue reducing personnel by not
filling vacancies and (c) by July 1971, to create (in cooperation with the
Social Security authorities) incentives for the timely retirement of older



-5-
employees. These measures are expected to lead to a slight decrease in
personnel in 1971, and to reductions of not less than 500 persons per
year during 1972-74.
3.09      Most of UTEts technical and managerial staff are competent.
They have managed to maintain the power and telephone services under
extremely difficult conditions. However, they need additional training
in modern t-echniques, such as business administration, investment planning,
electric osetem control, etc.  At lower echelons, 50 to 80 workers per
year are being trained in UTEts own school, with the help of equipment
and methods provided by Electricite de France. During negotiations UTE
has agreed to carry out a crash training program that would begin in 1971
and provide each year courses for (a) about 25 high level employees,
(b) about 100 medium echelon personnel and (c) about 250 workers and low
echelon administrative personnel.
3.10      While maintaining strict control over the total number of its
employees as discussed above, UTE will have to step up its efforts to
recruit and retain professional staff. Salary scales for such employees
will have to be improved because poor salaries have been the major reason
for UTEts inability to attract and keep enough qualified people. The
financial forecasts (paragraph 6.05) include a provision for such improve-
ments.
Generating Facilities
3.11      By mid-1970, UTE's total installed generating capacity was 572 IM
of which 519 MW belonged to the Montevideo - Rio Negro system interconnect-
ing the Rio Negro Valley with Uruguay 's western and southern departments.
This system accounts for about 93% of UTE's energy sales, with only 7%
corresponding to the isolated systems fed by diesel plants and/or through
interconnections of limited capacity with Argentina and Brazil. The
following table gives data on UTE's generating plant:

(c)  Diesel plants in 49 isolated locations:                  -             53
572
3.12      The thermal units installed after 1950 are in reasonably good
working condition, although in the past few years maintenance has been
insufficient because the units could not be taken out of service due to
the lack of reserve capacity. Of the older thermal units totaling a
nominal 70 MW, only about 15 MW can be considered to have a reasonable
degree of reliability. Many of the diesel plants are old and in poor
condition. All fuel is imported.
3.13      The two hydro plants are both situated on the Rio Negro, the main
Uruguayan tributary of the Rio Uruguay. They are in good physical condition
but their annual energy output varies within a wide range because of the
extreme irregularity of the runoffs. Rainfall in the Rio Negro catchment
basin is sporadic throughout the year and varies markedly from year to
year. There have been extended droughts; those of 1965 and 1968 forced UTE
to impose severe restrictions on energy consumption. Annex 5 gives details
on the method of operation of the hydro plants.
3.14      In early 1970 the total available reliable capacity in the Montevideo-
Rio Negro system barely covered the maximum demand of 389 MW. No reserve was
left for accidental outages, much less for maintenance (see Annex 2). The
situation has improved since the new 80 MW steam unit was commissioned in June
1970.

3.15      UTEts transmission system, though overloaded in many places, is
generally in good working condition. UTE's distribution facilities, however -
both in Mlontevideo and in the interior - urgently need rehabilitation.
Interruptions are frequent and in many places the voltage is inadequate during
the peak hours. Transmission and distribution losses in the Montevideo - Rio
Negro system increased from about 17% of the energy sent out in the early
1960's to a high 19% in the late 1960's.

Telecomrauunications
3.16      Uruguay's telecommunications facilities are presently inadequate,
but they are being improved under UTE's 1970-1975 telecommunications
investment program. By 1969 they included 320 telephone exchanges with
about 150,000 direct subscriber lines in service. Manually-operated ex-
changes still exist in the smaller towns and in rural areas; they represent
about 20% of UTE's present capacity and are gradually being automatized.
UTE has 250 telex subscribers. Annex 4 gives additional data on UTE's
telecommunications services.
Planning
3.17      While UTE's planning is satisfactory in telecommunications, it is
generally poor in the power sector where long-term planning is non-existent,
and medium-term planning concentrates too much on generation. The present
situation reflects the fact that for years it has been impossible for UTE
to reach even relatively modest targets, thus discouraging the planners.
The present management of UTE is fully aware of the urgent need for pro-
gramming its future investments on the basis of comparative studies of all
practical alternatives.
3.18      UTE has long been anxious to construct the 370 M  Palmar hydro
development on the Rio Negro and its planning efforts have been focused
principally on this project (estimated cost US$96 million) for which
SOFRELEC of France prepared a feasibility study, plans and specifications
between 1962 and 1968. Besides Palmar, the most promising prospects for
increasing UTE's power supply capacity are: (a) additional thermal plants;
(b) a high voltage interconnection between UTE's Montevideo-Rio Negro
system and the Buenos Aires-Litoral system in Argentina; and, (c) the 1,300
MW Salto Grande international hydro development on the Rio Uruguay.
Ebasco Services of the U.S. is presently carrying out a study of the high
voltage link, (the Inter-American Development Bank is financing this study),
while Acres of Canada is preparing a feas±b-lity study for Salto Grande.
UTE has agreed to hire consultants acceptable to the Bank, to aid it in
defining by mid-1971, a generation expansion program for the next decade.
UTE is preparing a program of other studies it will carry out during the
next three years in order to return gradually to an orderly planning of
its construction activities; the most urgent such study would define a short
and long-term rehabilitation and expansion program for the transmission
and distribution systems in the interior of the country.
3.19      UTE has agreed to review with the Bank the construction program
resulting from the studies described above. As explained in paragraph 6.09
UTE also agreed not to undertake any major new projects during the con-
struction of the Project unless it can present evidence satisfactory to
the Bank that adequate financing for such projects is available.



-8-
3.20      In the past five years UTE's power revenues have been insufficient
because of inadequate tariffs (paragraph 3.31). The average revenue per
kWh, which was 2.7 US cents equivalent in 1964, had declined to 1.9 US
cents equivalent by 1968. As a result of inocaases of about 30% in 1969
and 45% in 1970, tariffs are now adequate; hence earnings, which have
been unsatisfactory, are expected to improve (paragraph 6.05).
3.21      The President of the Republic approved regulations governing
UTE's power tariffs in March 1970. In essence, they state that UTE should
earn a rate of return of at least 4% in 1970, 6% in 1971 and 8% in 1972
and subsequent years, but not more than 10%, on its power rate base, which
includes revalued net fixed assets and provisions for inventories and
working capital. These regulations, described in more detail in Annex 8,
provide an objective basis for establishing power tariffs.  Material
amendment of the tariff regulations would be an event of default under the
proposed Loan Agreement.
3.22      To make a reasonable contribution to its power construction progrmia,
however, UTE must earn a return on its rate base well in excess of the
minima of 6% in 1971 and 8% thereafter, established by the regulations.
The Government and UTE have therefore agreed that during the construction
period of the Project, UTE's rate of return on its power rate base will
be not less than the maximum allowed by the regulations, 10%. After the
Project is completed, a new rate of return will be established after con-
sultation between the Government, the Bank and UTE. This rate will be
based on UTE's financial requirements for its power activities; it will
be between 8% and 10%, as provided by the regulations.
3.23      Telecommunications tariffs have, in general, been more satisfac-
tory than those for powfer (paragraph 3.31), although they have not been
based on a rate of return concept.  To ensure that UTE's telecommuiications
revenues are sufficient to cover operating costs and make an adequate
contribution to expansion of telecommunications facilities, the Government
and UTE agreed during negotiations for the proposed loan that: (a) UTE
will earn a rate of return of at least 10% on its telecommunications rate
base; (b) the telecommunications rate base will include revalued net fixed
assets and provisions for inventories and working capital acceptable to
the Bank; and, (c) straight line depreciation will be charged on tele-
communications fixed assets based on an estimate of their useful lives,
with the average rate being at least 4.5%.
Accounts and Audit
3.24      UTE's present accounts are inadequate for planning and control.
UTE has engaged SOFRELEC to assist it with preliminary studies leading to
a complete reorganization of its accounting system, with a view to improvirg
the timeliness and usefulness of reports, and to introducing effective
management control over operations and construction. The proposed Loan
Agreement provides that UTE will implement the reorganization with the
assistance of consultants acceptable to the Bank.  UTE has also agreed to
initiate during 1971 the implementation of a budgetary control sy3tcT.



-9-
3.25     UTJE has not followed generally accepted accounting practices in
preparing its financial statemients. Fixed assets have not been revalued
since 1964, in spite of rapid inflation. These circumstances make inter-
pretation of UTE's financial statements difficult. UTE has agreed to
revalue its power and telecommunications assets in preparing its financial
statements, using the procedure specified in the power tariff regulations
(see Annex 8).
3.26      Under the Uruguayan Constitution, UTE's accounts are audited by
the Accounting Tribunal, which follows Government accounting procedures.
To ensure compliance with generally accepted utility accounting practices,
UTE has agreed to have its accounts also audited by independent accountants
acceptable to the Bank, and to send the auditors' report to the Bank not
later than four months after the end of each fiscal year.
Financial Position
3.27      UTEts financial position during the last few years has been un-
satisfactory due principally to weak financial management (which resulted
in excessive short-term borrowing and poor collections), and inadequate
tariffs. This has led to considerable delays in the enterprise's expan-
sion programs. UTEts balance sheets for the years 1964-1968 are shown in
Annex 9. The present financial position, as reflected in the estimated
balance sheet for 1969 (Annex 10), is summarized below. This presentation,
based on the revaluation of power and telecommunications fixed assets,
using the procedure specified in the power tariff regulations (Annex 8), is
more realistic than UTE's own balance sheets shown in Annex 9, which
reflect assets that have not been revalued since 1964.

3.28      Of the total long-term capitalization of Ur$41.5 billion (US$166
million), 73% was provided by equity, consisting of retained earnings and
reserves and a small Government contribution arising from a law that
raquires the Government to service a part of UTE's local currency debt.



-10-
The composivion of the long-term debt on December 31, 19S9, is shown in
Annex 11.  Of the gross long-term debt of Ur$12.9 billion, the bllk of
which was in foreign currency, 71% is due by 1975.
3.29      UTE does not maintain separate current asset and liability
accounts for its power and telecommunication operations. The accounting
consultants (paragraph 3.24) have been asked to include a recommendation
on this matter in their report. Although the current pcsition appears
satisfactory, current aosets iiclude 3xcessive overdue aocouzits receivable
from pyublic sector entities.  These have accumulated as a res-1e31t of the
public sector's budgetary difficulties and of UTE's weak effo -ts at
collection. UTE has also built up excessive liabilities to other public
sector entities. In connection with the proposed loan, UTE has agreed to
prepare a program, satisfactory to the Bank, for collecting overdue accounts
receivable from, and settling its debts to, other public sector entities.
3.30      The current liabilities of Ur$7.0 billion include Ur$2.4 billion
which is due to the Banco de la Republica, a Government-owned commercial
bank. UTE and the Banco de la Republica have agreed that this debt will
be settled as follows: Ur$0.5 billion will be repaid during 1970, and the
balance of Ur$1.9 billion in equal installments over the years 1971-1975.
The effective interest rate will be less than 10%.
Earnings Record
3.31      Income statements for the years 1964-1968 are given in Annex 9,
and an estimated income statement for 1969 in Annex 12. UTE's overall
earnings since 1964 have been too low; the poor results of power oper-
ations were only partly offset by more satisfactory performance in tele-
communications. Operating income in 1969 was Ur$1,121 million (US$4.5
million) for power and Ur$864 million (US$3.5 million) for telecommunica-
tions, producing estimated rates of return on the rate bases of 4.0%
for power and 14.6% for telecommunications.

4. TIE PROJECT
UTE's Construction Program
14.01     The construction Drogram for 1970-73 is expected to cost Ur$35.6
billion (US$142 million): Ur$25.2 billion (US$101 million) for power and
general services, and Ur$10.4 billion (US$41 million) for telecommunications.
UTE has the capacity,with some assistance from consultants, to carry out this
program which represents the minimum it should undertake to cover increasing
demands and improve the quality of its services. The projects to be started
this year are well prepared. Some of the less immediate ones still need
further study. For these, reasonable estimates of the cost have been included.
4.02      The telecommunications investment program includes the improve-
ment and extension of telephone facilities. It provides for a 10% average
annual increase in telephone lines, which appears reasonable in view of the
1970 backlog of 65,0o0 applications (there are about 150,000 existing lines)
and the increase in business activity in Uruguay. The program's other main
items are links to Brazil as part of the inter-American telephone network,
and formation of a national telex network (paragraph 3.02).
4.03      The power investment program includes: (a) final payments for the
80 MS fifth steam unit at the Batlle plant; (b) construction of the 100 MW
sixth steam unit at Batlle; (c) start of construction on the Palmar hydro
development; (d) diesel plants for the isolated systems; (e) transmission
'crojects in Uruguay's western, central and eastern departments; (f) start of
construction on the high voltage interconnection with Argentina; and (g)
expansion and rehabilitation of the distribution systems in both Montevideo and
the interior. Details of the program are given in Annex 6. The followiing table
is a summary of the cost estimate:
Billion Ur,$ or Million US$
fleneration                                  14.6              58

Construction for General Services             1.3               6
25.2            101
The sixth unit at Batlle and the distribution program for Montevideo are
included in the Bank Project (see Chapter 5 for justification). The fifth
unit at Batlle is completed but final payments are still due. The installa-
tion of the diesels and the construction of the transmission lines in the
eastern departments are underway. UTE has completed the design of the
transmission lines for the central and western systems,which are justified.
The Palmar development, the high voltage link to Argentina, and the distribu-
tion program in the interior have not yet been justified, and UTE's construc-
tion program may well have to be modified when the consultants' studies are
completed and reviewed with the Bank (paragraphs 3.18 and 3.19).



- 12 -
The Bank Project
4.04      The proposed Bank Project would include the following most needed
projects UTE plans to carry out in the power field during 1970-73:
(a)  the 100 MW sixth stean. unit at the Batlle plant in Montevideo
(see Annex 6), which would allow UTE to meet the demand which by the
end of 1973 would exceed the presently available capacity;
(b)  the part of UTE's program for expansion and rehabilitation of
the Montevideo distribution system (see Annex 6), for the 2½ years
from mid-1971 to end of 1973; (the part of the program not covered
by the proposed Bank loan would be financed by s'uppliera' credits
and from UTE's own resources);
(c)  consulting services for: procurement and supervision of erection
of the sixth steam unit at Batlle (paragraph 4.05), reorganization
of the accounting system (paragraph 3.25), a long-range generating
plant development plan (paragraph 3.18), and improvement of the
efficiency of UTE's organization (paragraph 3.07).
4.05      UTE originally planned to procure the sixth unit at Batlle on
the basis of an option it had for the purchiase of equipment identical to
that of the fifth unit, In order to make the new unit eligible for Bank
financing, UTE decided in April 1970 to waive the opltion and to procure it
on the basis of intemational competitive bidding, Kennedy and Donkin of
UK have assisted UWE in preparing bidding documents for the unit, and UTE
has recently requested tenders, which are scheduled to be opened in mid-
December. UTF. has agreed to continue to employ consultants acceptable Uo
the Bank for the supervision of erection of the sixth urits
4.o6      The rehabilitation and extension program for the Montevideo
distribution system includes the installation of 307 km of underground
cable (30 kV, 6 kV and 220 V), 3,300 km of overhead lines (6 kV and 220 V),
196 MVA of transformers (30/6 kV and 6/0.24 kV), 95,000 meters, and the
construction and renewal of 79 MVA of substations (for details see Annex 6).
The program was prepared by UTE's own engineers, who are competent.  UTE
will carry out the distribution program itself as far as it has the capacity
to do so without increasing its personnel. The remainder would be done under
contract.
Estimated Cost
4.07      The Bank Project is estimated to cost Ur$5.6 billion (US$22.6
miil lion), with a foreign exchange component of Ur$4.1 billion (US$16.5 millior%.
The cost estimates are reasonable.  For the steam unit, the estimated cost e£
US$138/kW is based on recent purchases of similar equipment by Latin American
utilities and takes into account that part of the cooling water system
has already been buiilt in conjunction with the installation of the fifth ulit.
For the Montevideo distribution program, the estimate is based on results of
competitive bidding UTE carried out in 1969 and 1970 for the first phase nc.:'
underway.  A contingency allowance of about 7% of the total estimated  oslt
of the installations included in the Project has been added to cover ovorrI.Xs



- 13 -
of physical quantities, possible foundation problems, etc. For price escalation,
allowances in real terms of 3.5% annually on the foreign costs and 7% annually
on local costs have been added. Since the Government has declared the facilities
included in the Bank Project as "in the national interest," UTE will not have
to pay customs duties on imported equiprent for the facilities; therefore, the
Project cost summarized below excludes duties:

Procurement and Disbursement
1.B0      The Bank would disburse frcm the loan account for (a) CIF cost of
tilported equipment and materials for the sixth unit and the Montevideo distri-
bution; (b) foreign exchange cost of civil works and erection contracts for
the sixth unit; (c) foreign exchange cost of consulting services; and (d)
-nterest on the Bank loan during construction.
14.09     Procurement of all equipment related to the Bank Project and the
award of the erection contracts for the steam unit would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Civil works and erection contracts for
distribution equipment not carried out by UTE personnel would be awarded on
the basis of local bidding because of the small size of these contracts. These
contracts would not be covered by the Bank loan. None of the equipment included
in the Bank Project can be manufactured in Uruguay. Except for the hiring of
consultants, no contracts would be awarded before the signing of the loan.
4.10      The expected disbursements from the proposed Bank loan are shown in
knnex 15.  The Bank Project is expected to be completed in 1973.  However,
disbursements might extend into 1974 and a closing date of December 31, 1974
is proposed. If a balance remains in the loan account at that time, it
should be cancelled.



- 14 -
5. JUSTIFICATI9.1 OF TiE PROJECT
5.01      Uruguay's economy is expected to coantinue the recovery that began
in 1969. The Bank's 1969 economic mission to Uruguay considers it possible
for GDP, after remaining approximately constant for the past five years, to
grow at a rate of about 3% per year over the next five years. Should this
occur, the growth rate of electricity consumption can be expected to increase
from the 3.4% average for the past five years to about 6% to 7%. However,
this growth may still be limited somewhat by possible power shortages in the
Montevideo-Rio Negro system during dry years. Such shortages occurred before
the fifth unit at the Batlle plant was commissioned in 1970 and the probability
of a deficit in energy is again relatively high in 1973, before the sixth unit
can be ccmmissioned. Therefore, the growth rate of sales is projected to reach
6% in 1970, to increase to 6.5% in 1971-72, and to drop back to 5% in 1973
(see Annex 1). The maximum demand in the Montevideo-Rio Negro system which
was 389 MW in 1969 is expected to increase to about 470 MS in 1973.
5.02      The load forecast for the Montevideo system (see Annex 2), based
on the above projections, shows that UTE needs a new generating unit by the
second half of 1973 at the latest; the reserve capacity by then would again
be practically nil. UTE needs the new facility to cover both the increasing
peak load and the energy requirement; actually in dry years energy production
would be the most important function of the new unit. Palmar - the only
hydro alternative - cannot be completed before 1976. If it were the only
lacility to be constructed i.e., if TUTE did not proceed with some kind of
thermal plant, there would have to be stringent power restrictions for two
to three years. The cost of these restrictions makes a thermal solution
definitely more economical.  At this time there are only two practical
alternatives to increase the generating capacity; gas turbines combined with
a steam unit or a steam unit alone. The installation of a steam unit alone
with its higher capital cost but substantially lower production expense is
the least present cost solution for discount rates up to 13%. Normally the
capacity of a new unit to be added to a system would not exceed 15% of the
total installed capacity. The proposed 100 MW unit, however, would actually
represent about 16% of the total system capacity and therefore though somewhat
large, its size is reasonable.
5.03      The Montevideo distribution system, which presently is heavily
overloaded and in poor condition, urgently needs rehabilitation and strength-
ening in order to be able to carry the additional energy to be produced in
the new generating units. The proposed distribution program is realistic and
takes into account UTE's physical capability of carrying out the planned
improvements. The program represents the minimum UTE needs to restore to the
system an adequate reliability and to reduce losses from the present 19% to
about 15%, which would be acceptable.
5.04      Incremental financial rates of return were computed for the principal
items of the Bank Project as the discount rates equalizing the present value
of costs and revenues attributable to these items. Returns of 1h% and 10% on
the investment for the sixth unit at Batlle and the Montevideo distribution
program respectively, resulted when revenues were allocated to generation,
transmission and distribution on the basis of long-run capital and ope:rating
costs (see Annex 7). These returns are less than the full economic returns
which include benefits normally recognized as unquantifiable.

6. FUTURE FINANCES
Financing Plan
6.01      A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the five
years 1970-1974 is shown in Annex 13. UTE's capital expenditures during
this period are expected to total Ur$514. billion (US$206 million), consisting
of: (a) the construction expenditures of Ur$35.6 billion (US$142 million)
described in paragraph 4.01; (b) Ur$15.6 billion (US$63 million) of
constructicn expenditures in 1974; and (c) Ur$0.2 billion (US$1 million)
for the purchase of a 10 MhW gas turbine generator set from Agua y Energia
Electrica (AyEE) of Argentina. 1/
6.02      The plan for financing these capital expenditures is satisfactory,
and is summarized below:

6.03      Internal cash generation would be supplemented by (a) Government
contributions of Ur$0.4 billion (US$1.6 million) under an existing law
(paragraph 3.28); (b) contributions and deposits of Ur$4.9 billion (US$19.6
million) made by new telephone subscribers; and (c) a possible Government contri-
bution to UTEts future generation program, which is discussed below. In
connection with the proposed loan UTE agreed that it will continue to require
new telephone subscribers to make contributions and deposits until the Project
is completed. Since the financing plan is based on the reinvestment of all net
income, UTE also agreed that it will retain all its earnings for reinvestment
in its power and telecommunications facilities until the Project is completed.

6.0      The proposed borrowings would total Ur$28.1 billion (US$112.4
million), consisting of (a) the proposed US$18 million Bank loan assumed to
carry interest at 74  and to have a term of 25 years, including Ih years of
grace; (b) financing of US$13.1 million for power and US$20.1 million for
telecommunications from suppliers on 5 to 7 year terms for which arrange-
ments are now being made; (c) financing of UTE's future generation program
(US$48.4 million); (d) US$12.8 million of other loans. UTE should have
no difficulty in obtaining the suppliers' credits and has already received
firm offers in excess of US$20 million. The size of the capital require-
ments for UTE's future generation expansion program is dependent on the
outcome of the studies described in paragraph 3.18. The above financing
plan is based on the assumption that the next step in expanding UTE's gen-
erating capacity would be the construction of the Palmar hydroelectric
scheme to be started in 1972. Under this assumption UTE would have to obtain
Ur$16.8 billion (US$67.2 million) in external resources for this project
during the period 1972-1974. The forecasts assume that the foreign currency
cost of the project (US$48.4 million in l972-l974) would be financed by
borrowing, while Ur$4.7 billion (US$18.8 million) of the local currency
cost would be financed by Government contributions. If the decision is made
not to go ahead with the Palmar scheme, the most probable alternative
means of expanding UTE's generating capacity would be a new thermal plant.
The capital requirements for this type of plant would be much lower than
the amount included in the present program for Palmar. The US$67 million
financing for the future generation program can thus be regarded as an
upper limit of the amount UTE will have to obtain for this purpose during
1972-1974. UTE is expected to request Bank assistance for its future gen-
eration program as soon as the specific projects to be carried out are
clearly defined. The other loans cover (a) the funding of the short term
debt to the Banco de la Republica; (b) the financing by AyEE of the purchase
of the gas turbine set; and (c) financing of the study and construction of
the interconnection with Argentina (paragraph 3.18) by the Inter-American
Development Bank.
Future Earnings
6.o5      Income statements for the years 1970-197h, forecast on the basis
of constant prices, are shown in Annex 12. Power sales are forecast as in-
dicated in paragraph 5.01. Forecast operating expenses take into account the
various measures described in Chapter 3 to improve operational efficiency
while at the same time providing for increased salaries of professional and
managerial staff. The rate of return on the power rate base is expected to
increase to 9.9% in 1970 from 4.0% in 1969. A 10% rate of return would be
maintained during the years 1971-1973, and a rate of return of not less than
8% in 1974 and succeeding years (see paragraph 3.22). UTE should have no
difficulty in achieving these goals, provided it maintains itS9present tariffs
in real terms.
6.o6      Telecommunications revenues are expected to increase with the in-
crease in subscribers made possible by the 1970-1975 expansion program. The
rate of return on the telecommunications rate base is expected to decrease to
11.6% in 1970 from 14.6% in 1969 as a result of the increase of the rate hasea
due to the commissioning of new exchanges in 1970. There would be no dif-
ficulty in mairntair.ing a rate of retur!l of at least 1Ot during the pariod
1971-1974.

FIbure Financial Position
6.07      UTE's financial position is expected to improve in 1970 and to remain
sound thereafter provided adequate tariffs are maintained (see paragraphs 3.22
end 3.23). Annex 10 shows forecast balance sheets for the years 1970-197h.
The modest proportion of debt in UTE's long term capitalization would be increased,
with a debt/equity ratio of 32/68 in 1974 as compared to the 1969 figure of
27/73. There would still be room for more borrowing, ilowever, and debt service
coverage would remain ample for both the power and telecommunications operations
(Annex 13). UTErs total debt service coverage would decli-ne from 2.7 in 19710
to 1.8 in 1974., which would still be satisfactory.
6.08      The forecast balance sheets (Annex 10) show a considerable improvement
In UTE's current position which is due to (a) the funding of UTE's debt to the
Banco de la Republica (paragraph 3.30); (b) the reduction of accounts receivablo
from public sector entities; and (c) the reduction in UTE's debts to public s
entities (see paragraph 3.29).
6.09      UTE will have to exercise great care to ensure that the sound finanrci-
position described above is not jeopardized by excessive reliance on short terix,
credits (paragraph 3.28). In connection with the proposed loan, it has been
agreed that UTE will not undertake any new major project until the Bank Project
Is completed unless it can provide evidence satisfactory to the Bank that funds
for the project are available on terms which would not adversely affect UTE's
financial condition.  A major project is defined as a project requiring a tot-d
investment of more than 3% of UTE's net income in the fiscal year prior to the
start of the project. A similar limitation applies to smaller projects when
the aggregate investment required for such projects in a given fiscal year
exceeds 12% of UTEts net income in the previous fiscal year.
6.10      UTE has also agreed it will not incur debt for its power or
telecommunications operations without the consent of the Bank unless the sum
of net operating income and depreciation is at least 1.5 times the maximum
debt service in any future year.

(ii) telecommunication tariffs which will produce a rate of return
of at least 10% on UTE's telecommunications rate base (para-
graph 3.23);
(g)  UTE will reorganize its accounting system with the assistance of
consultants acceptable to the Bank, and will initiate the implementa-
tion of a budgetary control system during 1971 (paragraph 3.24);
(h) UTE will have its accounts audited by independent accountants

(1)  until the Bank Project is complete, UTE will not undertake any maJor
new project unless it can pravide evidence satisfactory to the Bank
that financing for the project is available on terzs which would riot
adversely affect USE's financial position (paragraph 6.09); and,
(m)- UTE will not incur debt without the agreenent of the Bank unless
the sium of net operating income and depreciation is at least 1.5
times the maximum debt service in any future year (paragraph 6.10).
7.02      With the above agreements, the proposed Project constitutes a
suitable basis for a loan of US$18 million equivalent with a term of 25 years
including Lh½ years of grace.

Hydroelectric Plants on the Rio Negro
1.        Map 1 shows the location of the two existing and the planned
hydroelectric plants:
- Rincon del Bonete: 128 MW, commissioned in 1948,
- Rincon de Baygorria: 108 MS, commissioned in 1960, and
- Palmar: 370 MW, proposed.
The Bonete reservoir has a storage capacity of 6.65 b-llion m3 and partially
regulates the run-off of the Rio Negro.  The Baygorria reservoir has only
120 million m3 of live storage and therefore provides only weekly pondage.
2.        The Rio Negro catchment at Rincon del Bonete measures 39,700 km2; i't
is situated mainly in Uruguay (only 3,100 km2 lie in Brazil). Rainfall averages
1,190 mm per year, but is extremely irregular both within the individual years
and from one year to the Qther. These irregularities are reflected in river
flows varying between 7 m/s and 16,000 m3/s (average: 525 m3/s) and annual
run-offs between 1.8 and 48 billion m3 (average: 16.5 billion m-').  The average
loss from evaporation and seepage in the Bonete reservoir amounts to about
1.2 billion mi3 per year.
3.        In view of the erratic stream flow and the relatively small storage
capacity of the reservoir (in average less than a six months run-off) UTE has
developed a system of operating the Bonete reservoir that tries to avoid
unnecessary spilling of water during the periods of high flow and shutdowns
of the plants during dry periods. The system defines the mode of operation
for three types of flow conditions:
(a)  the "normal" condition when as much water as possible should be
used; when this condition prevails the hydro plants are used
as base load plants and the thermal plants are utilized for
peaking;
(b) the "deficit" condition when there is a severe water shortage;
the hydro plants are used for peaking and the base load is
provided by the thermal plants; under this condition the
reservoir level is regulated in such a way as to enable the hycdko
plants to supply peaking capacity during a drought similar to the
one experienced in 1916-1917, which is the severest on record;
1965 and 1968 were also years with ver-' low run-offs.
(c)  the "mixed" condition when the stream flow is neither adequate
for condition (a) nor low enough to make operation under condition
(b) necessary. Then, in general, the hydro plants are used in
such a way as to hold the reservoir level constant, the rest of
the load diagram being covered by the thermal plants.
4.        The above system, which UTE is progressively refining, with the hielp
of several computer Drograms, has worked reasonably well in past years.

Power Construction Program 1970-1973
A. Description
1.  Fifth and Sixth Units at Batlle
The fifth steam unit at Batlle, which was cormissioned ir June
1970 includes an oil fired boiler with superheater and reheater, supplying
steam to a turbogenerator with the following main characteristics:
-    rated capacity                             80 MT   2
-    primary steam pressure                    125 kg/cm
-    primary steam temperature                  5200C
-    reheat temperature                         520 C
-    condenser pressure at rated capacity       0.05 kg/cm
-    generator voltage                          12 kV
-    cooling                              by closed hydrogen circuit
The sixth unit at Batlle will include an oil fired boiler without superheater
and without reheater, supplying steam to a turbogenerator with the following
main characteristics:
-    rated capacity                           100 kW   2
-    primary steam pressure                   1050kg/cm
-    primary steam temperature                50 C
-    generator voltage                        12 kV
-    cooling                            by closed hydrogen circuit
2.   Palmar aydroelectric Development
The Palmar hydroelectric plant would be situated on the Rio Negro
approximately 30 km downstream from its confluence with the Rio Yi and
about 80 km downstream from the Baygorria plant. It would use the waters
from the upper Rio Negro as regulated by the Bonete reservoir, and from
the Rio Yi which is unregulated. The average runoff of the Rio Negro at
Palmar is 725 m3/s. The plant would utilize the head (33.4 m maximum)
created by a 36 m high dam comprising 470 m and 950 m long earth fill
wings at the abutments, a 195 m long power house section, a 195 m long
spillway section (capacity: 13,500 m;3s); and a 215 m long concrete
section with the bottom out ets and the space for a future lock. These
works include 2.3 million m of earth fill and 600,000 m of concrete.
Six 62.5 MW Kaplan units (four units to be installed in the first stage)
would be installed in the power house. The expected production amounts
to 1,000 to 1,200 GWh per year in average. The energy would be transmitted
to Montevideo over a single circuit 400 kV line. The total cost of the
development is estimated at US$96 million, of which about US$50 million
would be in foreign currency. The 1970-73 investment program includes
expenditures for the first two years of the Palmar oroject subject to
confirmation that this devrelopTent is economically justified.

3.   Diesel Plants
UTE needs new diesel units to extend the power supply and to
replace obsolete units in the isolated systems of the interior. In 1969
it ordered two 3,200 kW units and one 1,400 kW unit from Fiat Argentina,
six 1,150 kW units from Skoda (Czechoslovakia) and three 450 kW units from
Caterpillar (U.S.). These diesel units are included in the 1970-73
investment program together with twenty 200 kW units to be ordered in 1970.
4.  Transmission in Eastern Region
UTE's 1970-73 investment program includes the second year of the
two year program for strengthening and extending the Eastern transmission
system. The purpose of this project is to increase capacity and reliability
of the lines supplying industrial centers and resorts (especially Punta del
Este) along the coast east of Montevideo.
5. Transmission in Western Region
In this region UTE plans to connect Salto (population, 70,000, the
second largest city of Uruguay) with the Montevideo-Rio Negro system and to
reinforce the lines between Rincon del Bonete, Young, Mercedes and
Paysandu, and the substations at Young, Mercedes and Paysandu.
6.   Transmission in Central Region
In this region UTE plans to connect the cities of Florida, Durazno
and Tacuaxembo to the Montevideo-Rio Negro system.
7. Interconnection with Argentina
Ebasco Services of the U.S. is presently investigating this
interconnection. The studies should be completed by end of 1970. Although
the feasibility of the line is not yet established, the present program
assumes that the implementation of the project would begin by 1973.
8.  Montevideo Distribution System
The extension and rehabilitation works during the four years
1970-73 comprise:
(a) the installation of the following subterranean cables:
- 47 km at 30 kV,
- 140 km at 6 kV, and
- 120 km at 220 V;
(b) the installation in existing substations of
- 150 MVA of 30/6 kV transformers, and
-  46 MVA of 6/0.24 kV transformers;
(c) the construction of 3 new 30/6 kV substations with a total
capacity of 6i MVA and of 60 new 6/0.23 kV substations with a
total capacity of 18 MVA;



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 4 pages
(d) the renewal of low tension control boards including the replacement
of the protection for 2,000 existing caoles, the extension of
control  boards for 124 new cables, and the installation of new
control boards for 300 cables in the new substations mentioned under (c);
(e) the connection of 500 new feeders with the 220 V overhead system;
(f)  the installation of 3,120 km of insulated 220 V conductors and of
150 km of uninsulated 6 kV conductors in the overhead system;
(g) the replacement of 95,000 meters for active energy and the install-
ation of 5,000 meters for reactive energy;
(h) the purchase of:
- equipment for fault localization in cables,
- equipment for oil treatment,
- mobile equipment for construction and supervision of the distribution
system,
- equipment necessary to rehabilitate the transformer workshop.
9, Distribut-Lon in Other Systems
UTE has not yet prepared a rehabilitation and extension program
for these systems, which are generally in very poor condition. It expects
to prepare a program for 1971 by the end of 1970 and will hire consultants
to prepare a longer range program.

Return Calculations
Lowest Cost Alternative:
1.        In order to determine the lowest cost alternative the two most
practical alternatives were compared:
- Alternative A: 100 Mi steam plant to be commissioned in 1973 plus 30 2YW
of steam plant as part of a 100 NW or larger unit to be coimmissioned in.
1974, and
- Alternative B: 30 ITI of gas turbines in 1973 plus a 1oo MW steam plant
in 1974.
2.        The basic assumptions used were:
- Capital costs: US$153/kW for the steam units and US$105kW for the gas
turbines;
- Operating&maintenance costs: US$0.35 million per year for Alternative A
and US$0.88 million per year for Alternative 3, both values are high
but they are based on UTE's calculations;
- Fuel consumption: 250 t/GWh for steam plants and [20 t/GlWh for gas turbines;
- Fuel costs: US$18/t for steam plant and US$22/t for gas turbine; the
US$18/t takes into account the fact that the US$13.50 UTE pays to the
Government refinery for the residual oil does not reflect the real cost
of the fuel;
- Expected production:              Alternative A    Alternative B (GWlh)

- Expected economic life of a steam unit utilized about 6000 h per year:
30 years.
3.        On the basis of the conservative assumptions shown above the equalizing
discount rate is 13%. If capital and fuel costs for steam plants are increased
by 10%, Alternative A is still less expensive than Alternative B for discount
rates up to 11%.
Incremental Financial Rate of Return for the 6th Unit at Batlle
4.7       For the computation of this incremental financial rate of return it
was assumed that power is generated by a hypothetical entity which sells it to
a transmission and distribution enterprise.  The financial rate of return to
this generating utility was calculated.



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 3 pages
5.        The following basic assumptions were used:
- capital cost; US$15.3 million;
- Maintenance and operation cost: US$0.76 million per year;
- fuel consumption: 250 t/GIJh;
- fuel cost: US$18/t;
- the production of the 6th unit was assumed to be 600 GWh (utilization
6000 h) during the first ten years and to decline uniformly to 375 GWh
over the next 20 years;
- revenues were calculated using present tariffs and allocated to
generation on the basis of long run production costs calculated by
UTE at a rate of US¢l.l per kWh of net generation;
- economic life of the unit: 30 years.
6.        On the basis of the conservative assumptions shown above the incre-
mental financial rate of return is 14%. A sensitivity analysis shows that
- a reduction in allocated revenue of 0.1 US¢/kWh reduces the return by
1.5%.
- an increase in capital costs of 10% reduces the return by l.4%, and
- an increase in fuel cost of 10% reduces the return by 1.2%.
On the assumption that not more than two variations of the above type occur
simultaneously the rate of return would still be about 12%.
Incremental Financial Rate of Return for the Montevideo Distribution Progran
7.        This rate of return was calculated for a hypothetical distribution
enterprise that would purchase its energy. The calculation considered the
complete Montevideo distribution extension and rehabilitation program (Annex 6)
of which only 2-12 years are included in the Bank Project.
8.        The following basic assumptions were used;
- capital cost: US$16.7 million;
- operation and maintenance cost: US$1.28 million per year;
- the cost of energy to the hypothetical distribution entity was
estimated at USQ 1.6 per kvh received,on the basis of long run
generation and transmission costs calculated by UTE.



ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 3 pages
- the following percentages of incremental revenues based on present
tariffs (over those in 1969) were allocated to the new facilities:
1970: 20%, 1971: 35%, 1972: 50%, 1973: 60% and 1974: 70%; for the
subsequent years the same energy figure as for 1974 was used.
9.        On the basis of the        conservative assuriptions shown above the
incremental financial rate of return is 10%. A sensitivity analysis shows that:
- an increase in the purchase price of energy of US30.1 per k1Th reduces
the rate of return by 1.4%;
- an increase in capital cost of 10% reduces the return by 1.2%, and
- an increase in operation and maintenance costs of 10% reduces the
return by 0.8%.
On the assumption that not more than two variations of the above type occur
simultaneously the rate of return would still be about 8%.

Power Tariff Regulations
The power tariff regulations were approved by the Government
on March 20, 1970. They are the result of discussions between the
Government, UTE and the Bank dating back to 1964. The following is an
outline of their main provisions:
1. Power Rate Base. The power rate base is the sum of:
(a) revalued net fixed assets as of June 30 of each year; (b) a provision
for inventories; and (c) a provision for working capital. The provision
for inventories is not defined in the regulations; UTE has set it at 2%
of revalued net fixed assets. The provision for working capital is equal
to one quarter of the year's operating revenues.
2. Rate of return. UTE is entitled to a rate of return on the
power rate base of at least 4% in 1970, 6% in 1971 and 8% thereafter.
If the actual rate of return is lower, UTE may recover the deficiency
as explained below. The actual rate used in setting tariffs is to be
adjusted on the basis of UTE's financial requirements, but it may not
exceed 10%.
3. Dereciation. Fixed assets must be depreciated over their
useful lives using tlle straight-line method. The average rate of
depreciation for power facilities must be between 3% and 5%.
4. Rate application. UTE must present its rate application by
October 1 so that the tariffs can be approved by January 1.
5. Revaluation. Gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation
are revalued with an index obtained by averaging the cost of living index
published by the Ydnistry of Finance and the official exchange rate index.
For the purpose of setting rates, a forecast revaluation index as of
June 30 of the subsequent year is used.
6. Recovery of deficiencies. If UTE fails to earn the minimum
rate of return established by the regulations, the deficiency is charged
to a special account. If actual earnings exceed 10%, the excess must be
credited to the same account. When the special account has a negative
balance, UTE is permitted to use a rate of return of up to 10% in setting
tariffs in order to recover the deficiency. The special account is then
credited with earnings in excess of the minimum return until it shows a
positive balance.



A1iEX 8
Page 2 of 2 pages
7. Intermediate adjustments. UTE is permitted to adjust its rates
automatically once a year: (a) if there are increases in the sum of fuel
and labor costs at least equal to 5% of the forecast total revenues used
in preparing the rate application; or (b) if the revaluation index
increases by more than 10% (before June 30) or 25% (after June 30) from
the value used in preparing the application.

Notes on 1964 - 1968 Balance Sheets
1.        Fixed assets were revalued in 1964. Subsequent additions
are shown at cost. This leads to an unrealistically low valuation of
fixed assets in terms of current values. The only substantial addition
to plant in operation during 1964l - 1968 was made in 1968, when the
facilities built with the assistance of a Us$8.8 million loan made in
1959 by the Development Loan Fund (DLF) of the United States were finally
transferred to this account.
2.        Accounts receivable represented the following percentage of annual
operating revenues:
1964  1965 1966  1       1960
Private consumers             1     22    20    24    20
Public sector consumers      203   106   116   131   131
The accomnts receivable from public sector consumers are offset to an
unknown extent by accounts payable by UTE and deferred liabilities (see
note 5).
3.        Represents the difference between the Uruguayan peso equivalent
of foreign exchange liabilities stated at current exchange rates and the
Uruguayan peso equivalent at the time that they were assumed.
4.        Including current maturities.  Foreign currency liabilities
are stated at current exchange rates.
5.        Represents liabilities of UTE to other public sector agencies
for which terms of repayment have not been worked out.

Notes on 1964-1968 Income Statements
1.        In current pesos.
2.        Based on an unrealistically low valuation of fixed assets
(see note 1 to balance sheets).
3.        UTE is exempt from income and other taxes, but pays fixed
contributions aggregating Ur$3.4 million for services rendered by various
government agencies.  Net income is overstated due to insufficient depreciation
(see note 2).  If adequate depreciation had been charged, there would have
been a loss in 1964 and 1965 and net income from 1966 to 1968 would have
been considerably lower (e.g. net income after deducting adequate depreciation
for 1968 is estimated at about Ur$700 millio4.

NOTES ON 1969-1974 INCOME STATEIMENTS
1.   In constant pesos.
2.  Forecast power revenues for 1970 are based on the tariffs
effective from July 1970. Revenues in the years 1971-1973
would be sufficient to achieve a 10% rate of return on the
power rate base. In 1974 the return would be at least 8%.
3.  Forecast telecommunications revenues for 1970 are based on
the tariffs in effect from February 1970. Revenues for
1971-1974 would be sufficient to achieve a 10% rate of return
on the telecommunications rate base.
4. Forecast fuel expenses are based on projected thermal generation
and present fuel prices. Depreciation is based on revalued
assets. Other operations and maintenance expenses (including
wages) are assumed to increase at about 8% a year in real terms.
5.   Includes revalued net fixed assets and provisions for inventory
and working capital (see Annex 8).
