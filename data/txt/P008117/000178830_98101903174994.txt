REPORT AND RECONUENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO ADMINISTRACION GENERAL DE LAS
USINAS ELECTRICAS Y LOS TELEFONOS DEL ESTADO
TO BE GUARANTEED BY THE
REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY
FOR A FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$18 million to
Administracion General de las Usinas Electricas y los Tel6fonos del Estado
(UTE) for a power project, with the guarantee of the Republic of Uruguay.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has been associated with the electric power sector in
Uruguay since 1950, when the first Bank loan in the country, for US$33 mil-
lion, was made to finance the foreign exchange costs of a four-year power
and telecommunications expansion program of UTE. Subsequently a loan of
US$5.5 million was made in 1955 to finance the installation of additional
thermal generating capacity in Montevideo and, in 1956, a third loan of
US$25.5 million was made for the Baygorria hydroelectric project and asso-
ciated transmission lines. The proposed fourth loan would help finance the
foreign exchange cost of the most urgent investments in generation and
distribution facilities which UTE must make during 1971-73.
3.        In the latter part of the 'fifties, severe inflation and economic
stagnation beset the Uruguayan economy and UTE was one of the institutions
which suffered most in these circumstances. UTE's financial performance
deteriorated sharply as successive governments denied the enterprise timely
and adequate tariff adjustments despite rapid inflation, while political
interference in UTE's administration led to overstaffing and inefficiency.
The negative trends in the economy and in UTE were not reversed until 1968,
when the present government instituted an effective stabilization program
and undertook a series of financial and institutional reforms in key sectors
of the economy. In 1969 a consultant, provided by the Bank, assisted UTE
in drawing up a program of essential measures to restore the operating
efficiency and financial health of the enterprise. In the following months,
UTE's administration was reorganized along the lines proposed by the con-
sultant, new tariff regulations consistent with Bank reconmnendaticns were
introduced, and power rates were sharply increased. By early 1970, impressive
progress had been made in laying the groundwork for a resumptiion of Bank
lending to UTE.



4.        The project was appraised by a mission which visited Uruguay
in March 1570 and negotiations for the proposed loan took place in
Washington from August 28 to September 8, 1970. UTE was represented by
Messrs. Yanuel Mendiola, General Manager; Pedro Rivero, Manager, Finance
Division; Juan Bado Hamilton, Legal Adviser; and Miss Marta Casabo,
Assistant to the General Manager. The Government of Uruguay was represented
in these negotiations by Mr. Hector Luisi, Uruguayan Ambassador in Washingt(n,
and IMr. Alfredo Platas, iLinister of the Embassy.
5.        The proposed loan would increase the Bank's total lending to Uru-
guay to US$126.5 million.  The following is a summary statement of the Bank
loans to Uruguay as of September 30, 1970:

6.        The road construction project financed by the loan the Bank made
in 1962 has suiffered a variety of delays, the most important of which was
occasioned by a lengthy disagreement between the design consultant and the
government on the final designs. However, recent performance on the pro-
ject has been satisfactory and construction is now moving ahead toward com-
pletion.  After review of a progress report from the Government, the Closing
Date was recently postponed to flay 31, 1971, by wthich time it is expected
that iwork on all road sections will have been satisfactorily completed.
7.        The proposed loan is the only one I expect to present to the
Executive Directors in the current financial year. In FY-1972 another,
larger livestock loan is planned to follow up the US$6.3 million loan
made in June 1970; the latter was intended as an interim loan which would
meet the credit needs of Uruguay's ranchers for only 12-18 months. Prepa-
ration has begun on a tourism project and another loan to UTE to help
finance the expansion of its generating capacity after 1973 is in prospect.

PART III - THE PROJET
9.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
report entitled "Usinas y Telefonos del Estado (UTE) Appraisal of the Fourth
Power Project" (PU-49a).
10.       UTE, the proposed borrower, is an autonomous government enter-
prise which manages power supply and telephone services in Uruguay. UTE
now operates generating plants having a reliable installed capacity of some
464 IIW and supplies 95 percent of the country's electric energy requirements,
the remaining 5 percent being produced in "captive" plants owned by large
industries in Montevideo. On the telecommunications side, UTE operates 320
telephone exchanges and services about 150,000 subscribers. It also pro-
vides international telephone services as well as a telex service.
11.       Over the past five years electricity consumption has grown at a
rate of 3.2 percent per annum, but with the recovery in the Uruguayan eco-
nomy and the increased tempo of development now under way it is expected
that the rate of growth of demand for electric power will increase to 6 per-
cent per annum.  The commissioning of the fifth 80 HMA unit at the Batlle
plant earlier this year alleviated an acute power shortage in the Montevi-
deo-Rio Negro system (which accounts for 90 percent of UTE's sales) and
gave UTE sufficient generating capacity to meet estimated consumption
requirements until 1973. By the latter year, however, consumption is
expected to have grown to the point where UTE's reserve capacity will be
inadequate and additional generating capacity will be needed to assure the
maintenance of a reliable power supply.
12.       The proposed project includes the additional generating capacity
in which UTE must now invest, plus the most urgent investments which must
be made in the distribution network. The major component of the project
is the installation of a 100 MW sixth steam unit at the Batlle plant in
Montevideo, to be commissioned in 1973.   The other major item is the
rehabilitation and extension of the Montevideo distribution system which
includes installation of underground cables, overhead lines and transformers.
The loan will also finance the services of consultants who will assist UTE
in the following three key areas: (i) the development of long range plans
for the expansion of generating capacity; (ii) the reorganization of the
accounting system; and (iii) improving management and operating efficiency-
13.       UTE's Board of Directors consists of five members appointed by
the President for a four-year term coinciding with that of the Government.
In addition to considering broad policy matters, the Board has in the past
directly controlled day-to-day operations with the result that decisions
were often long delayed and UTE's management made unduly cumbersome. Last
year, however, following one of the principal recommendations of the Bank
consultant, the Board established the position of General Manager to which



it delegated certain important operating responsibilities.  This was an
important step forward in making more agile and effective management possible,
and during negotiations assurances were obtained that the existing Board
resolutions governing the position of General Manager would not be modified
without the Bank's concurrence. The present General Manager is well qualified
and UTE has agreed to consult with the Bank prior to making any new ap-
pointments to this post. The further strengthening of UTE may also be
expected as a result of the work of the consultants who will be employed
under the project to advise on the improvement of organization, management
and operating procedures. During negotiations UTE agreed to consult with
the Bank on the consultants' recoimendations and to implement an improvement
program satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations UTE also outlined
a program under which it intends to progressively eliminate overstaffing,
mainly by not filling vacancies arising from normal staff attrition. It
is expected that total staff can be reduced by at least 10 percent by 1974,
despite the fact that UTE would be greatly expanding both its telecommunica-
tions and power operations during the intervening years.
14.       As a result of increases of 30 percent in 1969 and 45 percent in
1970, UTE's power rates are now adequate to enable the enterprise to earn
a satisfactory rate of return and make a reasonable contribution to the
financing of its investment requirements. The Government and UTE agreed
during negotiations to maintain power rates at a level that will produce a
minimum return of 10 percent on an appropriately revalued rate base until
the completion of the project. It was also agreed that the existing elec-
tricity rate regulations, which provide for a rate of return of 8-10 percent,
will not be materially modified without the Bank's concurrence and that, for
the period following the completion of the project, rates will be set after
consultation with the Bank so as to assure UTE a rate of return within the
stipulated range. Telecommunication tariffs have been generally adequate
in the past and to insure UTE's overall financial viability it was agreed
during negotiations that they would in the future be maintained at a level
which would provide a minimum rate of return of 10 percent on UTE's appro-
priately revalued telecommunications tariff base. In addition to the
maintenance of adequate tariffs, measures to assure the collection of
substantial past due accounts owed by public sector agencies are essential
to the restoration of UTE's financial health. Good progress has been made
in recent months in collecting these accounts and UTE has agreed to continue
to take steps satisfactory to the Bank for this purpose. UTE may borrow
only if debt service including the service of the proposed borrowing is
covered at least 1.5 times by the sum of net operating income and depreciation.
15.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$22.6 million, ex-
cluding interest during construction. Contracts for equipment and for
erection of the steam unit will be put to international bidding and are
likely to go to foreign firms. The proposed Bank loan of US$18 million
would be used to pay for the foreign exchange cost of these items as well
as interest of US$1.5 million on the loan. Civil works and erection contracts
for distribution equipment are too small to be likely to attract foreign
bidders and they will be financed entirely by UTE.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUM12TS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and UTE, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Republica Oriental del Uruguay and the Bank,
the report of the Conmittee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and a draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors sepaiately.
The draft agreements conform substantially to the pattern of agreements
relating to power projects.
PART V - THE ECONO1MY
17.       A report on the 'TCurrent Economic Position and Prospects of Uru-
guay" (WH-198a) was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1970.
The report concluded that the policies being pursued by the present Gov-
erment had brought about a significant improvement in Uruguay's economic
performance and creditworthiness. It found that monetary, fiscal and
incomes policies had succeeded in slowing inflation and that the balance
of payrents had been strengthened. The continuation of these favorable
trends in the first eight months of this year was confirmed by an Economic
Mission which visited Uruguay in August to update and expand our information.
This mission is now preparing its report.
18.       The recent mission found that there was increasing evidence that
the Uruguayan economy had finally broken out of its prolonged stagnation.
In 1969, GDP is estimated to have grown by 5.3 percent in real terms, with
improved price incentives to livestock producers and the impact on internal
demand of the Government's incomes policy, which had tended to redistribute
income in favor of labor, playing an important role in raising the level of
economic activity. Industrial productivity and profits have improved with
the utilization of excess capacity and recent large increases in capital
goods imports appear to indicate that the private sector is beginning to
respond to the Government's policies by stepping up investment. The revival
of the economy has also been reflected in a significant decline in reported
unemployment in Montevideo; in addition, real wages rose significantly in
1969 and labor-management relations have been relatively tranquil for the
past year.
19.       The cost of living rose by less than 10 percent in the first six
months of this year, despite increases in public sector tariffs and other
corrective price adjustments. The increase over the full year is likely to
be held to about 15 percent, the level to which inflation was brought dowl
in 1969, after having averaged about 100 percent in the preceding two years.
Although a 13 percent general wage increase was permitted in 1969, it is
estimated that by the beginning of this year more than half of the increased
unit cost of labor had been absorbed by improved productivity. Through



- 7 -
June 1970, public sector operations were contractionary as the housing
authority accumulated large balances of unspent earmarked taxes and the
Central Government covered its modest cash deficit with sales of Treasury
bills and bonds. Monetary expansion during the first semester was held
to about 7 percent despite a substantial increase in net foreign exchange
reserves.
20.       As regards the balance of payments, exports have continued to
rise sharply this year, mainly as a result of substantial increases in
both the volume and value of meat exports reflecting the improvement of
producers' incentives in Uruguay as well as the favorable trend in world
prices. While imports have been rising even more sharply than exports,
Uruguay is expected to be able to maintain the trade surplus which, together
with a substantial inflow of long-term capital, has made it possible to
rapidly amortize the short-term debt in the form of rescheduled commercial
and financial arrears accumulated in the mid--l9601s. Net foreign exchange
reserves (excluding official liabilities of more than one year), which
reached the equivalent of almost seven months' imports at the end of 1969,
continued to rise in the first six months of this year. However, in recent
months substantial foreign exchange losses have occurred, apparently as the
result of speculative capital movements following the devaluation of the
Argentine Peso. Much now depends on whether such speculation will abate,
and on the behavior of Uruguayan tourist earnings with the advent of the
tourism season in December; the outcome of the latter is doubtful due to
the high level of Uruguayan prices. The present uncertainties underlie the
continuing need for the government policies to respond with flexibility and
speed to changing circumstances. Also, there is a need to assure an adequate
level of public sector savings and an expanded flow of credit to the
commodities-producing sectors, as well as to improve project identification
and preparation activities.
21.       Uruguay's public and publicly-guaranteed foreign debt amounted
at the beginning of 1970 to US$320 million. Service on this debt has been
very heavy in recent years, due to the excessive concentration of maturities,
and the ratio of debt service to foreign exchange earnings was 23 percent
in 1969. However, it is reasonable to assume that Uruguay will be able to
borrow over the next five years on more favorable terms than in the past and
that debt service will be manageable. On this basis Uruguay can be regarded
as creditworthy for further borrowing on conventional terms.

PART VI - 011PLIANCE WITH TI-E ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOIMMEDATION
23.       I reconmend that the Executive Directors approve this loan.
