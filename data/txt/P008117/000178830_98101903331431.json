The major component of the project is\n            the installation of a 100 MW sixth steam unit at the Batlle\n            plant in Montevideo, to be commissioned in 1973. The other\n            major item is the rehabilitation and extension of the\n            Montevideo distribution system which includes installation\n            of underground cables, overhead lines and transformers. The\n            loan will also finance the services of consultants who will\n            assist UTE in the following three key areas: (i) the\n            development of long range plans for the expansion of\n            generating capacity; (ii) the reorganization of the\n            accounting system; and (iii) improving operating and\n            management efficiency."}, "docdt": "1970-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
