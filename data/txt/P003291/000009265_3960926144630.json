the backlog of the periodic maintenance of primary,\n            secondary and feeder roads. The project comprises : (1)\n            strengthening and rehabilitation of nine sections of paved\n            roads totalling 175 km; (2) resealing of about 1500 km of\n            paved roads; (3) regravelling of about 1500 km of secondary\n            and feeder roads; (4) low-cost improvement of about 1400 km\n            of secondary and feeder roads; and (5) consultants to\n            prepare detailed engineering studies and to supervise\n            strengthening and rehabilitation of paved roads."}, "docdt": "1988-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
