The\n            primary objective of the project was to reduce the backlog\n            of periodic maintenance of primary, secondary, and feeder\n            roads. Bank's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) government's\n            commitment alone does not guarantee the allocation of\n            adequate funds for a project; (ii) the decision to address\n            maintenance requirements at a time when most projects\n            focused on new construction and rehabilitation yielded high\n            returns; (iii) parallel reforms, such as to develop and\n            maintain the capacity of the construction industry, must\n            move in consort with changes in how roads are maintained;\n            and (iv) the usual time frames provided for are too\n            optimistic and that more effective change could ensue from\n            more realistic programming."}, "docdt": "1995-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
