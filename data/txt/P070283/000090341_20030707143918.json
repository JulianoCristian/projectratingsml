The lesson learned indicate that\n            immediately following conflict, and the concomitant\n            destruction of property, the prices of assets often rise to\n            an inflated level. Where a line of credit is offered while\n            these conditions persist, this can result in excessive\n            borrowing and expose borrowers to unmanageable levels of\n            debt as asset prices deflate post-boom. In a post-conflict\n            environment, both borrowers and lenders face massive\n            information deficiencies and so the misreading of market\n            conditions and opportunities is more likely than not, thus\n            leading to loan losses, unsuccessful businesses and\n            worsening of poverty and livelihood levels. A significant\n            proportion of small, short-term loans in the early\n            post-conflict portfolio will support the objectives of\n            injecting liquidity rapidly and restoring retail trade\n            quickly. Such loans are also likely to have superior\n            repayment performance. The credible promise of timely\n            approval of subsequent credit lines, with the possibility of\n            progressive increases in loan size, is a potent incentive\n            for repayment. Many of the implicit objectives of Small\n            Enterprise Project (SEP I) related to financial sector\n            development, although the headline SEP I, Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) related to broader and more\n            explicit post-conflict Private Sector Development (PSD)\n            goals. The competing objectives and forms of input brought\n            about a degree of internal inconsistency during project\n            implementation. Even in an emergency situation, small credit\n            projects need to calculate appropriate measures of portfolio\n            performance to permit the monitoring and analysis of trends\n            in repayment performance. These include data on the aging of\n            arrears and loan collections at the margin as well as\n            cumulatively. In an immediate post-conflict environment,\n            donors should coordinate their activities such that there is\n            only one form/approach of donor-provided small enterprise\n            intermediated credit. The sequencing of post-conflict PSD\n            interventions is crucial and adequate allowances should be\n            made for relatively weak implementation capacity on the part\n            of the transitional administration and the emerging\n            government structure. Procurement of services in a\n            post-conflict transitional environment can be expected to\n            take longer than normal. Project design needs to accommodate\n            this accordingly."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
