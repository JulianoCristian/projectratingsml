were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            in regards to project preparation, there is clear trade-offs\n            between a fast-track approach and a more time-consuming\n            approach based on in-depth country analysis. Even when there\n            is international experience to draw upon to address complex\n            development problems, every project requires an in-depth\n            analysis to ensure that project design is based on\n            sustainable approaches. Project designs that rely more on\n            existing models and less on a thorough understanding of\n            country needs and context may lead to risky projects with\n            delays in implementation. Less preparation can result in\n            costly project restructuring in order to use loan resources\n            more efficiently and effectively. In order to make a more\n            effective use of loan resources, 'virtual' pools\n            of funding can be used by fostering a single national\n            operational plan of which project funding is only one part,\n            under the coordination of a national coordination entity\n            with sufficient institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "2009-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
