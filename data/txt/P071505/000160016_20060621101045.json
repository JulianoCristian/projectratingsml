The\n            changes will support the government in comprehensively\n            responding to the challenges of preventing and controlling\n            HIV/AIDS. Currently, the projects of development partners,\n            including the Bank Project, restrict the use of funds to a\n            limited set of activities. As a result, some intervention\n            areas that are critical to effectively respond to the\n            epidemic are underfunded, including the coordination of\n            activities. The changes will expand the eligibility of\n            expenditures to match the full scope of activities required\n            to strengthen, expand, and deepen the response to the\n            epidemic. Furthermore, the changes would, where appropriate,\n            simplify the project's implementation procedures. The\n            revised development objective would include, in addition to\n            the original objective of reducing the risk of HIV\n            transmission, improving the quality of life of those\n            infected and affected, and strengthening the coordination\n            and management of the response to the epidemic."}, "docdt": "2006-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
