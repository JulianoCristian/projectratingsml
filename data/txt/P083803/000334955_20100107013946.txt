F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
Program Development Objectives (from the Operation Description in each Program
Document)
  Mali PRSC-I: The operation supported implementation of Mali#s Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF), including policy measures intended to: (i)
strengthen the macroeconomic and budget frameworks, particularly their links to the
poverty reduction strategy, and strengthen public finance management, namely
management, accountability and transparency of budget execution as well as
procurement; (ii) support growth-enhancing measures in the financial sector, private
sector, electricity, transport and transit facilitation, Office du Niger irrigation, and cotton
sectors; and (iii) improve access to basic social services, notably health and social
development, and rural water supply and sanitation.

  Mali PRSC-II: The operation continued IDA support to GOM to implement the
GPRSF, focusing on a set of policies and reforms intended to: (i) strengthen the
macroeconomic and budget frameworks, particularly their links to the poverty reduction
strategy, and strengthen public finance management, notably in the areas of procurement
and in management, accountability and transparency of budget execution; (ii) support
growth-enhancing measures in the financial sector, private sector, transport and transit
facilitation, Office du Niger irrigation zone, and cotton; and (iii) improve access to basic
social services, notably health, rural water supply and sanitation.

  Supplemental Financing for Mali PRSC-II: The objective of this supplemental
financing is, together with the IMF and other development partner contributions, to help
the Government of Mali fill an unanticipated financing gap caused by the food crisis and
thus maintain the course of important socioeconomic policy reforms agreed under the
PRSC-I1 and GPRSP.

    1.   Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

      1.1.         Context at Appraisal

1. Mali is a vast semi-arid and landlocked country, of which about 60 percent is desert. In 2005, it
   had a population of about 13.5 million. Population density was low (10 persons per square kilometer)
   resulting in a high cost of transport and public service delivery. Mali's economic performance was
   highly vulnerable to climatic conditions and fluctuating terms of trade, with the exports concentrated
   in three primary sector products (gold, cotton and livestock products). The country's economy was
   dependent on ports and transport systems in neighboring countries. Mali had a weak administrative
   capability and its business environment had been affected by the protracted political crisis in
   neighboring Côte d'Ivoire. Mali's social indicators were among the lowest in the world. In 2006, the
   country ranked 175 out of 177 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index.

2. Despite numerous adverse external shocks, during 1994-2006, Mali was able to achieve a 5
   percent GDP growth rate on average per annum. This favorable performance was attributed to
   political and social stability since the transition to electoral democracy in 1992, effective
   implementation of financial stabilization and economic liberalization policies before and after the
   1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc,1 and a large influx of external assistance (about 15 percent of
   gross national income on average).

3. Four presidential elections took place peacefully, including the latest one in April 2007, one month
   after the Board approval of PRSC I. In that election, President Amadou Toumani Toure won a
   second and last five-year term. The political environment was competitive, with civil society holding
   an important place in the national dialogue. However, conditions remained unsettled in the Saharan
   part of the country due to perceptions of central government neglect, with sporadic periods of
   hostilities.

4. In past decades, Mali had made limited progress in poverty alleviation. According to
   government estimates, poverty declined from about 73 percent in 1989 to 68.3 percent in 2001 and to
   64.4 percent in 2006. While the incidence of poverty declined in urban areas, it remained virtually
   unchanged in rural areas, where about 70 percent of the population lived. Moreover, high population
   growth of about 3 percent per annum made it difficult to reduce poverty rapidly. Despite progress,
   public spending was not sufficiently pro-poor, particularly in post-basic education, health care and
   electricity and water services. Thus at the outset of PRSC I, Mali was unlikely to meet all the MDGs
   without more robust and shared growth in the medium term, coupled with better service delivery to
   the poor.

5. Following adverse shocks in 2004 due to drought and locust invasion, strong economic growth
   resumed in 2005 and 2006. Favorable rainfalls generated good cereal harvests, which in turn
   enabled inflation to fall from 6.4 percent in 2005 to 1.9 percent in 2006. In 2007 economic growth
   slowed down due to shortfalls in cotton and gold production. The current account balance improved
   in 2006, but this was not sustained in 2007. Fiscal performance was good in 2006, but deteriorated in
   2007 as revenues declined from 17.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2007. In
   both years the Government maintained a tight fiscal stance. Public debt sustainability was greatly
   strengthened through prudent fiscal policy and external debt reduction via the Highly Indebted and
   Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006.

  As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Mali shares a common Central Bank (BCEAO) and a common
currency (the CFA Franc) with seven other countries.

                                                              1
6. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of July 2003 for FY04-FY06 was designed to support
   implementation of Mali's first PRSP. The CAS focused on three key themes: (i) promoting growth
   by combining policy support through structural adjustment, and subsequently development policy
   operations, with an approach of increasing agricultural productivity and diversification through rural
   sector operations and non-rural growth driven by the private sector; (ii) developing human resources
   by working with donors to strengthen programmatic approaches in the health and education sectors;
   and (iii) improving public finance management and governance by focusing on public sector financial
   accountability mechanisms covering public expenditure, procurement, and financial management
   systems.

7. In November 2006, the Government approved an ambitious second generation PRSP, the
   Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework for 2007-11 (GPRSF), which has two main
   objectives: promotion of rapid growth (7 percent annual average) and strengthening public sector
   performance. The GPRSF acknowledged that the small reduction in poverty in previous years was
   due to poor control of population growth, insufficient economic growth (4.9 percent per annum
   versus a target of 6.7 percent), unequal distribution of growth benefits, and limited access to basic
   services. The GPRSF improved on its predecessor across several dimensions, including the emphasis
   on growth. A major weakness of the GPRSF, however, was the absence of a results framework.
   Also, the growth agenda was insufficiently detailed.

8. The CAS for FY08-FY11 was discussed by the Board in February 2008. The CAS stressed that
   higher economic growth combined with lower population growth was essential for achieving a more
   rapid decline in poverty. Higher economic growth required addressing key constraints, including an
   unfriendly business and investment climate, and weak capacity, which had their roots in suboptimal
   governance. The CAS was designed to assist the Government achieve the two key GPRSF objectives
   on growth and public sector management. Under the first objective, the focus was on linking Mali to
   the rest of the world, improving availability of factors of production and supporting an indigenous
   private sector. Under the second objective, the focus was on ensuring that public financial
   management would result in better service delivery by improving the links between sector strategies
   and the budget.

9. Several Bank-financed projects were under implementation in the sectors covered by the first
   PRSC series, including a Financial Sector Development project approved in 2000, a Transport
   Corridors Improvement project approved in 2004, a Growth Support project approved in 2005, an
   Agricultural Competitiveness and Diversification project approved in 2005, an Agricultural Services
   and Producer Organizations project and a Second Transport Sector project.

10. IMF support. In February 2007, the IMF completed its fifth review of the Poverty Reduction and
    Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved in June 2004. In October 2007, it completed its sixth
    and last review of the arrangement. In May 2008, the IMF approved a new US$45.7 million
    arrangement under the PRGF with front-loaded disbursement to address higher food and fuel prices.
    World Bank teams worked closely with their IMF counterparts throughout program design and
    implementation.

     1.2. Original Program Development Objectives

11. The objective of PRSC I, as stated in the Project Document (PD), was to support
    implementation of the GPRSF, through three components: (i) strengthen the macroeconomic and
    budget frameworks, particularly their links to the poverty reduction strategy, and strengthen public
    finance management, namely management, accountability and transparency of budget execution as
    well as procurement; (ii) support growth-enhancing measures in the financial sector, private sector,

                                                   2
    electricity, transport and transit facilitation, Office du Niger irrigation, and cotton sectors; and (iii)
    improve access to basic social services, notably health and social development, and rural water supply
    and sanitation. The objective of PRSC II was to continue IDA support to GOM to implement its 2nd
    PRSF, the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF), focusing on a set of policies
    and reforms intended to: (i) strengthen the macroeconomic and budget frameworks, particularly their
    links to the poverty reduction strategy, and strengthen public finance management, notably in the
    areas of procurement and in management, accountability and transparency of budget execution; (ii)
    support growth-enhancing measures in the financial sector, private sector, transport and transit
    facilitation, Office du Niger irrigation zone, and cotton; and (iii) improve access to basic social
    services, notably health, rural water supply and sanitation. In the aftermath of the 2008 food crisis, a
    supplemental financing for PRSC II was approved in December 2008 to help the Government of
    Mali, together with the IMF and other development partner contributions, to fill the unanticipated
    financing gap caused by the food price crisis and thus maintain the course of important
    socioeconomic policy reforms agreed under PRSC-II and GPRSP.

     1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators

12. Objectives were not revised.

     1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

Policy area I: Budget framework, poverty reduction strategy and Public finance management
(PFM)

13. Overall, the quality of public expenditure management in Mali was considered above average in sub-
    Saharan Africa. However, there were weaknesses in several areas, including in (i) the less than full
    alignment of the budget with the poverty reduction strategy; (ii) the monitoring of the four-phase
    expenditure execution process, due to weak and unreliable budget information; (iii) the consolidation
    of financial accounts, and (iv) budgetary controls and reporting.

14. In 2006, the Government adopted a medium-term action plan for 2006-08 to strengthen and
    modernize public financial management (PAGAM-GFP). The action plan was an essential
    element in the dialogue between the Government and its external partners and laid the groundwork
    for the shift from project-based aid toward increased use of harmonized donor support to the budget.
    A Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) was being
    prepared during the processing of PRSC I and II, with field work in November 2006 and a validation
    workshop in January 2007.

15. PRSC I and II focused on two areas in relation to public financial management: (i) reinforcing
    the links between the strategy and the budgets, while maintaining macroeconomic stability, through
    updating of the overall and sectoral Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) and increased
    appropriation of these instruments by concerned ministries; and (ii) improving the financial
    management system through establishing the institutional framework for monitoring implementation
    of the Public Financial Management (PFM) action plan (a Prior Action under PRSC I was related to
    this), and improving reporting on budget execution and building capacity in internal and external
    control agencies (with PRSC II supporting better interconnection of finance and budget departments
    as a Prior Action--see Table 1 below).

16. In the procurement area, the 1998 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was
    updated in 2005 and approved by the Government in 2007. It provided an action plan to address

                                                      3
    major shortcomings of the system, including: (i) adoption of a sound regulatory framework in line
    with WAEMU guidelines; (ii) creation of a control and a regulatory body; (iii) strengthening of the
    contracting authorities by giving them more responsibility in their procurement activities; (iv)
    development of a computerized system in the existing procurement body and in four line ministries
    with large procurement activities; and (v) development of the use of baseline indicators. PRSC I and
    II supported the adoption of the CPAR and key measures in the action plan--via a Decree on the
    Procurement Code--as Prior Actions (see Table 1).

Policy area 2: Support to growth

17. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) of August 2006 emphasized the need to reduce
    factor costs to enhance Mali's growth prospects, particularly in transport and utilities. The FY08
    CAS stressed that critical reforms, particularly in the cotton, electricity, transport and financial sectors
    had been difficult. Privatization agendas had been delayed, and progress had been slow. The
    suboptimal concession arrangements in the power and rail sectors, the slow pace of restructuring and
    reform in the cotton sector, shortcomings in the management and development of the Office du
    Niger's (ON) irrigation potential, the inadequate supply of electricity and weak financial position of
    the Malian electricity utility (EDM SA), and weaknesses in the banking sector, especially in two large
    public banks, posed major risks to Mali's macroeconomic stability and growth prospects. This policy
    area of the PRSCs covered key sectors for growth, as indicated below.

Financial sector

18. Under an ongoing technical assistance project approved in 2000, progress was made in
    improving the performance of the financial sector. The PRSC I and II reform agenda was
    designed to support this progress, including adopting a strategy to clean up non-performing loans in
    the banking system, reflected in a Prior Action under PRSC I, to which PRSC II also added a Prior
    Action to strengthen oversight of microfinance. The restructuring of two major state-owned banks
    (BIM, a commercial bank, and BHM, the housing bank), supported by the technical assistance
    project, was a critical element of the strategy to strengthen the financial sector. In addition, the PRSC
    series supported reforms designed to reduce the deficits in social security institutions.

Private sector development

19. In the 2007 Doing Business report, Mali was ranked 155 out of 175 countries. Close to 50
    percent of the economy remained in the informal sector, as a consequence of cumbersome procedures
    for business licensing and a 50 percent tax on formal enterprises gross profits. Areas needing urgent
    attention included streamlined licensing to start a business, improved corporate taxation and flexible
    labor market. PRSC I supported as a Prior Action the adoption of a law that established the priority of
    procedures attributing a single identification number over previous procedures, while a Prior Action
    under PRSC II focused on operationalizing the one-stop window, with a view to eliminating six
    procedures in business start up over the course of the PRSC series. In addition, PRSC II supported a
    Prior Action designed to reduce property registration fees (see Table 1). Other actions included
    measures to increase exports in both PRSCs, as well as studies on corporate taxation and labor market
    competitiveness under PRSC II.

Transportation and transit facilitation

20. The Trade Diagnostic Integration Study (2004) and the CEM (2006) identified severe
    constraints, making transport and transit far too expensive. Key challenges included the
    inadequate condition of transport infrastructure as a result of an inadequate balance between

                                                       4
    investment and maintenance, weak management of transport fleets, cumbersome regulations and
    irregular practices at road blocks along transport corridors. PRSC I and II supported actions to: (i)
    ensuring the regular funding of road maintenance, including Prior Actions under both PRSC I and II
    related to establishing and strengthening revenues from road user fees (see Table 1); (ii) strengthening
    the incentive framework for private sector transport operators and shippers; (iii) improving the
    customs administration and controls, and (iv) implementing the regional transit facilitation rules.

The energy sector

21. Privatization of the water and power utility (EDM) failed in the early 2000s, because of
    substantial differences in the interpretation of contractual clauses by the Government and the private
    operator. Due to lack of adjustment, electricity tariffs covered only 60 percent of the variable costs of
    generating thermal power, which contributed to a growing operating deficit. PRSC I supported the
    Government action plan for the restructuring of EDM, including technical studies on institutional
    arrangements, tariffs, least-cost investment plan, and audits. PRSC II dropped this area from the
    policy matrix in the interest of streamlining.

The agriculture sector

22. Cotton production expanded considerably following the devaluation of the CFAF in 1994,
    mostly through expansion of cultivated area. During the first half of the 2000s, however, cotton
    production stagnated, due to low productivity and an unduly low producers' share in the price of
    cotton. Farmer engagement in decisions on the sector was limited given their weak organization.
    CMDT, the state cotton company, incurred increased deficits because of poor management as well as
    a decline in world prices for cotton. In 2005 the Government requested Bank support to boost the
    reform process, with a view to restructuring the sector by 2008. A new price mechanism was set up
    to correct the bias against producers in 2005. In 2006, the Government adopted a privatization
    scheme and undertook a program to empower farmers' organizations. PRSC I and II focused on
    implementation of the producer price mechanism and preparation for the privatization of CMDT, with
    Prior Actions in both these areas under PRSC I (see Table 1).

23. Office du Niger (ON) was created in 1935 to develop irrigation along the Niger River. In 2006 it
    was in charge of managing about 82,000 ha of fully controlled irrigated areas out of a potential of at
    least 1 million ha. Yields of paddy increased from 2 t/ha in the early 1990s to 6 t/ha in 2004. In spite
    of this achievement, there was the need to improve ON management and empower farmers'
    organizations, accelerate the pace of irrigation development, design a vision and strategy for the ON
    zone, and move the focus from rice to higher value crops and commercial agriculture. The
    Government prepared a comprehensive development plan for the ON zone, including mechanisms for
    attracting private financing of irrigation schemes. PRSC I and II supported, as Prior Actions, the
    preparation and publication of a study to strengthen the financing aspects of the private irrigation
    mechanism, including draft text for the creation of a department to manage irrigation financing (see
    Table 1).

Policy area III: Access to basic social services

Health and social services

24. In the health sector, the Government adopted a ten-year strategy (PRODESS) for the period
    2001-2010. Progress was made in the supply of services and key indicators, including assisted
    deliveries and vaccination. Major issues in the sector were the low utilization rate of health services
    by the population, due to lack of drugs and poor quality of care in health centers, high population

                                                     5
    growth, with high total fertility rates and negative consequences on child and maternal mortality, and
    poor quality hospital care. The allocation of additional resources to the Ministries of Health and
    Social Development was a Prior Action supported by PRSC I. The adoption of a 2008 budget in line
    with the MTEFs of the two ministries, including a provisional health map, was a Prior Action
    supported by PRSC II. Other actions, for which indicators were proposed in the matrix of policy
    actions for the two PRSCs, included: (i) increasing the availability of family planning services; (ii)
    introducing standard performance contracts for hospitals; and (iii) promoting community health
    insurance (mutuelles).

Rural water supply and sanitation

25. In 2004, 36 percent of the rural population had access to potable water and 39 percent to
    improved sanitation. Meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the sector required a
    vast increase in institutional capacity and financial support, so as to ensure the construction of 1,250
    water points annually, compared to 450 in recent years. It would also require an efficient operation
    and maintenance system, including adequate cost recovery, to prevent new facilities to be in disrepair,
    as was the case for 30 percent of existing water systems. The traditional project approach with its
    unpredictable and irregular flows of funds would not meet the challenge. The PRSC series supported
    the shift to a sector-wide approach with actions under PRSC II focused on related reforms to define
    the National Water Directorate's mandate, and strengthen maintenance of water delivery systems.

     1.5. Revised Policy Areas

26. Policy areas were not revised, except that the energy sector was dropped in PRSC II, as noted above.

     1.6. Other significant changes

27. A Supplemental Financing for PRSC II of US$5m equivalent was approved to support the program in
    light of the food and fuel crisis of 2008. The series, which foresaw three operations, was interrupted
    after the second operation, and a new PRSC series was launched instead with PRSC III in May 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

     2.1. Program Performance

28. Both PRSC I and II were single-tranche operations, which disbursed on effectiveness. PRSC I
    was approved on March 6, 2007 and became effective on July 25, 2007. PRSC II was approved on
    February 5, 2008 and became effective on May 27, 2008. Two triggers for PRSCII were not achieved
    and were replaced, as indicated in the table below. Most Prior Actions were incremental steps
    towards reforms, reflecting government intentions to introduce bigger changes in future. Only a few
    of them consisted of larger reform measures actually completed by the Government.

29. Under PRSC I there were 13 indicators related to Prior Actions. These indicators are given
    particular weight in assessing the operation's performance; most of them have not been met. This is
    the case in particular for those related to the financial sector (although solid progress was generally
    made, excepting BHM, using tighter asset classification standards for non performing loans), the
    investment climate, and road maintenance, while the indicator for procurement was met with delay.
    The indicator for ON on the number of hectares developed with private funds was not met in 2007,
    and while it was met in 2008, it will not be met in 2009. The indicators related to Prior Actions that
    were broadly met, were (i) the zero budget transfer to CMDT for 2007, although the company
    incurred a large cash deficit, and (ii) budget allocations to the health and social development

                                                     6
    ministries. Finally, the indicator related to cotton producers' shares in the cotton companies is in
    progress, to the extent that is has been provided for in new legislation approved in 2008, but not yet
    effected as part of the privatization.

30. Under PRSC II, there were 9 indicators related to Prior Actions. The first one on the production
    of a budget execution report four weeks after the end of each month is considered partly met, to the
    extent that real time data are available for officials using the computerized system, but published only
    on a quarterly basis with an eight-week delay for broader audiences. The indicator for the
    procurement-related Prior Action was met, while the indicator for the investment-climate related Prior
    Action was not met. The indicator on taxes and fees other than registration tax was not met, despite
    substantial progress towards it. The indicator on the share of user fees in the budget of road
    maintenance was met, but only because regular budget allocations were sharply reduced. Information
    is lacking on the share of the road network which is maintained. No information was provided on
    most indicators related to the reduction in truck transit time. The indicator for the new microfinance-
    related Prior Action under PRSC II has no baseline or target against which to assess progress. The
    outcome for the ON-related Prior Action indicators is as for PRSC I above. The two indicators on
    budget allocations to the health and social development ministries were broadly met.

31. Annex 1 provides five tables: table 1 on key economic and financial indicators, table 2 on policy
    actions, table 3 on indicators, table 4 on prior actions-related indicators and table 5 on the matrix of
    policy actions. Details on sectors supported by the two PRSCs are also provided in Annex 1.

  The initial trigger required the adoption (by GOM) of the draft texts for the creation of the procurement regulatory department and department
to audit procurement transactions. These texts were adopted in 2009. The Prior Action that replaced the trigger is an adjusted version of an Other
Action for PRSC II identified in the PRSC I policy matrix, with approval by the Technical Committee rather than the Council of Ministers due to
the political transition.

  The initial trigger required the adoption of a strategy for each concerned bank to clean up the bad debts in their portfolios. The development of
this strategy took longer than anticipated.

   Component 3. Access to basic social services
   Health Sector: Adopt a budget for the 2008 program based on the METFs of the two ministries,
   including a provisional health map taking into account the private sector in the statistics of existing                   Met
   health centers.

2.2.       Major Factors Affecting Implementation

External factors

32. In 2007, the process of political transition, with presidential elections in April, legislative
    elections in July and the appointment of a new Cabinet in September, delayed program
    implementation. In these elections, President Touré won a second term and the coalition supporting
    him won a landslide victory, which helped strengthen government commitment to reform. During the
    transition process, however, public officials were more concerned with the political context than with
    program implementation.

33. In 2008, Mali suffered from fast rising food and fuel import prices. Like its neighbors, it
    experienced a significant price increase for grains, particularly rice and wheat, which are essential
    food items for the Malian population. Mali is a net importer of these two cereals. In response to the
    food crisis, the Government took a series of measures, which were not part of the PRSC II agenda, to
    boost production of rice and cushion prices increases on the demand side, including (i) providing
    financial support to rice production through fertilizer and machinery subsidies; (ii) releasing food
    from village food banks; (iii) removing import taxes on limited quantities of rice, milk powder, and
    cooking oil imports; and (iv) temporarily reducing taxation of petroleum products, particularly diesel.
    The cost of these measures was estimated at 1.8 percent of GDP.

Factors under Government control

34. In spite of extraordinary pressures on the budget due to the food crisis, the government
    maintained a tight fiscal discipline, which implied severe spending restrictions, including a 16
    percent reduction in ministries' budgets, with the exception of the social sector budgets, which were
    reduced by 11 percent. To help Mali weather the food crisis, the Bank extended a supplemental
    financing grant for an amount of US$5 million from the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund
    (FPCRTF) in December 2008. The closing date of PRSC II was extended from December 31, 2008
    to March 31, 2009, without any change to target dates. Inflation surged to an estimated 9 percent in
    2008, but by September it began to moderate. The increase in the price of rice had a positive impact
    on production. This, combined with favorable weather and strong prices for gold, contributed to
    economic growth close to an estimated 5 percent in 2008.

Adequacy of government's commitment

35. The Government was committed to the reform program, but was slow in making policy
    changes. This is mostly due to the need for reaching a consensus among all parties concerned before
    making any change. The process is time consuming, particularly when it involves trade unions,
    which have considerable clout in Mali. The advantage of the process is that once a decision is made,
    the risk of policy reversal is low. The delays in advancing the reforms in the productive sectors had

  The Prior Action was slightly reworded for clarity. The original wording was: Adopt (by the Ministers' Council) the draft texts for the creation
of the department charged with managing irrigation financing.

                                                                        9
    been noted in the Country Assistance Evaluation prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group
    (IEG) in 2007, covering the period FY95-FY05. The evaluation rated progress in the private sector
    area as moderately unsatisfactory. The GPRSF stressed the importance of private sector growth, but,
    as emphasized by the Joint Staff Assessment, did not specify the reforms required for achieving the
    growth agenda. Eventually, in June 2008, a round table focusing on the growth agenda generated a
    momentum for reforms and the pace of program implementation accelerated.

Soundness of background analysis

36. A number of studies were carried out in preparation for the new series of PRSCs. A key
    analytical work was the CEM completed in August 2006. Building on previous studies and analyses,
    it highlighted priority policy measures to sustain and accelerate Mali's economic growth and provided
    the underpinnings for the growth agenda. An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in FY05
    informed about the constraints to private sector development. The Trade Diagnostic Integration
    Study prepared in 2004 was most helpful for the design of the reform program in the transport and
    transit area. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) of reforms in the cotton sector was
    prepared in FY04. It was not sufficient, however, for overcoming the government's reluctance to
    implement reforms in this sector out of concern for the rural poor. The analysis showed that a
    reduction in producer prices would have a limited impact on cotton production, mostly because
    farmers have the certitude that they will get a monetary income at a predetermined moment. Issues in
    public financial management were adequately analyzed in a large number of reports, including a 2004
    CPAR and preliminary results for a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
    analysis. A study on the impact of an oil price increase was completed in FY06. It showed that the
    impact of rising fuel prices on inflation would be moderate. In the social sectors, a health sector
    study was prepared in FY04 and an education status report was completed in FY06. These studies
    were complemented by a poverty assessment in FY05 and a gender assessment in FY06. These
    studies, in addition to those done by others, provided the analytical background for the design of the
    reform program. Taken together, these studies provided a strong analytical background for the design
    of the program.

Assessment of the operation's design

37. The two PRSCs were complex. They involved a number of sectors and institutions. Mali's
    historically slow pace in advancing the overall reform agenda meant there were many important areas
    that needed to be addressed in order to boost growth and improve access of the poor to basic social
    services, although this increased the complexity of the operations. This was compounded by the need
    to reach a consensus among a large number of donors, who each had their own reform priorities. The
    first PRSC series would have gained from more selectivity, however, and a modest effort was made
    to streamline it by dropping the energy sector actions in PRSC II. The Borrower ICR also notes that
    the series could usefully have focused more on outcomes than on process steps, which account for the
    majority of the PRSC I and II Prior Actions, although it can be argued that the need to focus on
    process steps rather than reform outcomes reflects the pace at which the consensus-building reform
    process advances in Mali. A more important shortcoming is the fact that the linkages between the
    process actions foreseen in the policy matrices for PRSC I and II and the indicators used to measure
    their success were not always spelled out clearly. For example, moving from undertaking and
    publishing a study on irrigation financing mechanisms to achieving substantially larger numbers of
    professional cultivators and hectares developed with private funds requires significant intermediate
    work that is not elucidated--this point holds a fortiori for several of the Other Actions under the two
    PRSCs. Taking into account weak capacity, the triggers for PRSC II were not too demanding, but
    adjustments had to be made because of delays due to the electoral process and political transition.
    The assessment of the macroeconomic policy framework was adequate under both operations.

                                                    10
38. During post Board implementation of PRSC I it became clear that only limited progress would
    be achieved in the growth agenda. The decision was made to discontinue the first PRSC series after
    PRSC II and to focus the new series on public finance management, governance and the delivery of
    basic services to the population. To facilitate the change, the Bank leadership for PRSC II was
    transferred from the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Unit to the Human
    Development (HD) Unit. The meeting of the Regional Operations Committee (ROC) on December 5,
    2007, concluded that the team was walking on a tight rope, doing all it could to ensure that what had
    been promised by PRSC I would be delivered, while striving to have a fresh start in line with the new
    CAS. The meeting recommended increased selectivity in the policy matrix. It acknowledged,
    however, that little could be done by the new team at that stage. The energy sector was dropped, as
    were targets for 2009 (in light of the discontinuation of the series after PRSC II), but the new matrix
    otherwise looked very much like a copy of the previous one.

39. The social, environmental, and fiduciary aspects of PRSC were generally adequately analyzed.
    Both operations were expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction, through improved
    conditions for the provision of public services, reduction in transport cost, and promotion of pro-poor
    growth. Detailed analysis was conducted for potential social impacts of the cotton area reforms,
    although PRSC I did not discuss the consequences of larger numbers of commercial cultivators in the
    ON area, nor of tariff reforms in the energy sector, which were still at the study stage and expected to
    be advanced later under PRSC III. Implementation of the reforms supported by PRSC I and II could
    have a limited impact on the environment due to increased irrigation, higher cotton production or
    improved road maintenance. Environmental guidelines were in place, however, and they were
    reported to be adequately implemented by the relevant agencies in these areas. In the views of the
    Bank team, Mali's fiduciary framework was adequate for ensuring that budget support would be used
    for the intended purposes. Weaknesses in public financial management, including budget information
    and reporting, internal and external controls, and procurement were to be addressed through the
    reform program supported by PRSC I and II.

Relevance of risk analysis

40. Three risks were identified, deriving from to external, political and budget factors. Mali is
    highly vulnerable to climatic shocks, exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations and regional
    developments (persistent crisis in Côte d'Ivoire, for instance). PRSC I and II were designed to
    increase the capacity of the Government to manage the impact of these shocks through reforms
    intended to diversify growth and strengthen public financial management. Increased predictability of
    budget support and willingness of external donors to provide additional assistance in the case of an
    external crisis would further mitigate these risks. The risk that the pace of reform would slow due to
    the electoral process in 2007 was acknowledged. Continued dialogue was expected to mitigate this
    risk, but this could not have made much of a difference. The financial crisis in two key parastatals,
    EDM and CMDT, would potentially require large budget transfers. The reform process would
    mitigate this risk, but it was delayed. Additionally, a financial evaluation of CDMT was planned for
    2007 to better understand the nature of the losses and design corrective measures.

41. The three risks were considered as moderate, but all three occurred and had a significant
    impact on program implementation. Overall, the Government's management of the food and fuel
    crisis was adequate. Contrary to the situation in other African countries, there were no widespread
    riots in Mali, thanks in part to measures taken by the Government, but the cost of these measures was
    high and had to be compensated through severe reductions in the budgets of all ministries (although
    there was greater protection for health and education), to some extent defeating efforts made at
    increasing allocations to priority sectors--even though the cuts were partially reversed during 2008.

                                                    11
    Financial losses in EDM and CMDT accumulated because of higher fuel prices and a fast declining
    cotton production. Both companies required additional subsidies. Tariff adjustment for EDM was
    postponed to 2009. The financial evaluation of CMDT was not carried out. The electoral process in
    2007 delayed significantly the implementation of the reform program. Despite major changes in
    2007, the risk section in PRSC II was not adjusted.

     2.3.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring design

42. The program document for PRSC I indicated expected results of the program in the matrix of
    policy actions. One outcome indicator (number of MTEFs available) and three intermediate outcome
    indicators (number of weeks after the end of each month taken to produce the budget execution
    report, gross share of non-performing loans in the banking sector and share of customs declarations
    cleared in the red risk category) were selected in the Implementation Status Reports (ISR). These
    indicators are output or process indicators, not outcome indicators, however. Out of these four
    indicators selected, only one was related to a Prior Action. In the ISR for PRSC II, three outcome
    indicators were selected (the number of MTEFs available, the share of rural population with access to
    a potable water point and the rate of assisted childbirths). There was no link between PRSC II actions
    and the latter two indicators. The three intermediate outcome indicators were the same as for PRSC I.
    Thus both operations' ISRs were highly selective on the indicators they reported on, but they should
    not have made the distinction between outcome and intermediate outcome indicators (since DPOs do
    not have intermediate indicators) and should have been designed to report at least on all Prior
    Actions-related indicators.

43. A long list of indicators was part of the matrix of policy actions for the two PRSCs (55 and 54
    respectively). Several indicators were poorly defined, as for instance the number of jobs in the formal
    sector. In any event, improvement was expected for that indicator as a result of the conducting of a
    study on labor market competitiveness, which was far-fetched. The need to ensure consistently
    strong and clear linkages between the policy actions and the outcome indicators throughout the matrix
    was not met. The baseline for two indicators (monthly report on budget execution or exports other
    than cotton and gold) was simply wrong. Mali did not produce monthly reports on budget execution
    and the value of exports other than cotton and gold was CFAF 81 billion, not CFAF 431 billion.
    There again, the signature of a decree distinguishing artisan products from antiquities and conducting
    an awareness campaign would not per se result in a 12 percent increase in exports in 2007 and 13
    percent in 2008. Improvements to a number of indicators was expected, but could not be attributed to
    the PRSCs. This is the case for instance for the rate of assisted childbirths, including by trained
    traditional midwives, or the share of the population covered by community health insurance
    programs. PRSC II introduced an indicator for a Prior Action on microfinance that had no baseline
    and no target. The Government's ability to gather the requisite baseline and actual data for the large
    number of indicators on a regular basis should have been confirmed as part of the monitoring design.

Monitoring implementation

44. The Secretary General in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) was responsible for
    monitoring the policy matrix in relation with line ministries for PRSC I. During preparation of
    PRSC II, the Government was reshuffled and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade became
    the main interlocutor of the Bank for the reform program. It was responsible for overall coordination
    of supervision and monitoring of program implementation. For both operations, the focus was on
    monitoring policy actions. The matrix of policy actions indicated the agencies responsible for
    collecting data for indicator monitoring, but little was done in that area. The matrix of policy actions

                                                    12
        was not systematically updated during program implementation. In June 2009, the Government
        issued a progress report on GPRSF with a large number of data, but not for most of the indicators set
        forth in the matrix of policy actions. Clearly, there appears to have been little ownership for
        monitoring the results framework by the Government.

 Monitoring utilization

45.      The focus of the Bank and Government teams was on the progress of the policy actions,
        notably the Prior Actions and triggers, rather than on assessing their impact on broader sector
        performance or even on the full range of indicators identified in the policy matrix. During the
        preparation of this ICR, the country team had enormous difficulties in providing the data required to
        fill out the indicators table. Similarly, government staff responsible for sector monitoring were not
        always able to provide the information required for filling out the indicator table in their sectors
        during the ICR mission (see Annex 1). The monitoring system was clearly inadequate and not used
        for policy adjustments or for tracking progress, except to the extent that selected indicators were
        directly relevant to task teams' investment projects.

         2.4.    Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

46.      A second PRSC series was initiated with the approval of PRSC III in May 2009. The new
        operation focuses on the same policy areas, but with a slightly changed emphasis, as follows: (i)
        enhancing the regulatory and institutional framework for infrastructure and private investment; (ii)
        strengthening public financial management; and (iii) improving basic social service delivery. PRSC
        III is aligned with the FY08 CAS. To address the unfinished agenda in the energy sector, an
        investment project for improving access and efficiency of electricity services in Bamako and other
        targeted areas in the country was approved in June 2009.

 3.         Assessment of Outcomes

 3.1.       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47. The objectives of the first PRSC series are as relevant today, as they were when PRSC I and II
    were appraised. Despite progress under previous budget support operations, public financial
    management needed further attention, the framework for private sector development was far from
    satisfactory and much remained to be done to improve the effective delivery of basic services to the
    population, including its poorest segments. This is still the case today. The objectives of the PRSCs
    were couched in general terms in the description of each of the three components in the two Program
    Documents (PDs). The two operations were complex and the focus on a large number of actions with
    a limited impact and process indicators distracted from the attention required for achieving the
    expected outcomes.

48. Relevance for both operations is rated substantial, based on high relevance of objectives but
    modest relevance of design.

 3.2.       Achievement of Program Development Objectives

 49. Despite severe shocks due to the food and fuel crisis in 2008, the Government maintained
     macroeconomic stability and stayed the course of reforms, albeit at a slow pace. Real GDP
     growth was estimated at 5 percent in 2008, in spite of a sharp drop in cotton production by 22 percent.
     High farm-gate prices for other crops stimulated agricultural production. Good performance in

                                                       13
    service sectors contributed to growth. Because of the 2008 shocks, however, Mali, which met 6 out
    of 10 WAEMU convergence criteria in 2006, was able to meet only 3 of them in 2008. A Poverty
    Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement was approved by the IMF in May 2008. The first
    review of the arrangement was completed in December 2008. Table 1 in Annex 1 provides key
    economic and financial indicators.

Objective 1: Strengthening the links between the GPRSF and the macroeconomic and budget
framework

50. In the area of public finance management, PRSC I supported the implementation of the 2006
    measures of the government action plan (PAGAM/GFP) and making operational the CARFIP
    (the public finance reform support unit to replace another unit, which was not effective). This Prior
    Action was met, although the policy matrix did not specify directly related key performance
    indicators. The PAGAM/GFP, with its annual programs, was expected to be completed at end 2008.
    In October 2008, the Minister of Finance decided to extend its implementation period to end-2009,
    because a number of actions had been delayed. The progress report for the first semester of 2009
    indicated that out of 167 planned activities, 120 had been initiated and 71 completed. Other Actions
    envisaged under PRSC I and II contributed to expanding the MTEF process, while a Trigger/Prior
    Action for PRSC II supported the operationalization and interconnection of finance departments of
    four ministries and four regional budget departments with a view to reducing delays in the generation
    of budget execution reports.

51. The reforms resulted in closer links between the poverty reduction strategy and sectoral
    strategies through completion of MTEFs for 11 ministries or agencies in 2007 and 15 in 2008,
    more than were targeted (see Annex 1). While Mali has made progress in defining broad strategic
    lines for public investment, notably the PRSP and MTEFs, the screening and prioritizing projects
    remains weak. The process of preparing and updating MTEFs has been most helpful in fostering a
    dialogue between sector planners and Ministry of Finance's officials, particularly in the health, social
    development and rural water and sanitation sectors. Efforts are still needed, however, to better align
    the budget with the MTEFs and reduce delays in budget implementation. At end-2008, the execution
    rate of the 2008 budget was close to 80 percent. Reporting on budget execution could also be
    improved. While officials using the interconnected system have access to information on budget
    execution in real time, other interested parties have to rely on quarterly tables published in an
    aggregated format about 8 weeks after the end of the quarter. The Budget Directorate is preparing the
    format for a short monthly report, which would be made available to all ministries and external
    partners.

52. The outcome in the area of public finance management is moderately satisfactory overall for both
    PRSC I and PRSC II.

53. Procurement reform was delayed. The adoption of the revised CPAR (a PRSC I Prior Action)
    entailed government agreement to implement a 2006-08 action plan that was intended to lead to the
    establishment of a regulatory framework, the strengthening of contracting authorities and the
    development of a computerized system. In addition to a Prior Action focused on working towards
    creating procurement regulatory and audit departments, PRSC II included a broader range of Other
    Actions on procurement than PRSC I (see Annex 1). The procurement decree was issued in August
    2008. Regional procurement directors were appointed in February 2009. A Law enacted in 2009
    established the regulatory and control agencies. In 2007 the General Directorate of Public
    Procurement reviewed 1753 contracts, of which 74 percent under open competitive bidding. The
    threshold of periodic review of contracting authorities has been raised from CFAF 10 million in 2006
    to CFAF 20 million in 2008, (equal to the target for 2009 under the program), and CFAF 25 million

                                                    14
    in 2009. However, with regard to policy matrix indicators, the database installed in 2006 could not be
    used and is being replaced by a simpler one. A large number of training sessions was organized, but
    they did not focus on the new code and standard bidding documents, and were generally attended by
    junior staff.

54. The outcome in the procurement area is moderately satisfactory for both operations.

Objective 2: Strengthening contribution to growth of key sectors

55. In the support to growth component, PRSC I supported seven Prior Actions, whereas PRSC II
    supported six Prior Actions. The reform areas comprised the financial sector; private sector (export
    promotion and investment climate enhancement); transport and transit facilitation; electricity and
    urban water supply (in PRSC I); cotton sector reform; and support for reforms of the Office du Niger.

56. Reforms in the financial sector are advancing, but challenges remain. PRSC I and II reinforced
    the support provided by the technical assistance project, which was supervised in Bamako by a Lead
    Financial Sector Specialist, ensuring close attention to this difficult component. A large public bank
    (BIM) was successfully privatized, which was a significant success as it had previously been
    insolvent but was turned around and a majority stake was sold for 60 million. This success should
    also help lessen resistance to privatization in public opinion. Progress was made in reducing the ratio
    of non-performing loans of banks, which is in line with the regional average of 18.5 percent, if BHM
    is excluded, but higher than target is BHM is included. BHM was recapitalized twice by the
    Government. It has taken steps to improve its portfolio, but its non performing loans remain
    substantially higher than those for the rest of the banking system and BHM has a large operating loss.
    The Government continues to work towards its privatization, which is expected to be launched in
    2011. With support from the technical assistance project, progress was made in strengthening the
    insurance sector, in particular through a better enforcement of obligatory auto insurance and the
    restructuring of two companies, and enhancing access to capital markets. A new law was adopted in
    April 2008 to increase beneficiary contributions, so as to reduce the deficits of social security
    institutions. CRM's deficit was larger than targeted, however. Overall, progress was as expected,
    with an important success in the case of BIM, good progress in the general banking system and
    insurance sector, and shortcomings in the case of pension deficits and BHM.

57. The outcome in the financial sector area is moderately satisfactory for both operations.

58. Limited progress was made in improving the investment climate. The number of procedures to
    create an enterprise (an area supported by Prior Actions under both PRSC I and II) decreased from 13
    in 2006 to 10 in 2007 and 2008; and the time taken to open an enterprise also decreased significantly,
    from 42 days in the baseline to 25 in 2007 and 2008; however these advances fell short of PRSC
    targets, and indeed Mali was not able to improve its ratings in the 2009 Doing Business report. None
    of the performance indicators was met in 2008, except for the cost of creating an enterprise as a
    percentage of GDP per capita. Substantial progress was, however, made towards reducing taxes and
    fees other than registration taxes (which was a result supported by a Prior Action under PRSC II),
    although the final result fell slightly short of the target. Following completion of the first PRSC
    series, the Government took decisive action in several areas, including the long-delayed effective
    initiation of operations by the one-stop shop for private investors in May 2009. This was noted in the
    2010 Doing Business Report. In the areas of strengthening exports other than cotton and gold, and
    creation of jobs in the formal sector, the baseline data reported in the PRSC policy matrix were
    wrong, making it hard to assess achievement of results, although the increases foreseen in the policy
    matrix for these indicators were exceeded in both cases. It is nonetheless not clear how a labor

                                                    15
    market study (an Other Action under PRSC II) was expected per se to contribute to an increase in
    formal sector jobs.

59. For both PRSC I and II, the outcome in the investment climate area is rated moderately
    unsatisfactory.

60. Little progress has been made in transportation and transit. The share of users' fees in the
    budget of the Road Authority (associated with a Prior Action for both PRSC I and II) has increased
    from 26 percent in 2007 to 47 percent in 2008, but this was the result of a sharp reduction of regular
    budget allocations to the sector. The length of road maintained has marginally increased in 2007 and
    2008. The share of road user fees in the road maintenance budget increased substantially in 2009 as a
    result of the change in fuel taxation. According to data provided by the Roads Directorate, only about
    60 percent of the road network maintained is in good condition, which raises serious questions as to
    the effectiveness of road maintenance. No solid data is available to assess whether custom clearance
    and transit time has improved, or whether the tax burden on transit operators has declined as targeted.
    No contracts were established through the freight exchange, which was to emerge as a result of a
    study supported as an Other Action in PRSC II. The number of road barriers has not declined and
    irregular practices remain a problem at these barriers. Mali is still the country with the highest
    transportation cost in the sub-region.

61. The outcome in the transport and transit facilitation area is unsatisfactory for both PRSC I and II.

62. The financial situation of EDM, the power and water utility, has worsened because of lack of
    tariff adjustment, while fuel prices increased steadily in 2007 and 2008. On the other hand, EDM
    has made progress reducing electricity distribution losses. The PRSC series supported actions
    centered on accelerating technical studies on institutional arrangements, tariff policy, least-cost
    investment plan, and audits of EDM. In March 2009, the Government adopted a restructuring plan,
    which is to be implemented with the support of the Bank's Energy Support Project approved in June
    2009. In May 2009, the Water and Electricity Regulatory Agency approved a 4 percent increase in
    electricity tariffs. In September 2009, the Government decided to separate water and electricity
    operations. Signature of a contract with a new operator for water is expected in 2010 and for
    electricity in 2011.

63. The outcome in the electricity sector is moderately unsatisfactory for PRSC I. It is not rated for
    PRSC II as the component was dropped from the policy matrix

64. Production in the cotton sector has been cut from about 410.000 tons in 2006-07 to 201,000 tons
    in 2008-09. This was mostly due to declining international prices, inadequate incentives for
    producers and low cotton yields. The same factors applied in other West African countries, but their
    impact has been much stronger in Mali. In the WAEMU area, other countries (Benin, Cote d'Ivoire
    and Senegal) broadly maintained their cotton production in the past two crop seasons. In neighboring
    Burkina Faso production declined by about 40 percent. In Mali, poor management of CMDT was an
    additional factor. Because of large losses, CMDT was unable to make payments to farmers for their
    crop from the prior season. To continue operating it received a CFAF 8.8 billion subsidy from
    Government in 2008. The subsidy, which broke with the zero target set in the policy matrix, proved
    essential to enable CMDT to pay its arrears to cotton producers in December 2008. In the second
    review of the PRGF in August 2009, the IMF noted that CMDT financing requirements for the 2008-
    09 and 2009-10 cotton campaigns, and for the restructuring and arrears clearance, amounted to the
    equivalent of about 1.75 of GDP (about CFAF 68 billion). A Law authorizing the privatization of
    CMDT was approved by Parliament in August 2008. This law also provided for a 20 percent stake
    for cotton producers in the cotton companies (an outcome that is associated with two Prior Actions

                                                    16
        under PRSC I). There appears to be a consensus now on the need to privatize CMDT, which is in
        part the result of the easing of tensions in the cotton policy dialogue. The prospects for attracting
        serious investors have improved recently, as cotton price has increased by 68 percent since March
        2009. This area continues to be supported under the new PRSC series.

65. The outcome in the cotton sector area is moderately unsatisfactory for both PRSC I and II.

66. A master plan for the development of Office du Niger (ON) was adopted in December 2008. It
    provides clear strategic directions for the development of the irrigated perimeters. Going forward,
    clarification is needed regarding ON's role and responsibilities with respect to water management and
    land tenure, taking into account the decentralization process and increased implication of local
    governments. In addition, a clear mapping of planned land use is needed to attract large commercial
    farmers and agro-industries while safeguarding the interest of smallholders. Maintenance of
    irrigation infrastructure remains a serious challenge, however, because of inadequate government
    funding. An action plan was prepared in 2007 on the basis of an organizational and financial audit of
    ON. The plan has estimated that ON's requirements for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the
    irrigation network amounted to CFAF 73 billion. Two schemes associating small farmers and private
    investors to the development of irrigation have been initiated. Subsidization by ON was required for
    both these schemes. In the first one, ODN built the secondary canals and leveled the land; in the
    second it provided the land for free. The financing aspects developed under a study, which was a
    Prior Action for PRSC I, need some revision. PRSC II supported progress towards ensuring
    institutional oversight of irrigation financing. Performance indicators fell short of targets. Although
    good progress was made towards them in 2008, following a slow start in 2007, it is clear that the
    target set for 2009 (3000 ha for smallholders and 60 ha for private investors) will not be met. Targets
    related to Other Actions under PRSC I and II in this area were met, with the cultivation intensity ratio
    reaching 1.5 in 2008 versus a target of 1.35, and irrigation maintenance rising to 75 percent in 2008,
    relative to a target of 70 percent.

67. The outcomes for PRSC I and II in the irrigation area are rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Objective 3: Improving access to basic social services, notably health and rural water and
sanitation

68. In the access to basic services component, the Prior Action in PRSC I aimed at ensuring that
    the 2007 budget of Ministries of Health and Social Development would benefit from additional
    resources, so as to accompany the shift from a project approach towards a sector-wide approach in
    the health and water and sanitation sectors, which was important for ensuring that external resources
    would be used more efficiently for achieving sector objectives.6 The Prior Action for PRSC II
    ensured that the 2008 budget for these two ministries would be aligned with their MTEFs.

69. The two PRSCs contributed to reforms in health and social development which have produced
    positive results, although access by the poor remains inadequate. Financing for the health and
    social development ministries was increased broadly in line with targets by 2008--this was supported
    by Prior Actions for both PRSC I and II. Performance-based contracts were signed with 12 hospitals
    and the rate of assisted childbirths was better than expected at 61 percent, against a target of 57
    percent for 2008. This increase cannot be attributed solely to actions supported by the two PRSCs,
    however. The Government has defined a plan to strengthen family planning services in health
    centers. The jump in couple-years of contraceptive protection reported by the Government for 2008
    is not plausible. The coverage of community-based health insurance did not expand notably, because
6
    Indeed, consistent with this approach, the Bank had folded a proposed health project into PRSC I.

                                                                         17
       many households lack the resources needed to join a mutuelle. Moreover, access of basic social
       services by the poor continues to be limited and of low quality, raising the need to enhance the
       targeting of public efforts. There has not been much progress in addressing the major issue of
       assigning qualified staff to rural areas.

70. The outcome in the program for health and social development is rated moderately satisfactory for
    PRSC I and II.

71. The potable water program outside the EDM area achieved mixed results. In the rural water and
    sanitation sector, Other Actions were supported under PRSC II, notably to strengthen sectoral
    planning and potable water delivery systems maintenance (this area was not addressed in PRSC I).
    The preparation and updating of the MTEF has improved budget allocations to the sector, and the
    share of the rural population with access to a potable water point rose from 64 to 70 percent between
    2005 and 2008, exceeding the target of 69 percent, while the number of piped water systems managed
    under PPP also exceeded the target. However, the share of potable delivery systems which are
    functional has not improved as expected in 2007 and data could not be obtained to confirm the status
    in 2008.

72. The outcome in the potable water program (outside the EDM zone) is rated moderately satisfactory
    for PRSC II. It was not addressed by policy actions under PRSC I and is therefore not rated for
    PRSC I.

3.3.      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

       PRSC I: Moderately Unsatisfactory
       PRSC II: Moderately Unsatisfactory

73. Post Board, PRSC I implementation was delayed because of a long political transition process.
    Key actions were not implemented on time, including adoption by the Government of the draft decree
    on the procurement code and on establishing the procurement regulatory agency, adoption of a
    strategy for each concerned bank to clean-up the bad debts in bank portfolios, the establishment of the
    one-stop window for private investors and preservation of EDM's financial viability.

74. Out of the ten Prior Actions, two had no related indicators (PAGAM action plan in public finance
    management and improvement of loan procedures in the banking sector). Out of the three Prior
    Actions in the cotton sector only one had a related indicator which was met in 2007, but not in 2008
    (absence of subsidy to CMDT). The indicators related to the five other Prior Actions were not met in
    2007, except for the confirmation that additional resources had been allocated to the health and social
    development ministries. The PRSC has supported the Government in maintaining a relatively strong
    macroeconomic framework, as well as to take steps to advance on a range of complex but important
    and highly relevant areas of reforms, with a significant success in the privatization of BIM. On the
    other hand, the efficacy of the Prior and Other Actions in achieving the targeted indicators was low in
    general, and the linkage between some policy actions and the expected outcomes was not very clear,
    so that indicators were not achieved even though Prior Actions were implemented, while in other
    cases data could not be obtained to confirm progress against the PRSC indicators (see Table 1 and
    Annex 1 Table 4).

75. The overall outcome rating for PRSC-I is moderately unsatisfactory based on the combined
    assessment of relevance and efficacy.



                                                    18
76. In spite of severe external shocks in 2008, with the fuel and food crisis, Mali was able to
    maintain macroeconomic stability. Good progress was made in setting sector priorities in the
    MTEFs for health, social development and rural water and sanitation, including more focused
    attention to providing adequate allocations to decentralized entities. On the other hand, in all program
    areas, the pace of reform has been slower than anticipated and indicators are lower than targets.

77. Out of the nine Prior Actions for PRSC II, one did not have a related indicator (microfinance
    supervision unit). Out of the eight remaining Prior Actions, the indicators related to 4 of them were
    met. Progress related to Other Actions in the policy matrix was similarly mixed. Just as for PRSC I,
    the reform areas were highly relevant, and the reform agenda has continued to advance in a complex
    set of reform areas, however efficacy was generally low in terms of generating the targeted results on
    the indicators with the Prior and Other Actions. Moreover, just as for PRSC I, the first policy area on
    strengthening public financial management systems (with its two sub-components for public financial
    management and procurement) is rated moderately satisfactory; the second policy area, with its five
    policy areas of support to growth, (six for PRSC I) is rated moderately unsatisfactory, and the third
    policy area on access to basic social services (with its two sub-components for health and social
    development and for potable water) is rated moderately satisfactory.

78. The overall outcome rating for PRSC II (including its Supplemental Financing) is moderately
    unsatisfactory based on the combined assessment of relevance and efficacy.

3.4.    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty impacts, gender aspects and social development

79. The first PRSC series had little impact as yet on poverty alleviation. Recent improvement in
    budget allocations to the health and rural water and sanitation sectors will take time before translating
    fully into better living conditions for the poor, although access to potable water points has improved.
    In the area of cotton, the privatization process, which will strengthen farmer engagement including
    through a 20 percent share in the cotton companies is still under way. With support from donors,
    including supplemental financing from the Bank, Mali designed and implemented a series of
    measures to protect the population from the impact of the food and fuel crisis in 2008. These
    measures helped Mali weather the crisis better than some of its neighbors, although the poorest
    segments of the population were not adequately targeted. More broadly, despite reforms in the social
    sectors, access by the poor to social services remains inadequate. Some progress was made in
    increasing the rate of assisted births by trained personnel and the number of family planning
    consultations, but overall, the first series put little emphasis on gender issues. In any event, the extent
    to which progress in social outcomes can be attributed solely to the first PRSC series is hard to assess,
    as a number of activities supported by the Bank and other donors contributed to the outcomes, and the
    assessment in terms of the poverty impact is affected by the same concern indicated above related to
    the generally low efficacy of the policy actions in yielding the targeted results.

Institutional change/strengthening

80. The capacity to align budget allocations to strategic objectives is slowly improving through the
    process of preparing and updating MTEFs. This is especially the case in the health and rural water
    and sanitation sectors. Capacity in monitoring budget execution is improving through the
    development of the interconnection between departments in the Ministry of Finances (at the national
    level and in the regions) and in line ministries. Procurement capacity in line ministries and regions is
    still extremely limited. The capacity of Office du Niger has been strengthened through the
    involvement of its staff in the preparation of the master plan. In other sectors supported by the PRSC

                                                      19
       series, institution building has been extremely modest, with the exception of BIM (which was
       successfully privatized), although progress continues to be made in strengthening BHM and in
       advancing on the privatization agenda for CMDT under the new PRSC series.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

81.       There were no unintended consequences.

3.5.      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

82.       There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

       PRSC I: Moderate
       PRSC II: Moderate

83. The risk of policy reversals in the areas supported by PRSC I and II is moderate. The risk of
    reversal in the first policy area is small. Less progress was made towards results in the second policy
    area, nonetheless the risk of reversal is also small for those results. Finally, in the third area,
    improving access to health and rural water and sanitation services, the risk is moderate, as it is likely
    that a number of donors will continue to provide support in these sectors, and the process of resource
    allocation to these sectors has been substantially strengthened under PRSC II. This assessment of a
    low risk of policy reversal, which reflects in part the consensus-building approach to advancing
    reforms in Mali, is also supported in the Borrower's ICR, as well as in the continuity of the reforms in
    various areas of the first PRSC series under the new, more streamlined PRSC series and in new
    investment lending (e.g. in the energy sector).

84. For the first PRSC series, the risk to development outcome is moderate to significant,
    depending on the duration of the ongoing global economic slowdown and Mali's economic
    policies. The global economic slowdown could have negative consequences for Mali. The prices for
    cotton and gold could fall after their recent increases. The appreciation of the CFA franc vis-à-vis the
    US$ could continue. Remittances from the 4 million Malians living abroad could decline, with a
    negative impact on the livelihood of a majority of households in Mali. External assistance could
    drop. Direct private investment could dry up, making privatization efforts more difficult. Because of
    delays in privatization of key public enterprises, the budgetary exposure to their combined deficits has
    become a serious threat to fiscal stability.

85. In 2008, however, Mali demonstrated its capacity to maintain a stable macroeconomic
    environment despite severe external shocks. Economic growth was strong in 2008. The donor
    community has been highly supportive of Mali's efforts to contain the negative impact of the food
    and fuel crisis on the population. According to the IMF's estimates, external assistance was expected
    to reach 6.9 percent of GDP in 2008. Actually it was much higher at 10.3 percent of GDP. Assuming
    that Mali maintains a strong macroeconomic record, the likelihood of continued donor assistance is
    relatively high. Accordingly, the risk is moderate.

86. The political risk is low. It is mitigated by Mali's well established tradition of political stability,
    dialogue and social harmony. Numerous teachers' strikes have disrupted the school year in 2008. In
    December 2008, the Government held a forum on education with representatives of all stakeholders
    to define a course of action in the sector. This forum has contributed to reducing tensions in the

                                                     20
    sector. The peace process with Tuareg groups in the North of the country has been re-energized in
    early 2009 to address sporadic hostilities in the area.

    5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

    5.1. Bank Performance

Quality at entry

     PRSC I: Moderately unsatisfactory
     PRSC II: Moderately unsatisfactory

87. The decision to move from structural adjustment lending to a PRSC approach was sound. The
    decision to fold the proposed health project into the program was fully consistent with the 2005 Paris
    Declaration and strongly supported by an active donor community. PRSC I and II were aligned with
    the GPRSF, approved by the Government in November 2006, although they did not focus sufficiently
    on improving the quality and efficiency of public expenditure in line with GPRSF's priorities. The
    Bank team worked closely with the donor community on the policy agenda. The lessons from
    experience were taken into account, and the series was grounded on a rich set of economic and sector
    work. The risk analysis was adequate, though some updating for PRSC II would have been useful.
    The participation of the PRSC-II preparation team in the budget discussions held in June 2007
    between the line ministries and the Budget Directorate on the basis of the MTEFs was most helpful.

88. On the other hand, the two operations in the first PRSC series were complex, as was the growth
    and poverty reduction agenda. Both of them would have gained from more selectivity. Policy
    actions were designed for a slow moving reformer, particularly in the support to growth area. Most of
    them did not require significant reforms, emphasizing instead a series of incremental process steps.
    PRSC I was prepared without the benefit of a GPRSF or CAS results framework. The Bank team had
    to develop a framework from scratch. The number of indicators was overwhelming, even though two
    key Prior Actions had no corresponding indicators, some indicators had incorrect baselines, many of
    them were of little relevance, and most of them were not closely monitored. There again, selectivity
    would have been welcome. Not enough attention was paid to establishing adequate monitoring
    systems at the time of PRSC I preparation. More importantly, the linkages between the policy actions
    and the expected results in the indicators were not consistently spelled out, and in some cases were
    rather weak.

89. In June 2007, the preparation team for PRSC II helped the Government improve the alignment
    of the 2008 budget with GPRSF priorities. It participated in the discussions between line ministries
    and the Budget Directorate to ensure that budget allocations would better reflect sectoral MTEFs.
    This time consuming exercise was highly appreciated by the staff of line ministries and contributed to
    improve the credibility of the MTEF process.

Quality of Bank supervision (including M&E arrangements):

     PRSC I: Moderately unsatisfactory
     PRSC II: Moderately unsatisfactory

90. Supervision was focused more on policy actions, especially triggers, than on outcomes. During
    implementation of the two operations, the Bank prepared two Implementation Status Reports (ISRs).
    These reports were not sufficiently informative and were somewhat optimistic in their ratings. They
    focused on policy actions, particularly the triggers for the subsequent operation, but not sufficiently

                                                    21
    on monitoring the quality of steps taken and evaluation of progress on results on the ground, although
    this was covered to some extent in the missions' extensive aide-memoires. Staff on the ground
    played an important role in maintaining a daily dialogue on PRSC implementation. This was the
    case, for instance in the area of the financial sector as well as for public finance management.
    Representatives of the donor community, including the Bank, met regularly with CARFIP to discuss
    their progress reports. The Bank team through the supervision of the policy operations and related
    investment projects provided considerable support to the Government for implementing the reform
    agenda.

91. Not enough was done to encourage the authorities to collect the data required for updating the
    indicators and filling out the results framework in a systematic way during implementation of the
    first PRSC series. In September 2008, the team leaders for the preparation of the supplemental
    financing and of PRSC III made a considerable effort to update the matrix of policy actions with the
    Government. While the ICR was being prepared in June-July 2009, the country team and the
    Government were unable to provide data for the extensive indicator table.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

     PRSC I: Moderately unsatisfactory
     PRSC II: Moderately unsatisfactory

92. The first PRSC did not make a significant break from past development policy operations. It
    emphasized the need to accelerate growth, but the policy agenda was weak. It was characterized
    more by incremental process steps than completed, substantive reforms, and proved complex in scope
    and unclear in terms of linkages from actions to results, for which there was weak monitoring and
    evaluation. On the other hand, the Bank was able to support the client in slowly progressing with its
    reform agenda, even during global crisis times in 2008. The decision to discontinue the first PRSC
    series and to focus on improving public finance management and service delivery was sound, but
    there was limited scope for making any significant change to the policy agenda of PRSC II. To
    ensure a smooth transition to the new approach, Bank management decided to shift the task team
    leadership from the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) group to the Human
    Development (HD) group. During the two and a half years period between the concept review
    meeting for PRSC I and the closing date of PRSC II there were four Task Team leaders (TTLs). This
    lack of continuity has been accompanied by a lack of accountability. Monitoring program
    implementation was weak, which was reflected at the time of ICR preparation in difficulties to obtain
    information on policy actions actually implemented and data for completing the performance
    indicators table. On the other hand, the Bank was highly responsive to the food and fuel crisis and
    helped the Government address it efficiently. Based on the Harmonized Evaluation Criteria, a
    moderately unsatisfactory rating for quality-at-entry and a moderately unsatisfactory rating quality of
    supervision yield a moderately unsatisfactory for Bank performance

         PRSC I: Moderately unsatisfactory
         PRSC II: Moderately satisfactory

93. The Government prepared a second generation PRSP, which was a significant improvement on
    the previous one. It emphasized the need to accelerate growth as an essential requirement for
    significant poverty reduction, but did not provide a good road map for achieving the growth agenda.
    GPRSF lacked a results framework, which made monitoring of the program difficult.

94. The pace of reform was slow in 2007, due to the long political transition process. When the post-
    election Government was formed in September 2007, the Ministry of Economy and Finance was split
    into two separate ministries: Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economy, Industry & Trade, which
    affected the coherence and continuity of the work program. Key actions were not implemented
    during that period for lack of an adequate monitoring system and weaker follow-up on the reform
    agenda. The consensus-building process has been slow in key areas, such as cotton, but led to the
    approval of key laws establishing the basis for CMDT privatization in August 2008, as well as
    privatization of BIM.7

95. Faced with the food and fuel crisis in 2008, the Government took a series of measures to boost
    agricultural production and protect consumers from fast increasing prices. The measures were
    sound, with the exception of the temporary ban on exports of rice and other cereals. Contrary to the
    situation in other West African countries, there were no riots in the streets. The Government
    maintained macroeconomic stability under difficult circumstances, and protected social expenditures
    by reducing them less than the deep cuts in the overall budget. Following the round table on growth
    in June 2008, the pace of reforms accelerated, which led to key reforms in 2009.

·       Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:


                             Implementing Agency                                                     Performance
          1. Ministry of Economy and Finance (PRSC I)                                            Moderately unsatisfactory
          2. Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade (PRSC II)                                   Moderately unsatisfactory

96. The performance of the Ministry of Economy and Finance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory,
    because it did not provide the leadership required for (i) meeting the general effectiveness conditions
    for PRSC I on time, (ii) monitoring effective implementation of the reform agenda and (iii) collecting
    the data for evaluating results. The performance of the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade is
    equally rated as moderately unsatisfactory for the same reasons, even though it was diligent in
    ensuring that PRSC II would be declared effective within a reasonable time period. Following
    several requests, the Government prepared a completion report and sent it on October 30, 2009. A
    summary of the report is provided in Annex 3.

        6. Lessons Learned

97. A selective focus on policy areas with already concrete reform actions or strong prospects for
    reforms is preferable for a PRSC series. The first PRSC series did not make a real break from the
    past. It was complex, lacked selectivity, was heavy on processes and was not sufficiently focused on



7
    Outside of the PRSC areas, the Government also advanced on privatization of the state telecommunications company, completed in 2009.

                                                                      23
      outcomes.8 Not surprisingly, the results are broadly similar to those obtained in the previous ten
      years. While an incremental approach can serve to build up a consensus for parts of a broader reform
      agenda that require more consensus-building, there is a risk of loss of focus when this incremental
      process approach is applied across the board to a broad and complex range of policy reform areas.
      The Bank had conducted significant technical analysis prior to the PRSC series but arguably less
      political economy analysis that could have served to identify selective areas with stronger prospects
      for reforms, or potential coalitions in favor of such reforms. It is clear that the results from an
      analysis of the political economy in connection with reforms in specific sectors can usefully be taken
      into account in the formulation of the reform agenda supported by the Bank.

98.         Monitoring and evaluation is an essential part of any Bank-supported operation. It is
      important to ensure, during preparation and approval of the operation, that there is a sound but simple
      monitoring and evaluation system within Government's institutions. Few indicators should be
      selected, with an emphasis on outcome rather than output or process indicators. The links between
      policy actions and indicators should be clarified and credible, and the selection of indicators should
      take into account limitations in the availability of data and not impose additional costs to the
      Government. For PRSCs, the country team should be mobilized for ensuring that data are collected
      and analyzed. The PRSC is the instrument designed to help the Government implement its poverty
      reduction strategy (PRS). The annual progress report prepared by the PRS Secretariat should include
      an updated policy matrix with comments on actions taken and their impact.

99.         A PRSC requires strong, multi-sectoral ownership that is often best achieved by
      continuity of Bank and Client teams.9 This is true for both the Bank and the client side of the
      partnership. The first PRSC series was characterized by a change in program leadership for both the
      Government and the Bank (which had four different TTLs for the series), which contributed to higher
      turnover and less effective program implementation monitoring and accountability for results.


      7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Partners

(a)        Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

100.          Comments were received from the Borrower and are summarized in Annex 3.

(b)        Co-financiers:

101.      There was no co-financing as such; however, a memorandum of understanding of budget
    support was reached with Sweden, France, The Netherlands, Canada, African Development Bank,
    and the European Union (see below).


Collaboration with Other Multilateral and Bilateral Donors

102.     In line with the Paris Declaration, development partners are supporting Mali in
    implementing the GPRSF, by providing financial and technical support in a coordinated way.
    The Bank led the technical discussions that culminated in the signature of the Framework
    Arrangement for budget support to Mali, and of the specific arrangement for general budget support.

8
  The Borrower coincides with these findings, while cautioning that an otherwise efficient tool like budget support is less helpful for state
disengagements (e.g. CMDT)
9
  The Borrower ICR additionally notes that a strong partnership with donors around a reform agenda is critical.

                                                                         24
    A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in March 2006 by the Government and a group
    of donors (including the Bank, AfDB, EC, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada)
    to provide a framework for a multi-donor approach to budget support. This Budget Support Group
    initiated annual joint-donor missions in 2007. The last mission took place in September 2008 and
    resulted in the preparation of a joint policy matrix, which will be the base of the programs supported
    by the participating institutions.

103.     The Government of Mali has created an Aid Harmonization Secretariat. Within the
    Ministry of Finance, this secretariat includes other relevant ministries and entities and is chaired by
    the Technical Advisor on poverty reduction. The Secretariat closely cooperates with the "Pool
    Technique", a unit created by and providing support to the development partners.

104.      Development partners are organized in thematic groups, each of which maintains a close
    dialogue with the Government in specific areas. The support to the public expenditure reform
    agenda is coordinated in line with the Government's PAGAM-GFP. The Government has convened
    meetings periodically with the main donors to inform them of progress on implementation. Key
    reforms in public financial management are being supported by financing from IDA together with
    technical assistance from the EU and the French Cooperation. Donor coordination around
    decentralization reforms has also improved with a thematic group on decentralization chaired by the
    EU. The working group focuses jointly with the Government on the institutional framework of the
    decentralization process in Mali. The working group on public finances, chaired by the Bank, is
    helping to ensure the effectiveness of the transfer of funds to the local governments, in line with the
    Mali decentralization law, and to ensure more financial transparency at the local level.

A summary of sector-specific actions covered by the operation

Budget: In 2006 the following sectors/institutions had prepared a MTEF: Education, Health, Agriculture,
Livestock and Fisheries, Public Works and Transport, Social Development, and Decentralization and
State Reform. In 2007, the Hydraulics, Environment, Crafts and Tourism, and Food Security Departments
prepared their MTEF. In 2008, the Ministries of Finance, Youth and Sports, Homeland Security and
Economy, Industry and Trade prepared their MTEF. Validation of an MTEF implies that it has been
approved by the Ministry of Finance. The global MTEF is updated in May. The updating of the sectoral
MTEFs takes place before the budget discussions in October.

A consultant (ADE of Belgium) prepared an evaluation of the MTEFs. Its report was made available to
the Ministry of Finance on October 13, 2009. The main recommendation of the report is that a standard
format be adopted for MTEFs.

All ministries and regions (except Kidal for security reasons) are now interconnected with the Ministry of
Finance. The monitoring of the chain of expenditures has been fully operational since end-2008.
Problems persist, however, in the recording of the payments made by the Treasury, which has its own
system. The interface between the budget and the treasury was completed in October 2009. The Financial
Control Department used to produce quarterly tables on actual expenditures (at the payment order stage)
at a highly aggregated level. These tables are generally available 8 weeks after the end of the quarter. No
monthly report on budget execution is available, but officials who have access to the information system
have budget execution tables in real time. The Budget Directorate is preparing the format for a short
monthly report, which would be made available to all ministries and external partners.

Procurement: A consultant installed a database in the General Directorate of Public Procurement
(GDPP) in September 2006. In the contract, however, there was no provision for hands on support and
training. The data base was not used, as a consequence. The IT specialists of the Ministry of Finance are

                                                          32
working on a simplified database. The regulatory agency was created by a law enacted in July 2009 and
an implementing decree issued in August 2009. Key personnel have been appointed. The agency is not
yet operational, however. GDPP has organized a series of training sessions for staff in ministries and
regions. The training sessions did not focus on the new procurement code or the standard bidding
documents, however, which is unfortunate. In general, junior staff is sent to these training sessions. In
2007, GDPP has reviewed 1753 contracts, of which about 74% under open competitive bidding. The
threshold for periodic reviews of the contracting authorities has been raised from CFAF 10 million in
2006 to CFAF 20 million in 2008.

Financial sector: In the PRSC I policy matrix, the adoption of a strategy for each concerned bank to
clean-up the bad debts in bank portfolios was proposed as a trigger for PRSC II. This action was not met
and was replaced by the adequate funding of the micro-finance supervision unit in the Ministry of
Finance. BIM was successfully privatized. BHM has been recapitalized at a cost of about 1% of GDP.
The ratio of gross non-performing loans in the portfolio of banks was expected to decline from 29% in
June 2005 to 20% in April 2008. It was still at 25% at that time. Excluding BHM, the ratio was 18%. At
the end of 2008, BHM had a negative net worth (about ½ percent of GDP), 40 percent of its loans were
nonperforming, and it had a large operating loss. The unit in charge of financial sector supervision in the
Ministry of Finance could not provide the data required to complete the indicator table.

The two operations sought to reduce the deficits in the social security institutions (CRM and INPS). A
new law was expected to be enacted for CRM and new texts adopted for INPS in April 2007. The law and
the texts were eventually adopted in April 2008. CRM, the retirement fund continued to incur deficits
(slightly higher than expected for 2008). The indicator for INPS was focused on the pension part, which
was and is still incurring deficits.

Private sector: Exports Promotion and Investment Climate Enhancement.

Exports: The decree distinguishing artisan products from antiquities was signed in 2006 and a public
campaign was conducted to inform artisanal producers that their products are not subject to export
authorization. Quality standards for exports, notably agricultural exports, have been adopted. This is the
case for mangoes for instance. In the policy matrix, the value of exports other than gold and cotton was
expected to increase by 12% in 2007 and 13% in 2008, from a value of CFAF 431 billion in 2005. In
reality the value of non cotton-non gold exports was CFAF 81 billion in 2005. According to the IMF,
these exports increased to CFAF 83 billion in 2006, declined to CFAF 79 billion in 2007 and increased to
CFAF 106 billion in 2008. The decline in 2007 was due to lower world prices for vegetable oil, skins and
leather and peanuts. In 2008 world prices recovered strongly. The targets for export growth in real terms
were optimistic.

The indicator on the number of jobs in the formal sector in the matrix does not make much sense as most
jobs in that sector are in the public and para-public sector. No information was available on job creation
by the private sector. The Employment and Training Observatory conducts annual surveys on
employment. In 2005 it is estimated that 322,839 people had a job in the formal sector. This number
increased to 326,867 in 2007.

Investment climate: The law confirming that the unique firm ID number would be used by all
administrations has been adopted as a Prior Action for PRSC I. The one-stop window for investors started
operating in 2009 after completion of PRSCII. The property registration fees have been reduced. No
progress was made in corporate taxation. The studies on corporate taxation and on labor market
competitiveness were not initiated. Indicators were selected to assess progress in the investment climate,
focusing on starting a business and paying taxes. According to the last three Doing Business reports, the
indicators are as follows.

Payments (number per year)                                    58                   58                  58
Time (hours per year)                                       270                  270                 270

Progress was made in the first series of indicators, but after completion of PRSC I. On the other hand, no
progress was recorded on paying taxes.

Transports and Transit Facilitation: In 2002, the principle of earmarking 3% of the petrol import price
for financing the Roads Authority was adopted. Each year the fee would increase by CFAF 3. Until 2009,
however, the Government did not implement the policy of adjusting the fee. Road maintenance was
financed for a large part by budget transfers and an increase in road tolls paid to the Road Authority. The
level of road user fees as a percentage of road maintenance financing was 26% in 2007 and 47% in 2008.
The increase in 2008 is mostly due to a large decline in budget allocations to road maintenance.

The indicator in PRSC I and II was the share of the road network maintained. The target was 66% in 2007
and 67% in 2008. The table below, provided by the Roads Directorate, shows the length of roads
maintained and in good condition in the past three years. Little progress was made in the number of km of
roads maintained. The table also shows that, on average over the past years, only 60% of the road network
maintained is in good condition, which raises questions about the effectiveness of road maintenance.

Road network                                                    2006                2007             2008

Km of gravel roads in good condition                           5,019               5,220            3,595

The studies on taxation and levies on road transport operators and on creating a competitive freight
exchange have not been initiated. The coordination unit in charge of implementing three Bank-financed
projects in the transport and transit sector was not able to provide information on the indicators in the
policy matrix for that sector. The average duration of truck immobilization in customs does not make
much sense, as a truck can be stuck there as long as the payment of customs duties has not been made.

Electricity and urban water supply: In 2002-2003, EDM started to benefit from cheap power generated
by the Manantali dam. This enabled EDM to increase its customer base by an average of 10% per year. In
2006, EDM was using 100 percent of its quota of power from Manantali. It had to meet new demand with
local thermal generation, the share of which in total generation went from 20% in 2005 to 41% in 2007.
In 2004, CREE, the regulatory authority, decided to reduce electricity and water tariffs by 10%. No
adjustment was made until 2009. EDM's financial situation deteriorated significantly from 2006 to 2008.
The gross operating profits to sales went from 18% in 2006 to 4% in 2008. On the other hand, technical
performance improved in recent years. Electricity distribution losses declined from 22% in 2004 to 19%
in 2008, and water losses declined from 30% to 25% during the same period.

Cotton: Following the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, seed cotton production rose rapidly for a
number of years, exceeding 600,000 tons in 2003/04. Since then, cotton production has steadily declined
to reach 201,000 tons in 2008. Low prices for cotton have discouraged farmers. Yields are low and
declining because farmers use less imported inputs. CMDT, the state-owned ginner, used to be a state in
the state and the source of considerable rents. It was inefficient and absorbed a large share of the export
price of cotton. On the other hand, it provided services to the local population. It is now bankrupt. In
2007 its cash deficit was CFAF 18.4 billion and in 2008, CFAF 22 billion. In 2008, CMDT received a
government subsidy of CFAF 8.8 billion. Its privatization has been on the agenda of reform for a long
time, but the Government was not prepared to rely on private investors for improving the value added
from the sector. Privatization is again on the agenda, and it is expected that it could be completed by end
2010. The policy measures supported by PRSC I and II have been implemented.

Office du Niger (ON): On the basis of an organizational and a financial audit of ON, an action plan was
prepared in December 2007 for a total cost of CFAF 79.5 billion, of which CFAF 73 billion for the
rehabilitation and maintenance of the irrigation network. Seven priority actions were recommended:
· Improve accounting to make financial data more reliable;
· Improve the technical information system, including establishing a cadastre;
· Strengthen information technology and communications;
· Restructure ON;
· Rehabilitate and maintain irrigation networks; train farmers in contract management;
· Improve the living conditions of personnel; and
· Reinforce capacity for implementation of the 2020 development plan.

Two schemes associating farmers to the development of irrigation have been initiated in the Koumouna
area. The first one concerns 130 farmers who will receive 3 ha each. In that scheme, ON builds the
secondary canals and levels the land; the farmers take care of tertiary canals. They have to pay slightly
above CFAF 1 million, each, over 10 years before getting a title to the land. The Government is
considering extending the repayment period to 15 years and entrust a microfinance institution with the
task of collecting debt service. In the second scheme, 10 private investors were selected to develop 444
ha. They obtained the land for free. Other schemes are underway.

In December 2008, the Government adopted the Master Development Plan for ON. A State Secretariat
was created in the Prime Minister's Office in April 2009 to supervise its implementation.

Health and Social Development: The standard performance contracts for hospitals was finalized and in
2008 the 12 hospitals in the country have signed their contract. A proposal for a bonus to be paid for good
performance is being discussed. The Government has defined a plan to strengthen family planning
services in health centers. It claimed it has made FP services operational in half of the health centers.
According to data provided by the Ministry of Health, the number of couple-years of contraceptive
protection jumped from 68,487 in 2007 to 355,349 in 2008, which is clearly impossible and inconsistent
with the number of FP consultations in that year. In another document of the Ministry of Health
(Yearbook SILS 2008), the number of FP consultations reached 306,104 in 2008, resulting in a ratio of
FP consultations to the number of women of childbearing age of 4.05.

The Government provided written confirmation of the modalities for transfer of the additional resources
required for the 2007 program of the health and social development ministries. It adopted a budget for the
2008 program based on the MTEFs of the two ministries, including a provisional health map taking into
account the private sector in the statistics of existing health centers. However, the 2008 yearbook of the
Ministry of Health does not mention health centers operated by the private sector or NGOs. The share of

the health budget in total budget increased from 10.45% in 2007 to 11.54% in 2008. In 2008 actual
expenditures in health and social development declined as a result of the fiscal crisis.

Rural water and sanitation: The text updating the role of the Department of Hydraulics (DNH) was
approved by the Government in 2009 and is expected to be submitted to Parliament. The potable water
delivery systems maintenance strategy, including tools for PPP in piped water systems, was adopted in
2007. A database on water systems is in place, but it is not yet fully operational, as construction and
rehabilitation of water facilities by NGOs are not systematically recorded. Information on the
rehabilitation of water systems continues to be a problem. The share of potable water delivery systems
which are functional has not improved over the PRSC I and II implementation period. The table below
provides information on the construction and rehabilitation of water systems by DNH over the period
2004-08.

During the past two years, construction of water systems has accelerated, compared to the previous three
years. The increase on an annual average basis is 35%. The annual average of 876 water systems in the
past two years is still well below the level required for achieving the MDGs in the sector (1,250 annually).
No information is available on whether cost recovery has improved.

Annex 3. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The completion report indicated progress made and persistent weaknesses in the areas supported by the
two PRSCs as follows:

Public finance management

Progress:
        ·   Good results achieved in 2006 in macroeconomic and budget management and in poverty
            reduction;
        ·   Good progress in implementing PAGAM/GFP;
        ·   Preparation of good quality MTEFs;
        ·   Interconnection of departments and regional offices of Ministry of Finance; and
        ·   Selection of technical assistance for procurement reform.

Weaknesses:
   ·      Delays in mobilizing budget support;
   ·      Inadequate alignment of budget with MTEFs;
   ·      Delays in budget execution in all sectors;
   ·      No progress in the study on taxation; and
   ·      Delays in approving texts for the establishment of the regulatory agency for procurement.

Support to growth

Progress:
   ·        Continued efforts in the formulation of norms and standards for exports;
   ·        Reforms for improving the business climate;
   ·        Adoption of a new Tax Code, including a reduction in property registration fees;
   ·        Progress in restructuring BHM and BIM; and
   ·        Good monitoring of the schedule for cotton sector reform.

Weaknesses
   ·       Delays in establishing the one-stop window for private investors; and
   ·       Persisting weaknesses in the banking sector due to the high level of non-performing loans and
      difficulties in the micro-finance sector; and
   ·       Uncertainties in the cotton sector due to a world price which is lower than the farm-gate
      price.

Access to basic services

Progress:
   ·        Good coordination among donors and improvement on some MDG indicators; and
   ·        Improved access to education (not part of the PRSC agenda).

Weaknesses
   ·       Need to increase allocations and actual spending for health and social development; and
   ·       Unequal access to education.

                                                   55
Assessment of Bank and Government performance

Bank

Program implementation has contributed to (i) strengthening the dialogue with external partners, (ii)
improving public finance management; (iii) improving access to basic social services; and (iv) enhancing
governance.

Government

The Government opted for a prudent fiscal policy in 2006 and 2007. It took courageous decisions in the
allocation of resources and the development of instruments for strategic planning and budgeting.

Lessons from experience

    ·   The PRSC series did not make a real break from the past. It was too focused on processes, not
        enough on results.
    ·   Budget support is an efficient tool, but not for state disengagement.
    ·   The reform program should be sharply focused.
    ·   A strong partnership with donors is critical.
