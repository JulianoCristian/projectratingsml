Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            rated as unsatisfactory. Borrower performance during the\n            project implementation period is rated unsatisfactory\n            (though marginally so) principally on account of poor\n            project management and lack of transparency. Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory because, while the Bank\n            insisted that the existing exploration contracts were too\n            favorable and should be re-negotiated, it ignored the\n            dilemma with the Government on this issue. Furthermore,\n            supervision was very limited and the Bank failed to react\n            strongly to overdue audits, inadequate project accounting,\n            and failure by the Government to comply with the covenant\n            requiring transparency in budgeting of oil revenues.\n            Experience from this project confirms a number of OED\n            lessons: 1) As soon as significant discoveries are made,\n            important issues arise associated with the impact and\n            distribution of oil wealth, which need to be addressed\n            rapidly through the Bank-country dialogue to ensure\n            long-term sustainability. The Bank might consider supporting\n            the adoption of policies and strategies leading to the\n            proper management of oil wealth through adjustment or sector\n            loans. Negotiated contracts need to incorporate time and\n            geographical limits on those terms. When the implementing\n            agency lacks project management capacity, project design\n            should incorporate provisions to contract outside expertise."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
