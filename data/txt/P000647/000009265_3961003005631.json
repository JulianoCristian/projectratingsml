recruited consulting services,\n            including highly specialized services of:  (a) production\n            and reservoir engineers to define the most efficient method\n            for developing the Alba field and ensuring that this\n            development is in line with international industry\n            standards; (b) specialists to monitor exploration activities\n            in the country; (c) an expert in the downstream subsector to\n            make recommendations on reform of petroleum products\n            procurement and retail pricing policy; (d) a consultant to\n            study the reorganization of the energy sector; (e) gas\n            specialists to identify and implement optimum uses for Alba\n            gas; and (f) a specialist in petroleum-related pollution to\n            study the environmental impact of production from the Alba\n            condensate field and prepare recommendations for protection\n            of the environment.  The project will also finance a\n            training action plan including training sessions in Malabo\n            and scholarships, attendance at special courses and seminars\n            and instruction in safety and environment protection both on\n            the job and in petroleum depots in Europe or Africa.  It\n            also includes provision for construction and rehabilitation\n            of the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons building and field\n            cars to enable staff to carry out their tasks, particularly\n            with respect to product supply and distribution."}, "docdt": "1992-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
