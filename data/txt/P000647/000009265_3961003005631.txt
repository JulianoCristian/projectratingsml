MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE FRESIDENT
OF THE INTERWATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA
FOR A SECOND PETROLEUM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following report and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea for SDR 1.8 million, the equivalent of US$2.43
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to finance a
project to help the Government: (a) maximize revenues from the Alba
condensate and gas field; and (b) strengthen the Government's technical
and financial capability to monitor oil companies' activities in the
country.
Country Backcsround
2.          Although the country has enjoyed increased access to
external assistance, the economy faces major development constraints,
including: (a) a weak tax administration which limits the availability
of domestic resources; (b)  .- iy debt service which constrains budget
expenditures; and (c) a weak human resource base and consequent lack of
entrepreneurship. The Government has set the following macroeconomic
objectives: (i) accelerate the rate of real GDP growth to an average of
6% per annum; (ii) limit the annual rate of inflation to 3% annually;
and (iii) reduce the external current account deficit to a sustainable
level of 28.5% of GDP. It expects to achieve these goals by prudent use
of oil revenues and with the assistance of the Bank and IMF.
3.          IDA's country strategy in Equatorial Guinea is designed to:
(a) help create conditions for economic growth within a framework that
provides incentives for private investment; (b) alleviate poverty; and
(c) assist the Government in addressing key development constraints.
With that end in view, the Government's medium term adjustment program
is supported by an arrangement under the current IMF structural
adjustment facility (SAP) in an amount equivalent to SDR 5.52 million.
Sector Background
4.          Equatorial Guinea is a small and poor country with a largely
rural economy. Annual demand for petroleum products is lower than
20,000 tons. Of this, fuel oil accounts for the major part, about 65%.
Overall, petroleum products account for almost 30% of total imports.
Given the favorable geomorphormic characteristics of the Nigeria and
Cameroon basin, domestic oil exploration has centered on the northern
offshore of Bioko Island. In 1984, oil was discovered in the Alba
field, located 36 km off the coast of the island. Within the framework
of a production sharing contract signed in May 1990, an independent oil
company started production there in January 1992 and is currently
proceeding in its development (for details on contract, see Technical
Annex - para. 1.38).
5.          Proven reserves are estimated at 535 billion cubic feet of
gas (cfg) and 28 million barrels of condensate. Current production is
2,500 to 3,000 barrels of condensate per day. Peak production, of about
5,000 to 6,000 barrels per day, is expected to be reached in 1993. The
Government could receive some US$60 to 90 million on a cumulative basis
during the period 1995 to 2000, which will have a significant impact on
economic growth and the balance of payments.
6.          The contracting company is technically well qualified.
However, its prime objective may be _o maximize the short term pay-out
and increase immediate returns rather than maximize recovery from the
field over the longer term. This would result in the loss of part of



- 2 -
the original recoverable oil in place.  It    also possible that
recoverable operating costs may be inflated.
7.          Condensate produced from the Alba field has a high gas
content (14 million cfg per 1,000 barrels of condensate). The daily
amount of gas flared at preaent is approximately 35 million cubic feet,
and will reach 80 million when the field reaches its peak production.
By that time, 2,000 barrels per day of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG),
worth about US$24,000 equivalent, would be flared daily.
8.          Because of unusually favorable technical characteristics --
the gas is under high pressure and its temperature is relatively low --
and the design of the processing plant, LPG could be separated from the
condensate at almost no cost. Furthermore, the operator intends to
increase the amount of diesel stripped from the condensate. At present
only enough diesel is extracted to provide energy for operating the
processing plant itself but in the near future the amount stripped will
be sufficient to supply domestic demand ft:ly.
9.          The Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons (MNH), and, within
the MMH, the Department of Hydrocarbons (DR), have the primary
responsibilit' for policy and regulatory matters pertaining to the
petroleum seccor in Equatorial Guinea. DH includes, beside its
director, who is a petroleum engineer, about ten specialists in various
techniques in the petroleum upstream subsector. Although MMB's capacity
to supervise and regulate the sector has increased in recent years, it
still requires strengthening, particularly in the areas of oil
production (since the Alba field is moving into its implementation
phase), and product supply and distribution (where the procurement
process needs to be more transparent and the retail price structure more
efficient).
10.         Furthermore, the control of various energy subsectors is
spread between different ministries and there is a need for an
appropriate central unit to collect energy-related data and establish a
national energy policy. Since the future products separated from Alba
flare may be used for different purposes such as electricity generation
or household energy supply, MMH has insisted that activities under the
proposed Project include an energy sector reorganization study and the
identification of ways to improve the institutional framework of the
sector. IDA has agreed to this.
Prolect Obiectives
11.         Objectives of the proposed project are to assist the
Government in: (a) identifying ways to improve the organization of the
energy sector; (b) protecting and maximizing its interest in the Alba
field by ensuring a maximum rate of recovery of field reserves and
sustainable long-term production; (c) identifying the most cost-
effective methods for utilizing the gas from the Alba field, either on
the domestic market (butane for household use) or for export (separated
LPG or dry gas to produce methanol); and (d) monitoring the activities
of oil companies in the upstream petroleum subsector (seismic
exploration or development well drilling) as well as downstream
(improvement of product supply process and retail price structure). In
addition, the proposed project includes a training component aimed at
progressively enabling MMH staff to take overall responsibility for
monitoring oil company activities in Equatorial Guinea without further
external technical assistance within three to four years.
Proiect Description
12.         As described in the Technical Annex (page 12), the main
component of the Project is the provision of internationally recruited
consulting services, including highly specialized services of: (a)



- 3 -
production and reservoir engineers to define the most efficient method
for developing the Alba field and ensuring that this development ie in
line with international industry standards; (b) specialists to monitor
exploration activities in the country; (c) an expert in the downstream
subsectc:. to make recommendations on reform of petroleum products
procurement and retail pricing policy; (d) a consultant to study the
reorganization of the energy sector; (e) gas specialists to identify and
implement optimum uses for Alba gas; and (f) a specialist in petroleum-
related pollution to study the environmental impact of production from
the Alba condensate field and prepare recommendations for protection of
the environment. Total requirements for consultancies are estimated at
85 man-months for ar. estimated cost of US$1,810,000: the average rate of
about US$21,000 per month (all costs included) is reasonable for such
highly specialized services. It is expected that consultants, even
under a long-term contract, would stay in Malabo for periods not
exceeding about two months.
13.         The proposed Project will also finance a training action
plan including training sessions in Malabo and scholarships, attendance
at special courses and seminars and instruction tn safety and
environmental protection both on-the-job and in patroleum depots in
Europe or Africa.  The action plan aims at enabling the MKH staff to
take over the implementation of their assigned tasks within the project
period.
14.         The proposed Project also includes provision for: (a)
rehabilitation of MMH's building, the construction of which was financed
under the IDA-financed First Petroleum T.A. Credit (estimated cost:
US$100,000); and (b) provision of two field cars to enable MMH staff to
carry out their task, particularly with respect to product supply and
distribution. The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Equatorial Guinea are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
Proiect Imolemntation
15.         The Project will be executed by the Department of
Hydrocarbons in MMH which will be responsible for the technical and
financial implementation. Implementation should be facilitated by the
Department's experience acquired on the course of the First Petroleum
T.A. Project. This project closed on June 30, 1990. Close supervision
will ensure that World Bank guidelines for the selection of consultants
are followed and Credit covenants are met throughout implementation.
16.         During the implementation of the project, IDA will assist
the Government: (a) in negotiating appropriate agreements with both the
foreign company which is currently developing the Alba field, and the
firm, also foreign, which has a practical monopoly on the supply of
petroleum products in the country; and (b) in using gas from the Alba
field in the most cost effective way for the economic development of the
country.
Proiegt sustainabilitv
17.         The Project is targeted at ensuring the long-term
sustainable production from the Alba field. If this field is operated
in accordance with international industry practice, its life span should
be at least 15 years, thus securing long-term revenue for the
Government.

Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement
18.         Ns recorded isi the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the
First Petroleum T.A. Project (Cr. 1304-EG), DH staff were able to ensure
that Credit covenants and Bank guidelines were respected throughout the
implementation of the project. They also fully benefitted from the
training program included in that project.  However, IDA was not always
informed in a timely fashion of proposed arrangements with the oil
industry. This concern will be addressed through close supervision of
the project by IDA staff.
19.         Studies performed under the previous petroleum credit have
assisted in laying the foundations for the proposed project. They
include: (a) an in-depth study of petroleum product supply and
distribution in Equatorial Guinea; (b) a pre-feasibility study of Alba
gas utilization; (c) a study of the organization of a statistical unit
within the MMH; and (d) an evaluation of the hydrocarbon potential of
the sedimentary basins in the country.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
20.         Equatorial Guinea's economy faces major development
constraints. The Bank's strategy is to assist the Government in
overcoming these (paras 2 and 3). Economic and sector work over the
program period will emphasize the improvement of public sector
management and in management of the critical petroleum sector.  The
proposee Project is thus an integral element of overall IDA assistance
to Equatcrial Guinea.
21.         During the First Petroleum T.A. Credit, IDA developed a
close dialogue with the Government and is well placed as the lead donor
in the sector to assist the Government in improving its regulatory and
policy capacity in the energy sector.
22.         The World Bank is sponsoring a regional study of associated
gas utilization in West African countries. The proposed Project, which
includes a study of the utilization of Alba gas, is in synergy with this
regional study.
Actions Agreed
23.         The Government has submitted its Declaration of Principles
regarding its energy sector policy as well as an action plan for
training MMH personnel. In addition to agreeing on the terms of
reference of the studies financed by the project, agreement has been
reached on the following: (a) regular transfer of oil production
revenues to the national budget -- this will be reviewed with IDA on a
periodic basis; (b) Government financing for 10% of the cost of the
Project; (c) a study of the environmental impact of Alba production and
an action plan and timetable for implementation of the study
recommendations not later than January 15, 1993; and (d) Government will
select consultants to carry out: (i) a feasibility study of the gas
utilization program; (ii) an independent study to establish the optimal
program for development of Alba field; and (iii) agreement on an action
plan by November 30, 1992, based on recommendations of the studies.
Conditions of effectiveness of the credit are selection of consultants
to assist in project implementation and establishment of a special
project account.
Environmental Asoects
24.         The development of the Alba field presents some hazards for
the environment. The field's product is light and volatile. For this
reason, while any crude would be disposed of through evaporation, it
would also present a danger of widespread fire because it is so



flammable. It is therefore necessary to assess the environmental impact
of the development of the field with respect to: (a) possible oil or gas
leakage which could trigger an extensive fire; and (b) disposal of
chemical products found in drilling waste in order to prevent damage to
marine flora and fauna. A US$50,000 study of the environmental impact,
to include appropriate recommendations on identified issues, is included
in the proposed Project. During negotiations, it was agreed that the
Government would prepare an action plan based on the study's
recommendations and a timetable for its implementation not later than
January 15,1993. The Project is classified in category B.
Prooram Objective Cateaories
25.         The project supports private sector development and
strengthening of the Government's capacity to supervise investor
activities through improvemetnt of the regulatory environment.
Proiect Benefits
26.         Benefits exicted to result from Project activities include:
(a) a possible in-redse in the rate of recovery of the Alba field; and
(b) the identification and implementation of the most cost-effective
methods for using gas which is presently flared. An increase by 1% of
the rate of recovery of the field would generate inc_.amental revenue
equivalent to twice the total cost of the proposed Project. The
financial rate of return of the possible export of LPG separated from
Alba effluent would be over 100%.
gisks
27.         Risks associated with the Project are of two kinds.  The
first is technical and relates to the possible over evaluation of the
recoverable reserves and production rate of the Alba field. This risk
is minor, since three oil and gas wells have already been drilled and
production, which started six months ago, has not resulted in any
observable decrease in well-head pressure. The second is institutional
and concerns possible non-compliance with the agreement to enter Alba
field revenues in the annual budget. Compliance with this agreement
will be closely supervised by IDA staff.
Recommendation
28.         I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.

SECOND PETROLUM TECUNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Disbursements - Im1ementation Issues
In Egquatorial Guinea, certain projects show significant lag.
The reasons for such performance are due to lack of counterpart funds.
This problem has derived primarily from the weak financial performance
of the public sector.  This situation, coupled with occasional
suspensions of disbursements by co-financiers, has had a negative
influence on the execution of projects.
In view of these problems, IDA has made several adjustments
to improve portfolio performance. It is intensifying project
supervision to address problems before they seriously prejudice the
attainment of project goals. Furthermore, in December 1991, IDA
assigned to its resident representative (based in Brazzaville, Congo) a
more regional role, including responsibilities for first line
supervision of IDA's activities in Equatorial Guinea.

REPUBLIC OF DOVATORIAL oUXNEA
Technical Annex to the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President
for a Second Petroleum Technical Assistance Proiect
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRXPTXON
I. The Energy Sector
A.        Xatroduction
1.1      Equatorial Guinea consists of the island of Bioko, where the nation
capital, Malabo, is situated, Rio Muni, a territory on the African continent,
and numerous small islands. It is well endowed with wood and hydro-electric
resources and has a fair potential in hydrocarbon resources. Bata, capital
of the continental region, is supplied with electricity from the 3.6 MW
hydropower plant at Bikomo. Malabo is also supplied by a 3.6 MW hydropower
plant at Riaba. Recently, Equatorial Guinea's oil reserves have begun to be
tapped: the first production started in January 1992. However, more than 80%
of the population's domestic energy needs are still met through consumption
of fuelwood from the forests which cover about three quarters of Equatorial
Guinea's 28,000 square kilometers of land area.
1.2       Because well supported statistical data are lacking, it is not
possible to make an accurate assessment of commercial energy consumption in
the country. Available information suggests that it is of the order of 200
to 300 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) per capita--a low value, typical of
a largely rural economy with relatively small industrial and commercial
sectors. Total demand for petroleum products has remained stable over the
last five years at approximately 18.2 thousand tons annually.   Total
consumption is fairly evenly split between the two major regions,
Malabo/Bioko and Bata/Continent,  although gasoline consumption  in the
continental area is about 50% higher than on Bioko. Fuel oil accounted for
some 65% of demand for petroleum products in 1988 and consumption is not
expected to increase significantly in the near future due to the recent
commissioning of the Riaba hydropower plant and to the possibilities for
separating diesel from Alba field associated gas.
B.       Country Policies and Performance
Past Performance
1.3      With a population estimated at 350,000 and a per capita income of
US$450 in 1990, Equatorial Guinea has one of the world's smallest and least
developed economies. Despite a generous natural resource endowment, economic
performance has been inadequate since independence from Spain in 1968. The
disastrous mismanagement and brutal repression of the period 1968-1979 left
the country in economic disarray. A new economic program was initiated in
1980 but was not sustained. In 1985, Equatorial Guinea became a member of the
Bank of Central African States (BEAC). Efforts to rebuild the economy were
renewed, but overall growth was marginal.   Although timber production
increased appreciably and activity in the commerce and trade sectors

expanded, the production and export of cocoa, the country's main foreign
exchange earner, stagnated far below levels achieved before independence and
worsening terms of trade contributed to large and unsustainable fiscal and
external imbalances.
1.4       In 1988, the Government adopted its first  medium-term adjustment
program covering the period 1988-1991.  This program was supported by: a
first annual arrangement under the IMF's structural adjustment facility
(SAP); a rehabilitation import credit (RIC) and sectoral loans from IDA; and
assistance from other international and bilateral donors. However, during
1988-1989, economic performance fell short of what had been envisaged under
the adjustment program. Many of the program's objectives were not met owing
to slippage in policy implementation, caused in part ty limited
administrative capacity and in part by the continued erosion in world market
prices of cocoa and coffee, the country's principal export crops. After
having grown by about 2.5% in 1986-1987, real GDP growth slowed to an average
increase of less than 2% in 1988-1989, as production and exports of timber
and cocoa declined. The overall fiscal balance (commitment basis) moved from
a modest surplus in 1987 to a deficit equivalent to about 7% of GDP in 1988.
Although expenditure was brought under control in 1989, the fiscal deficit
only declined to 6% of GDP because of a weakening in revenue performance.
1.5       Export performance was also disappointing even though external
competitiveness was maintained by holding down domestic production costs,
including producer prices and labor costs.  Falling export earnings from
cocoa anid timber, combined with an increase in imports of goods and services,
contributed to a weakening of the balance of payments. The external current
account deficit, excluding official transfers, amounted to an average of 49%
of GDP in 1988-1989. Overall weak performance is explained not only by the
terms of trade shock but also by delays in the introduction of stronger
incentives for food crop producers and the failure to introduce other
measures for the strengthening of the private sector, such as the revision of
the investment code and the labor law, the clarification of property rights,
and the restructuring of the banking sector.
Recent Developments
1.6       In 1990-1991, the Government took a number of important steps to
bring the structural adjustment program back on track. The reforms consisted
mainly of efforts to diversify economic activity and to strengthen the
productive sectors. In this regard, the most significant actions taken were:
the launching, in October 1990, of a new IDA-financed project to diversify
agriculture in favor of food crops and non-traditional exports; the adoption
of a forestry action plan aimed at revitalizing production and exports, while
strengthening the management and conservation of the country's natural
resources; and the signing, in April 1990, of a new contract with a foreign
*       company to start the exploitation of the country's oil resources.
1.7       Petroleum production is estimated at 3,000 barrels per day in 1992
and will increase to at least 4,000 barrels per day in subsequent years.
*       Exports of oil are expected to start in April 1992.  According to the terms
of the oil contract, total oil revenues accruing to the Government from 1992
to 1994 will be about US$10 million.   They will increase substantially
afterwards, especially from 1996 when profit sharing will start.   The
Government could receive some US$60 to 90 million, on a cumulative basis,
during the period 1995-2000. The balance of payments will also be positively
affected by oil exports.
1.8       With regard to other structural reforms, considerable progress was
achieved in 1990-1991 in strengthening the management and performance of key
public utilities and towards the completion of the liquidation of the two
insolvent banks. A number of changes were also made in the legal framework,
including a revision in the labor law to free up the labor market; the
liberalization of price controls; and the preparation of the Civil Service
Statutes.

Central Development Issues
1.9       Although the country has enjoyed increased access to external
technical and financial assistance, the economy faces several important
development constraints. These include: (a) domestic resource mobilization
that is hampered by the weaknesses of the tax administration; (b) budget
expenditures constrained by a heavy debt service burden; (c) lack of private
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship due to: (i) uncertain property rights;
(ii) a weak banking sector; and (iii) cumbersome regulatory and incentive
frameworks; and (d) a weak human capital base, accompanied by poor access to
education and health services, and related weak administrative and technical
capacity across the public sector.
Medium-Term Macroeconomic Objectives
1.10      With the commencement of oil production, and building upon the
progress made during 1990-1991, the Government extended the adjustment
program to cover the period through 1994 and prepared a Policy Framework
Paper (PFP) that was discussed at the IDA and IMF Boards in early December
1991. This second medium-term adjustment program is supported by a second
annual arrangement under the structural adjustment facility (SAF), in an
amount equivalent to SDR 5.52 million.   The program has the following
macroeconomic objectives: (a) accelerate the rate of real GDP growth to an
average of 6% per annum, with a major impetus from the oil sector; (b) limit
the annual rate of inflation to 3% annually; and (c) reduce the external
current account deficit to a sustainable level of 28.5% of GDP.
1.11      Although the petroleum sector alone will have a substantial impact
on growth and the balance of payments, to achieve the macroeconomic
objectives of the program, the Government intends to: (a) improve fiscal
performance, in particular expenditure control, the efficiency of public
investment and resource mobilization; (b) continue restructuring the public
enterprise sector; (c) implement reforms conducive to expanding private
sector activity; (d) step up human resources development (education and
health) through increased budget allocations and improved sector management;
and (e) revitalize the forestry sector and implement a natural resource
management plan.
C.        Energy Sector Oraanization
1.12      The Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons (MMH), and within it, the
Directorate of Hydrocarbons (DH), have the prime responsibility for policy
and regulatory matters pertaining to the petroleum subsector in Equatorial
Guinea.  The state-owned company "Empresa Estatal Petrolifera de Guinea
Ecuatorial" (EEPGE) is the owner of all the infrastructure for petroleum
products storage and distribution in the country.   EEPG8 leases these
facilities to a mixed-capital company "Total Ecuatoguineana de Gesti6n" (GE-
TOTAL), which has the exclusive right to manage and operate the supply and
the distribution of petroleum products throughout Equatorial Guinea. The
consultant who will assist the Government in improving the products, pricing
will also verify the import costs as compared with Platt's data corrected
with transport cost.
1.13      Under a protocol signed in January 1984, a joint French and Equato-
Guinean company, GE-TOTAL, was created to provide technical assistance and
petroleum products supply to Equatorial Guinea on a preferential basis. This
preference has resulted in a practical supply monopoly, without adequate
control on the prices of petroleum products and cost of transportation
offered by GE-TOTAL.
1.14      Under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Enterprises Promotion,
and in particular the Directorate General of Industry and Energy (DGIE), the
public company ENERGE is responsible for the power subsector. EMNRGE's main
management team is in Malabo, with a sub-unit in Bata, and although they are
both under the direct control of the DOIE, there is no close relationship



- 15 -
between the units. The Ministry of Water, Woods and Reforestation supervises
and regulates the development of Equatorial Guinea's forest resources. The
Ministry of Planning coordinates the activities of all ministries, although
there is no unit in charge of coordinating the Energy Sector.
De        Power  ueto
Bioko Island
1.15      Until 1989, Bioko's sole source of electric power was a 5 MW diesel
generating plant at Malabo. In 1990, the 3.6 MW Riaba hydropower plant,
designed and built by a French company and financed by the Caisse Contrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the European Investment Bank (BIB) came on
line. Its output is sufficient to meet demand from the existing distribution
system, which supplies only the towns of Malabo and Riaba during the rainy
season. During the dry season, however, the Malabo diesel plant is needed to
compensate for reduced output from Riaba.
1.16      The diesel plant is in need of rehabilitations its three units
(respectively 2.0, 1.7 and 1.2 NW) are in poor shape. The 2 MW turbine is
damaged and out of service. If maintenance of the 1.7 MW unit has to be
carried out in the dry season and before the 2 Mw unit is repaired, only 1.2
MW of power will be available to supplement Riaba's reduced output, while
peak demand is of the order of 7 MW. The Government needs technical and
financial assistance to increase the available power.
1.17      Gas is available at no cost from the new petroleum processing plant
and consideration is therefore being given to replacing the Malabo generator
by a gas power plant with two units of 5 MW each. The establishment of such
an inexpensive, reliable and ample power supply could be a significant asset
for the economic development of the island.
1.18      Under the terms of the financing for the Riaba plant, the national
electricity company, EMERGE, was required to enter into a joint venture
agreement to manage power generation and distribution on Bioko.   Initial
negotiations with a French company were unsuccessful, but, on July 15, 1990,
a twelve-year agreement was signed, creating a new joint venture, SEGESA.
However., the arrangement was short-lived, the French partner withdrawing
after little more than a year. The power company in Bioko is now run without
expatriate assistance, in violation of the agreement between the Government
and the donors and with possible detrimental effects on maintenance of the
equipment at the Riaba plant.
1.19      The Government is currently looking for a new partner, and plans to
sell up to 49% of its share in SEGESA to the private sector.
Rio Mi
1.20      Rio Muni is also supplied by a 3.6 MW hydropower plant (Bikomo)
which is in excellent condition and by a 1.6 MW diesel station which is not
well maintained. In an average year the Dikomo station provides 90% of the
energy required by the system. A project to rehabilitate the distribution
system and increase the electricity supply in Bata is expected to be carried
out under Italian financing.  However, the equipment has been stored in
Trieste for two years, and it is not known when it will be shipped to Malabo.
The African Development Bank (DAD) is also preparing a project to finance
construction of a hydropower plant at Djiploo, where the river has a natural
drop of 10 meters, and to establish a distribution network in the continental
region.   If both projects are realized,  Rio Muni will have a higher
availability of electric power than will Bioko.

1.21      As indicated above, the state company EEPGE owns all the petroleum
storage, transportation and distribution facilities in the country and leases
them to the operating company, GE-TOTAL. The facilities include: (a) a 1 km
unloading pipeline, half of which is laid underground in inhabited areas; (b)
port storage depots at Malabo and Data; (c) jet fuel storage and fueling
facilities at Malabo airport; (d) several road tankers in both locations; and
(e) a network of seven retail outlets on Bioko and 15 in Rio Muni. The
Malabo bulk storage installation includes about 11,400 cubic meters capacity
in seven tanks.  In-service storage capacity on Rio Muni is 11,220 cubic
meters in six tanks. The aggregate capacity is equivalent to more than a
year's petroleum consumption for the country.
1.22      All facillities -- unloading, storage, retail outlets -- are in poor
condition, both in Rio Muni and on Bioko. All the main terminal tanks need
to be rehabilitated and modified to halt further deterioration and bring them
up to international safety, loss and environmental protection standards. The
Caisse Centrale has agreed to finance the rehabilitation of all ESPOE
petroleum products storage and distribution facilities at an estimated cost
of approximately US$3.0 million (FF 15.2 million, of which F? 3.8 million
would be a grant).   Project start-up is expected during 1992 with the
schedule calling for completion within two to three years.
1.23      The Government controls the price of all petroleum products.  The
structure is prepared and maintained by GE-TOTAL, with certain inputs from
MMH and the Ministry of Flnance.  A summary of the official structure for
each product as of January 1992 is provided below:

1.24      As shown in Table 1, the external landed cost represents a
relatively small proportion of the final price to the consumer. The largest
and most variable category by product is Government revenue. The present
petroleum product price structure contains a proliferation of taxes and
company margins which are unnecessarily complicated and possibly, in the case
of gross margin, not reflective of real costs. The structure is in need of
overhaul and streamlining. Resolving this issue is one of the objectives of
the proposed Credit (see paras. 1.29, 2.7 and 3.1).
1.25      Demand for petroleum products has remained stable since 1987,
partly because of the availability of hydropower from the Riaba plant since
1990. In November 1991, however, a new tax, the so-called "IMF charge" was
introduced on petroleum products and demand for gasoline decreased by about
22% between then and January 1992.  Triggered by the increased difference
between retail prices  in Equatorial Guinea and ne.ghboring countries,
smuggling has increased.
1.26      Production from the Alba field (see paras. 1.38 to 1.41 below), is
forecast to replace all diesel imports and part of the kerosene used for
household purposes, significantly reducing overall petroleum imports. The
evolution of future demand is shown in Table 2 below:

1.27      Supply is by tanker from regional sourcess  Port-Gentil refinery
(about 38%), Abidjan refinery (about 32%), unspecified regional sources
(22%), and for smaller quantities: Lom6, Cameroon, Spain, and owendo (Gabon).
A cargo of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 tons of petroleum products is
imported every quarter, with about half being delivered to each of the
receiving depots at Bata and Malabo. Because the draft in Malabo port is
limited, vessels have to unload at Bata first, reducing voyage flexibility.
1.28      An experienced consultant has studied the petroleum downstream
subsector in the country and made recommendations including: (a) modification
of the petroleum price structure; (b) ensuring perfect transparency in
petroleum product procurement; (c) decommissioning of some  of the storage
tanks; (d) decreasing demurrage costs; and (e) possible sale of the retail
network facilities to private Equato-Guinean investors. The Bank supports
these recommendations.
1.29      The  Government  will  need  technical  assistance  to  put  the
recommendations into practice, in particular for revising the price
structure, ensuring transparency in product supply, and establishing an
appropriate fiscal regime for petroleum crude or product import and export.
The proposed project includes a component aimed at reaching these goals.
1*30      At present, the Government does not monitor the downstream
subsector.  Technical supervision oft (a) the safety of facilities; (b)
environmental protection; and (c) product quality control is needed and

should be taken on by DR. Training activities under the proposed project
will be geared to enabling DH staff to assume these responsibilities.
P.        Petroleum Exoloration and Production
Geology of the Region
1.31      Equatorial Guineas particular geographical configuration results
in difficult administrative management problems but it also means that the
country has extensive territorial waters and offshore areas in three distinct
sedimentary basins. One of these, lying north of Bioko, is an extension of
the Niger Delta Basin, which contains a large number of fields ir. Nigeria and
Cameroon, and where the Alba gas and condensate field was discovered,
producing from sandstone reservoirs of Cenozoic age. The offshore area south
of Bioko Island is part of the seaward extension of the Douala Basin in
Cameroon. The remaining basin, lying offshore from Rio Muni, is part of the
northern extension of the Gabon Basin, which is productive to the south in
Gabon, principally from mesozoic and cenozoic reservoirs associated with
structures induced by flowing of an underlying salt formation, of middle
cretaceous age.
1.32      The Bioko Island is located approximately 57 km from the coast of
Cameroon. The island itself, being a volcanic build-up, is not interesting
from an oil exploration point of view. The northern part of the island shelf
may be considered as part of the external belt of the giant delta build-up of
the Niger.   Almost all of the producing fields were encountered in the
typical structures on the internal and median belts. The external belt is
considerably less investigated. Almost all the traps in the latter area are
represented by faulted anticlinal structures related to shale diapirs. The
Alba anticline belongs to this type of structure.
Petroleum Exploration Nistory
1.33      In the Rio Muni area, new seismic data (more than 3,000 km of new
seismic lines) are to be acquired under a speculative contract (i.e., under
which the contractor finances the survey, and has the right to recover its
cost by selling acquired data to the oil industry). The seismic survey is
expected to be started  in July  1992.   Following the processing and
interpretation of new data (scheduled for early 1993), the MMH will open the
area for bidding to the oil industry.
1.34      In 1979, the Government and the public Spanish oil company,
Hispanoil, entered in a joint venture agreement to create Guineo Espafiola de
Petr6leo, S.A. (GEPSA), a non-profit company, which, in the event of
hydrocarbon discovery, would distribute its respective shares to the
partners, recovering first its operating expenditures which would be charged
at cost.   Hispanoil was the operator for the joint venture.   Under the
agreement, Hispanoil would bear all exploration expenses, but following
commercial discovery, the Government would participate equally in all costs
and receipts of the contractor.
1.35      Between 1982 and 1985, GEPSA acquired seismic data and drilled six
wells, out of which two, which were located on the Alba structure, yielded
gas and light oil.   Producing sandstone, which belong to the miocene
formation Isongo, are 2,600 to 3,000 meters deep. The not pay-zone is of the
order of 120 meters. The gas oil ratio (GOR) is approximately 14,000 to
18,000 cubic feet per barrel.   The oil is light (more than 50 API).
Production per well is approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day (bopd).
Proven and probable recoverable reserves (as estimated by the current
operator) are respectively estimated at 550 and 1,000 billion cubic feet of
gas, and 25 and 28 million barrels of condensate.
1.36      Under its contract, GEPSA was to drill one more well to obtain a
two year extension of the first period of the agreement, and to declare the
commercial character of any discovered field, before the end of the seventh



- 19 -
year of the contract. The Spanish company, which by that time had changed
its name from Hispanoil to REPSOL, did not comply with any of these
contractual obligations. Reasons for the company's reluctance to maintain
any activity either in the Alba prnvisional discovery area or in the
exploration acreage were many: (i) the company contemplated very expensive
development plans (approximately US$150 million); (ii) REPSOL wanted to
amortize its past exploration expenditures (US$66 million)} (iii) the unusual
legal status of the GEPSA joint venture which was incorporated as a joint-
stock company in $quatorial Guinea made it difficult for REPSOL to attract
new partners in the project; and (iv) the Spanish company had major financial
commitments to develop bigger oil fields elsewhere in the world. After three
consecutive years of inactivity, the Government decided to avail itself of
its right to cancel, which it did on February 6, 1990.
1.37      Between 1982 and 1992, the Government received revenues from the
oil companies totalling US$7.0 million in rentals and US$4.9 million in
bonuses for a total of US$11.9 million.   This indication shows that oil
companies activities, even before production is established, may generate
significant revenue for the Government.
1.38      on May 5, 1990, a contract for the development of the Alba field
and the exploration of surrounding areas was signed by an American
independent oil company. The company drilled one well which confirmed the
extension of the Alba field; it started field development in January 1992.
Development cost was about US$36 million.  Initial production rate is at
2,500  bopd, and will progressively  reach  5,000  bopd.   Products  are
transported through a 22 mile-10 inch pipeline from the production platform
(a guyed tower) to the Bioko Island, where condensates and gas are separated.
Condensates are exported, and associated gas flared.
1.39      The company plans to drill a second development well starting June
1992. Production of this well is expected to begin in September. By this
time, field production will be 5,000 to 6,000 bopd of condensate and 80
million cubic feet of gas. The latter will include an equivalent amount of
about 2,000 barrels of LPG per day. Gas pressure at the well head is very
high (3,400 pounds per square inch-psi).   By generating low temperature
through decreasing the pressure, the company is liquefying light products
(down to CS) and blending them with condensates.   To this point, the
characteristics of the gas are such (residual pressure: 350 psi; temperature:
10 degree Fahrenheit) that butane and propane could be further separated for
an insignificant cost. Due to the lack of an identifiable market, the gas is
flared, including associated LPG.
1.40      The company's sharing agreement is a Rate of Return (RoR) based
contract, which provides that the contractor bears all expenses, and recovers
them from production revenues (cost oil). After payment of a flat "off-the-
top" expense royalty (10%), the Contractor is entitled to recover its
development  and  production  costs  from  the  remaining  revenue.    When
development costs are recovered (about three years), the contractor will pay
a 25% tax on the profit oil. The production sharing contract between the
Government and the Contractor is defined according to a formula based on the
Contractor's actual pre-tax RoR. Up to 30% RoR (reachable after a period of
approximately 6 years) Government's share rises from 30% (when the
Contractor's RoR is in the *:ange of 30 to 40%) to 80% (when Contractor's RcA
is over 80%).
1.41      Assuming a production of 5,000 bopd and an oil sale price in Bioko
of US$16 per barrel, the Government's share, initially restricted to royalty,
would be approximately US$3 million a year. During the second period, taxes
paid by the contractor would add about US$7.5 million to Government revenues
(expected date: 1995). Eventually, during a third period, the Government
would receive its share of profit oil, amounting to an additional US$8.5
million (expected datet 1996/1997).



- 20 -
1.42      This contractual regime (under which the oil company recovers its
operatiodal costs from 90% of petroleum production revenues) makes it
necessary for the Government to monitor operators' expenses accurately,
including: (a) regular auditing of oil companies exploration, duvelopment and
production expenditures; (b) verifying the cost effectiveness of their work
program; and (c) estimating the value of production and petroleum processing
facilities.
1.43      To do this it is necessary to establish a well organized data
filing system within the DH, together with a technical and financial
statistical data system.
1.44      The high proportion of the gas to be flared (about 40 mmcf a day)
led the Government to request the Association to finance a study of the
possible uses of the gas. A prefeasibility study was carried out in November
1991 under Credit 1489-EG, and resulted in the following recommendations: (a)
producing LPG from the flare stream to replace gasoline in vehicle transport
and kerosene in household uses; (b) using dry gas (i) locally, and (ii) to
produce methanol for export; and (c) obtaining from the Contractor an
increase of its diesel production (currently stripped to provide the energy
necessary to operate the plant) to meet Equatorial Guinea's present level of
consumption 1/.   However, the alternative solution to separate LPG for
export should also be explored. These products may be scid either for direct
use, or to manufacture MTBE (additive to gasoline) or methanol.   The
geographical situation and technical organization of the'inshore processing
plant, would make this process easy to put into practice. An intermediate
strategy may consist in supplying the local market with bottled butane, and
exporting the remaining LPG portion 2/. In the meantime, the Contractor is
also investigating the commercial possibility and the cost effectiveness of
building a fertilizer plant on the Island. According to the operator, China
offers a prospective market for the product.
1.45      Under the proposed credit, a feasibility study of LPG utilization
should be initially carried out in order to analyze various options--
exporting LPG, in order to generate foreign exchange resources; using LPG on
the domestic market, in order to save hard currency by replacing currently
imported products; or adapting Walter International 'a concept--and define the
least cost process to obtain maximal revenue from gas utilization.  This
feasibility study will be carried out under a Project Preparation Facility
advance which was granted by the Association on April 15, 1992.
l/ Since the gas used for energy purposes is contractually delivered at
no cost to the Government, it was agreed that diesel oil will be
stripped from crude oil (about 100 bopd) to supply fuel to domestic
consumers, essentially thermal power plants in the Island.
Vj  In Angola, a similar process is being applied: oil production is
360,000 bopd. Extracted from the associated gas, 500 bopd of butane
are sold on domestic market, the remaining 5,500 bopd are exported to
Brazil.

II. The Protect
A.        Obleotives and Rationale for IDA's Involvement
Lessons Learnt
2.1       Credit 1304-EG was successful in many ways and provided a number of
lessons which have been incorporated in the proposed project. Its components
includeds (a) technical assistance to expand petroleum promotional
activities; (b) strengthening the technical capacity of the MMH; and (c)
preparing an energy sector database, a prerequisite for sound sector planning
and policy-making.
2.2       The project was successful  from the outset as it had been
thoroughly prepared and was understood by all the parties concerned.  It
followed two UNDP projects which had resulted in a petroleum code for the
country. At closure, 80% of the sedimentary basin had been subjected to
exploration and additional seismic interpretation for the rest had been
completed. A main lesson is the varying interests of different oil companies
--in this case both large and smaller firms were active-- and the importance
of a properly coordinated promotion program cannot be overestimated. The
project was successful as it resulted in signature of a production contract,
after about six large and small companies had evaluated the prospects. The
Government implemented the project successfully and respected covenants and
other engagements. It was felt that IDA was sometimes slow in responding to
arrangements proposed by the Government. The training program was successful
as an initial program.  The proposed project is designed to extend this
technical assistance to help the Government interface with the operator.
Again, there is clear understanding of the objectives and targets of the
program and the Government has ensured that its agencies and staff have lined
up behind the program.
Rationale for IDA's Involvement
2.3       The Bank Group's involvement with Equatorial Guinea in the Energy
Sector began with the First Petroleum Exploration Project in 1983 (Credit
1304-3G). By the time this project was completed exploration contracts had
been drawn up for approximately 85% of the offshore acreage and production
from the light oil and gas Alba field was beginning to make Equatorial Guinea
an oil exporting country. The development of the Alba field will generate
major revenues for the Government and oil will become a key source of revenue
for the economic development of the country. It is therefore necessary to
exploit the oil assets conservatively and outline an expenditure and
investment program which would have the strongest impact on this development.
2.4       In order to ensure the highest revenues for the Government from
production of the Alba field, it is necessary to ensure that the highest
efficient rate of recovery is achieved. This is also generally the goal
contemplated by the oil company.  Contractors may, depending on internal
changes in their financial status or management policy, wish to obtain a
quick rate of return rather than e long-range sustained production. The
possible divergence between Government's and the oil company's strategy and
interest is illustrated by the many past experiences in West African
countries.  The gas produced by the Alba field at a current rate of 40
million cubic feet a day constitutes an energy waste for a country where the
hydrocarbon demand is met through imported fuels. The experience of the Dank
in gas utilization projects will be useful to the Government for identifying
appropriate methods of gas use for the economic development of the country.
S.        Proiect Obiectives
2.5       The main objective of the proposed credit is to assist the 10H, and
in particular the DH, to fulfill its key role in Equatorial Guinea's
macroeconomic adjustment program. It focuses on two main objectives: (a)



- 22 -
monitoring of the exploration, oil and gas field development and production
activities of oil companies in the country; and (b) identifying suitable
methods for using Alba gas either for export or as a substitute for a large
portion of imported petroleum products. The project also emphasixes: (i)
efficient control of the oil companies' activities in the petroleum
downstream subsector; and (ii) revising the contractual and fiscal framework
of petroleum activities in Equatorial Guinea. Furthermore, because of the
perceived need for an energy policy planning unit inside the Government,
given the diversity of government agencies dealing with the energy sector,
the Authorities have requested that project activities include a study of the
reorganization of the country's Energy Sector.
Environmental Aspects
2.6        The development of the Alba field presents some potential hazards
for the environment. The field's product is very light and volatile. For
this reason, any oil spill would probably dissipate quickly through
evaporation but by the same token, it would be highly flammable.   It is
therefore  necessary  to:  (a)  assess  the  environmental  impact  of  the
development of the field, with respect tos (i) pessible oil or gas leakage
which could easily trigger an extensive fire; and (ii) disposal of chemical
products possibly included in drilling waste, in order to prevent damage to
marine flora and fauna; and (b) obtains (i) recommendations to minimize
identified risks for the environment; and (ii) an action plan based on study
recommendations with a timetable for implementation.
C.        Proiect Descrintion
2.7       Consulting services will be complemented by a training program,
including: (a) instruction sessions organized in Malabo by expatriates; and
(b) overseas training comprising scholarship and on-the-spot training, which
will enable the MM  staff to progressively take over monitoring of oil
companies' activities in the upstream and downstream subsectors within a
period of three to four years without any further external technical
assistance.   This training program would also include scholarships in a
Petroleum University for two selected graduated Equato-Guinean engineers in
the field of petroleum development and production. MMH staff capability will
also be reinforced in the field of petroleum products supply and distribution
through courses provided by specialized universities, and on-the-spot
training  in  petroleum  storage  and  refining  plants.    Before  Board
presentation, the MNH will present a detailed training action plan, focusing
on the objectives to be reached, and detailing cost effective ways to reach
them.
2.8       The project focuses on providing technical assistance to the DR.
The components are the followings
Cateaory 1: Consultants
(a) Consulting Services in technical areass (i) monitoring the
production from the Alba field, particularly during the discussion
with the operator of the annual production program (recruitment of
a production engineer and a rozervoir specialist will be required);
(ii) monitoring of petroleum upstream activities (both a
geophysicist and a well-site geologist will be hired for this
purpose); (iii) controlling petroleum downstream activities. This
will include revising the product pricing formula and the
procurement process; and (iv) identifying the most cost effective
method to utilize the gas produced by the Alba field, and assisting
the Government in carrying out the adopted recommendations;
(b) Consulting services in financial areas: (i) auditing operational
expenditures of oil companies; (ii) evaluating production
facilities constructed by the Contractor for developing the Alba



- 23 -
field; and (iii) setting a fiscal regime for petroleum product's
import and export;
(c) Consulting Services in legal areas: (i) revising the current legal
and  contractual  framework  for  exploration  and  production
activities; and (ii) assisting the Government in negotiating
contracts with oil companies;
(d) Consulting services to improve the institutional organization of
the Energy Sector and to organize a technical and financial filing
system within the MMH, as well as a statistical process which is
necessary for energy planning; and
(a) Consulting Services to carry out a study of the environmental
impact of the production of the Alba field and the processing of
its effluent, and preparing appropriate recommendations and an
action plan for its implementation.
Total consulting  services  are estimated at  85 man-months.   Although
consultants may be hired for a longer period, their stays in Malabo will not
exceed two months at any one time.
Cateaory 2: Trainina
2.9       A training action plan will be presented by the Government before
Board presentation. It will be organized in accordance with the principles
mentioned above: (a) training by expatriates provided in Malabo; (b)
cooperation with the operations of oil companies in the country; (c)
scholarship in an appropriate University for three selected MMH engineers
(production); (d) theoretical and on-the spot training to four or five NMH
engineers (products' supply and distribution); and (e) training sessions in
modern technology in the petroleum upstream subsector.
Cateaorv 3: Office and Field Eauipment
2.10      This category will cover the followings (a) the rehabilitation of
the MMH building, which was constructed under the First Petroleum T.A Credit,
(during heavy rain water enters the computer room through the roof); and (b)
cars will be provided to enable MM0  staff to carry out the monitoring of the
petroleum downstream subsector.
D.        Prolect 1Mul2mentation
Status of Project Preparation
2.11      Consultants have carried out an in-depth study of the petroleum
products supply and distribution mechanism in the country, a good preliminary
study of the Alba gas utilization potential, and a prefeasibility study of
Alba gas utilization.   Consultants' studies were reviewed by the Bank.
Furthermore, since the Bank played a decisive role in attracting the operator
to the Alba field, and keeps a close contact with it, it is well aware of
which kind of specialists are needed by the NWH to monitor the development of
the Alba field. The proposed Petroleum T.A. Credit was appraised in March
1992.
2.12      The Project, and mainly the legal documents -- i.e., the Project
Agreements and other letters -- were negotiated in Washington on May 20 and
21, 1992.
2.13      Terms of reference were agreed during negotiations, including for
consultants who will be in charge of: (a) defining the production process
resulting in the maximum rate of recovery for the Alba field; (b) carrying
out a feasibility study of Alba gas utilization; (c) monitoring the petroleum
exploration activities of the oil companies; (d) reorganizing of the Energy



- 24 -
Sector; and (e) evaluating the environmental impact of the Alba field, and
preparing appropriate recommendations.
The Executing Agency
2.14      Within the MMR, petroleum activities in the country are controlled
by the Directorate of Hydrocarbons (DH).  The DH would be the executing
agency for implementing the proposed Second Petroleum Technical Assistance
Credit. Beside the DR manager, who is himself a petroleum engineer, the
technical staff within the DU consists of three geologists, one geophysicist
and about ten specialists in drilling and production. DH staff is taking
advantage of the exploration and production activities in the country, to
strengthen its technical capacity and expertise, but still needs external
technical assistance in the petroleum upstream sector.  In addition, the
dispersion of monitoring of various energy sources (such as petroleum,
electricity, and fuelwood, see paras. 1.12 to 1.14 above) between different
Ministries, makes it impossible to elaborate a much needed energy policy. On
the request of the Government, a study of the reorganization of the energy
sector will therefore also be included in the proposed project.
2 15      Although MMR has improved its capacity to supervise and regulate
the sector in recent years, it still requires strengthening. Major areas
requiring improvement are: (a) all stages of development and production
(primary, secondary, and tertiary); (b) supervision of the oil companies in
the downstream petroleum subsector, particularly with regard to safety and
environmental protection of product storage and transport facilities, and
product quality control; and (c) monitoring of exploration activities.  IDA
provided support in these areas under Credit 1304-EG (in particular in the
area of oil exploration) but much remains to be done, particularly as the
Alba field is now moving into its implementation phase. IDA has developed a
close dialogue with the Government and is well placed as the lead donor in
the sector to assist the Government in improving its regulatory and policy
capacity in the energy sector.
2.16      The experience acquired during the first petroleum TA Credit has
shown that DR regularly met Credit covenants. However, the DR did not
always volunteer to inform the Bank about its relationship with oil
companies. Smooth as the implementation of the project may be expected to
be, it will require close supervision. Furthermore, many of the DH staff
have taken the maximal advantage from the training program which was provided
under the first petroleum TA Credit. It may be consequently expected that
one of the main goals of the project--namely, to provide further appropriate
training of the DH staff to enable them to take over by themselves their
monitoring assignment--should be reached within a three to four year period.
2.17      Tj:e DR will prepare quarterly reports which will highlight various
indications for monitoring project implementation (a list of main indicators
for the implementation of the project is given in para. 2.19 below).
Assurances will be sought that the DH will submit to the Bank for reviewt (a)
copies of all consultants' reports and studies financed under the project;
and (b) a Project Completion Report within six months of project completion.
Furthermore, the DH will agree to carry out all sub-components of the project
in accordance with Bank's guidelines.
2.18      The project implementation period covers four years.  A mid-term
review meeting will be held by June 20, 1994 to assess the status of
implementation of the project. Variances from the initial work program will
be analyzed, and progress in approaching the project's objectives--namely,
the adequate rate of Alba field production and its appropriate development
method, and the most suitable utilization of the LPG extracted from the gas
flared--will be examined. If necessary, appropriate measures will be taken
to put the project back on track. Target is to have the DH implement its
assigned task without further technical assistance by the end of the project.

B.        Finacla
3.2       The amount of credit granted by the Association is US$2.43
million.  The total cost of the project is estimated at US$2.7 million
equivalent (net of taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of
86%. Credit is granted under standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40
years. Government's share in funding the project (10%) will finance 67% of
estimated local costs. Since the Credit is granted to the sole MMH, no on-
lending is required. Breakdown between local and foreign costs is shown

3.5       Disbursements will follow the schedule of the work program
implemented by the oil companies. Disbursements will start early and will
be gradually streamlined during the course of the project:
Table 6: 3stimated Disbursements
IDA FT            1992                   1994        199S        1996

3.6       Disbursements will be made against full Bank documentation except
for contracts not exceeding US$20,000, disbursements will be made on the
basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs). In order to ensure the timely
availability of funds to finance the costs of overseas training to be
financed under the Project, the MMH will establish a separate Special
Deposit Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the Association. An
initial deposit of about US$50,000 equivalent will be made from the credit
account.
De        Accountina and Auditina
3.7       From the start of the project and throughout its implementation,
the DR will maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect, in
accordance with consistently maintained sound accounting practices, the
expenditures financed out of the proceeds of the Credit.
3.8       The Credit accounts, together with the Project Account and the
Special Account (see para. 3.4 above) will be audited annually by an audit
company acceptable to IDA, and the audit report for each calendar year will
be presented to the Bank within six months after the end of the calendar
year concerned.

s.    Rnumas&t
3.9       All procurement under the project, with the exception of the
supply of equipment, will be for consulting services, technical assistance
and training, and will be in acc¢ordance with Bank guidelines. Terms of
reference, letters of invitation, short lists of firms or individual
consultants, and draft contracts will be subject to prior IDA review. The
DH acquired solid experience during implementation of the first petroleum
TA Credit, in recruiting consultants and procuring equipment in accordance
with Bank's directives. No issues are subsequently expected to show up in
this domain during the implementation of the second petroleum TA Credit.
Furthermore, Bank's guidelines for hiring consultants and procuring
equipment were reviewed during appraisal. Rehabilitation of the mm1
building will be done by LCB (US$O.1 million). Vehicles will be procured
only after receiving bids from at least three suppliers (US$0.04 million).
IV. Project Justification and Risks
A.        Proie¢t igLtlfi¢ation
4.1       From a macroeconomic point of view, the proposed project
represents the most logical and needed investment in the Equatorial Guinea
petroleum subsector. It would ensure maximizing Government's revenue from
the subsector by (a) obtaining a maximum recovery from the Alba oil and gas
field; (b) utilizing associated gas rather than flaring it; and (c) closing
all financial loopholes in the petroleum products supply and distribution
system. Furthermore, through the project, the Government would obtain the
Bank's assistance in outlining an expenditure program for revenues derived
from Alba condensates production.
4.2       From an institutional point of view, the proposed petroleum TA
Credit will: (a) improve the organizational framework of the Energy Sector;
and (b) strengthen the technical capacity of the DH staff in all petroleum
related matters, from upstream activities such as seismic data acquisition
or crude oil processing, to downstream operations such as distribution of
petroleum products in the provinces, This may progressively build up a
petroleum cell within the ministry able to assist the Government in
controlling the whole petroleum operational cycle in the country.
so        Financial Return
4.3       A significant return cannot be defined as far as the monitoring
of the Alba field is concerned, since the project deals with incremental
earnings on diversely estimated revenues. It may be pointed out, however,
that a 1% increase in the rate of recovery of condensates from the ALBA
field would represent more than the cost of the second petroleum T.A.
project.
4.4       Conversely, the proposed project will assist in identifying a
suitable method to utilize the associated gas of Alba field. The financial
return of LPG exporting was evaluated under the following assumptions: (a)
the cost of building facilities, forecast for 1993, was evaluated at US$3
million; (b) LPG production was assumed to be 2,000 bopd from 1993 onward;
and (c) FOB sale price for LPG was estimated at US$12 per barrel. Under
these assumptions, the financial rate of return of this gas utilization
project is expected to be more than 100%.
C.          roect Risks
4C5       The major risk is inherent to all petroleum exploration and
development activities, namely that initial expectations regarding
recoverable reserves and production rate of Alba field should be proven



- 30 -
wrong. However, the risk is minor, since three oil and gas wells have
already been drilled on the ALBA anticline, and that well-head pressure was
maintained since production was started. Another type of risk is the
Government's non-compliance with an agreement to enter Alba field revenues
in to the annual budget, to be reviewed periodically with the Bank.
D.        Agreements Reached
4.6       The Government has presented a Declaration of Principles,
regarding its energy sector policy; and a training program for the DR staff
based on the principles highlighted in para. 2.7 above. It includes names
of staff concerned, objectives, methods, location, program period, and
cost. Those receiving training abroad should stay in their job for at
least 3 years.
4.7       The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(a) starting with FY 1993, the Government will enter all revenues
derived from the exploitation of the ALBA field or other
hydrocarbon accumulations into the annual budget, and this
process will be discussed with IDA and IMF on a regular basis;
(b) the Government will select consultants to carry out: (i) a
feasibility study of the gas utilization program; and (ii) an
independent study to establish the optimal program for
development of Alba gas and condensate field;
(c) The Government will prepare an action plan based on
recommendations of studies mentioned above, with a timetable for
its implementation not later than November 30, 1992;
(d) The Government has presented terms of reference for the
consultants who will prepare or implement the different
components;
(e) The Government has agreed to finance 10% of the cost of the
project;
-  (f)  The Government has agreed to have a Project account, acting as a
revolving fund, in which will be deposited the counterpart
financel
(g) The Government will carry out an environmental impact study of
production of the Alba field, review recommendations and agree
on an action plan and a timetable for its implementation with IDA
before January 15, 1993;
(h) The Government has agreed to hold a mid-term review with IDA, in
accordance with para. 2.18 above; and
(i) The MMH will appoint National counterparts prior to the hiring of
any technical assistance.
4.8       Effectiveness conditions will include the following:
(a) the Government has selected consultants which will be contracted
to assist in implementing the project; and
(b) the Government has established a special project account for
entering its share of credit funding on an annual basis and has
made an initial deposit of US$15,000 equivalent in local
currency.

REPUBLXC OF 8OUATORThL GUINEA
SECOND PrEROgLU TECEMICAL ASS!XTANCE PROJEcr
Schedule 2: Trainina Plan
1.          The Directorate of Hydrocarbon (DH) includes, beside its
Director, who is a petroleum engineer, one geophysicist, three
geologists, and about ten specialists in drilling and production.
However, the activities carried out by the DH staff, and the training it
received, were concentrated during the last decade on exploration
activities: seismic surveys and well drilling. The Minister and the
Director of the DH were from time to time consulted by the Government
about product supply and distribution issues, such as modification of
retail prices. Prior to the production of the Alba field, in January
1992, the DH had never been exposed to field development issues.
2.          The monitoring of the Alba field production requires
expertise in field development. Also the DH needs expertise in the
downstream petroleum sector, which will be reformed under the proposed
credit. The experience acquired by the DH in exploration activities
enables it to perform routine control of the petroleum upstream
subsector.
3.          The training action plan will take into account both the
current DH human resources and its required technical capacity. It will
emphasize the petroleum production area, and, to a lesser extent, the
petroleum downstream subsector. It will include attendance at seminars
or participation in short courses in modern exploration technology.
4.          The training program will include: (a) instruction sessions
organized in Malabo by: (i) consultants hired to carry out various
components of the project who also will be attentive on transfer of
technology; and (ii) specialists who will be contracted purposedly to
teach the DH personal various aspects in petroleum related technology;
and (b) training overseas of selected DH staff members. Expatriate
professors will assist the DH in: (i) selecting the staff members who
will receive overseas training; and (ii) organizing the overseas
training program implementation.
5.          Overseas instruction will include: (a) training in petroleum
development comprising one-year scholarships for three selected local
engineers in an appropriate university: and (b) instruction in supply
and distribution through attendance at short seminars, and on-the-spot
training in petroleum depots in Africa or West Europe. Furthermore, DH
knowledge in exploration techniques will be updated according to the
timetable and program of training seminars organized by specialized
universities or exploration companies.
6.          Before the arrival in Malabo of consultants in charge of
carrying out various components of the project program, the DH will
designate local counterparts who will be associated to the
implementation of the consultants' tasks throughout their execution.

A.          Reporting Requirements
Project implementation will be monitored to record progress.
made, identifying any corrective action that may required in respect of
individual components. Reporting is the responsibility of the
Directorate of Hydrocarbons (DH). Reports will be prepared quarterly
and will comprise a financial section recapitulating project
expenditures, and a section assessing the progress of each of the
programmed activities included in the project.
B.          Supervision Plan
At the start of the project, the adequate supervision of the
project will require three missions per year. After about the first
year, twice yearly Bank missions should allow for adequate supervision
of the project. A mission in 1994 would perform a mid-term review. A
last mission in 1996 or 1997 would prepare the Project Completion Report
(PCR).
