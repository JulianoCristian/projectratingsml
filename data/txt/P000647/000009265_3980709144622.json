Some of the lessons\n            learned from the project are: (a) the need for an\n            unequivocal understanding of, and agreement on, project\n            objectives; (b) the need for openness on the part of the\n            Borrower in sharing sector information with the Bank and\n            with consultants for assistance to be effective; (c) the\n            need, when project management capacity is limited, to\n            include assistance for this purpose in the project; and (d)\n            the recognition that the modernization of Ministry of Mines\n            and Energy (MMEs') structures and systems should have\n            been given a higher priority."}, "docdt": "1998-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
