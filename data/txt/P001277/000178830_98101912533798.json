needs of Kenya's farmers more\n            effectively. Target clients would be commercial farmers who\n            can demonstrate their ability to increase their farm\n            productivity and to meet the related financial obligations,\n            including farmers who have not had previous access to other\n            sources of institutional credit. (a) Strengthening\n            AFC's general management and administrative\n            capabilities by: (i) establishing a Corporate Planning\n            Department; (ii) reorganizing the Finance Division; (iii)\n            increasing the number of loan officers; (iv) appointing an\n            accounts officer in each branch; and (v) improving\n            AFC's branch services and facilities. (b) Improving AFC\n            training and staff development by introducing programs for:\n            (i) credit training; (ii) staff performance improvement;\n            (iii) career development; and (iv) continuing training. (c)\n            Providing credit to assist in financing AFC's lending program."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
