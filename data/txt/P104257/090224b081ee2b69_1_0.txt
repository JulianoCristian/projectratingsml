                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is: within a fragile context, to promote a coordinated development approach which builds the capacity of communities to plan for and
                         manage development resources. The key indicators for project success include:
                         a)      percentage of activities identified through the Area Development Plans that receive funding from other sources;

                         b)         percentage of projects with economically and/or socially marginalized groups as main beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
