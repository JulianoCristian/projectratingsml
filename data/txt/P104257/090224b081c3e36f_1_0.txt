                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is: within a fragile context, to promote a coordinated development approach which builds the capacity of communities to plan for and
                         manage development resources. The key indicators for project success include:
                         a)      percentage of activities identified through the Area Development Plans that receive funding from other sources;

                         b)         percentage of projects with economically and/or socially marginalized groups as main beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         1 and 2) is 215; (ii) the project has mobilized an additional US$28 million from other funding sources as communities promoted Community Development Plans (CDPs) prepared and
                         updated under the project. The project is expected to close on time on October 31, 2013. All other Project Outcome Indicators are either fully achieved or surpassed. Moreover,
                         towards achieving a coordinated development approach, the Palestinian Authority has allocated around US$5 million from local resources towards a Village Development Program.

                         Consequently, the Ministry of Local Government has sought the input of the World Bank in designing such a Program to address capacity building of village councils and
                         infrastructure development for villages in the West Bank. An on-going Technical Assistance activity financed from additional Bank resources will help the Ministry develop a more
                         comprehensive approach to village development.
