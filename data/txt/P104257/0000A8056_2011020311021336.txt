                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is: within a fragile context, to promote a coordinated development approach which builds the capacity of communities to
                         plan for and manage development resources. The key indicators for project success include:
                         a)       percentage of activities identified through the Area Development Plans that receive funding from other sources;

                         b)         percentage of projects with economically and/or socially marginalized groups as main beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         identified through the VNDP planning process have also been financed by other Donors. The period between sub-project identification and implementation has, however, been

                         during the recent Supervision Mission (Dec 6 - 14, 2010) to examine the possibility of compressing the implementation cycle under Cycle II. Also, it is unclear, if the project had,

                         process, which was a sector goal of the project. The Project will undergo a full evaluation during the upcoming Mid Term Evaluation planned for March 2011.
