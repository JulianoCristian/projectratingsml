                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is: within a fragile context, to promote a coordinated development approach which builds the capacity of communities to plan for and
                         manage development resources. The key indicators for project success include:
                         a)      percentage of activities identified through the Area Development Plans that receive funding from other sources;

                         b)         percentage of projects with economically and/or socially marginalized groups as main beneficiaries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is progressing well towards meeting the Development Objective (DO). A recent restructuring (approved in March 2012) has extended the Closing Date for additional 18-

                         months, which compensates for the cumulative implementation delays and gives sufficient time for the completion of project remaining activities. The restructuring also confirmed
                         changes in the wording of selected project indicators of success to enable a better measurement of the DO. Hence the DO is expected to be met within the revised project timeframe.
                         The two key indicators for project success are above their targets: (i) 59% of implemented sub-projects benefit women, youth and other marginalized groups (target was 50%), and
                         youth and women represented 31% and 46%, respectively, of active Project Support Groups (targets were 20% and 30% respectively).(ii) the project has also mobilized an additional

                         delays, only 4 out of 124 sub-projects under Cycle 1 are still on-going and nearly completed. Cycle 2 was launched in December 2011, and implementation is in accordance with the
                         agreed workplan.
