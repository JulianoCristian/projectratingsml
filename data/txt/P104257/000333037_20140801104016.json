West Bank and Gaza were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            Community-Driven Development, or CDD approach can\n            effectively assure involvement of women and youth in a\n            patriarchal society, but success depends on the right\n            incentives and regular monitoring. However, future efforts\n            must seek to maintain the quality of their roles and\n            contributions, including extending their active\n            participation through the subproject implementation and\n            operation phase. Maintaining achievements especially for\n            women is essential in future interventions, through support\n            for women groups to engage in institution-building. Delivery\n            of public goods and joint service provision should be scaled\n            up in the follow-on operation and linked to\n            institution-building. This will be crucial to achieve\n            economies of scale and making inroads in the infrastructure\n            deficit in poor communities while considering\n            sustainability. The project cycle could be further\n            simplified and time needed for administrative matters\n            shortened by reducing approval layers and revisiting the\n            OC's role and contractual modality. The engagement of\n            OCs has generally added great value. In some areas, however,\n            the OC engagement may have added complexity to\n            communication, prolonged approval reviews, and paper work\n            for communities. The new program should take stock of the\n            capacity built in VNDP beneficiary communities and need for\n            a differentiated process and intensive hand-holding to\n            isolated villages that have never received any CDD support."}, "docdt": "2014-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
