 AGRICULTURAL SERVICES", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Despite satisfactory project outcomes, a\n            likely sustainability, and substantial institutional\n            development impacts, both the Bank and Borrower performances\n            are rated unsatisfactory, given a shared, flawed quality at\n            entry, unnecessary delays (and possibly missed\n            opportunities) in redesigning the project by the Bank, as\n            well as delayed counterpart funding, counter-productive\n            restructuring of the agricultural ministries, and slow\n            implementation of institutional changes by the Borrower.\n            Nonetheless, satisfactory performance after restructuring\n            contributed to achieve success. The negative factors are\n            addressed in the many lessons that follow. Supressive\n            internal professional debates may have indirectly,\n            contributed to, and in detriment of the quality of project\n            design. Instead, the management of the Bank must protect the\n            intellectual space for staff members to disagree\n            professionally, and to act on their best professional\n            judgment. To this end, design of follow-up projects should\n            reflect lessons of prior projects. However, the prompt and\n            decisive restructuring, in response to changes in the\n            institutional framework, and country circumstances,\n            prevented the potential project failure. This is\n            demonstrated by the decentralization of extension services,\n            which combined with a move toward a participatory\n            demand-driven public, and private extension system, improved\n            the effectiveness and affordability of services. However,\n            the continued public funding for agricultural extension is\n            appropriate when the information conveyed has features of a\n            public good, and when the users of information are not able\n            to purchase optimal quantities through private transactions.\n            Other lessons address effective production, and\n            communication of agricultural information as an important\n            mean to transfer knowledge for production; and, information,\n            to be conveyed through the agricultural extension system, to\n            enhance economic, and technical decisions."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
