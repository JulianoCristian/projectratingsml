The project, which will be implemented in 16\n            regions of mainland Tanzania, will consist of four main\n            components: (1) institutional strengthening of extension and\n            field services as well as additional provision of equipment;\n            (2) extension education and training, including: staff\n            training, farmer training, training institutes, and training\n            coordination; (3) communications support in the\n            decentralization of information management to the Zonal\n            level; and (4) pilot initiatives to improve extension\n            management, technology transfer, inter-linkages between\n            farmer-extension-research, participation of other providers\n            in extensions delivery, seeds production and input supply,\n            farmer empowerment, and gender impact."}, "docdt": "1996-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
