NUCLEUS ESTATES SMALLHOLDER I PROJECT
The Indonesian Rubber Industry
1.         There has been considerable, although fragmented, study of the
Indonesian rubber industry during the past several years. The vast smallholder
area, however, has not been extensively surveyed but available data are suffi-
cient to assess the existing conditions in the industry.
Structure of Tree Crop Production
2.         Tree crops provide the major agricultural export produce of Indonesia,
presently (1974) achieving about $250 million annually in foreign exchange earn-
ings. The total area of the major tree crops, rubber, coconuts, coffee, oil palms,
tea and cloves is estimated to be about 4.5 million ha./I Rubber and coconuts
with 2.3-2.4 million and 1.7 million ha respectively, occupy about 80% of this
area.
Structure of the Rubber Industry
3.         The industry is dominated in both area and volume of production by
smallholder operators. The estimated total area of smallholder rubber is about
1.8 million ha located almost entirely in Sumatera (1.35 million ha) and Kalimantan
(0.45 million ha)./2 Within Sumatera, almost 1.3 million ha of the above area is
found in the four provinces of North Sumatera, Riau, Jambi and South Sumatera.
Within Kalimantan, 0.30 million ha of smallholder rubber is in the province of
Kalimantan Barat. Over 90% of smallholder rubber therefore, is located in these
five provinces. The estimated total production of smallholder rubber in 1974 was
573 million tons. Historically, increased production has been the outcome of
expansion of the rubber area. The average yield of smallholder rubber is very
low and estimated to be about 350-400 kg/ha/annum./l The age distribution of
these plantings cannot be readily determined. However, the area of smallholder
rubber was recorded as 0.7 million ha in 1940 and 1.3 million ha in 1950. There-
fore, in 1976, about 0.7 million ha was at least 36 years old and a further
0.6 million ha at least 26 years old. As a result of smallholder conditions of
exploitation and on the basis of surveys already carried out, this area of some
1.3 million ha, appears to be generally in urgent need of replanting. This total
may be reduced somewhat by an estimated replanting rate of 15,000 to 20,000 ha
per year from 1950 onwards. This replanting, however, is unlikely to have a
major influence on yield levels, in that, in common with existing plantings, the
quality of planting material was low, density of planting was much too high,
standards of maintenance have been poor, fertilizer has not been applied and in
the interest of immediate income, smallholders have been unable to resist the
temptation to overtap, with drastic consequences for yield and tree life.
/1 1974 IBRD Agricultural Sector Survey.
/2 Historically, much of the smallholder rubber development was the result of
shifting cultivation where trees were planted after one or two annual crops,
before moving elsewhere.

4.        As stated above, average smallholder rubber yields are of the order
of 350-400 kg/ha, with an average holding size of 1.5 - 2 ha. (Over one mil-
lion families, therefore are engaged directly in the production of smallholder
rubber.) Typically, rubber accounts for 80% of farm size./L Frequently, rubber
smallholders also grow rice and in some areas, a second cash crop such as coffee,
pepper or cloves. Indonesian rubber smallholders are a low income group with
little oDportunity for improvement. It has been estimated that in Sumatera, the
700,000 poorest families with rubber areas of one ha or less, receive a maximum
cash income of US$100 per annum, assuming a mean yield of 400 kg/ha and a farm-
gate price of Rp 100/kg for dry rubber./2 Smallholder tappers work at a very
low level of productivity, frequently harvesting only about 3-4 kg rubber per
day. Taking account of the one million smallholder rubber farm operators and
also of those employed in clearing new land for rubber planting, as well as tapping
labor, and processing, marketing and estate workers, it has been estimated that
some 10 million people in Indonesia derive the major part of their earnings from
rubber./3
5.        The quality of the smallholder rubber product is extremely poor due to
lack of attention to basic practices of cleanliness. Latex is frequently allowed
to drip into dirty collection cups or into a hole in the ground and during primary
on-farm processing the product is further contaminated. This poor quality product
requires additional processing to remove considerable quantities of soil and
other foreign matter. This is generally carried out in large block or remilling
rubber plants, owned by processors/marketers and adapted to deal with low quality
rubber. Due to the low quality product, the need for additional processing,
various taxes and levies, poor infrastructure and the consequent large number
of transporters and mi'dlemen, farmers generally receive as little as 30-50%
of the fob price of their rubber. Because of the low quality of the primary
product, around 90% of smallholder rubber is exported in the SIR 20 and 50 grades.
The imposts borne by the smallholder include an export tax and local taxes and
levies. The level of taxation was reduced in early 1976 through alteration of
the export tax from 10% to 5% of the fob price and removal of the rubber cess
of 1 Rp/kg.
6.        The estates component of the rubber industry amounting to about 0.5 mil-
lion ha is located largely in the provinces of North Sumatra (50%) and West Java
(25%). Estate average yields vary greatly, ranging from 500-1, 300 kg/ha, de-
pending upon the extent of rehabilitation from the low levels reached during
the political difficulties of the early and mid-sixties. Total estate yearly
production amounts to about 245 m tons. Rubber estates generally employ about
one laborer per 2.5 ha and consequently the number of full-time laborers in the

estate component of the industry approximates to 100,000 persons.  Estates
generally use modern processing techniques and export a high quality product
through their own marketing organizations. The estates component of the in-
dustry comprises the public sector estates (45%), private Indonesian owned
estates (35%) and private foreign estates (20%).
7.        Institutions.  The Ministry of Agriculture provides regulatory and
extension services to tree crop smallholders and to private estates, through
one of its five Directorate Generals, the Directorate General of Estates,/1
and the Provincial Smallholder Estates Service, responsible to the Provincial
Governor. Finance, facilities and manpower are small in relation to the size
of the task and generally the services provided are inadequate. The Ministry
of Trade, under Presidential Decree No. 85, 1971, has responsibility for
research into the quality of the rubber product and for specifying quality
standards for Indonesian rubber exports. In addition, this Ministry is
charged with the responsibility for improvement of the trade structure of
smallholder rubber and for consumption research. Under the same decree, the
Ministry of Industry has responsibility for development of processing techni-
ques appropriate to required quality standards, for licensing of processing
facilities and for control of the conversion of existing processing plants
to block rubber processing. The public sector estates are responsible to
the Ministry of Agriculture. Several associations of producers and processors,
such as the West Java Estates Syndicate and the Indonesian Rubber Association,
exist and Indonesia is a member of the various international rubber organi-
zations designed to improve the competitive position of natural rubber.
However, the industry is not self-sufficient for its own affairs. There is
no single authoritative body such as a Natinoal Rubber Board, representing
both Government and the industry, and charged with ensuring the efficient
development of the industry in all its aspects. Although rubber replanting
on a large scale is urgent and economically justified, there is not a sepa-
rate national organization with the sole responsibility for administering
rubber replanting programs.
Government Intervention in the Subsector
8.        GOI intervenes in the subsector in four broad categories of actions:
(a) First, the provision of national support services of a research,
extension and regulatory nature. The impact of these services
is not large, as the means to execute well-planned programs on
a sufficient scale is lacking.
(b) The second category involves marketing policies designed to raise
the quality of the exported product. Again, there is little impact
at smallholder level, as smallholder production is small in quantity
1  In Indonesia, the term estates comprises large estates and smallholdings
planted with tree crops.



ANNEX 2
Section 1
Page 4
and because of product quality, marketing arrangements and poor
communications, smaliholders generally receive only a small
proportion of the fob price.
(c) The third category is taxation, involving several crop and land
taxes on rubber production which amount to about 17% of the fob
value. Apart from the small rubber cess component of the taxa-
tion, virtually none of the taxes collected have been returned
to the industry for financing development.
(d) The fourth category is the implementation of a number of
locally and externally financed area intensive projects for
rehabilitation/replanting on public sector estates and new
planting/replanting in smallholder areas.
9.        Development Projects and Plans.  The public sector estates have a
program of continuing rehabilitation and replanting. Assuming a replanting
rate of about 3% per annum, the area replanted annually by this component of
the industry would only amount to some 6,000-7,000 ha. The extent of replanting
by the other active member of this component, the private foreign estates,
would, on a similar basis, not amount to much more than 3,000 ha annually.
In the smallholder sector, only two large-scale projects in North and West
Sumatra, comprising planting of some 22,000 ha over five or six years are
fully underway. Other smallholder projects, now being initiated or under
preparation, encompass about 100,00 ha spread over the next five to six
years. Just for output after 1983 to maintain present levels of exports, it
is estimated that a very large program of new plantings of 100,000 ha per
annum, in the next eight years is necessary. The above program clearly falls
far short of this target.

NUCLEUS ESTATES SMALLHOLDER I PROJECT
The Public Sector Estates Industry
History
1.        The Indonesian Estate Industry is dominated by the government-owned
industry which comprises a planted area of some 645,000 ha.  These estates were
formerly owned by foreign companies, mainly from the Netherlands, and were
nationalized in 1958. From that time until 1969, the estate companies were
reorganized on several occasions, which in itself led to a decline in efficiency.
Estate operations were further impeded and retarded by the extreme political and
financial difficulties of the early and mid-sixties, with the inevitable con-
sequence that yields declined to a fraction of their former levels, perennial
tree crops were seriously over exploited, replanting was badly executed and
maintenance of fields, processing facilities, other fixed assets and trans-
portation facilities virtually ceased. With a few exceptions, estates were
seriously debilitated and recovery was bound to be a long slow process, con-
sidering the nature of tree crops. In 1968, the estates were reorganized into
28 groups, based on location, crop and size, of Perusahaan Negara Perkebunan
(PNP's) or State-Owned Estate Enterprises responsible to a BCU (later BKU) or
Badan Khusus Umum, the Special Board for the Affairs of the PNP, chaired by
the Minister of Agriculture with the Director General of Estates as vice
chairman and chief executive. This reorganization marked the start of a new
era in the life of the estates and the problems in terms of managing, staffing
and financing the recovery operations were enormous in scale.
Industry Statistics
2.        The planted area broken down by Estate Group location and crop is
in Table 1. The government-owned Estate Groups are widely dispersed from
Aceh to the Moluccas, but there are large concentrations in North Sumatra,
West Java and East Java. (The bulk of the Aceh area is of natural pine
forest totally different in operation from the traditional tropical plan-
tation venture.) There is a wide ecological range in estate growing condi-
tions in terms of sunshine, rainfall, temperature, elevation, topography and
soil quality. The consequence is an unusual variety of crops which can be
successfully grown - in order of hectarage, and excluding pines, these are -
rubber, oil palms, sugar, tea, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, coconuts, hard fibers,
cloves, kapok, quinine, cashew, citronella, nutmeg, guttapercha and cinammon.
Indonesian estates have several comparative advantages in cultivation of
these crops compared with other countries. The total quatity of production
is given in Table 2 for the period 1970-74. In 1974, the value of these
Estate Group exports amounted to about US$296 million, the value of production
sold locally was about US$200 million (Tables 3(a) and (b)). The data show
large increases in oil palm and sugar and smaller increases in rubber, tea
and coffee production since 1970. Table 4 provides data on yield per hectare
for each Estate Group during the 1968-74 period. The 1968-69 data are
probably inaccurate and rubber yields in the 1968-71 period are higher than
they should have been, because of overtapping; nevertheless, the data reveal



ANNEX 2
Section 2
Page 2
the steady although slow, progress which has taken place. Yields are still,
however, well below the levels currently reached on progressive estates in
Malaysia, where average annual mature area yields of 1,700 kg rubber/ha and
four to five tons palm oil/ha are frequently achieved. Such yields were
obtained in Indonesia in the fifties on the best estates and future yields of
these crops, if the best technology is used, could be 50% larger than the
above Malaysian yields. Similarly, very large further increases in sugar,
tea and coffee yields are possible.
3.        These Estate Groups are important employers of labor and employ
some 462,000 staff and labor (Table 5). Some two million Indonesians are,
therefore, directly dependent upon the Estate Groups. In 1974, the total
government-owned Estate Group investment program was approximately US$100
million; in 1975, US$140 million.
External Assistance to the Public Sector Estates
4.        The first external assistance credits did not begin to influence
performance until 1970. Generally, great progress has been made in terms of
physical and technical achievement in the groups receiving external assistance
(Table 6). The groups not receiving such assistance progressed much more
slowly. Assistance to these groups is necessary and generally there is a
need with all groups to devote much more attention to overall development
policies, to corporate business objectives such as evaluation of investment
proposals, coordination of investments between Estate Groups, improvement in
financial management, strengthening of marketing organizations and centraliza-
tion of specialist advisory services.
Organizational Structure of the Public Sector Estates
5.        The 28 PNP Estate Groups were responsible to the BKU in Jakarta.
The BKU had four distinct representatives with a small staff in the main
regions and located in Medan, Bandung, Semarang and Sourabaja. These few
offices were intended to have a supervisory and coordinating function but
have tended to be bypassed by the Estate Groups who dealt directly with
Jakarta. Government policy is that PNP's be converted into Perseroan
Terbatas Perkebunan (PTP), limited liability companies, operating under
the Indonesian Commercial Code. The objectives in this conversion were
that the PTP's should operate as fully commercial entities rather than as
quasi-government departments and that any contribution made by the PTP's
towards fulfillment of government policy would not reduce the profitability
of commercial operations. The majority of the PNP's have now been converted
and under their statutes, have a two tier board structure with an upper
Dewan Komisaris (Supervisory Board) and a lower Direksi (Management Board).
The PTP's are responsible to the Shareholders Meeting, which is chaired
by the Minister of Agriculture. The Management Board has considerable
autonomy in day-to-day operation but policy, investment programs, budgets,
payment of dividends and allocations to reserves require the approval of
the Shareholders Meeting. The Shareholders Meeting makes major staff appoint-
ments and monitors progress of the PTP's along with the Directorate of Perseros

(PTP's and other PT's) in the Ministry of Finance. The transition from
PNP to PTP has been in progress since 1971 and will continue for a further
one to two years. In this transitional period, the BKU has executive respon-
sibilities to the PNP's and advisory responsibilities to the Shareholders
Meeting in the case of the PTP's. Government is still considering the
organizational structure for the future, but it appears that the present
28 Est^7 e Groups will become PTP's, without any regrouping or loss of identity.
In March 1976, the BKU was liquidated and a temporary Support Staff to the
Minister of Agriculture for the Affairs of the National Agricultural Enter-
prises was set up./l This staff will have advisory and supervisory functions
and will assist the Supervisory and Management Boards of the PTP's by provision
of specialized expertise to the Shareholders Meeting, in analysis of PTP
plans and proposals and in monitoring of progress and assisting the Minister
of Agriculture in ensuring that overall development policies are fulfilled,
that maximum use is made of scarce resources and that there is coordination
of investments between PTP's where advantageous.

NUCLEUS ESTATES SMALLHOLDER I PROJECT
The BIMAS Program
Background
1.        BIMAS (Bimingan Massal Swa Sembada Bahan Makanan) literally trans-
lated means "mass guidance for self-sufficiency in food stuffs." It is a
national program to raise foodcrop production and farm income by supplying
credit and cash inputs at subsidized prices. The first credit package pro-
gram, the Paddy Center Program was introduced in 1958/59. Several modifi-
cations in approach were progressively introduced as experience was gained
in handling and organizing farmers, credit and input supply, until the BIMAS
program evolved and was initiated in the 1965/66 wet season. With minor
changes in methods of operation, the program expanded to the point where it
now covers about 40% of the rice area with an assured water supply, but only
about 25% of the total wet-season rice area. It is currently the most im-
portant Government program to raise food crop yields, production and farm
income.
2.        In 1967/68, the INMAS program was inititaed in the belief that
after a few years under BIM1AS the farmers' requirements for credit would be
less. Under this program, all farmers who are not eligible for BIMAS due
to credit default or who do not wish to take credit, can obtain subsidized
inputs for cash.
Present Organization
3.        A BIMAS Secretarat within the Ministry of Agriculture administers
the program. Although there is provision for a BIMAS Secretary as executive
head, the Director General Food Crops currently holds this post. He is
assisted by four directorates, Administration, Planning, Direction and
Control within the Secretariat to plan and administer the program. Program
planning and coordination with the activities of relevant participating
governemnt agencies is achieved through a National BIMAS Committee.
4.        Key agencies involved in the planning and execution of the program
in the National BIMAS Committee are:
(a)  Directorates of the IOA - selecting areas of operation,
setting area and production targets, formulating recom-
mendations and credit packages, determining numbers and
grades of extension personnel and equipment requirements,
advising on fertilizer and agrochemical requirements, seed
production and distribution.
(b) Bank Rakyat Indonesia - estimation, supply and control
of credit requirements.

(d) P.N. Pertani and PUSRI plus several private agencies -
supply and distribution of fertilizer and agrochem-icals.
(e) Department of Cooperatives - the formation and supervision
of farmers cooperatives (BUUD/KUD) to distribute inputs,
purchase and process production.
(f) BULOG and DULOG - the National and Provincial Paddy
Marketing authorities who purchase paddy from farmer
cooperatives, maintain paddy floor prices and generally
supervise and control paddy and rice marketing.
(g) Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD) -
coordination of the BIMAS target areas with available water
supplies and water control conditions in irrigated areas.
(h) Ministry of Home Affairs - coordination of participating
agencies' activities and program supervision at provincial,
district and village levels.
(i) BAPPENAS - integration of the BIMAS program with national
development planning.
5.        The National BIMAS Committee meets at least once a year to review
progress and determine the program for the following year. The Secretary
or Director General Food Crops and his representatives meet with key agencies,
i.e., BRI, Director General WRD, Department of Cooperatives to resolve specific
problems as they arise during the implementation of the program. BIMAS Com-
mittees with a similar constitution to the National Committee have been
established at provincial and district level under the supervision of the
Governor and Bupati, respectively. These committees are also involved in
the planning process, and the national BIMAS target is a reconciliation bet-
ween district and provincial and provincial and national food crop develop-
ment goals. Nevertheless, the prime function of the provincial and district
committees is to coordinate the activities of participating agencies, ensure
effective implementation of the program and provide monthly progress reports
to the BIMAS Secretariat.
Program Implementation
6.        The program is implemented via village units (VU).  These are
defined as 600-1,000 ha of paddyland in rice growing areas and comprise two
to three villages and up to 1,500 farm families. A fully established VU
is supposed to have a BRI credit office, a farmer's cooperative (BUUD/KUD)
for input supply and purchase of paddy or village kiosk to supply inputs and

at least one field extension worker (PPL). In nonirrigated or upland areas
there are no set criteria for the size of the VU and it could comprise a
whole subdistrict (Kecamatan), depending on farm family density and crop-
ping activity. The District Government Officer or Bupati in consultation
with district agricultural staff determines the need for VUs. The Governor
and his technical staff at provincial level assess the request, and if
viable, the VU is gazetted by the Governor. Requests for the establish-
ments of a BRI office, Farmers' Cooperative and the appointment of a PPL are
forwarded to the appropriate central government agencies, i.e., Bank Rakyat
Indonesia (BRI), Department of Cooperatives, BIMAS Secretariat and DGFC.
Provision of facilities depends upon national priorities and availability
of funds and personnel. As a result, many gazetted VUs may not necessarily
be "established" VUs. As a stop gap measure, the VU may be serviced by an
adjacent VU, a village trader may be appointed to run a kiosk for input
supply and credit needs may be met by a BRI mobile unit.
7.        Credit packages are based on national standardized recommendations
for each field crop. Any farmer can apply to join the program, but his credit-
worthiness must be established with the village head (Lurah) before the VU
credit office will authorize a loan. The Lurah receives a small incentive
payment for every farmer receiving credit, with half payment at loan authori-
zation and the other half when the credit is repaid. The farmer is required
to take 75% of the recommended urea dressing and at least two liters of insec-
ticide in insect prone areas. In practice, farmers gain flexibility by ex-
changing materials with neighbors. Credit vouchers are used to obtain fertilizer
and insecticide from the village kiosk or the farmers' cooperative and as cash,
or deducted from payments for paddy delivered to the farmers' cooperative. The
Lurah is primarily responsible for assisting the VU credit office with collec-
tino of loans.
8.        The main responsibility of the PPL is to provide technical advice
to the farmers, maintain a check on planted area, yields and production, assist
with planning VU crop production programs and assessment of input requirements
for transmission to the district office. He is also responsible for implemen-
ting the national crop cutting program to estimate planted area, yield and
production of paddy. Data from the VU is transmitted to the subdistrict
(Kecamatan) and then to the district where it is used by the district BIMAS
Committee to prepare progress reports, prepare BIMAS and INMAS targets and
estimate input requirements. The compiled data is forwarded up to the
provincial level for purposes of program planning and evaluation.  The Pro-
vincial Inspectors of Agriculture, District Agricultural Officers and Sub-
District Agricultural Officers bear most of the administrative responsibility
for implementing the BIMAS and INMLAS programs.
9.        The BIMAS program is financed by the central government.  Neverthe-
less, once targets have been set at national level for crops, cropped area,
production credit and input supply, participating agencies submit their own
budget requests and receive finance as a portion of their normal financial



ANNEX 2
Section 3
Page 4
allocation to implement their part of the program. In the case of the
BI14AS Secretariat and DGFC, a special budget is allocated to pay the
salaries and operating expenses and provide the basic equipment for addi-
tional PPS, PPM and PPL to strengthen field technical and extension
services in BIMAS areas. As - re;ult, most of the extension personnel
and extension activities fall under the Director General Food Crops and
are financed through the national BIMAS program.
Scope of the Program
10.       Initially, BIMAS was largely restricted to paddy areas with
good water control. The program was recently expanded to include direct
seeded rice, maize, sorghum, soybean, groundnut, green beans and cassava.
Currently, the program covers about 40% of the irrigated and rainfed rice
land planted in the wet season and dry season and 4% of the planted secondary
crops (Tables I and 2).  There is thus considerable potential to expand the
program. The nine project provinces cover 80% of the national irrigated and
rainfed paddy and 79% of the secondary crops. Over 90% of BIMAS activity on
rice and secondary crops takes place within the project provinces.
Potential Impact of the Project on the BIMAS Program
11.       It is recognized that extension is not the only factor affecting
the performance of the BIMAS Program. Improvements must be progressively
made in the timely supply of inputs at village level, seed production and
distribution, the marketing of secondary crops, etc. if full benefits are
to be obtained from the program. Nevertheless, an effective extension ser-
vice is a prerequisite to making the best use of what resources are currently
available at farm level. Furthermore, an extension project is the cheapest
and quickest way of bringing some benefit to all farmers.

Prof. Dr. Ir. Thojib Hadiwidjaja
Minister of Agriculture
Department of Agriculture

JAKARTA, INDONESIA
Dear Mr. Minister:
Aide-Memo ire
Nucleus Estates and Smallholders I and II
And Sugar II Preappraisal Mission
My World Bank Colleagues and I have today completed our 24 day
preappraisal, assignment in Indonesia in the course of which we visited sites
for the proposed projects in Aceh, North Sumatra, South Sumatra, West and
Central Java and South Sulawesi provinces and held useful discussions with a
wide range of Government of Indonesia central and provincial officials from
several agencies.
On the basis of these visits and discussions we selected, and
will recommend to our management as suitable for possible Bank financing,
two nucleus estates and smallholders projects for which details are given
below.
We also examined the proposed Takalar sugar project site and
have discussed this project as well as the Gunong Batin Area 7 sugar project
presently being studied for feasibility by consultants. The mission has also
considered the minor sugar mill rehabilitation projects being prepared under
the direction of the Joint Sugar Project Unit. We propose recommending to
our management that a decision on the project to be selected and appraised
for Sugar II be deferred until after the above preparations have been com-
pleted and made available for study, which we understand should be possible
before the end of 1975. We also expect from the Government of Indonesia
indications with regard to their appreciation of priorities between the
several sugar project proposals.
The two nucleus estates and smallholders projects recommended
for appraisal include all project components proposed to us by your Ministry
on our arrival, with some modifications. As the aggregate estimated total
and foreign exchange costs of these components (revised by our mission)
considerably exceed the amounts set aside by the Bank in its present lending
program for the first project in this new series of loans, we will propose to
our Bank management that the several components be divided into two projects
as follows:-

(b) Nucleus Estates and Smallholders II (NES II)
This project would include the rehabilitation of PNP I (estimated
total cost US$49.6M) and PTP III (estimated total cost US$78.OM). The Bank
loan for each of these components is now estimated at US$22.3M and US$31.2M
respectively. NES II could include smallholders components near PNP's V and
VI which are now being prepared. This would however depend on the speed of
the Government to allocate land and to initiate feasiblity studies in this
area. Alternatively the smallholder development project now under preparation
in Jambi could be considered.
We have deliberately selected for the first project those components
which are likely to have the most immediate and substantial impact on the
smallholder subsector, are of high economic priority, and which we consider
to be in the most advanced state of preparation. We would like to see this
first project appraised before the end of calendar 1975, probably commencing
late October, with expectation of World Bank Board presentation in mid-1976.
We hope the second project could be appraised early next year. We have
recommended additional preparation work for this second project which would
introduce additional smallholder components to supplement the estate rehabili-
tations already prepared.
In collaboration with your staff and those of other ministries we
have made satisfactory progress in developing what we believe would be an
effective system for implementing these projects and for strengthening the
supervisory and servicing functions of the public sector estate system, and
of the Direktorat Jenderal Perkebunan, which can be accommodated readily
within the Government of Indonesia new organizational structure. The details
of this system are described in attachment 1 to this letter. We would
appreciate receiving your comments in due course regarding the acceptability
of these arrangements, if possible prior to the dispatch of our appraisal
mission next month.



ANNEX 2
Section 5
Page 3
Other important topics on which we held discussions include small-
holder target incomes, farm sizes, capital costs of development, smallholder
cash flows and proportionate costs recovery, all of which are closely related.
As a contribution towards establishing a Government policy wich would allow a
reasonable measure of uniformity between settlement schemes, including
transmigrant schemes, and yet retain sufficient flexibility to accommodate
regional differences, we intend to analyze in depth the several preparation
reports which present a variety of options on these matters after we return
to Washington. On the basis of this analysis we will make proposals. If
these meet with the concurrence of your Government and our management, they
could be applied during future appraisals.
In addition to the project components included in the preparation
documents made available to us on our arrival, we have discussed the possi-
bility of strengthening the Lembaga Pendidikan Perkebunan with the provision
of top and middle level agricultural management training courses suited to
the needs of mature supervisory staff in the BKU/PNP/PTP structure. We
therefore propose the inclusion of a training specialist with a practical
estate management background in our forthcoming appraisal team, to prepare an
appropriate training component in this field. As an aid to the formulation
of proposals for strengthening the BKU/PNP/PTP structure, we have prepared a
short summary incorporating our observations about the problems of future
organization of the public sector estates enterprises as attachment 2. We
believe this statement could provide a useful basis for discussion during
appraisal. We have also considered options for strengthening the implemen-
tation capacity of the Direktorat Jenderal Perkebunan and the public sector
estate industry, and will elaborate on this topic after our return to
Washington.
Proposals for additional preparation work by the Government of
Indonesia and its consultants which would facilitate appraisal of the projects
selected, are given in attachments 3 and 4.
Copies of this letter have been sent to the Minister of Finance,
the Minister of State for Administrative Reform, the Minister of Manpower,
Transmigration and Cooperatives, BAPPENAS and the Director General of Estates.
Yours sincerely,
William P. Panton



ANNEX 2
Section 5
Attachment 1
Page 1
MISSION PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHING A
NUCLEUS ESTATE SMALLHOLDER SYSTEM
1.        The Directorate General for Estates (DGE) would negotiate contracts
with the nucleus PNP/PTP with suitable incentives, financed through a loan
agreement to be negotiated between the World Bank, the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) and the PNP/PTP for among others, the clearing, planting and maintenance
of the land and crop until about six months after initial tapping. These
contracts would include agricultural roads, access roads to villages and
village building construction. The PNP/PTP would employ as many as possible
of the future settlers as laborers during the development period. The cost
of land development would be met by a loan from Bank Indonesia to the PNP/PTP,
covering the World Bank and GOI financing components. Independent auditors,
in most cases already appointed under existing Bank Group approved conditions,
would be responsible for auditing separate project accounts maintained by the
PNP/PTP exclusively for the project. Independent inspectors (advisory
service), attached to a Nucleus Estate Smallholder Support Unit (NESSU) would
be responsible for approving PNP/PTP yearly plans, reviewing budgets and
monitoring physical progress standards and costs of PNP/PTP work and evaluating
the results of their efforts.
2.        The present organization of the DGE consists of three Directorates
and a Projects Management Board (PMB). It is proposed that the PMB be
abolished and the NESSU assume the current duties of the PMB and also take
responsibility for the nucleus estate development. The present salary
structure of the PMB would be used in the NESSU. The headquarters staff of
the NESSU would be assisted by three consultants, for finance, land use
planning and surveying, and rubber production. The terms of reference of the
NESSU would include:
- Provision of general guidance, technical advice, direction and
coordination of Project Management Units (PMUs), one of which
would be established on each smallholder scheme;
- approve tender contracts for procurement of goods, services and
work as members of the tender committee;
- assistance in future project preparation;
- future planning;
- planning for processing, transport, and marketing;
- land use planning and coordination;
- monitoring;
- training of PMUs staff;
- liaison with research and extension agencies.
Expert staff presently available in the North Sumatra Rubber Smallholders
Project management unit would be used in establishing the NESSU.



ANNEX 2
Section 5
Attachment 1
Page 2
3.        The work of the NESSU would be carried out at the field level by
the PMUs. Initially, four PMUs would be necessary, for the West Java Tea
Project, the North Sumatra Smallholders Project and one each for the proposed
Aceh and South Sumatra nucleus estate smallholder project areas proposed for
development under NES I.
4.        Each PMU would be responsible for monitoring the development work
carried out by the PNP/PTP or other contractors, assisted by independent
inspectors, and for coordinating settler recruitment and selection. In
addition, the PMU would be responsible for coordinating development activities,
with provincial authorities, Agraria, PNP and Public Works Department which
would include land acquisition, the village layout plans, roads, water
supplies and other infrastructural works, schools, clinics and other social
infrastructures, and would instruct and organize the prospective settlers
socially.
5.        The PMU would also be responsible for arranging with Agraria for
the acquisition of land, the design and survey of village site structural
layout plans and houselot plans, and ultimately for the subdivision of the
developed crop lands on an individual plot basis.
6.        The provincial Dinas Perkebunan Rakyat (DPR) would be useful in
coordinating with the provincial government as a link to the local authorities.
One of two staff of each provincial DPR would be supported by the project to
provide this regional linkage.
7.        A Project Coordinating Committee would be established at the outset
at the provincial level to provide settler representation and coordinate the
implementation of the overall development effort. Representatives of the
committee would include the Project Manager in the PMU; a representative of
the Governor; the PNP management; the Kepala DPR, and in due course, after
their establishment, a representative of the BUUD/KUD (new style cooperative)
which will be established on the scheme.
8.        As special problems occur, a series of ad hoc unpaid working
committees would be established. These committees would not be permanent
institutions, but would cease to exist as soon as problems are solved.
9.        Hopefully, decision making would be decentralized to the operating
level with ultimate responsibility at the top.
10.       The BUUD/KUD would, in the Mission's tentative thinking, become
involved in the project in the later stages of development. The broad
functions and responsibilities could include the following, subject to
detailed study during the development phase:
- low level management (management of group coagulating centers/crop
assembly centers)
- smallholder representation/protection
- organization of production activities on behalf of the smallholders.



ANNEX 2
Section 5
Attachment 1
Page 3
11.       A sound cost recovery system would be further analyzed during
development, but established early in phase II. Proposals currently under
consideration include the use of fiscal measures such as an increased IPEDA
(land tax), the use of smallholder owned factories, the BRI or the BUUD/KUD.
12.       The three Directorates of the DGE have prepared a variety of plans
for expansion. The main thrust of the DGE is not associated with nucleus
estates, but towards, 1,800,000 hectares of smallholder rubber, 2,050,000
hectares of smallholder coconut and a wide range of other tree crops. Thus,
the DGE Directorates would concentrate on smallholders outside of the Nucleus
Estates.
13.       A technical assistance program should be prepared for the DGE.  The
program could consider such matters as:
(i)  Training for DGE staff.
(ii)  Investment credit mechanisms for smallholders.
(iii) Establishing an improved project identification and preparation
team.
(iv)  Advisors, as necessary.
14.       Hopefully, the identification of viable DGE projects for Bank
financing would result from the above.
15.       The nucleus estate smallholder system should have the following
advantages:
(i)  ensure the use of high level technology and efficient management
for the establishment of the main crop;
(ii)  secure funds for the project, both for the World Bank and the
Government financed components, under a relatively simple
procedure;
(iii)  provide an incentive to the PNP/PTPs to develop the future
smallholder land effectively and at least cost;
(iv)  permit development of an entity (the NESSU) which would
represent the smallholders and protect their interests;
(v)  foster the early development of social cohesiveness among the
settlers which could lead to the eventual establishment of a
strong cooperative system at the village level;
(vi)  attain maximum conformity with existing GOI organizational
structure;
(vii)  simplify credit administration procedures for settlers by
providing for a standardized package, and would eliminate the
need for a subsistence payment system;



ANNEX 2
Section 5
Attachment 1
Page 4
(viii) establish an attainable role for the utilization of the
BUUD/KUD.
Financial Concepts
16.       Lending During the Development Stage:  Local and foreign currency
would be lent from Government (Ministry of Finance) and the World Bank to
Bank Indonesia for onlending to the respective PNP/PTPs which would be
developing the land for smallholders. At commencement of production the loan
held by the PNP/PTP would be turned over to the institution responsible for
collection. All funds would thus come from one source (Bank Indonesia) and
go to one user (the respective PNP/PTP).
17.       Interest During Development and Recovery:  Both local and foreign
currency loans from Bank Indonesia would be free of interest during the
development phase of approximately seven years. Concessionary rates would be
charged thereafter, possibly 12%. Recovery of the loan would be through any
of the following agencies: BRI, IPEDA, Smallholder owned factory or Smallhol-
der Organization.
18.       Disbursements:  It is proposed that there be no restrictions on the
amounts to be withdrawn by the PNP/PTPs up to a designated maximum. A
multi-year commitment by Government of available funds is advisable, allowing
for an increased pace of development and potential cost reduction.
19.       Control:  Disbursements would be checked ex-post and semi-annually
against impelemntation targets and financial requirements. An annual auditor s
report, the approval of the financial accounts by the PNP Board and the PMU
(Project Management Unit) and inspector reports by the advisory service would
serve as the control mechanism. In the event of negative opinions expressed
in their reports, disbursements would be stopped after consultation with the
Bank.
20.       Accounts:  Proper and separate management accounts would be main-
tained by PNP/PTPs for land development for smallholders projects. Cost
accounts (cost centers and unit costing) would be used by PNP/PTPs to maintain
cost effectiveness during development and for assessments by inspectors in
relating physical progress to actual disbursements.

Sub.:   Draft of Minister of
Agric. decree concerning
BKU-PNP liquidation
Referring to our discussion a few days ago in connection with the
liquidation of BKU-PNP we have concluded that this is in line with government
policies.
This decision is a follow-up of presidential decree nos. 44 & 45/
1974 concerning organizational principles and department structure
of non departmental agencies which are not in accord with the prevailing
organizational pattern.
In accordance with the subject mentioned above we resubmit the
draft of the decree of the Min. of Agric to you to be decided as a decree
and as suggested by the liquidation committee an Accountant from the
Min. of Finance should be appointed to smoothen the work.
Thank you very much for your kind attention on this matter.

Adjustment State Apparatus

Annex 2
Section 7

1.         Summary of Proposals
1.1       Facilities at the LPP
The facilities at LPP, Jogjakarta should be improved and expanded
so that it will be possible to:
- identify the training needs of plantations and factories, and
adopt courses to meet them.
- upgrade business management training
- provide up-to-date technical training in all crops and processes
- adopt modern training methods appropriate to adult learning.
These requirements can be met by:
- appointing four expatriate training advisers for 3 years
- providing local and overseas training for lecturers
- appointing ten additional Indonesian lecturers
- attaching five lecturers to thc LPP sub-center at Medan to deal
with agronomy of oil palm and rubber
- reorganizing LPP divisions along functional lines.
1.2.       The role of PNP/PTP's in training
PNP/PTP's should be given specific functions in the overall training
program, namely by:
- making them responsible for identifying training needs and set-
ting up training programs for employees at all levels.
- appointing a Training and Development Manager at each PNP/PTP
and giving him training in his duties
- carrying out the actual training of supervisors, artisans and
other junior workers within the estates
- requiring consultation and cooperation between PNP/PTP's and LPP
in the organization of management and other courses for managers
at all levels.
1.3.       Advanced training
Five senior managers should be sent on six-month courses at schools
of business management.



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 6
1.4.       Importance of cooperation
It is crucially important that there should be cooperation be-
tween LPP and PNP/PTP's in training programs. LPP will provide
professional guidance overall, and the actual training courses
for all management staff. PNP/PTP's will provide the main drive
for effective training, and will themselves train their own
junior workers.
2.         The Current Situation
2.1.       Cropping program on PNP/PTP's
Each of the 28 PNP/PTP's has, on average, a dozen estates, including
processing factories, with staff responsible for day-to-day manage-
ment. Twenty different crops are grown, with an average of four
within each PNP/PTP. Of the overall total area of 644,994 hectares,
88% are devoted to five crops, and in some instances the areas of
the other fifteen are quite significant. For instance, although
cloves account for only 0.6% of the total area, this is spread
between ten PNP/PTP's, and amounts to less than 50 ha on four of
them. The full range of crops and their areas are listed in Table
1. The most important five crops are rubber, pine, oil palm, sugar
cane and tea, and at least one of them is grown by 25 out of the
28 PNP/PTP's, and two or more of these crops are grown by 17 PNP/
PTP's.
2.2.       Personnel
Management staff at PNP/PTP Headquarters are concerned with overall
planning, control and marketing. Operational management is dele-
gated to individual estates under the control of an Estate Manager.
He operates with Plantation and Factory Managers, the number dep-
endant upon the size of the estate, and each of these has three
or four assistants. In total there are 6,000 management staff.
Below the managers are 10,000 foremen in charge of groups of
workers of varying levels of skill. The largest group are the
daily paid laborers, which number 300,000. An important group
in the maintenance of efficient operations are the artisans,
numbering approximately 10,000. The ranks of the semi-skilled
like tractor and truck drivers, and the office workers probably
amount to 4,000 and 7,000 respectively.
2.3.       On-the-job training
The attention paid to training at PNP/PTP's and their estates is
very variable. While in many situations the amount of actual
planned training may be small, junior staff are expected to "pick
it up" as they go along, and this is true for both management and
artisan training. At PNP/PTP's there is a member of staff given
responsibility for training, but the priority accorded to this

aspect of his duties is variable. It appears that in most cases
the staff members concerned with training lack seniority. Insofar
as much of the on-the-job training is unplanned, the staff member
responsible for training has little influence on the situation. It
appears that none of those responsible for training affairs have
had training themselves in the duties and practices of a training
officer.
2.4.      Training at Lembaga Pendidikan Perkebunan (LPP), Jogiakarta
This institution was set up specifically to meet the training needs
of the PNP/PTP's and currently has a staff comprising a Director
and 24 lecturers. (For further details see Appendix 1). Originally
concerned solely with the sugar industry, in 1970 its terms of
reference were widened to embrace the needs of all the estates
whatever the cropping program might be. A good deal of effort
goes into improving the basic scientific education of young people
entering the service of the PNP/PTP's as potential technicians,
especially in sugar factories. There is a wide variation in the
basic education provided by the Technical and Agricultural High
Schools, and any shortcomings have to be made good at LPP to ensure
a sound basis for further training. The result is that many hours
are spent in classroom and laboratories on basic principles of
botany or chemistry, rather than on training specifically for a
job. It is not surprising, therefore, that the organization of the
LPP follows the pattern of a school or college, and is only indirectly
related to crops or processes occurring at the PNP/PTP's. LPP
staff find it difficult to develop expert knowledge about particular
crops or factory processes, and they tend to rely on out-of-date
text books when teaching operational managers. The task of keeping
abreast of modern developments in agricultural techniques is made
more difficult by the lack of specific lines of communication with
research stations or with other people concerned with crop develop-
ment.
Training in management and administration is devoted to the current
methods in use at PNP/PTP Headquarters and on estates. Satisfactory
as this may be in the short run, wider concepts are not discussed,
and managements' responsibility to face the need for improvement
and change is not considered. In particular, little attention
appears to be paid to problems of human relations, which should be
an important part of training for management.
2.5       Training at Hedan
It is stated that the LPP arranges courses at Medan in N. Sumatra,
but in effect the control exercised by LPP is minimal. A member of
staff of the BKU at Medan has spent about 25% of his time on training



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 9
and it is he who arranged the courses with little consultation
with LPP. At the end of a course the Director of LPP, or his Head
of Education and Training Division, visited Medan to assess the
examination papers put in by course members. There were no lecturers
on the BKU staff and the whole course is given by lecturers from
university, research stations, colleges, and from some PNP/PTP's.
In 1975 two courses each with 24 participants were given for Estate
Managers, Heads of Department and BKU Inspectors. There were also
two courses each with 35 participants for Senior Assistant Managers
of plantations and factories (same course for both categories) All
courses were for 3 months, and a typical syllabus was as follows:
General management                  Tea
Financial control                   Tobacco
Statistics                          Pests and Diseases
Rubber                              Tractors
Oil Palm
Each student got the same instruction, whatever crop he was in fact
concerned with, and even though transfer from one crop to another
is rare. The same lecturers were used when a course is repeated,
and they were paid a fee of Rp2,500 (US$6) per hour of lecturing.
BKU had accommodation available for those attending courses. The
view was expressed by PNP/PTP managers that this training was not
relevant to their needs.
2.6       Various traininR agencies
From time to time Government Departments arrange training courses
to which some PNP/PTP's send staff. In November 1975, for instance,
the Ministry of Manpower arranged a course on job description and
job evaluation which was held at the LPP and was attended by
PNP/PTP staff members. In Indonesia there are four technical
colleges giving training for artisans and those at Bandung and
Medan are being used by PNP/PTP's. The Medan Center is a close
copy of similar ones in the Netherlands (where they are known as
Vocational Training Centers for Adults) and is achieving a high
standard using advanced training methods. In November 1975 there
were 14 trainees attending from PNP VI, and this will soon be
increased to 28. The course covers the following subjects:
Welding        )
Automotive    )   Available 1975
Machine Shop )
Electrical    )
Carpentry      )
Masonry        )   Available 1976
Plumbing       )
TV/Radio       )   Available 1977
Diesel         )



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 10
Courses last for 6 to 8 months; teaching is designed to allow par-
ticipants to proceed at a speed suited to their abilities, so that
there is some variation in the duration of the course according to
the individual. The course cost Rp 60,000 per month or about
Rp 420,000 (US$1,012) for the whole course. At a later date up-
grading and refresher courses will be offered in addition to basic
courses. Other training is provided by means of seminars run by
research stations or the Plantations Syndicate. In Java, the
latter arranges meetings three times a year to discuss over a
period of a few days the technical problems relating to one or
other of the plantation crops. Most PNP/PTP's send from 2 to 4
senior managers. International crop conferences in S.E. Asia are
attended by a few people from the PNP/PTP's.
2.7       Training methods within the DGE
In general, those concerned with training have not themselves re-
ceived instruction in the training methods appropriate to adults.
In some PNP/PTP's there is undoubted interest and enthusiasm for
training, and the efforts in this direction could be made consider-
ably more effective. At the LPP the heavy burden of High School
type education for young people recruited for training as tech-
nicians has precluded progress in adopting modern training methods
for adults. The school atmosphere has perpetuated a broad approach
to meet pre-conceived educational needs of experienced managers,
with the result that many courses bear little relation to the real
needs of the estates. The continuing needs of trained personnel
for sugar cane production and processing has precluded LPP from
giving the attention that is needed to training in the production
and processing of other crops, especially rubber, oil palm and tea.
In several countries in South East Asia there is a lack of under-
standing of the ways in which modern management techniques, divorced
from the technical requirements of particular crops, can help to
improve the efficiency of mangement. LPP staff share this failure
to give adequate training in business mangement, and this constitutes
probably the biggest gap in the training program being offered.
2.8       The amount of training taking place
In the time available it was not possible to make a reliable esti-
mate of the amount of training taking place. In any case, training
is difficult to quantify. Within the PNP/PTP's the effort is
considerable, and is increasing with the recognition of need and
realization that little help is available from outside. Much of
what is being done is slow and less effective than it might be
because it is being done by people unskilled in communication/
training methods. At the LPP it is difficult to identify the
amount of training given to new entrants to the estates system
(i.e. induction training) separate from the training at regular
intervals to keep staff up-to-date and equipped to meet changing
situations. Clearly the greatest effort is given to the former,



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 11
both in terms of length of course and numbers attending. With
courses of varying length, there may be between four and ten
running at any one time, with an average of about five. Out of a
total of some 33,000 student/days per annum, about one quarter are
devoted to refresher couses for experienced staff, and the balance
to induction training. Most of the latter is related to the needs
of the sugar industry.
No figures are available for the amount of training received from
special courses at technical centers or arranged by Government
departments, or in the form of seminars at research stations. A
rough estimate is around 3,000 student/days per annum (i.e. 20
people from each PNP/PTP for 5 days each).
3.        An Improved Training Program
3.1.      The responsibility of management
Senior management at the PNP/PTP's is moving towards a fuller recog-
nition of its own responsibility for training over the whole range
of operation. The acceptance of this responsibility needs to
be speeded and spread through the organization to all line managers.
Coupled with it there must be an appreciation that training is not a
separate package obtained at long intervals and at a distance from
the work place, but that training is part of the total work situation
(in general the more junior the employee, the shorter the course,
and the nearer to his work place should it take place). Deficiencies
in staff performance can be expressed in terms of training need,
which in turn can be met by training instruction. Management is
well aware of the need to keep abreast of modern techniques. Only
now is it beginning to be accepted that only half the problem is
in terms of research and development, and that the other half is
moving information from the point where it is generated to the
point where it can be used, and in a form that is usable - a communi-
cation and training problem.
3.2       The management of training
The focal point for training is where the ability of personnel can
be compared with required performance, and deficiencies converted
into training need. This is centered on each PNP/PTP, and it is
from here that the training drive must come. The function of the
LPP is to help meet the need, and act as a consultant in the
overall training program. LPP staff need to establish close
contact with a Training and Development Manager at each PNP/PTP, so
that they are keenly aware of the problems facing plantation and
factory managers and can ensure that their courses meet real needs.
The PNP/PTP Training and Development Managers can be expected to be
able (after he has himself received training) to organize on-the-job
training for junior staff, foremen and artisans, and to know about
training facilities in his area that can be utilized.



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 12
Training and Development Managers at PNP/PTP's could with advantage
be recruited from amongst existing estate managers ( or factory
managers) and serve for a period of 5-8 years. The post involves
the over-view of all activities of the PNP/PTP, with special
attention to weaknesses in organization and control of agronomic and
factory operations; it also involves close attention to new develop-
ments that could with advantage be adopted. The appointment of
Training and Development Managers thus presents an opportunity for
the best of the Estate Managers to widen their view of the working
of a PNP/PTP, and could be a valuable preparation for appointment
as Production Manager at PNP/PTP headquarters. By restricting the
terms of office to 5 to 8 years, individuals would maintain their
interest in and knowledge of conditions in the field and factory,
which is where the main training needs originate.
Each estate within the PNP/PTP should nominate a member of the
management staff to be responsible for training within the estate,
and especially to supervise the considerable volume of on-the-job
training taking place with artisans, foremen, semi-skilled workers,
etc. This would not, of couse, be a full time job, and might
normally be allocated to the second in command to the Estate
Managers. He should have direct access to the Training and Develop-
ment Manager at PNP/PTP headquarters. While the motivation to
train must come from the PNP/PTP's, much depends on the leadership
in training methods that can only come from the LPP. This will
call for a substantial change in viewpoint by the LPP staff, moving
away from the academic/theoretical approach of colleges or univer-
sities which are concerned with education in general terms. In its
place there must be a determination to discover the real (and
changing) needs of plantations and factories, with a ruthless
cutting out of information that is not strictly relevant to better
job performance. This is a task which LPP staff are themselves
ready to accept, since the need is already perceived. It is essential
that high priority should be given to training the trainers, both
initially and on a continuing basis.
3.3       Management training
The biggest change needed at the LPP is in the approach to agricul-
tural business management. Experience of the Commonwealth Develop-
ment Corporation shows that a training course of 10-12 weeks can
materially help managers with a few years experience to plan and
control money, men and machines and improve output and profit. For
progress in this direction to be made swiftly these management
problems must be separated from technical questions relating to
crop production or processing. This type of management training
will require a fresh start in the management division of LPP which
could well be modelled on the experience in precisely this field at
the CDC Managa Agricultural Management Center in Swaziland (see
Appendix 3).



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 13
An integral part of such management courses is the attention drawn
to the responsibility of management for staff training, and the
processes whereby information and change can be introduced into an
agricultural business. This in itself will help PNP/PTP staff
who attend such courses to become more conscious of the benefits
that can flow from quite simple on-the-job training programs.
A few very senior managers, or those likely to be promoted very
shortly to senior posts, should be sent overseas for 6 months
courses at centers for advanced business management training.
3.4       Technical training
There is a tendency at the present time to include information on
many different crops in one course. This makes the course longer
than it need be, and sometimes considerable parts of it are irrele-
vant to some members of the class. Courses should concentrate on
the carefully defined needs of narrow groups of staff - improved
definition allows better aim to be taken at the target problem,
with a much improved chance of hitting it. Every hour of every day
of every course must be justified in terms of the expected improve-
ment in the job performance of the participant in the next 6 to 12
months. He only needs to know what he needs to use. The training
problem facing the DGE is too big in relation to the resources
available for the luxury of peripheral information to have a place
in training programs.
It should hardly need stating that a lecturer dealing with a partic-
ular crop or a factory process must be more knowledgeable than his
audience. LPP staff feel that this may not always be so, and
special efforts are needed to correct the situation. Arrangement
should be made for lecturers regularly to visit research stations
connected with their speciality, not only within Indonesia, but
also further afield, and include visits to estates where the best
practices are to be found. The role of inspectors, either at BKU
or PNP/PTP, appears to be somewhat limited, and in general they
lack authority. It appears possible that the function could be
changed somewhat, so that they act as a channel for technical
information from outside and to make it available within estates.
If this were to be the case their information needs and level of
required expertise would be similar to that of LPP lecturers on
technical subjects; the inspectors (under a new title) could become
a reserve of part-time lecturers.
3.5       Supervisor training
The immediate supervision of the work-force is carried out by fore-
men who carry a good deal of the responsibility for the quality of
the work done, and in some cases, the quantity as well. If they
are to be effective in ensuring good work, then care must be taken
to ensure that they themselves have mastered the techniques, can



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 14
recognize levels of achievement in others, and have the ability to
carry out simple training procedures to ensure that quality is
maintained or improved.
The training of foremen should be of short duration, usually for not
more than an hour or so at a time, repeated at intervals as necessary.
Only in exceptional circumstances should it be provided away from
their place of work.
3.6       Artisan training
The majority of artisan training (for mechanics, welders, carpenters,
electricians, etc.) can be carried out on the job, supplemented by
specific periods (say two hours per week) of training carried out
in the regular workplace. The foreman of each group of artisans
should receive training at a technical center (of which several
exist in Indonesia) to ensure that his practices are sound and
up-to-date. In addition he should receive a few hours of instruc-
tion in training methods, so that he can effectively discharge his
training responsibilities in the group of workers for whom he is
responsible.
3.7       Training semi-skilled workers
The most important members of this category are truck and tractor
drivers. Such training as may be required can best be done by
taking the best of existing semi-skilled workers, giving him
foreman status, and sufficient training at the artisan level to
enable him to uderstand the background to the semi-skilled operation.
He can then be used to train new entrants to these grades, or
improve the performance of existing personnel. It would probably
not be necessary to have such a trainer on every estate within a
PNP.
3.8       Training office workers
Most of the training in office procedures and machine operation
can be done on the job by office supervisory or mangement staff.
Where major changes are called for (as with the new Management
Information System) training can probably best be carried out by a
visiting training team at PNP/PTP headquarters, or at one estate
office to which nearby estates send their operatives. Such courses
should as far as possible be kept short, or should be broken up into
"sandwiches" of course attendance and periods of normal work.
3.9       The research role of LPP
With very limited facilities indeed, LPP staff have engaged in a
small amount of crop research. It is suggested that this is better



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 15
left to research stations set up for the purpose, while the investi-
gation program of LPP should be directed towards the management and
economic fields. At the present time there appears to be no unit
within the PNP/PTP system responsible for keeping under review the
management practices, financial control, economic efficiency, etc.
of the PNP/PTP's. This investigative role could be allotted to the
LPP as it grows in experience in the business management field. It
should be borne in mind that an effective training unit should also
be the spearhead for improvement and change. In the field of
agronomy and factory processes, research external to LPP should be
relied on to provide up-to-date information. Nevertheless, LPP has
an important role in helping to identify problems in the field
requiring research; survey techniques are particularly appropriate
in this respect. In general a research/investigative role should
be confined in the next few years to an assessment of PNP/PTP
problems, coupled with training programs to overcome them. Follow-
up investigation should attempt to assess the effectiveness of
training; LPP should be its own severest critic.
3.10      Teaching methods and visual aids
In recent years a great deal of information has accumulated about
the way people learn and the best methods to use to aid the learning
process. It is important that at all levels of training the
teaching methods should be kept under review to ensure that time
spent in training is at maximum effectiveness. This is perhaps
especially true with training adults who already have experience
in the subject of the training program. It is important that LPP
should revise its teaching methods in the light of modern practices,
and that new programs should adopt the best methods from the outset.
Part of the success of new methods springs from the judicious use
of visual teaching aids - charts, diagrams, slides, transparencies,
film, as well as the chalk board. Perhaps the greatest steps
forward have been made in relation to training methods for manual
workers. Modern methods have reduced the time required to teach
new skills, and have increased the efficiency of work performance
following the training period.
A small unit within LPP to advise on training methods and help with
the preparation of visual teaching aids would be desirable. Such
a unit would not only be concerned with courses taking place within
LPP but also with training within PNP/PTP's. It is on the estates
that the main burden of training manual workers and junior supervi-
sory/management grades will take place, largely carried out by
people with no training skills. It is important that PNP/PTP
Training and Development Managers should have help readily available
when setting up their training programs. It would be appropriate
specificallv to charge such a unit at LPP with the task of liaison
with the PNP/PTP's.



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 16
3.11      English language
Most of the text books, research reports etc. required for training
are published in the English language. Information and ideas from
outside Indonesia are also available mainly in English, and the
same is true for relevant management and technical conferences and
courses outside Indonesia. For all these reasons, all management
staff should become proficient in reading (and writing) English,
and middle and senior managers should be fluent English speakers.
It is suggested that ways and means should be found to encourage
practice in reading and speaking English, not so much by formal
courses at LPP or elsewhere, but by correspondence and the use of
tape recorders in the offices of individual estates within each
PNP/ PTP. The teaching method unit referred to at para 3.10 above
could be made responsible for this aspect of training.
3.12      An information service
The LPP publishes a quarterly journal containing scientific papers
and general news items of interest to PNP/PTP personnel. Useful
function, but consideration should be given to including more
articles and reports in terms of practices and procedures that are
immediately usable in the plantations, factories and administrative
offices. Discussion of theoretical and academic matters should be
reduced or eliminated.
In conjunction with research stations, and other relevant institu-
tions, brief leaflets and longer reports should be published
reporting and reviewing modern developments in production and
processing techniques. These would be useful not only in training
courses, but also to send out to all managers. It is important
that all information presented in this way should be in practical
terms where its application in the operation of estates and factories
is made clear. They should not be planned or written as scientific
reports intended for scientists and researchers. The scope of such
leaflets and reports should also cover management, financial and
economic affairs. Efficiency factors can be identified, and their
use discussed, and improved methods of planning and control des-
cribed. As in the technical field, authorship outside the LPP
should be encoraged.
3.13      Status of training staff
The status of training staff and their reputation in the eyes of
their colleagues throughout the PNP/PTP will ultimately depend on
the quality of the training they give. The most senior staff
within the PNP/PTP should ensure that LPP has a fair share of
people of outstanding ability. Second class people will provide
second class training, doomed to failure.
Thought needs to be given as to how the best people can be attracted
to training. Remuneration is important, and the loss of bonus in



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 17
LPP employment compared with PNP/PTP is discouraging. A possibility
is to provide an efficiency bar in salary scales for LPP staff (and
other trainers) which can be passed when proficiency has been
deomonstrated in teaching and training methods. The financial
advantage of this could be calculated to be approximately equialent
to bonus payments at PNP/PTP's.
Money is not everything, and ways should be sought by the award of
honorary titles, invitation to official events, judicious publicity
etc. to improve the standing of trainers in the eyes of their
colleagues. Overseas travel for attendance at courses for "training
the trainers" and for study-travel should be fairly readily avail-
able, and will contibute to an enhanced reputation.
Artisans and other junior staff involved to a limited extent in on-
the-job training should have some small financial recognition of
their added responsibilities. The recognition by those in authority
of his extra skill is probably as important as the extra money.
4.        Proposals for an Improved Training Program
4.1       General
For the next 5 years there are two main changes proposed in the
training program - the creation of a training capability within each
PNP/PTP, and a re-orientation and expansion of the LPP. This
involves recruitment and training for new appointments, the re-train-
ing of existing lecturers, and a degree of re-organization and
re-deployment. To help the smooth transition to the new training
program, an important proposal is the attachment of four expatriate
training experts.
4.2       Expatriate Training Advisers
It is proposed that four expatriate training advisers should be
appointed for a period of 5 years, and attached to LPP. They
should all be experienced in teaching and training, and conversant
with modern methods appropriate to training adults. It should be
noted that experience confined to academic education may be a
hindrance in giving guidance on building practical training programs.
The following is a brief outline of the four appointments:
(a) The team leader: general adviser on the new training program
to the Director of LPP. Experienced in the overall organiza-
tion of training, and especially of management training.
Should have a general acquaintance with plantation crops.
(b) A training expert in financial control methods, and their use
in management decision making. It is desirable that he should
be acquainted with practices on large estates.



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 18
(c) An expert in management training as applicable to large
scale agriculture, with knowledge of both decision making
procedures and human relations in work situations.
(d) An expert in training methods appropriate to junior and
manipulative workers.
At the outset all four should be attached to LPP at Jogjakarta, but
at a later date one or more may need to transfer to Medan.

4.3       LPP Sub-center at Medan
It is proposed that technical training related to agronomy and pro-
cessing of rubber and oil palm should be provided at Medan. At the
outset the unit should consist of four lecturers, all of whom would
be part of the total staff of LPP. The sub-center should act
independently of LPP, Jogjakarta, while remaining under its general
supervision. It might be appropriate to have the unit headed by a
lecturer with the title of Deputy-Director, LPP. In the second
year a member of staff from Jogjakarta should be transferred to
Medan to help with training programs taking place within PNP/PTPs.
Staff and their housing for this sub-center is included below in
para 4.6. Lecture rooms and living accommodation for students are
available already in Medan.
4.4       Training and Development Managers at PNP/PTP's
An important proposal is for the appointment of a full time Training
and Development Manager at each PNP/PTP. They should be recruited
from amongst the best of the Estate Managers, and should be regarded
as a step towards promotion to PNP/PTP Production Manager. A job
description is to be found in Appendix 2.
4.5       Re-organization of Divisions at LPP
It is recommended that the divisions should be re-organized on a
functional basis as follows:
1. Agronomy - sugar, tea, coconuts, rubber, oil palm and
other crops at Medan.



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 19
2. Factory technology - sugar, oil palm, rubber, tea, other
processing.
3. Business management - accountancy, decision making, human
relations, project planning.
4. Science - botany, chemistry and other non-vocational subjects.
5. Teaching methods & liaison - adult training methods, visual
aids, liaison with PNP/PTP
Training Managers, training evalua-
tion.
6. Library & information - staff magazine, lecture notes, reports
and leaflets.
7. Administration - non-teaching staff, finance, control of LPP
vehicles, equipment and buildings, student
accommodation.
It has been pointed out that a good deal of basic teaching is
provided to supplement the education provided at the Technical &
Agricultural High Schools. The responsibility for this should rest
with the Science Division, but it is important that this Division
should not be given responsibility for "science" that is properly
within the field of factory technology or agronomy.
4.6       Additional lecturers at LPP
It is proposed that there should be additional Indonesian lec-
turers appointed. No recommendation is made about the induction
training provided for new entrants (see para 2.4). At the present
time this appears to take up the time of 18 out of the 24 lecturers,
thus leaving 6 for refresher and up-grading courses for management
staff. It is important that LPP should substantially increase the
training for existing PNP/PTP staff and the additional lecturers
should be concerned with this sector of the training program.
Experience elsewhere suggests that management staff can be kept
up-to-date with new and improved practices if, on average, about
one week a year is devoted to formal or semi-formal training. This
does not mean that every manager must have five or seven days
training within each period of twelve months. What it implies is
that the 6,000 managers from the PNP/PTP's should have available a
training program of 30,000 days a year, of which about 80% should be
in specific courses. Some managers will attend seminars of a
couple of days, while others may attend a course of three months.
Bearing in mind the number that can attend one course, the number
of days available each year for training, and the proportion of a
lecturer's time that can be spent actually running classes, it
appears that 11 lecturers would be required.



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 20
No allowance is made in the above calculation for a backlog of
training calling for extra effort in the next few years. This
can in part be catered for by part time lecturers, some of them
recruited from outside the PNP/PTP.
Responsibility for training junior staff and manual workers rests
with the proposed Training and Development Managers at PNP/PTP's.
They will need help in designing effective training, while LPP
lecturers need help in adopting modern teaching methods, and in
producing visual aids, such as charts, slides, transparencies,
films, etc. It is proposed, therefore, that five people should be
appointed to a Teaching Methods and Liaison Division, who should
have particular skills in the selection of methods for teaching
adults. Their liaison duties with PNP/PTP's must be built on an
ability to help set up training sessions for manual workers in
informal, on-the-job situations.

4.7       Courses for lecturers and training managers
All the 28 Training and Development Managers will require instruction
in their duties, and particularly in the training methods that are
appropriate for junior staff and manual workers. This is most econo-
mically done by contracting with an organization which specializes



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 21
in providing training of this kind to arrange a course of about
four weeks duration within Indonesia, probably at LPP, Jogjakara.

The Management Division at LPP should have all its seven members
of staff trained at the Mananga Agricultural Management Center in
Swaziland, which itself can serve as model for this Division.
(See Appendix 3).

US$ 28,000
Other lecturers at LPP will require training overseas in modern
teaching methods. It is proposed that two members of each teaching
Division should receive this training, normally including the Head
of the Division.
Costs
Fees for 2 month courses @ $2,000

US$ 74,880
In agronomy and factory technology there will be need for some
travel and up-dating of knowledge by staff of LPP. This might in
part be met by consultants spending brief periods in discussion
with groups of staff. It is proposed that a sum of $75,000 should
be allocated for this prupose.
US$ 75,000
4.8       Training overseas for senior managers
Experienced managers of PNP/PTP's, or staff about to be appointed
to these or more senior posts should have the opportunity for



Annex 2
Section 7
Page 22
advanced management training overseas. It is proposed that five
senior staff should be sent for 6 months to advanced schools of
business management in the USA or Europe.
Costs
Travel @ US$2,000 x 5                             10,000
Subsistence @ $70 per day

US$ 98,000
4.9       Equipment
There is a need for a certain amount of equipment including overhead
projectors, a cine projector, tape recorders, etc. The sub-center
at Medan will also require more fully equipping with teaching aids.
The Business Management Division requires calculators of various
kinds. Two extra cars will be needed for additional staff, together
with their office furniture and equipment.
Cost
Audio-visual equipment                            15,000

Office equipment for 10 staff @ $1,000            10,000
US$ 90,000
4.10      Buildings
While it appears that lecture room space is adequate at LPP Jogjakarta,
there are no small rooms for syndicate work, and offices will need
to be provided for additional local and expatriate staff (total 9).
It is assumed that office space can be made available in Medan for
the five members of LPP staff to be retained here. Some provision
is proposed for alterations to buildings to provide the space
required, and a sum of $75,000 is proposed.
US$ 75,000

(Educational Institute for Estate Enterprises)
1.        Establishment
In September 1950, a State Sugar College was established with the
objective of training sugar technologists. In December 1961, it
was transformed into the State Sugar Academy, with the duration of
courses extended from two to three years, and the right to award
degrees (of B.Sc.). In July 1965, a Department of Accountancy was
added to run alongside the existing Department of Sugar Technology.
February 1970 saw a further change to the LPP as it now exists,
which involved the extension of its training facilities to cover
all the commodities produced on Government estates.
2.        Organization and Staffing
The LPP is organized in seven divisions:
1. Education and Training - sugar technology, other crops, tobacco.
2. Chemistry - technology, industrial, general, physical, chemistry.
3. Agronomy - agronomy laboratory, botany, pests and diseases, soil
and fertilizers.
4. Engineering - buildings, engines, electricity.
5. Socio-economics - management, social labor, economics.
6. Research and Extension - research, public services, alumni and
students, library.
7. Finance and Administration.
LPP is still orientated to the sugar industry, and very much less
attention is given to the production and processing of other crops,
or to questions of commercial management and administration. In
addition to the Director, there are 24 teaching staff supported by
nine assistants and 18 other staff members concerned mainly with
administration. Another 196 are employed in connection with the
students' living accommodation, Wisma LPP, drivers, cleaners, etc.
In addition, about 50 guest lecturers are used on an ad hoc basis,
mostly fron sugar producing PNP/PTP's and the Gajah Mada University.



Annex 2
Section 7
Appendix 1
Page 25
For the teaching staff there are five salary grades:
Rp per month
Grade   I  Assistant                      52,000
II  Senior Assistant           55-60,000
III  Junior Lecturer               66,000
IV  Lecturer                   70-90,000
V  Senior Lecturer          100-110,000
These salaries are slightly above comparable grades within the
PNP/PTP's and above salaries for university lecturers. However,
PNP/PTP management staff received bonuses for which LPP lecturers
are not eligible.
Within the seven divisions teaching staff are graded as follows:
Salary Grades
Division                    I    II    III    IV    V   TOTAL
Education & Training             1             1     1    1      4
Chemistry                        3     1             2    1      7

Totals             7     3       1     8          24
3.        Courses
There are four main types of courses:
(a) Management
Intended to meet the needs of Estate Managers, Plantation
Managers and Assistant Plantation Managers. The courses
normally last for 3 months, but may be longer for the more
junior level.
(b) Vocational
Numerically this is the most important kind of course. It
includes sugar technology, for factory operators; sugar
administration, which includes accounting together with some
management; the new management information system (as designed
by consultants SGV) is being taught.



Annex 2
Section 7
Appendix 1
Page 26
The duration of these courses is variable. In sugar technology
and accounting the course can be for three years. Sugar analysis,
and finance administration may be for 5 to 6 months. Machine
operators and plant supervisors have a course available of about
one month, while a one week course is available on administration.
(c) Refresher Courses
These courses are usually for senior managers - the heads of
production and commercial divisions at PNP/PTP headquarters.
They last from two to four weeks.
(d) Special Courses
These are arranged at the request of PNP/PTP's, and usually
involve aspects of management. They are sometimes arranged in
conjunction with other Government departments. There will be a
need shortly for special courses to upgrade operatives in sugar
factories as new ones come into operation.
Note
Throughout the descriptive material about courses currently available
the word "management" is used to include techniques. Thus, for
example, the role of nitrogen in plant nutrition is regarded as
chemistry, but the use of a nitrogenous fertilizer for oil palm is
regarded as management. Thus the "management" courses referred to
at (a) above are not management courses as generally referred to in
the western world. Management separate from technique is not
generally understood.
4.        Facilities
In general the LPP is well provided with buildings. One three-story
building accommodates lecture rooms, library, conference room and
administrative offices, while another similar building houses
laboratories and workshops. There is an auditorium, and dormitory
accommodation for 120. On a separate site there is a guest house
(LPP Wisma) for 100 people (50 rooms) run on the lines of a first
class hotel.
Summary
9 classrooms - can accommodate about 300
9 laboratories
15 offices
6 conference rooms
1 auditorium - can accommodate up to 350 people
15 houses for senior staff
7 houses for junior staff



Annex 2
Section 7
Appendix 1
Page 27
There are two small areas of land for experimental purposes. One
of 1.7 hectares is about 2 miles away and a second of 0.2 ha is 20
miles away. The latter is equipped with a bungalow which is
available for the temporary use of staff.
Three buses and eight cars are available for tansporting staff and
students.
5.        Budget
The LPP has a budget for 1975 of Rp 320,697,000 (US$772,764) of which
Rp 83,350,000 (US$200,843) is for investment in buildings, vehicles
etc. In 1976 it is anticipated that there will be an increase of
17% to Rp 376,094,000 (US$806,250) of which Rp 94,102,000 (US$226,752)
will be for investment.
With student attendance of 450-500 per annum the cost per student/month
is about Rp 66,000 (US$160).
6.        Teaching Methods
There appears to be almost total reliance on lectures as the teaching
method, supplemented by laboratory and drawing office practicals,
whether for young people receiving technical training or for experi-
enced managers. Discussion, exercises, case studies or business
games appeared to play a very minor part in management training.
Lecture sessions were sometimes very long.
7.        Basic Education of those attending LPP Courses
Children in Indonesia will normally attend 6 years at Primary School,
followed by 3 years at Junior High School. Some will then go on to
a further 3 years at one of the three kinds of High Schools -
Agricultural, Technical or General. After High School they may go
on to a university or college.
Sugar Technologists are usually recruited after High School; Labora-
tory Technicians probably after Junior High School. Until a few
years ago, estate/plantation managers were recruited from Agricultural
High School but at the present time they come from a university.

Training and Development Managers at PNP/PTP
1.        The Training and Development Manager (TDM) at PNP/PTP headquarters
is concerned with the maximum utilization of the abilities of all
employees in the interests of the DGE. He must ensure that potential
skills are developed so that there is a steadily improving level of
performance in all operations in administration, plantation and
factory.
2.        The development of employees must be considered in the light of
technical economic and managerial improvements becoming available
as the result of research and experience. The TMD must therefore
be fully aware at all times of current and future plans for his
PNP/PTP so that he can arrange to have people trained to meet new
situations and different problems. He must be actively concerned
with PNP/PTP development as a whole.
3.        To do this work he must have the confidence of the Manager and senior
staff at PNP/PTP headquarters. He must have the respect of Estate
Managers and be able to discuss plans and problems with them as an
equal. By standing back from the day to day problems of plantations
and factories, he should be able better to identify the way in
which training can help to overcome them.
4.        A thorough understanding of plantation and factory operation is a
basic requirement of a TDM, and recruitment from amongst the best
Estate or Factory Managers is advocated. An appointment limited to
5-8 years will ensure that a TDM can regard it as an opportunity to
increase his understanding of the whole scope of PNP/PTP operations
in peparation for promotion, possibly to Production Manager. At
the termination of his TDM appointment he can be confident of
returning to the management work.
5.        Outside the confines of the PNP/PTP, the TDM will need to discover
training facilities available at technical training centers, in
government departments and by consultants. In this respect the
most important training agency is the LPP at Jogjakarta (with sub-
center at Medan) and an important part of his duties is to maintain
contact with LPP, and in cooperation with LPP staff, to evaluate
and improve the LPP courses being offered. Another reason for his
contact with LPP is to obtain assistance in arranging on-the-job
and other local, short term training for artisans and other PNP/PTP
junior workers.
6.        The TDM needs freedom to attend to his own training and development,
carried forward in consultation with his PNP/PTP Manager, and the
Director of LPP. He will need to visit training institutions,
research stations and TDM's at other PNP/PTP's. His activities can
provide an avenue along which new and improved techniques are
introduced from outside his own PNP/PTP.

Business Management
The success of PNP/PTP's turns on the ability of management staff
to organize the resources available in order to produce efficiently
and profitably. "Business Management" is the kernel of the managers'
task, and training in this respect is crucial in bringing about an
improvement in the whole DGE system. The Commonwealth Development
Corporation's international management center in Swaziland has
successfully provided training of this kind for experienced estate
managers, and the syllabus and introductory notes handed to partici-
pants in the three-month course are appended. They provide an
outline for the work of the Management Division at LPP, Jogjakarta.

Syllabus and Notes on Projects and Options
1.        Course Objectives
1.1       Subjects covered.  This course is not concerned with providing train-
ing in the technical problems of agriculture. We shall not discuss
the relative merits of varieties of sugar cane, or what herbicides
to use to control weeds in rice. We shall devote the time to consider-
ing how to make economic decisions to ensure profitable production;
how to combine men, machinery and materials so that objecives can
be reached efficiently; and how records can be designed to help in
planning and control. In seeking how to organize other people
better, you will find that you will be able to examine yourself in
your role as a manager.
1.2       Developing managerial ability.  Our object in the three months that
you are at MAMC is to create a situation in which you will develop
and improve your ability as a manager in agriculture. We have in
mind a picture of your work and responsibilities and the whole
program is related to this. We do not try to include everything in
management, but only those methods and practices that you can
probably use back home. Throughout the course we shall discuss
principles, and then seek to see how these are applied on our own
farm or on neighboring estates. A real effort will be needed from
you to perceive how you could apply the principles under your
conditions. The staff will also help in discussion, but will not
attempt to tell you exactly what you should do. Exercises based on
field observations or case studies in which work is done in small
groups are designed to help you to see how to apply new knowledge in
practical situations.



Annex 2
Section 7
Appendix 3
Page 30
1.3       Learning and understanding. You may find our approach to teaching
different from what you expect. We do not attempt to tell you how
to do your job, but help you to learn for yourself how to do it.
This calls for a sustained effort from you to see how to use what
you will learn about.  We are not looking for the one correct
answer, because it does not exist; by exercises, discussion and
argument we seek to give you understanding.
2.        Course Program
The course falls into four main divisions outlined below.
2.1       The core program.  On the first five weeks we cover the basic
language of agricultural business mangement. This is dealt with in
three broad divisions: theory and practice of management (see
para. 3 below); financial analysis, planning and control (para. 4);
and skills of working with people (para. 5).
2.2       Projects and options.  During the second period of five weeks the
course broadens in scope, still covering the core program, and
composed of a series of projects and optional subjects. The
projects (see para. 6) are normally interactive group exercises
which explore areas and concepts in agricultural management.
Active learning is the foundation for this project work. You can
choose from a list of seventeen optional subjects a number for more
detailed study that are particularly relevant to your work and your
organization (see para. 7).
2.3       Tutorials.  Throughout the twelve weeks, course members will indi-
vidually discuss the previous week's work with a member of staff.
By reviewing comprehension, relevance and involvement, the course
member can be helped to monitor his learning and enhance the
benefit from the course.
2.4       Review and evaluation.  In the last two weeks of the course we
look at wider issues concerning agricultural development and the
management of agricultural organizations. Through discussion and
exercises we hope to integrate the learning of the previous ten
weeks and consider the transfer of the learning into your work
situation.
3.        Theory and Practice of Management
During this part of the core program we will examine the theoretical
and practical basis of management, so that course members may
deepen their understanding of the processes of management. The
following areas are discussed:

Decision-making and problem solving.
Co-ordination and delegation.
Systems thinking.
4.        Financial Analysis, Planning and Control
This is the second part of the core program.
4.1       Financial accounting.  This section is designed to give a broad
appreciation of the financial accountant's function and the informa-
tion he requires from the operating manager. Subject matter will
include:
Capital
Cash analysis
Valuation and depreciation
Profit and loss account
Balance sheet
4.2       Control accounting.  This section is concerned mainly with conven-
tional cost accounting as applied to agricultural estates, with
emphasis on budgetary control and variance analysis.
Data collection, presentation and analysis
Cash flow budgets
Cost accounting
Budgetary control
Performance analysis
4.3       Decision accounting.  This is the largest section of this part of the
core program. The concept of the margin is introduced, and its
relevance to the work of the manager is thoroughly explored. The
various aspects include:
The margin
Fixed and variable costs
Gross budgets
Break-even budgets
Planning resources use
5.        Skills of Working with People
5.1       Organizations and their environments.  The way in which people behave
in organizations depends upon many factors. Some are due to the
organization's environment and others to the fact that people
differ and see things from different points of view. The organiza-
tion's environment is influenced by such things as the nature of the



Annex 2

Appendix 3
Page 32
organization, the arrangement of work, the composition of work
groups, and the cultural influences of national and local communi-
ties. At the individual level, people bring to their work their
attitudes, abilities and personalities as well as their wants and
expectations.
5.2       Small groups.  This part of the core program is concerned with the
individual in the context of small groups and the organization as a
whole. By examining the operations of small groups and the action
of individuals within them, course members will get an opportunity
to gain further insight into their own behavior. The issues and
topics covered will be:
Interpersonal behavior
Authority, power and influence
Motivation
Leadership
Performance of work groups
Interaction of groups
Role conflict
5.3       Working with people.  An opportunity to analyze, try out and practice
the skills of working with people will form an important part of this
aspect of the twelve weeks and will include special emphasis upon:
Working in groups - the dynamics of group behavior
Selective perception
Face to face communication
Developing effective listening skills
Influencing behavior - appraisal and interviewing
Communications networks - conflict and cooperation in groups
Committee work skills
Intergroup communications - negotiations
6.        Projects
There are periods of active learning when studies and exercises are
arranged for small groups. Conclusions are reported verbally, or
in writing and are normally discussed by all course participants.
6.1       The course participant in his organization.  We work for a wide range
of organizations and in them hold diverse positions. In this early
project we shall explore the different type of work we are each
engaged upon, and try to relate our work and aspirations to the
functioning and goals of our organization.
6.2       On being a ma Mager.  What do we know about managers' jobs in the field
of agriculture? What is management? How do managers spend their
time? How can managers' jobs be compared or evaluated? During
this project we shall explore our views and other people's answers
to these questions with the object of increasing our understanding
of the processes of management.

6.3       Relationships at work.  Many classes of people solve problems and
distribute their time over a variety of tasks. The uniqueness of
the manager lies in his relationship with other people, all of whom
are ostensibly devoting their efforts to the same ends. Insofar as
the manager is a source of initiative and change, he is required to
instruct and control individuals and groups of people, and to
persuade them to carry out his instructions in an efficient manner.
He needs, therefore, to be able to predict their responses to his
actions. Generally, a manager's action will be based on the
"models" he has of the operation of the social system of which he
is a part. The models, consciously or unconsciously created by
himself, reflect the way he thinks the system works. In every case,
many of the components of his models are determined by forces over
which he has no control. Equally, the people with whom he deals
will have their often very different models of the same system of
which they also are a part. Managers, therefore, need to consider
the origins and validity of their own models, and to learn something
of the nature and strength of the forces which have determined
those of other people. Our intention will be to explore course
members' models of their working relations and the forces affecting
their operating environment.
6.4       The study of leadership and management styles.  The concepts of
leadership and management style are highlighted in most literature
on management. Recent writing on these two concepts will be
explored through a combination of discussions, exercises and films.
6.5       The rational manager.  MIost writings on management emphasize the
importance  of decision making as an element of the work of the
manager.  The term 'decision making' tends to include all the
rational processes involved from the setting of objectives to the
choice of means for ahcieving them.  The study of this topic will
be concerned with distinguishing the variables which determine the
character of the processes in different instances.
6.6       The study of agricultural organizations.  The study of the struc-
ture and function of organizations and the behavior of groups
and individuals within them is basic to any study of management.
Organizations are particularly affected by the nature of their
environment and technology. Our intention is to explore the
different approaches to the organization of estates, settlement
schemes, cooperatives, individual farms and government institutions.
There will be an opportunity for course members to study the
particular organization of which they are a part.
6.7       Management and change.  Probably the greatest of all problems for
the manager is rapid change. This project, therefore, is devoted to
considering the impact of change on your job. How managers react
to change has, indeed, an important influence on the future of



Annex 2
Section 7
Appendix 3
Page 34
organizations and of whole countries. We will explore some of the
important sources of major change affecting management in tropical
and sub-tropical agriculture.
6.8       Shtaffel.  Shtaffel is a hand-operated business game which is
intended to generate a serious, committed discussion in the area of
management development. The game concerns itself with questions
such as:
How do companies treat their staff in order to get the greatest
value from their services?
What are the constraints that prevent them from doing all that
they might like for their staff?
How do people respond to the attitudes that can be adopted
towards them by their employer?
6.9       Organizational control and performance.  In our lectures and exer-
cises throughout the courses, problems of working within an organiza-
tion, of leadership concerned with welding together the work of
disparate grcups, of the design of organizations and of their
systems and procedures. This project is devised for the course
member to participate in an experimental approach to learning about
organizations management.
6.10      Career planning and proposals for action.  How much influence should
an individual have over his own career? How much can he have?
Should the individual busy himself solely with doing his present
job as well as possible, leaving Providence or the management
development department to look after the future? Or should he
devote time to preparing himself for future challenges? Should he
float with the current of life or should he pick up the oars and
influence his own course?
What can you identify in this respect in the way you intend to
manage?
What proposals for action have you in those areas for which you
are responsible?
What difficulties do you foresee, and how do you propose to overcome
them?
A series of exercises have been collected together to enable you to
explore these questions in relation to your long term career and
your work on returning from MAMC.

6.11      Economic development and commodity marketing.  This section is made
up of a few seminars designed to give background information rather
than to provide training in expertise. The place of agriculture in
economic development and efficient marketing are pivots upon which
agricultural production in the field depend. But managers attending
this course are not concerned with decision-making in this area,
and the subjects will only be dealt with superficially.
6.12      Training.  This covers a basic introduction to how to design and
operate a training program. Examples will be taken from the system
operating in one of the larger local companies.
7.        Options.
The following optional subjects are offered to cater for the needs
of the individual and to enable him to meet the situation in which
he operates. About half a dozen can be selected after discussion
with teaching staff to ensure that those chosen are relevant to your
work and your organization.
7.1       Planning the small farm (10 hours).  The small farmer growing a
mixture of annual crops has a certain flexibility in his choice of
program and the allocation of resources to it, which is denied the
large plantation/estate manager. The option shows the concepts
which can be used to obtain optimum resource/enterprise combination.
An exercise using program planning demonstrates these concepts.
7.2       Reward system (4 hours).  The structure and use of reward systems
can be studied which are applicable either to large organizations
or to small scale farming.
7.3       Settlement schemes (8 hours).  One of the institutional structures
being utilized in the development of agriculture is the settlement
scheme. From visits, discussions and guided reading, we shall
explore the varying approaches being used in different situations.
7.4       Large scale harvesting and transportation systems (4 hours).  There
are many choices available to managers in the design and operation
of large scale harvesting and transportation systems. Taking the
Northern Area Sugar Industry in Swaziland as an interesting example,
we shall explore the problems and possibilities with sugar cane.
Visits, discussions and reading will allow a full exploration of
this topical subject.
7.5       Innovation and change in agriculture (4 hours).  The diffusion of
innovation has particular relevance in the context of agriculture
in Africa. Taking an example from Swaziland, we shall explore some
factors which affect the acceptance and diffusion of new ideas.

7.6       Labor relations on agricultural estates (6 hours).  Works councils,
trade unions, arbitration boards and Ndabazabantus are amongst the
institutions available for formal negotiating relationships between
management and labor. Through reading, discussion and exercises we
shall consider some of these approaches in large scale agriculture
today.
7.7       Labor development and control (9 hours).  MIanagers are involved in
the planning of work for other people to perform. This option is
involved in investigating the concepts behind this action and also
the practical problems of transmitting the planning into activity.
Time will be spent on the communication problems involved in job
instruction and upon the managerial responsibility for staff
development at all levels.
7.8       Decision making under uncertainity (4 hours).  This option consists
of a basic exposition of some of the principles of decision theory
as applied to agriculture. Part of the option will involve an
exercise based on local estates.
7.9       Principles of credit appraisal (4 hours).  A number of course
members are sponsored by rural credit agencies, where appraisal
of loan applications will form a large part of their work. This
option will give an opportunity to examine the principles involved
and the practices applied in different parts of the world.
7.10      Problem 6lving and investigation in management (10 hours).  The topic
will provide insight into the fundamental nature of problems and the
thinking processes by which they are solved. Utilizing a practical
situation on our own farm, course members will have an opportunity
to develop their own problem solving ability.
7.11      Project appraisal (12 hours).  The option will cover the standard
methods available for capital investment and project appraisal.
The quantitative method of discounting cash flow and sensitivity
analysis will form the main part of the option.
7.12      Human relations workshop (26 hours).  An opportunity to practice
and develop the interpersonal skills which fall into the categories
of communications, influence (leadership) and decision-making in
both the two person and group situations. Members select their own
learning objectives which are achieved by exercises, short projects
and selected reading. Feedback on the activities is used as a rich
source of personal learning during the period of the workshop.
7.13      Cooperative estate accounting systems (4 hours).  The object of this
option i. to show the essential features of three different estate
accountii systems. The accountants for the 3 estates will give a
short lecture on the principles and features of each system which
will be followed by discussion. The emphasis will be on showing



Annex 2
Section 7
Appendix 3
Page 37
what information the accountant requires from the manager, what he
does with it and the information which is fed back to the manager
in the form of management accounts.
7.14      Critical path analysis (14 hours).  Critical path analysis is the
organized application of reasoning for planning, scheduling and
controlling practical situations where many separate jobs, which
make up the whole task, can happen simultaneously or in sequence
such that it is difficult intuitively to establish the relationship
between separate jobs. Examples will be taken from typical agricul-
tural development projecs.
7.15      Machinery planning, control and replacement (4 hours).  These
sessions will cover the quantitative approaches to machinery
planning, control and replacement.
7.16      Rural education (8 hours).  Much time and finance have been spent
on planning and providing education facilities. Very little
thought has been given to the particular demands of the farmer and
his family in isolated rural areas. This option gives an opportunity
firstly to re-examine the educational systems common in the devel-
oping countries and their relevance to the rural community, and
secondly to investigate the factors which are necessary to provide
a more relevant vocational training for the farm family.
7.17      Development and modernization (8 hours).  Many different views are
put forward by economists, sociologists and others concerning the
structural changes required for development and modernization. We
shall consider the relevance of land reform, education, institutional
formation and technology to this issue.
