in their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods,
or the ex-factory price for domestically-manufactured goods;
(ii) customs duties and other import taxes on imported goods,
and sales and similar taxes on domestically-supplied goods, shall
be excluded; and (iii) the cost to the Borrower of inland freight
and other expenditures incidental to the delivery of goods to
the place of their use or installation shall be included.

Indonesia if the bidder shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that
the manufacturing cost of such goods includes a
value added in Indonesia equal to at least 20%

comparison only, an amount equal to (i) the amount of customs
duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would
have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such
group C bid; or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods

SCHEDULE 7
Provisions to be Included
in Smallholder Financing Arrangements
1.   The Smallholder Financing Arrangements shall consist of:
(a) a Financing Agreement between BI, acting for and on
behalf of the Borrower, and BRI, to provide for the channeling of
the proceeds of the Loan allocated to Credit Expenditures for Part
A of the Project, and the Borrower's contribution to the financing
of such Credit Expenditures, to BRI; and
(b) Sub-Financing Agreements respectively between BRI and
PTP V and between BRI and PNP X, to provide for the further chan-
neling of the funds referred to under paragraph 1 (a) respectively
to PTP V and PNP X.
2.   The Financing Agreement referred to under paragraph 1 (a)
shall require BI, inter alia, to make available to BRI the pro-
ceeds of the Loan withdrawn for Credit Expenditures (presently
estimated at about $22,000,000 equivalent), and all such addi-
tional funds as are allocated by the Borrower (presently estimated
at about Rupiahs 5.8 billion through FY 1982, as detailed in
paragraph 3 below) to cover the total requirements for Credit
Expenditures. For these purposes, Credit Expenditures shall
be defined as those expenditures for Part A of the Project which
are intended to be recovered from Participating Settlers through
rubber collections, and shall include the costs of:
(i) land clearing;
(ii) fertilizers and chemicals (including pesticides);
(iii) wages and salaries of Participating Settlers and
casual labor;
(iv) machinery, vehicles and equipment for rubber
development;
(v) settler housing;
(vi) a subsistence package including first year seed and
fertilizer and cash payments not exceding 15,000
Rupiahs per family;


﻿- 51 -
(vii) primary and secondary estate roads and farm tracks;
and
(viii) estate overhead costs as approved by DGE of about
15% of the direct costs of rubber establishment and
related machinery and equipment (other than
vehicles).
3.   The Borrower's contribution to meet the total requirements
for Credit Expenditures shall be provided from sources in the
Ministry of Finance on the basis of approved annual budgets. The
Borrower's annual contributions to meet these requirements are
presently estimated as follows:
FY 1977             Rupiahs   800 million
FY 1978             Rupiahs   800 million
FY 1979             Rupiahs 1,200 million
FY 1980             Rupiahs 1,400 million
FY 1981             Rupiahs 1,100 million
FY 1982             Rupiahs   500 million
TOTAL             5,800 million
4.   BI shall, under the Financing Agreement with BRI, make
available to BRI, and BRI shall, under Sub-Financing Agreements
respectively with PTP V and PNP X, make available to PTP V and PNP
X, the amounts required to meet Credit Expenditures respectively
for Parts A.1 and A.2 of the Project (including both the amounts
to be provided by the Borrower and those to be provided from the
proceeds of the Loan). Such amounts shall be determined on the
basis of annual budgets approved at least 3 months before the
start of each fiscal year, and shall be advanced to PTP V and PNP
X quarterly, sufficiently in advance so as to enable PTP V and PNP
X to carry out their respective functions under Part A of the
Project without delays resulting from unavailability of funds. To
enable BRI to release in time the required funds to PTP V and PNP
X, the Financing Agreement shall provide for arrangements under
which such funds will be made available to BRI in advance of BRI's
need to release such funds to PTP V/PNP X. PTP V and PNP X shall
be authorized, within the approved annual budgets, and subject to


﻿- 52 -
the approval of DGE, to anticipate their quarterly requirements
should project implementation proceed more rapidly than planned,
provided adequate notice thereof is given to BRI and BI. Without
limitation upon the foregoing, advances to PTP V and PNP X to meet
their quarterly requirements shall include the requirements to be
met from the Borrower's contribution and those to be financed from
the proceeds of the Loan.
5.   The requirements for Credit Expenditures are presently
estimated to be financed as follows:
Part A.1 (PTP V)
From the proceeds of the Loan: the equivalent of
$13,000,000
From the Borrower: Rupiahs 3,700 million
Part A.2 (PNP X)
From the proceeds of the Loan: the equivalent of
$9,000,000
From the Borrower: Rupiahs 2,100 million
6.   The funds to be made available by BI to BRI and by BRI to PTP
V and PNP X, respectively, as set forth above, shall be risk free
to BRI, PTP V and PNP X; that is, such funds shall be repayable:
(i) by PTP V (or, when PTP V is replaced by PNP I as the Bor-
rower's designated representative for collection of Participating
Settler debt obligations, by PNP I) and PNP X to BRI, only from
the proceeds of rubber received from Participating Settlers, in
accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraph 9 below, and
(ii) by BRI to BI, only from repayments received by BRI from PTP V
(or PNP I) and PNP X pursuant to (i) above.
7.   BI and BRI shall be paid a handling fee in the aggregate at
the rate of 0.5% per annum on the amounts disbursed to PTP V and
PNP X for Credit Expenditures and outstanding, or at such other
rate as the Borrower, BI and BRI may agree, said fee to be divided
among BI and BRI as the parties may agree from time to time. Said
handling fee shall not be included as a part of Credit Expendi-
tures to be recovered from Participating Settlers, and shall be
payable semi-annually by the Borrower directly to BI and BRI.


﻿- 53 -
8.   PTP V and PNP X shall be required to establish and maintain
appropriate accounts to record all Credit Expenditures. After the
third year of settlement, BRI shall establish and maintain
individual smallholder accounts for Participating Settlers, to
which shall be charged each Participating Settler's share of
Credit Expenditures, in accordance with criteria and procedures to
be agreed between the Borrower, BRI and the Bank.
9.   BRI, PTP V and PNP X shall require Participating Settlers to
enter into Credit Agreements under which each Participating
Settler will agree, inter alia, to repay his share of Credit
Expenditures charged to his individual smallholders' account, in
kind, on the following basis:
(i)  the Participating Settler's debt obligation shall
bear no interest during the first three years and
shall bear interest thereafter at the rate of 12%
per annum on the amounts outstanding, said interest
to be capitalized and added to principal during the
following three years, and payable thereafter
starting in the 7th year until the principal amount
is fully repaid;
(ii)  principal shall be amortized over not more than 15
years commencing in the 7th year;
(iii) Participating Settlers shall be required to deliver
periodically (on a weekly basis) to the respective
nucleus estates in payment of debt obligations,
fixed quantities of rubber expressed in kilograms
established from time to time by decision of the
Provincial Coordinating Committees, on the basis of
estimated average annual yields of smallholders
from 2 ha of rubber, not to exceed 25% of such
yields per annum;
(iv)  Participating Settlers shall be credited for the
rubber so delivered in payment of debt obligations
(and any additional rubber offered for sale to the
nucleus estate) at the prices determined from time
to time by the respective Provincial Coordinating
Committees in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.10 of the Loan Agreement; and
(v) grace and repayment periods shall be measured from
the year in which block-planted rubber allocated to
a Participating Settler was planted.
