Under the estate development\n            component of the project about 20,500 ha of rubber will be\n            newly planted, replanted, or rehabilitated; 4,200 ha of\n            coconuts and 5,000 ha of oil palm will be planted; and\n            necessary palm oil and rubber processing facilities will be\n            constructed. Benefits to smallholders have been estimated on\n            the basis of increased annual incomes from about $250\n            currently to $800 after year 10 (constant 1976 $).
