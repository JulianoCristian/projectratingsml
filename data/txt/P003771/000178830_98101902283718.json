component the Second\n            Nucleus Estates/First Smallholders Project aims to assist\n            5,750 smallholder farmers by supplying 11,500 ha of rubber\n            holdings in Sumatra block planted by public sector estates.\n            Settlement costs will be repaid during a five-year period\n            from proceeds of rubber sales. Under the estate development\n            component of the project about 20,500 ha of rubber will be\n            newly planted, replanted, or rehabilitated; 4,200 ha of\n            coconuts and 5,000 ha of oil palm will be planted; and\n            necessary palm oil and rubber processing facilities will be\n            constructed. Benefits to smallholders have been estimated on\n            the basis of increased annual incomes from about $250\n            currently to $800 after year 10 (constant 1976 $). Increased\n            estate production will generate foreign exchange earnings\n            and higher tax dividend transfers to the Government."}, "docdt": "1977-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
