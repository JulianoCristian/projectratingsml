Re:
COLOMBIA: Loan 3250-CO (Rural Development Investment
Project) Amendment to the Loan Agreement
This is in connection with the Loan Agreement for the above Project between 
Republic of Colombia (the Borrower) and the Bank, and the Project Agreement, also for 
the above,  between the Bank and Fondo DRI,  both dated September 14, 1990 and as 
amended up to the date herewith. More specifically, we are responding to the letter 
from Fondo DRI's Director General dated July 5, 1996.
We are pleased to tell you that we agree to said Director General's requests, as 
follows:
Firstly, and relying upon the statements and representations made by said 
Director General in the aforesaid letter, particularly in respect of the Eligible 
Subprojects (for each of which a Contrato de Cofinancion will eventually be entered 
into) listed in Annex 4 to said letter and in respect of the information contained in 
Annex 5 to said letter, the condition stated in our telex dated December 22, 1995 in 
connection with disbursements of Loan proceeds under Category 1 of the 
table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement, is hereby modified as 
follows: the Bank will honor new commitments under the said Category for any such 
Contrato, only if the Contrato in question has been signed on or before December 31, 
1995 or if the Contrato in question, having been signed thereafter, is for one of the 
587 Eligible Subprojects listed in the aforesaid Annex 4 to the July 5, 1996 letter.
Secondly, and in order to make possible the full disbursement of the Loan 
proceeds by the Closing Date, or close thereto, the following amendments are made in 
the table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement (the 
Disbursement Table):
(i)
the disbursement percentage for Category 2 of said table is hereby 
increased 
from 70 to 95 in respect of payments made for local 
expenditures after June 1, 
1996; and
 
(ii)
(A) the amount in Category 3, Unallocated, is hereby reallocated 
to Category 
1; (B) the amount of Loan proceeds allocated to Category 2 
(a) is reduced to 
$70,397.00; and (C) the corresponding amount for 
Category 1 is hereby 
increased to $67,929,603.00.
 
Please  date and sign, on behalf of the Borrower, the form of agreement hereto 
attached and return it to the Bank's office in Bogota. This letter will become 
effective on the date herewith,
except for its portion related to the amendment of the Disbursement Table which shall 
become effective, retroactively to June 1, 1996, upon receipt of your notice informing 
the Bank of the signing and delivery to the said Bank office of the aforesaid form of 
agreement.
In view of his interest in this matter we are also sending a copy of this letter 
to the Director General of Fondo DRI.
Very truly yours,
By /s/ Peter Ludwig
