1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Colombia for US$75.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan, which would be repayable in 17 years,
including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable irterest
rate, would help to finance a rural development investment program.
2.       Backaround. Colombia has an estimated 1.0 million smallholder
farmers who cultivate 78? of the total farms in the country, and who
produce about 60? of the basic foodstuffs and 202 of the industrial raw
material derived from agriculture. About 60Z of the rural labor force is
employed in small-scale agriculture, with heavy concentration in the
mountainous Andean region where soils are prone to erosion. Between
1977-1990, the Government implemented a rural development program under the
direction of the Fund for Integrated Rural Development (DRI) to improve tte
productivity and welfare of low iacome farm families in about 332
municipalities. The implementation of this DRI program has been quite
successful, its design incorporating a number of the more successful
features of rural development efforts identified in the Bank's Report on
Experience with Rural Development (Report No. 6883), in that its (a) uses
existing institutionsistructures to implement projects; (b) coordinates its
assistance with other sectoral programs; and (c) backs up its production
component with extension services and suitable technology. The Bank has
supported this program through two projects. An evaluation of the first
project (Loan 1352-CO) has shown imp;essive yield increases for crops such
ass cassava (103?), maize (67Z), and be.ans (722), and family incomes of
beneficiaries rose substantially. Similarly, an initial impact study done
recently for one district which has benefited from the second project
(Loan 2174-CO, closed June 30, 1990), has shown significant improvements in
the living standards of beneficiaries and a 37? internal rate of return for
the agricultural production component.
3.       In 1988, the Government requested the Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank (tDB) to help prepare and cofinance a follow-on Rural
Development Investment Program (RDIP), with a view toward helping it to:
(i) sustain the positive results achieved under the earlier two projects in
332 municipalities during 1977 to 1990; (ii) incorporate an additional 270
municipalities into the program, thereby expanding the coverage to 602
municipalities, encompassing about 9,000 rural communities; and
(iii) implement the 1986 to 1989 decentralization reforms whereby, in
contrast to the previous DRI projects (under which all funding for rural
investments came through central line agencies' budgets without the direct
participation of the municipalities), DRI would now cofinance projects with
municipalities which would receive 502 of the Value Added Tax (IVA)
transfers by 1992. Municipalities must earmark 22 of the IVA transfers
annually for rural development projects. The projected level of IVA
transfers to the participating municipalities is adequate to cover



-2
cofinancing countterpart funds for the RDIP. Another change in the
firarcing arrangement under the RDIP is that in constrast with the two
earlier DRI projects, the municipalities would finance education, health
and power projects directly with the respective ministries leaving DRI to
cofinance only projects supportive of agricultural production. The
proposed RDIP would encompass rural roads, water supply, sanitation and
extension services, as well as rural markets, watershed management and
environmental protection, fisheries and rural women projects. With respect
to the provision of extension services, the decentralization reforms
require that municipalities provide extension by 1992, either through the
establishment of their own Technical Assistance Units (TAU) andlor by
hiring specialized organizations in this field, such as, the Colombia
Agricultural Institute (ICA), the Agricultural, Industrial and Mining
Credit Bank (Caja Agraria), universities, etc. By 1992, however, the
reforms also require the national research agency, ICA, to give up its
extension function in order to concentrate on research and technology
transfer. In support of this, the Bank is helping the Government to
establish under a separate project (Technology Transfer and Extension):
(i) a national technology transfer system to strengthen ICA's cspacity to
provide technology to municipal extension services through applied research
centers (CRECEDs); and (iiP a mechanism for the Ministry of Agriculture to
monitor and ensure the quality of municipal extension services. The
executing agency for the proposed RDIP, DRI is a decentralizad agency of
the Ministry of Agriculture with itL own legal structure, administrative
autonomy and assets. Its headquarters is in Bogota, and it has 21 regional
offices, with a total staff of 325. Of these, 102 professionals are in
Bogota and 105 are in the 21 regions. DRI's General Manager is appointed
by the President of the Republic, the Minister of Agriculture, and is
t-hairman of the Board of Directors. The Board includes representatives of
all the decentralized entities in the agricultural sector. The
participation of the heads of the other agencies in DRI's Board would
facilitate coordination of the RDIP investments in agriculture, which would
complement the coordination to be done by the Technical Council for
Regional Coordination in respect of rural roads projects. During the past
two years, DRI has worked jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Finance, the National Planning Department, and elected officials and
community leaders, to establish the operational, financial, institutional
and legal framework for the execution of the RDIP. It has introduced new
instruments for grassroot participation in the identification of projects
(through preparation of Community Profiles), and it has strengthened its
management capabilities through the introduction of a comprehensive
Operational Manual and Annual Investment and Operating Plans. These
improvements are expected to strengthen DRI's and the municipalitie,
capacity to plan and implement the RDIP.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's support for the RDIP
fits well with the Government's strategy for alleviating poverty and
helping the municipalities to become more self reliant, as envisaged under
the decentralization reforms. The Bank's strategy besides giving priority
to poverty alleviation, also emphasizes support for improvements in
efficiency of key economic sectors, together with some structural changes
at the macroeconomic and sector levels. The Bank supports the Government's
anti-poverty strategy because the strategy is explicitly set within the
framework of overall macroeconomic policies. On the premise that the
country can best eradicate poverty by sustaining high economic growth and
thereby expanding the overall demand for labor, the Government seeks to



-3
achieve steady GDP growth (around 5Z per annum during 1987-1990) combined
with continued sound fiscal and external management. Also, beyond
attaining the overall growth targets, the Government supports expanding
specific programs designed to increase the productivity and employment
opportunities of the poor, such as through rural development projects,
education and health.  To this e-'d the Bank's assistance to agriculture
pursues two broad objectivess the efficient growth of the sector, and
rural poverty alleviation. The Bank is pursuing these objectives through
activities aimed ats (a) generating and promoting adaptation and transfer
of new technology; (b) assisting in the rationalization of the extension
system and improving credit delivery services in rural areas; and (c)
providing support in infrastructure, mainly irrigation and rural roads.
Proiect Obiectives
5.       The overall objectives of the proposed RDIP are tot  (a) increase
the income of about 280,000 poor farmers and fishermen in approximately
9,000 rural communities (in 602 municipalities) mainly in the Andean and
coastal areas of Colombia- (b) improve living standards of the rural
communities through provision of potable water and better sanitation
systems, roads and marketing facilities; (c) protect and develop watershed
areas to safeguard the environment and help ensure sustainable supplies of
clean water for drinking and irrigation; (d) promote grassroots involvement
of rural communities in the identification of investment needs and the
maintenance thereof; and (e) strengthen the capabilities of DRI to plan,
prepare, appraise, supervise and help the municipalities to implement
d.velopment projecte. The RDIP, like its predecessors. the first and
second DRI projects, would continue to emphasize support of production-
oriented investments.
Prolect Description
6.       The RDIP would finance a time-slice of DRI's program consisting of
small discrete projects ins (a) Aarikultural Production and Environmental
Protection (technology adaptation and extension, watershed management and
environmental protection, fisheries, and marketing) for US$68.3 million
(27.32); (b) Trainina and gommunity Organization (support for:
ti) organizing rural communities to participate with municipal governments
and DRI in identifying projects; (ii) forming associatilL's of rural women
to promote cottage enterprises and better health care ana education; aad
(iii) training extension agents, municipal mayors, technicians from
regional develop,ent corporations, DRI staff and rural communities in
environmental management aspects of projects) for US$29.0 million (11.62);
(c) Infrastructure (rural roads and water supply and sanitation) for
US$107.2 million (42.92); and (d) Strengthening of DRI and the
municipalities (technical assistance, training, vehicles, equipment and
preinvestment studies for the preparation of projects for inclusion in the
RDIP in the outer years (1991-1994)) for US$8.7 million (3.51), excluding
physical and price contingencies (US$36.8 million (14.72)). The qost
-figures-shown for each of the above-mentioned projects are estimates and
are provided here for planning purposes only. The final allocation for
each of the above-mentioned projects would be determined by the annual
demand from the rural communities and the municipalities.   The RDIP would
assist 9,000 communities in three major geographic areas as follows:
I.j                                                                 



-4-
(a) the Andean region, which for the purpose of the lDIP accounts for over
800,000 people or 80S of the potential beneficiaries; (b) the coastal area,
accounting for over 100,000 people or 102 of the beneficiaries; and
(c) along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as vell as along the Magdalena
River, where there are some 120,000 poor fishermen.
7.     - Overall, the rural communities would identify projects for the
RDIP by preparing Community Profiles. These profiles would be consolidated
by each municipality into a single document describing the essential
economic and social conditions in each locality, and ranking priority needs
of each covamunity (roads, water and sanitation services, markets etc.).
The municipalities have already made arrangements with Departmental
Secretarists, local communities, the Superior School for Public
Administration (ESAP), and consultants to help them strengthen their
capacity to identify and administer investment projects. Thus, the RDIP is
not expected to finance techuical assistance for all the 602 municipalities
for this purpose. Flexibility elists under the project to provide such
assistance, but this would be determined on a case by case basis. To help
the communities and municipalities prepare project profiles, DRI has issued
an Operational Manual, acceptable to the Bank, which details the technical,
economic and operational criteria to be used in selecting projects for
financing under the RDIP. E .h year, by September, DRI would finalize an
Annual Operating Plan which would list the approved projects, and the
source of money available. It would also detail the status of
prefeasibility and feasibility studies for each -project listed in the
operating Plan. DRI staff would prepare the texms of reference for
feasibility and design studies, using the eligibility criteria as
guidelines for those projects listed in the Operating Plan. The RDIP would
finance the cost of feasibility and design studi-s for preparation of these
projects. As soon as the preparation studies f r projects have been
completed, DRI would sign a cofinancing and ey  ztion contract with each
municipality to cover the cost of investments   4er each project.
Municipalities would invite bids from private . d public sector entities
for implementation of such projects.  In order to ensure that extension
services would be available from the outset of the RDIP, DRI has signed a
contract with ICA to provide such cervices unt_ the end of 1991. In
addition, arrangements have been made to ensure that ICA would put into
operation 19 additional regional adaptive resesa,ch centers (CRECED) to help
develop suitable agricultural technological packages to increase yield and
production by small farmers. DRI's regional office would monitor and
supervise implementation. DRI's share of financing under the RDIP, in the
form of grants, would vary from project to project depending on the
priority needs of each municipality. The municipalities would use mainly
IVA funds to cofinAnce with DRI. The municipalities and the beneficiaries
would be responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) including cost
recovery of projects, except for technology adaptation, extension and
training. To be eligible for cofinancing by DRI, marketing tCESCOS) and
fisheries (CESPAS) projects would have to yield positive financial returns
after repayment of outstanding loans, O&U  expenses and allowances for
depreciation. For water supply and sanitation projects, the practice
applied under the ongoing Bank financed Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
Project (Loan 2961-CO) would be continued whereby each community maintains
and operates the completed water supply system. To provide feedback on the
project's execution and allow for adjustments, a Program Review would be
carried out towards the end of 1992 (para. 11) as well as an impact
evaluatiqn to be done in the fifth year of the project.



-5-
8.       The 1990 IDIP Annual Operating Plan consists of 5,211 investment
projects, technical assistance, and training courses for a total of
US$46 million; all selected on the basis of the Eligibility Criteria in
the Operational Manual. Total project costs for the five years is
estimated at US$250.0 million equivalent, of which the Bank would finance
US$75.0 million equivalent (301) in parallel with a similar amount from
IDB, with a foreign exchange component of US$122.6 million, or 492. The
municipalities are programmed to contribute US$62.5 million equivalent, or
25Z, with the Government (DRI) providing US$37.6 million equivalent or 152
toward the cost of the RDIP. Retroactive financing of up to US$7.5 million
for expenditures made after January 1, 1990 on eligible cofinanced
investment projects, training and consultants, would be included in the
loan. A breakdowa of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement, together with the
disbursement schedule, are shown In Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Colombia are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8430-CC dated July 5, 1990, is also attached.
9.       Actions Aireeds (a) the Government has made arrangements,
satisfactory to the Bank, to reduce processing time to 40 days from 103
daya for DRI's reimbursement requests to the Bank; (b) DRI would retain
three economists in the Operation Office to monitor procedures and ensure
that the eligibility criteria are followed; (c) the Government through the
Natioaal Planning Department would undertake a study not later than August
1991 to develop a graduation policy for phasing creditworthy municipalities
out of the UDIP so they could finance their investment needs through
commercial borrowing or from their own resources; it would present the--
report and the recommendations for Bank comments by January 31, 1992 a-id by
September 30, 1992, DRU would introduce such a policy; (d) DRI would submit
for Bank review, by September 30 of each year, the Annual Operating Plan,
which inter alia, would detail stages of preparation and cost of projects,
as well as identify those projects requiring eavironmental studies, it
would include only those projects in areas where security considerations
would not impede normal Bank supervision; (e) the Government through ICA
would submit an action plan and timetable by September 30, 1990 for making
operational the additional 19 CRECEDs which would prepare technology
packages for the RDIP beneficiaries; ICA would also appoint the staff and
provide the resources for the CRECED8 to begin operations as per the plan
of action; (f) Government would submit for Bank comments by September 30,
1991, an action plan and timetable showing which agencies would replace ICA
by 1992; and maintain arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for providing
extension to RDIP beneficiaries; (g) DRI would not include CESC-OS and
CESPAS projects in the Annual Operating Plans until evaluations,
satisfactory to the Bank, have been completed for similar projects
previously financed from DRI's own resources to demonstrate the viability
of such, and a satisfactory mechanism for recovering the O&M costs to
sustain them; because of considerable assistance already provided to
women's groups, DRI would not include new rural women's projects in the
Annual Operating Plans until a socioeconomic needs assessment, satisfactory
to the Bank of women's groups already assisted ky it has been completed,
Justifying either additional ossistance or recommending phasing out such
groups from the program because they could obtain financing frim other
sources; (h) municipalities would budget and spend a fixed percentage
(estimated at about 4Z) of the capital cost, on the maintenance of each



-6-
road cofinanced under the RDIP; DRI would not finance new roads and related
agricultural production projects, for municipalities which fail to maintain
such roads; (i) DRI would prepare and implement water supply and sanitation
projects in accordance with arrangements agreed with the Fund for Financing
Urban Development (FFDU); (j) DRI would make arrangements to ensure that
both the Bank and IDB loans disburse at about the same rate, and each
September would review with the Bank, the status of disbursements of both
Banks; (k) DRI would annually submit to the Bank, independent financial
audit reports of RDIPISpecial and DRI's accounts; if the audits identify
significant irregularities in any participating municipality or agency, DRI
would suspend disbursements to that party, and require special audits to be
carried out to ensure that irregularities have been resolved before
resuming disbursements; (1) to the satisfaction of the Bank, the Government
would retain sufficient staff in DRI for the efficient implementation of
the RDIP; (m) DRI would retain an Assistant Manager for Operations, RDIP
Coordinator, and two professional staff to assist ln Implementing the RDIP;
(n) DRI would hire consultants according to an agreed timetable and with
qualifications and terms of.reference satisfactory to the Bank to carry out
the baseline surveys, prepare watershed management projects, and
environmental assessments; (o) DRI would complete the first baseline survey
by June 30, 1991 and complete the second baseline study and the impact
evaluation of the project by October S1, 1995; (p) DRI would submit annual
progress reports to the Bank, in conjunction vith the Operating Plans, and
biannual reports identifying major issues/problems in the planning and
implementation of the RDIP; and (q) the Government through the National
Planning Department would contract consultants with qualifications, terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to undertake a Program Review of
the UDIP by August 31, 1992, and submit to the Bank the co'.aultants' report
by October 15. 1992; thereafter furnish an action plan by November 30, 1992
to correct any deficiencies identified. Conditions of Effectiveness:
(a) Government would sign a Subsidiary Agreement with DRI, acceptable to
the Bank; and (b) DRI would put the monitoring system into operation;
provide the Bank with a methodology for the baseline survey and the impact
evaluation, and hire consultants to carry out the first baseline survey.
10.      Benefits.  The major benefits of the RDIP would be:  first,
reduced rural poverty by increasing employment and incomes of some 280,000
farmers, fishermen and women through access to improved agricultural
technological packages, support for establishing small-scale enterprises
and complementary marketing facilities; second, improved living conditions
for the rural poor in 9,000 rural communities through access to safe
drinking water, better sanitation and rural roads to connect villages with
production and marketing centers; third, enhanced sustainability of
investments through more active involvement of rural communities; fourth
improved soil management practices in watersheds of the Andean region to
safeguard the environment; and fifth, strengthened DR$'s capabilities to
plan, prepare, appraise and supervise projects, together with an enhanced
capacity of the municipalities to cofinance and administer rural
development projects. The expected ERR for the RDIP would be '.6X.
II.      Risks.- The main risks relate to the degree to which benefits may
not fully materialize during the first five years of the RDIP because of
the inexperience and limited capacity of DRI and the municipalities to
objectively select and implement projects, notwithstanding the screening
ptocedures (Eligibility Criteria). Also-, implementation may take longer



than planned because procedures. especially the arrangements for
cofinancing between municipalities and DRI, are new and may need longer
gestation to be put into operation effectively.  Although there is adequate
capacity in Colombia to produce technological packages and to provide
extension services a related risk is whether the municipalities and/or the
entities which would replace ICA would be able to provide extension
effectively and whether ICA would have the capacity to produce suitable
technology packages in a timely manner, and transfer the knowhow
effectively to the farmers, under the decentralized system. To minimize
these risks annual operating plans would be prepared and a comprehensive
program review of the RDIP would be completed towards the end of 1992 to
identify potential problems including, inter alia, the effectiveness of
research and extensiion services under the RDIP, etc., and to take the
necessary corrective measures. Moreover, special arrangements have been
made between the Bank and IDB to ensure close and intensive supervision.
Accordingly, IDB's Resident Mission in Colombia would provide on-the-spot
intensive supervision, complementary to that of the Bank on the basis of a
mutually agreed supervision plan.
12.      Recommendation.  I am sa-'isfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank "nw recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loah.
