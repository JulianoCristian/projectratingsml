communities; (b) improve living\n            standards; (c) protect and develop watershed areas; (d)\n            promote grassroots involvement; (e) strengthen the\n            Integrated Rural Development Fund (DRI) capabilities. The\n            RDIP finances projects in: (a) agricultural production and\n            environment protection (technology adaptation and extension,\n            watershed management and environmental protection, fisheries\n            and marketing); (b) training and community organization\n            (support to: (i) organize rural communities to participate\n            in identifying projects; (ii) form associations of rural\n            women to promote cottage enterprises and better health care\n            and education; and (iii) train extension agents, municipal\n            mayors and technicians in environmental management aspects\n            of projects); (c) infrastructure (rural roads and water\n            supply and sanitation); and (d) strengthening of DRI and the\n            municipalities (technical assistance, training, vehicles,\n            equipment and preinvestment studies for the preparation of\n            projects.)
