                         Implementation Status Overview
                         UMEME Ltd. continues improving losses which now stand at 30.2%, further reduced from 32% as recorded in April 2010. Collections have further increased since the last mission to
                         an average level of 97.2% (April '10= 96.8%). The utility and the Government of Uganda (GoU) stakeholders have strengthened their efforts to collaborate more closely on the
                         reduction of non-commercial losses and an independent technical study to give advise on additional measures to reduce losses has recently been launched by the regulatory agency
                         ERA in close consultations with the sector's main stakeholders.
