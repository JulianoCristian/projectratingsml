                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Improve the quality, coverage and economic efficiency of commercial and utility services, through privatization, private participation in infrastructure (PPI), and an
                         improved regulatory framework. This objective will be achieved by a higher level of private investment, and better quality and access of services in the
                         telecommunications, water, electricity and transport sectors; divestiture and improved efficiency of remaining public enterprises; and strengthening the regulatory
                         framework and institutions in relevant sectors.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         UMEME Ltd. continues improving losses which on average stood at 26% during this supervision cycle period. Electricity tariffs were increased in January 2012 by the ERA. As a
                         consequence, according to UMEME, collection rates deteriorated at the beginning of 2012, but have now improved again. The average collection rate recorded during the last
                         mission in December stood at 94%. However, UMEME seems confident that collection levels will soon be further increased.
