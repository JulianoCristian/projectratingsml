                         Improve the quality, coverage and economic efficiency of commercial and utility services, through privatization, private participation in infrastructure (PPI), and
                         an improved regulatory framework. This objective will be achieved by a higher level of private investment, and better quality and access of services in the
                         telecommunications, water, electricity and transport sectors; divestiture and improved efficiency of remaining public enterprises; and strengthening the

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         UMEME Ltd. continues improving losses which now stand at 28%, further reduced from 30% as recorded in November 2010. Collections have further increased since the last mission
                         to an average level of 97.1%. The utility and the Government of Uganda (GoU) stakeholders have further strengthened their efforts to collaborate more closely on the reduction of
                         non-commercial losses. The discussions about new performance indicators under the concession agreements for the next seven years are ongoing and are expected to be well
                         informed by various independent consultant technical reports. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) continues of being in close consultations with the sector's main stakeholders.
