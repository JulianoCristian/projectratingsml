Performance\n            by the Bank and the borrower was satisfactory as well. The\n            report outlines nine lessons learned from the project and\n            are as follows: (1) If properly structured, it is possible\n            to successfully implement a private sector project that\n            brings private capital, private sector efficiencies, and\n            first rated investors into an underdeveloped power\n            distribution and reap substantial economic benefits for the\n            country and the sector. (2) Loss reduction in chronically\n            poorly managed utilities is very challenging and takes\n            significant time and effort to tackle it, particularly in\n            countries with limited capacity. (3) PPP/Concessions are\n            long-term arrangements that need flexibility and commitment\n            from all involved parties to be able to adjust to unforeseen\n            circumstances, remain in place, and being successful. (4)\n            There is a fine balance to be struck between reducing the\n            perceived risks for the private sector and creating the\n            incentives to tackle sector issues. (5) Low income countries\n            may need donor funding to facilitate faster increase in\n            access than private financing can bring. (6) The commercial\n            mindset of the public entities is critical to ensure the\n            long-term sustainability of the sector performance\n            improvement. (7) Projects supporting Public Private\n            Partnerships in power distribution required active\n            supervision to ensure timely resolution of emerging issues\n            before they start to negatively affect the project. (8)\n            Designing the IDA support as a credit restructuring was\n            innovative, cost-effective, and, more importantly,\n            responsive to Government of Uganda\u0092s (GoU) needs. (9) The\n            innovative approach, however, became a burden during\n            supervision as the Bank\u0092s processes and systems were not\n            prepared to handle the innovative aspects of it."}, "docdt": "2014-12-05T14:32:05Z"}
