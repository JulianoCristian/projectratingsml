"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for Uganda - Privatization and\n            Utility Sector Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: A proper legal environment is essential for forcing\n            procedural discipline in privatization transactions. The\n            monitoring and evaluation system was well developed and\n            therefore was effective in tracking implementation progress.\n            The environmental assessments and decommissioning plans led\n            to unexpected results which were beyond the scope of the\n            project. Although there was a full time coordinator for the\n            environmental subcomponent, NEMA has indicated that the\n            presence of an environmental specialist in the PU would have\n            improved communication between them considerably and perhaps\n            more could have been achieved. Policy consensus is essential\n            before major reform programs are implemented to ensure\n            success and minimize reversals. Not overselling the benefits\n            of privatization and openly addressing the inevitable\n            negative aspects helps dissipate fears and create realistic\n            expectations among the public."}, "docdt": "2006-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
