                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Improve the quality, coverage and economic efficiency of commercial and utility services, through privatization, private participation in infrastructure (PPI), and an
                         improved regulatory framework. This objective will be achieved by a higher level of private investment, and better quality and access of services in the
                         telecommunications, water, electricity and transport sectors; divestiture and improved efficiency of remaining public enterprises; and strengthening the regulatory
                         framework and institutions in relevant sectors.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last ISR, actions have been taken to proceed with the earlier closure of the project, since the underlying World Bank guarantee support is no longer required after the formal
                         end of the Electricity Sector Stabilization Period. The distribution concession continues to be in place and UMEME Ltd. is progressing in further improving Uganda's electricity
                         distribution sector. This ISR publication for this project is the last sequence before closure.
