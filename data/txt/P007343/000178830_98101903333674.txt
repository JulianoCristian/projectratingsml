APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT-HONDURAS
(HONDURAS-NICARAGUA INTERCONNECTION)
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Fifth Power Project of
the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) of Honduras which has
requested a Bank loan of US$12.3 million. Because it involves inter-
connection with the Nicaraguan power system, this report is intended to
be considered in conjunction with the appraisal of the Eighth Power
Project of the Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) of Nicaragua.
ii.       Since 1959 the Bank and Association have provided major financ-
ial assistance to Honduran power development through four loans and two
credits, totaling US$32.75 million, for four ENEE power projects. The
first two projects have been completed successfully, and the third has been
substantially completed. The fourth project is under construction, with
satisfactory progress, and is expected to be completed by the end of 197h.
iii.      ENEE is a government-owned corporation responsible for the
development and operation of power facilities in Honduras. Its total
installed capacity - predominantly hydro but also including diesel and
gas turbine generating facilities - is now 111 MW. This represents 85%
of the country's total capacity available for public power supply. ENEE's
management has shown marked improvement during this period; however, its
engineering staff still needs strengthening.
iv.       Honduras has an abundance of attractive hydroelectric sites whose
potential capacity far exceeds the nation's current demand for power. The
interconnection component of the Project would permit transfers of thermal
energy from Nicaragua to Honduras from 1975 through 1977; from 1978 onwards
the interconnection is expected to provide Nicaragua with large amounts of
Honduran hydro power. ENEE's seven-year program also includes the construc-
tion of El Cajon hydroelectric plant, which preliminary studies have shown
to be the most economic alternative for electricity generation and which
would also provide significant flood control benefits. El Cajon will bene-
fit not only Honduras but also Nicaragua,which will obtain hydro power at
lower cost than it can generate in its own thermal plants. The interconnec-
tion provided under the Project would therefore permit the optimal develop-
ment of the power systems of the two countries.
v.        The Project includes:
a)   24 MW of diesel generating facilities at La Ceiba initially to
supply that city's needs and later to meet the demands of the
ENEE system prior to completion of the international inter-
connection;



- ii -
b)   a high-voltage (230 kV) interconnection with the ENALUF system
in Nicaragua to provide for the interchange of large blocks of
energy between the two Empresas;
c)   extension of ENEE's transmission system to areas not presently
served;
d)   studies of future hydroelectric projects; and
e)   training of ENEE staff.
vi.       Because ENEE will initially be purchasing power from ENALUF in
Nicaragua, its immediate capital requirements are smaller than they would
be without the interconnection. Subsequently, ENEE's requirements will
probably include funds for construction of El Cajon and will therefore
increase sharply, while ENALUF will rely on El Cajon in lieu of capital
investment in its own thermal generating plant.
vii.      The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$16.0 million
of which the Bank would finance the US$12.3 million foreign currency com-
ponent. The Project is expected to be completed by the end of 1975. The
Project is a small part of ENEE's seven-year (1972-1978) expansion prograjn,
which includes completion of El Cajon and calls for a total investment of
US$138 million.
viii.     ENEE personnel would carry out the design and construction super-
vision for the components of the Project for which they have experience,
namely the diesel generating units and 138 kV and 34.5 kV lines and sub-
stations. Consulting engineers would perform these duties for the 230 kV
transmission system and would do the hydro studies.
ix.       Procurement would follow the Bank's Guidelines.  A small arnount
of retroactive financing - less than US$250,000 - would be required to
finance consulting services for the interconnection and El Cajon.
x.        The combined programs of ENEE and ENALUF, which include the inter-
connection, are the least-cost solution to meeting the electricity require-
ments of Honduras and Nicaragua. Installation of the proposed diesel units
is the least-cost way of providing required expansion of ENEE's generating
capacity, and the proposed line is the least-cost way for ENEE to extend
its service area to the Aguan valley.
xi.       ENEE's financial position and earnings are satisfactory and are
expected to remain so.
xii.      The Project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$12.3 million equivalent with a term of 24 years including four years of
grace. The loan would be made to ENEE and would be guaranteed by the
Republic of Honduras.



APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - HONDURAS
(HONDURAS-NICARAGUA INTERCONNECTION)
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Fifth Power Project of the Empresa
Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE), for uhich Bank assistance of
US$12.3 million has been requested. The proposed loan would cover the
foreign exchange cost of the Project, the total cost of which is about
US$16.0 million. ENEE, the government-owned authority responsible for
the development and operation of electric power facilities within
Honduras, will finance the local cost of the Project from internally
generated funds and local borrowing.
1.02      The main facilities included in the Project are a high-voltage
interconnection with Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) of
Nicaragua and diesel generating capacity required by ENEE prior to the
completion of the interconnection.
1.03      The Bank and IDA have helped finance four power projects in
Honduras, as detailed in Annex 11. The financing, which has aggregated
US$32.75 million, has assisted in the expansion of ENEE's generating
and transmission facilities. The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), the Central American Bank for Economic Integration
(CABEI) and the Central Bank of Honduras have also assisted ENEE in in-
creasing its investment in facilities by 150% in the last seven years.
1.0h      The Project was appraised simultaneously with the Eighth Power
Project of ENALUF, which provides for the Nicaraguan part of the inter-
connection and the thermal generating facilities to meet its own needs
and supply power to ENEE prior to completion of the next large hydro-
electric plant in Honduras. Because ENALUF will be supplying power to
ENEE for the first few years after the interconnection has been complet-
ed, ENALUF's current capital requirements are larger, and ENEE's smaller,
than they would be without the interconnection. In the next phase of the
program, the situation will be reversed.
1.05      This report is based on a feasibility study prepared by Electro-
consult (ELC) of Milan, Italy, consultants to both ENEE and ENALUF, and
on the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. Hui Huang
(Consultant) and John E. Graves which visited Honduras in October 1971.
This mission coordinated closely with Messrs. W. F. Kupper and V.
Nercissiantz, who appraised the ENALUF project at the same time.

2. THE POWER SECTOR
2.01      While public electrical service in Honduras has improved in the
last seven years, it is still not available in most parts of the country.
Where available, electricity is relatively expensive, and consumption per
capita is comparatively low. ENEE, the principal entity of the sector,
has expanded its distribution network and improved the reliability of its
service and is expected to continue to do so.
2.02      ENEE's production of electrical energy has  approximately doubled ir,
thae five years 1967-1971.   Despite this large increase in production,
however, the unmet demand for electrical service is large. Existing in-
dustrial customers have requested more power from ENEE to replace their
own inefficient captive facilities. New medium-size factories are being
built and more are planned in both the northern and southern zones of the
nation. The percentage of potential residential customers actually re-
ceiving electrical service is low - less than 15%.
2.03      The per capita generation of electricity for 1970 was the low-
est of the Central American republics:
Costa Rica (estimated)                     500 kWh/capita
Nicaragua                                  245
El Salvador                                174
Guatemala                                  124
Honduras                                   116
2.04      Public electrical service in Honduras is provided mainly by ENEE:
Present       Generation
Capacity       in 1970
ENEE                            111.0 MW        257 GWh
Privately-owned utilities         17.5            39
Municipalities                     3.0             5
131.5 MW        301 GWh
The United Fruit and Standard Fruit companies own the largest of the
privately-owned utilities.  United Fruit's diesel stations totaling 10 MW
at La Lima and Tela, and Standard's 5.5 MW station at La Ceiba, provide
energy to each company's industrial facilities as well as to the respective
municipalities.
2.05      In addition to the facilities available for public supply, a
few industries in Honduras have their own generating capacity. The most
important of these captive facilities are the diesel plants owned by the
silver mines at Mochito (5.6 MW) and the cement plant at Bijao (2 MW). The
total capacity of al1 such facilities is about 24 MW and their total
energy generation in 1970 is estimated at 34 GWh, or about 10% of the total
electricity generated in the country.



2.06      ENEE's main system serves the most heavily populated and in-
dustralized section of the country. This area stretches from the Puerto
Cortes/San Pedro Sula area in the north to the capital city of Tegucigalpa
in the central zone. The system presently consists of 214 km of 138 kV
transmission lines and 60 km of 69 kV lines connecting six power plants
(2 hydro, 3 diesel and 1 gas turbine) with a total installed capacity of
about 105 MW, as detailed in Annex 1.
2.07      The Fourth Power Project currently under way will strengthen the
main system and extend it to other cities in the northern and central zones.
In addition to its main system, ENEE operates 14 isolated diesel plants with
a total installed capacity of 6.2 MW. Most of this capacity is located in
the principal southern cities of San Lorenzo and Choluteca, which would be
connected with the main system by means of the 230 kV transmission line in-
cluded in the Project. Demand for electricity in the southern zone has al-
ready overtaxed the capacity of the Choluteca plant.
2.08      ENEE supplies about 60,000 consumers.  Its market is primarily
industrial; 54% of 1970 sales were to industrial customers:
Category                Sales GWh               _%
Residential                 50                    22
Commercial                  39                   17
Industrial                 123                    5
Government & Other          16                     7
Total                    228                  100
2.09      Honduras has abundant hydro resources.  A preliminary hydro sur-
vey for the western and central regions of Honduras was conducted by Harza
Engineering Company International of the United States in 1967.  This study
identified several possibly favorable plant sites on the Jicatuyo and
Humuya rivers. Among the sites on the Rio Humuya, also surveyed by Motor-
Columbus of Switzerland in 1970, El Cajon is the most attractive and a de-
tailed feasibility study is being carried out by the firm as described in
Annex 5, El Remolino, which is a run-of-river site immediately downstream
from El Cajon, would not be economic until completion of El Cajon reservoir.
loi.or-Columbus has already done some pre-feasibility work, financed under
Ihe Fourth Power Project, concerning Naranjito on the Jicatuyo River. Further
studies, mainly of a geological nature, are needed to establish whether
NaranjiLo could be a feasible smaller alternative, should construction of
El C.ljon be postponed.
2.10      A similar survey should now be made for the eastern region to enable
a hydro inventory of the whole country to be prepared for planning future
power development. Because United Nations Development Programme funds are not
available, funds for consultants to carry out this survey are included in the
Project. This study would include a reasonable amount of pre-feasibility work
on the more promising sites, including the gorge on the Patuca River near
Cayetano, about 130 km east of Tegucigalpa (see Map of ENEE system), which
appears to offer good opportunities for power production in the more distant
future.

3. INTERNATIONAL INTERCONNECTION
3.01      As noted in paragraph 2.09, the most attractive of Honduras'
many undeveloped hydroelectric sites is that at El Cajon. More fully
described in Annex 5, a high dam in the El Cajon gorge would have a
potential of about 450 MW and would generate in an average year about
1,300 Gkh of low-cost energy (about 6.4 U.S. mills per kWh).
3.02      Despite its rapid growth, the market in Honduras is not
sufficiently large to absorb El Cajon's potential, nor is it expected
to be so until the mid-1980's. (ENEE's system peak demand is expected
to be only 60 MW in 1972).
3.03      In Nicaragua, the ENALUF system requirements are presently
almost double those of ENEE; peak demand in 1972 is expected to be 115
MW. Moreover, because of a lack of economic hydro sites, ENALUF will
become increasingly dependent on thermal generation, principally steam.
3.04      A high-voltage interconnection between the two systems would
therefore benefit both. By providing a market for power from El Cajon,
it would enable ENEE to develop this site sooner than would otherwise be
economically feasible. Prior to the completion of El Cajon, the link
would enable ENEE to obtain power from ENALUF, thereby minimizing ENEE's
need for new generating facilities. After El Cajon is completed, it
would provide ENALUF with large amounts of low-cost hydro power through
the mid-1980's, thus reducing that Empresa's generation investment and
operating costs from what they would otherwise be.
3.05      As part of the Fourth Power Project, ENEE intended extending
its existing system by connecting Tegucigalpa to Choluteca in the south
with a 69 kV transmission line. For interconnection with ENALUF the volt-
age of this line would have to be raised to 230 kV and the line extended
about 60 km to the border with Nicaragua (see Map of ENEE system). It is
proposed that the Tegucigalpa-Choluteca 69 kV line be deleted from the
Fourth Power Project and the complete 230 kV line from Tegucigalpa to the
border be included in the proposed Project. Funds thus left available
under the Fourth Power Project would help ENEE meet the now enlarged scope
of its transmission and subtransmission system expansion and the increased
costs of the remainder of the project due to the recent monetary revaluation.
230 kV has been shown to be the most suitable voltage for the interconnection,
considering the distances involved and the amounts of power to be trans-
mitted.
3.06      ENALUF's system would be extended from Leon to the border with
Honduras by a 230 kV line about 70 km long (see Map of ENALUF system).
ENALUF would build a new steam power station at Puerto Somoza with two
50 MW units to be commissioned by the end of 1974 and 1975, respectively.
These units would enable ENALUF, in addition to meeting its own load growth,
to supply ENEE from the end of 1974, when the interconnection would be
completed, until El Cajon is commissioned in 1978, with more economical
energy than ENEE could provide itself. The supply of power from ENALUF
would be sufficient not only to meet ENEE's incremental requirements but
also to allow ENEE to place its old diesel facilities on standby for most
of this period and thereby reduce fuel costs.



- 5 -
3.07      Once El Cajon is completed, all of ENEE's thermal facilities
would be put on standby and ENALUF's thermal generation would be greatly
reduced, thereby permitting further fuel cost savings for each.
3.08      Even if El Cajon were not completed as currently projected,
the interconnection would still benefit both utilities by reducing their
operating costs and investment programs, as detailed in paragraph 5.05.
3.09      As indicated in Annex 6, which describes the feasibility study
of the interconnection as carried out by ELC and modified by the two
utilities, each system's firm capability would be able to meet at least
79% of its peak demand in case of interruption of the interconnection.
Legal Aspects and Power Contract
3.10      Both Honduras and Nicaragua have agreed that it is necessary
for the two countries to conclude a treaty which will allow the inter-
connection and the interchange of power and also authorize the two Empresas
to negotiate a power contract for the interchange. The treaty has already
been signed but not yet ratified. Both countries' legislative bodies will
ratify the treaty before disbursements will be made from the loan in re-
spect of those parts of the Project directly related to the interconnection,
i.e., the 230 kV transmission line, the Pavana substation and the Suyapa
substation extension.
3.11      The two utilities are expected to sign, early in June, a contract
satisfactory to the Bank for the supply of power from Nicaragua to Honduras
during the first years after interconnection. No disbursement will be made
from the loan in respect of those parts of the Project directly related to
the interconnection until this contract becomes effective. The supply of
El Cajon power from Honduras to Nicaragua will be the subject of another
contract, to be negotiated after the completion of the feasibility study,
when the cost of the power plant and of its energy will be better known.

4. THE PRDGRAM AND PROJECT
Seven-Year Program
4.01      ENIEE's development program for 1972-1978 includes four basic
elemer]ts:
a)   completion of the Rio Lindo Project (see Appraisal. Report
No. TO-623a, dated May 13, 1968) and completion of the Fourth
Power Project (see Appraisal Report No. PU-42a dated May 28,
1970;
b)   the Fifth Power Project, which includes the interconnectior
with Nicaragua, described below;
c)   El Cajon hydroelectric project, discussed in Annex 5, and
related transmission system expansion; and
d)   improvements to and expansion of the existing distribution
system, including acquisition of existing systems owned by
other companies and municipalities.
The program's total cost of US$138 million is detailed in Annex 13.
Description of the Project
4.02      The Fifth Power Project, which amounts to about 11.5% of ENEE's
seven-year program, would comprise the following:
a)   four 6 MW diesel generating units (400-500 rpm) burning
bunker C oil to be installed at La Ceiba7
b)   a 150 km single-circuit 230 kV transmission line from Suyapa
(near Tegucigalpa) to Pavana (near Choluteca) and thence to
the Nicaraguan border, and appropriate substation equipment
at Suyapa and Pavana;
c) a 47 km 138 kV transmission line from La Ceiba to the Aguan
valley, a substation at Coyoles, a terminal at La Ceiba and
about 90 km of 34.5 kV sub-transmission lines and substations
in the Aguan valley;
d) installation of about 150 km of 34.5 kV sub-transmission lines
and substations to serve new areas;
e) consulting services to study hydroelectric power projects on
the Rio Jicatuyo and conclude the study of El Cajon hydroelectric
project (Annex 5);
f)  consulting services for a preliminary hydro survey in eastern
Honduras, particularly on the Rio Patuca (paragraph 2.10); and
g) training of ENEE staff.



-7-
4.03      Extension of the transmission line to the Aguan valley was
included in the Fourth Power Project, but ENEE agreed not to proceed
with its construction until it produced evidence satisfactory to the
Bank that there is economic justification for the work.  As ENEE has
not yet completed negotiations with Standard Fruit, the main prospective
customer in the area, this line has not been built. It is proposed that
these works be deleted from the Fourth Project and included in the Fifth.
Funds thus left available under the Fourth Power Project would help ENEE,
as mentioned in paragraph 3.05, to meet the enlarged scope and the in-
crease in costs of the remainder of the Fourth Power Project. The de-
cision to proceed with the Aguan valley works is again subject to ENEE's
providing evidence satisfactory to the Bank that there is sufficient
economic justification for the works.
Estimated Cost
4.04      The Project is estimated to cost US$16.0 million with a foreign
currency component of US$12.3 million. The cost estimates for trans-
mission lines (for 230 kV lines, at US$18,000 per km) and substations are
based on recent experience with similar works in Honduras and other Latin
American countries. The estimates for diesel units are based on actual
costs of recen-t similar installations in other countries adjusted for
recent currency revaluations. To cover cost increases arising from un-
foreseen difficulties, a physical contingency allowance of about 7V has
been included for all Project costs except training, feasibility study and
hydro survey costs. Because most project expenditures will be made against
firm price contracts which will be signed in 1972 and 1973, price contingency
allowances of 71% and 5% of the foreign exchange and local currency components,
respectively, of the Project should be sufficient to allow for price inflation
of the type of equipment to be required. Possible effects of future currency
revaluations are adequately reflected in the estimates. Details of the cost
estimates are shown in Annex 2. The following is a summary:

- 8-
Engineering and Construction
4.05      Engineering design and supervision of construction for the inter-
connection would be carried out by ELC, which is ENEE's consultant for the
Fourth Power Project and which would also be engaged by ENALUF to handle
the Nicaraguan part of the interconnection. In addition, the two Enpresas
intend to engage a firm experienced in power system studies to make sta-
bility analyses. This firm would establish basic design criteria which
would be adopted in ELC's design work.
4.06      The two Empresas expect to award separate contracts simultane-
ously for the interconnection in order to obtain cost savings in engineer-
ing and procurement. Each transmission line would be handled through a
single contract covering the supply of materials and erection work. For
the substations, separate contracts would be let for the supply of prin-
cipal components, miscellaneous equipment, and for erection.
4.07      Specifications for the diesel plant have been prepared by ENEE's
staff. ENEE's engineer who would be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the plant has been sent abroad to observe the erection,
operation and maintenance of similar units.
4.08      ENEE's staff would design the 47 km 138 kV transmission line to
the Aguan valley and the 138 kV stepdown substation at Coyoles and would
design and construct the 34.5 kV subtransmission lines for service extensic.-
to new areas. ENEE will have acquired sufficient experience in this regard
as a result of the work now being done by its own forces under the Fourth
Power Project on substations and lines of the same type.
4.09      Motor Columbus would continue with the existing assignment on El
Cajon feasibility study and would supervise the geological field work for
Naranjito (paragraph 2.09). Contractors acceptable to the Bank would under-
take the geological exploration for Naranjito, under the supervision of the
consultants. A consulting firm acceptable to the Bank would be engaged for
the proposed survey of hydro resources in the eastern part of the country.
Construction Schedules
4.10      Construction of the interconnection line (including the associated
substations) and the sub-transmission lines would be completed by the end of
1974. The first two diesel units would be installed during the first half
of 1973; the other two by the end of 1973. El Cajon feasibility study should
be concluded by the end of 1972, and the Naranjito studies during 1973. The
initiation of construction on the transmission extension to the Aguan valley
would depend on negotiations with the Standard Fruit Company, which have
begun. The line should be completed by the end of 1975.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      Procurement of equipment and selection of contractors would follow
the Bank's international bidding procedures; none of these contracts would



- 9 -
be awarded before the signing of the loan. However, to complete the inter-
connection by the end of 1974, consultants have been engaged to make stabili-
ty analyses of the system and design the interconnection facilities. These
studies and the completion of the El Cajon feasibility study (paragraph 2.09)
would require a small amount (estimated to be less than US$250,000) of retro-
active financing for expenditures incurred since February 1972.
4.12      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for the CIF
cost of imported equipment and materials and for the foreign currency cost
of contractors' erection work, consultants' services, and training. Dis-
bursements are expected to be completed by mid-1976. If the Project should
cost less than estimated, any savings from the loan should be canceled.
Environment
4.13      The La Ceiba diesel units will be located outside the city away
from the heavily populated area. Because of the relatively small size of
the plant and the fact that in the future it will be used mainly in stand-
by service, no noise problem or other adverse effects on the environment
are expected.
Project Supervision
4.14      The Project would largely overlap in time the ongoing Fourth
Power Project. Semi-annual visits by Bank staff should suffice to assure
adequate supervision of both projects.

5. JUSTIFICATION
Forecast of Sales and Demand
5.01      The forecast of energy sales in ENEE's market through 1985 is
shown in Annex 3. ENEE's forecasts have been accurate in the past ex-
cept for 1971, when the economic slowdown resulting from the Common
Market crisis led to a slower-than-expected rate of increase in energy
sales. In making its forecasts, ENEE analyzes economic and demographic
trends in each area which it serves or plans to serve. Sales to large
existing customers are based on estimates provided by those customers.
Future sales to the two major fruit companies are based on discussions
with those companies. Only prospective loads of well-advanced large in-
dustrial projects are included in the forecast. The forecast of maximum
demand has been derived from the sales forecast by assuming system loss
factors and annual load factors.
5.02      The average growth of required energy in the areas presently
served by ENEE's system is forecast at 15% for the years 1972-1976,
compared with an average annual rate of 16% for 1967-1971. Because of
the addition of the new service areas (Tela, La Ceiba, Aguan valley,
southern zone, etc.) with new loads to ENEE's system, total sales are
expected to increase at a higher rate - 21% annually - for 1972-1976.
Maximum, demand is expected to increase from 51 MW in 1971 to lo MW in
1976 as shown in Annex 4. These forecasts are realistic.
Interconnection
5.03      The proposed interconnection, while of itself not contributing
to revenues of either Empresa, will enable them to reduce, or postpone,
investments which would otherwise be required to meet their respective
forecast market requirements with the same degree of reliability. At the
same time, economies of operation will be realized in the near term, and
eventually economies of scale, which would not be available to either
Empresa operating in isolation.
5,04      ELC, in its feasibility study of interconnection, first selected
the best independent program for each system and then compared the combi-
nation of the two selected programs with its proposed program for inter-
connection. The interconnection program was shown to be more economic for
discount rates up to 19%. During the appraisals, in order to cut down the
investments by both Empresas, it was agreed to modify ELC's proposed pro-
gram by installing 36 MW less generating capacity before the commissioning
of El Cajon. This modification, which would reduce the reserve capacity,
is acceptable to both Empresas.  With this reduction in investment the
interconnection project is clearly the least cost solution for discount
rates up to 20% (see Annex 6).
5.05      Once the Motor-Columbus feasibility study of El Cajon and agree-
ments for the-transfer of electricity to and from ENALUF have been complet-
ed, it is expected that ENEE will proceed with the construction of E1 Cajon
as currently planned. If, however, for some reason such as financing dif-
ficulties, El Cajon should be postponed for a few years, the interconnection



- 11 -
would still benefit both Empresas because:
a)   the interconnection would provide a means for the two
utilities to interchange emergency power, and the combined
reserve requirements of the two systems would be less than
for independent systems; and
b)   until ready to proceed with El Cajon, ENEE could reduce
its financing requirements by continuing to purchase
thermal energy from ENALUF to meet its demand.
Diesel Units at La Ceiba
5.06      It is shown in Annex 7 that the installation of diesel units
at La Ceiba would be the least cost solution as compared to installation
of gas turbines for discount rates up to 31%. Because the main purpose is
to provide reserves, the internal economic rate of return has not been
calculated.
Extension of Power Supply to Aguan Valley
5.07      The proposed extension of power supply to the Aguan valley
(paragraph 4.03) is described in detail in Annex 8. It is the least cost
solution to meet the needs of the valley; the internal economic rate of
return is estimated at about 17%.

6. EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA
Management and Staff
6.01      The Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) was established
in 1957 by law as an autonomous authority wholly owned by the Government
and responsible for developing and operating power facilities in Honduras.
It is a reasonably well-managed utility.
6.02      The composition of ENEE's Board of Directors is described in
the Fourth Power Project Appraisal Report No. PU-42a. As a result of a
change in the national government in June 1971 four of the five directors
are new to the ENEE board. The present general manager, a civil engineer,
was appointed by the new board in August 1971. Although he is new to the
power sector and in an administrative capacity, the general manager is per-
forming his duties capably and energetically. ENEE has agreed to afford the
Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange views on any future appointment
to the post of General Manager.
6.03      In 1968 the Bank requested that ENEE's engineering staff be
strengthened. Since few Honduran nationals with power experience were
then available, ENEE agreed to engage four or five experienced and compe-
tent expatriates on a contractual basis to assist the existing staff. One
competent expatriate engineer has completed two years as technical adviser
to the general manager dealing with planning and engineering matters and
is expected to continue for at least another year. Three additional engi-
neers were hired in 1972.  In 1970 ENEE further agreed to send selected
engineers and technicians from its staff to foreign power companies for
study and on-the-job training. This activity has begun with two engineers.
Because of the urgent need to provide training for its engineers and techni-
cians, ENEE has prepared a specific training program for its technical
personnel through 1975.
6.04      Because of the large amount of work being performed by ENEE in
the Fourth Project, as well as the similar work in the proposed Project,
ENEE's management realizes the necessity of providing adequate training
for its new construction and maintenance crews. For this training ENEE
will establish a facility at Canaveral and is seeking help in setting up
courses and providing instruction from other Latin American utilities more
experienced in this regard.
6.05      ENEE employs about 1,100 permanent and 300 temporary employees.
During the past few years its permanent staff has grown by less than 6%
annually. Its temporary construction force has been expanded because of
recent rapid expansion of the sub-transmission and distribution systems.
With about 60,000 customers at present, ENEE's customer-to-employee ratio
of 55:1 (based on permanent employees only) is unfavorable even for a
small utility but is expected to improve as a result of the new management's
policy of limiting hiring of new employees.



- 13 -
Tariffs
6.o6      The ENEE law gives the Empresa the authority to establish
electricity tariffs. In the agreements on the previous loans and credits
ENEE was required to earn a minimum rate of return of 10% on net utility
plant in operation. This provision is repeated in the agreements related
to the proposed loan. In recent years ENEE's rate of return has been well
above this level; the Empresa earned 16% on its net fixed assets in 1970.
However, the addition of the Rio Lindo plant to the assets in operation in
1971 reduced the rate of return to approxinately 12%, still higher than the
minimum specified rate.
6.07      ENEE's tariffs,vhich are higher than other Central American
utilities', have remained practically unchanged since 1964. The average
rate per kWh sold is about 3.7 U.S. cents. A study completed by R. W. Beck
and Associates (USA) in October 1971 suggested some minor rate adjustments
among the various service classifications so that each category would cover
its allocated portion of ENEE system costs. The net effect of the suggest-
ed rate modifications, none of which exceeded 5%, would be negligible upon
ENEE's gross revenues. Because the suggested tariff revisions were minor
and because of the continuing need to generate ever-increasing amounts of
cash for system expansion - particularly for local currency expenditures
on El Cajon - ENEE's management feels it inadvisable to effect any rate
changes at this time. This course of action appears reasonable.
6.08      ENEE's management is concerned about the low rate of new service
hookups in certain towns where it has installed distribution lines. In
some cases as few as 25% of thepotential residential customers have actual-
ly begun to receive service from the ENEE system. To achieve better utili-
zation of its distribution network, ENEE intends to study this problem in
order to determine whether the problem in such poorer areas is due to high
rates, lack of capital for house wiring and appliances, or a combination of
the two. ENEE intends to make the study available for review by the Bank's
village electrification study group.
Financial Systems and Auditors
6.09      ENEE's accounting system, which is under the direction of a
qualified accountant, is well-designed. Operational problems have delayed
the submission of data to the accounting department, however, thereby delay-
ing the preparation of financial reports. The new general manager has
agreed to take steps to speed up the flow of data within ENEE.
6.10      The financial statements of ENEE are audited by Price Waterhouse
and Company, which is satisfactory. ENEE has agreed that its accounts will
continue to be audited by a firm of accountants acceptable to the Bank, and
that the auditor's full report will be transmitted to the Bank within four
months of the end of each financial year.

7. FINANCE
Introduction
7.01      ENEE has maintained rel_tively high power rates and annual
rates of return - at least 11.5% - during the past five years and is ex-
pected to continue to do so. Its profitability will enable ENEE to
continue to self-finance a large portion - about 34.5% - of its very
large 1972-78 construction program, which includes El Cajon hydroelectric
plant and which will increase plant investment by about 250%. ENEE's
financial position is expected to remain strong; its debt service is not
unduly burdensome and is not expected to become so.
Earnings Record
7.02      Income statements and financial ratios for the past five years
are shown in Annexes 12 and 14, respectively. During the period sales of
energy grew at an average rate of 16.4% and net income grew at 16.7%. Net
income for the last five years totaling L26.7 million (US$13.4 million)
was retained by ENEE in its entirety and was used to help finance a 119%
increase in gross plant.
Capital Structure and Financial Position
7.03      ENEE's financial position is sound.  Although heavy capital ex-
penditures have depleted ENEE's cash balannces, it is expected that the
utility will improve its liquidity and working capital position in 1972.
Despite increased borrowings for the Rio Lindo and Fourth Power Projects,
the debt/equity ratio is still a satisfactory 54/46. ENEE's balance
sheets for the past five years are shown in Annex 10.
7.04      At the end of 1971, US$19.0 million or 65.5% of the outstanding
long-term debt consisted of financial assistance given by the Bank Group.
Details of ENEE's long-term debt, including Bank/IDA financing, are shown
in Annex 11.
7.05      Like many other Latin American utilities, ENEE has been plagued
with disproportionately high accounts receivable in relation to sales.
ENEE has been taking the following steps to liquidate some of these
receivables and to reduce the current level, equal to more than two months
sales, to a more acceptable 1½Q-month level by:
a)   installing its own computer to expedite bill processing;
b)   establishing working arrangements with major banks enabling
customers to pay their bills at banks as well as at ENEE's
offices; and
c)   establishing procedures whereby the various agencies of the
national government (totaling more than 70) pay ENEE through
the Ministry of Finance. This has put almost all government
agencies on a current basis with the exceptions noted in the
following paragraphs.



- 15 -
7.06      A particularly vexing problem has been that of old accounts
receivable owed principally by certain government agencies and to a
lesser degree by churches and municipalities.  These old debts total Ll.l
million (US$550,000). ENEE's management has agreed with the Bank's re-
quest that this issue be soon resolved. Because of the government's
current fiscal situation a deferred payment plan for the central govern-
ment agencies over five years was suggested by the Bank. The government
has agreed to this plan.
7.07      ENEE is continuing to have great difficulty collecting current
payments from most municipalities and some churches. ENEE is trying to
solve this problem on a case-by-case basis by negotiation with responsible
authorities of each entity.
7.08      Another long-term problem involves a dispute between ENEE and
Servicio Autonomo Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (SANAA), the
water supply agency, concerning ENEE's use of water for two small hydro
plants, one of which has been shut down since April 1970. ENEE has de-
clined to pay what it considers exorbitant charges for use of water;
consequently, SANAA has never paid ENEE for electricity and continues to
obtain free service. ENEE has agreed that, within six months from the
date the loan is signed, it will make arrangements with SANAA satisfactory
to the Bank concerning the settlement of their accounts.
Financing Plan
7.09      During the four-year period 1972-1975 net internal cash genera-
tion will finance approximately 35% of ENEE's construction and acquisition
program plus additions to working capital. This is satisfactory especially
in view of the fact that this period includes the first two years of El
Cajon's five-year construction period.  During this period plant investment
will increase by about 100%. Miscellaneous contributions will amount to 1%
of the requirements and borrowings will be required for the remaining 64%.
The financing plan is based on the reinvestment of all net income. Conse-
quently, ENEE has agreed to retain all its earnings for investment in new
facilities. The following table gives a summary of the financing plan, de-
tails of which are shown in the projected funds statement Annex 13.

* Project disbursements of L 1.0 million (US$0.5 million) and loan withdrawals of
L 0.7 million (Us$0.4 million) are expected in early 1976.
7.10      The proposed Bank loan would be made to ENEE for a term of approxi-
mately 24 years, including about four years of grace, at the currenct Bank
interest rate.

7.11      The proposed Central Bank financing estimated at L5.5 million
(US$2.75 million) would be required in 1972 through 1974. ENEE has al-
ready secured a L2.5 million (US$1.25 million) 10-year loan from the
Central Bank at an annual interest rate of 7%. Assurances have been ob-
tained that the Central Bank will agree to meet ENEE's remaining require-
ment of L3.0 million (US$1.5 million) either directly or by underwriting,
at reasonable terms.
7.12      Arrangements have not yet been made for the future loans which
will be required to finance El Cajon project. The project, including the
related transmission lines, is estimated to cost approximately L188 million
(US$94 million). Of this total, 67% or L126 million (US$63 million) re-
presents foreign costs and the remaining 33% or L62 million (US$31 million)
represents local currency expenditures.
7.13      Annex 13 also shows ENEE's financing plan for the entire period
1972-1978, which covers El Cajon's construction period. During these
seven years, net internal cash generation will finance approximately 34.5%
of ENEE's construction and acquisition program plus additions to working
capital. This is satisfactory in view of the fact that plant investment
will increase by about 250% during this period. The financing plan calls
for national government contributions of L16 million (US$8 million) for a
portion of El Cajon's local currency cost, but ENEE may have to obtain this
amount through local borrowing if the government contribution is not avail-
able. Because the estimated cost ofEl Cajon is preliminary, the signifi-
cant addition of L19 million (US$9.5 million) to working capital may be re-
garded as necessary to provide for possible increases in its cost. This
increase in working capital occurs principally during 1978 and could be used
for other future projects or to permit reduction of tariffs if not required
for El Cajon.
Future Earnings
7.14      ENEE's forecast income statements (Annex 12) and financial ratios
(Annex 14) indicate that the utility will maintain its high level of profit-
ability and self-financing with existing tariffs. During the seven-year
period beginning in 1972 ENEE's rate of return is expected to remain in the
12.0 - 14.5% range experienced recently, except for 1976 and 1977. During
these two years, prior to completion of El Cajon, ENEE's rate base will
actually decline slightly; higher earnings will cause the rate of return to
increase to 16-18.5%. After the installation of El Cajon, preliminary figures
indicate a continuation of the 12.5 - 14.5% rate of return. Were it not for
the large cash requirements for El Cajon, the earnings level for 1976-1977
would be excessive. However, in view of the need for cash to cover the local
currency cost of El Cajon, ENEE's management is reluctant to reduce rates and
desires to maintain a reasonably high rate of return. Agreements related to
the Fourth Power Project state that ENEE will not adjust its tariff levels
without the Bank's approval until completion of that project, which is ex-
pected to be in mid-1974.

7.15      Net income is expected to increase from L6.2 million (US$3.1
million) in 1971 to L31.5 million (US$15.75 million) in 1978.  Total net
income for the seven-year period is estimated at L119.3 million (US$59.65
million).
7.16      ENEE's annual debt service coverage will vary from 1.9 to 2.4
times during 1972-1978, which is satisfactory. However, its rapid plant
expansion and consequent increase in borrowings will result in a less
favorable relation of current cash generation to future debt service. The
debt service test agreed to by ENEE and the Bank Group in the Fourth Power
Project, whereby ENEE will not incur debt without the Bank Group's approval
unless its most recent 12-month internal cash generation is at least 1.4
times the maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year,
is repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
Future Financial Position
7.17      The balance sheet positions for 1972-1978 shown in Annex 10
reflect a continuing sound financial position. The debt/equity ratio,
current ratio and debt structure are expected to remain satisfactory.
7.18      ENEE's debt/equity ratio is expected to remain at about its 1971
level of 54/46 until 1978, when it will decline to 51/49. The current ratio
will range from 1.25 to 1.6, except for 1978 when the cash increase referred
to in paragraph 7.13 will raise this ratio to 2.4.

8.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMWNDATIONR
8.01      During negotiations agreements were reached on the following
points:
a)   ENEE will not withdraw funds for construction of those parts
of the project directly related to the interconnection until
(i) the legislative bodies of Honduras and Nicaragua have
ratified the interconnection treaty, and (ii) the power supply
contract between ENEE and ENALUF has become effective (paragraphs
3.10 and 3.11);
b)   ENEE will not proceed with construction of the Aguan valley line
and related substations before providing satisfactory evidence
that they are economically justified (paragraph 4.03);
c)   ENEE will retain consultants satisfactory to the Bank to design
and supervise construction of the interconnection, conclude the
El Cajon feasibility study, undertake the studies of Naranjito
and survey the hydro resources in eastern Honduras (paragraphs
4.05 and 4.09);
d)   ENEE will give the Bank a reasonable opportunity to exchange
views on any future appointments to the post of General Manager
(paragraph 6.02);
e)   Within six months from the date the loan is signed, ENEE will
make arrangements with SANAA satisfactory to the Bank concerning
settlement of accounts between the two agencies (paragraph 7.08);
f)   ENEE will retain, until the Project is completed, all its earnings
for investment in new facilities (paragraph 7.09); and
g)   The Central Bank of Honduras will meet ENEE's remaining financ-
ing requirements during the Project period at reasonable terms
(paragraph 7.11).

EL CAJON HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
1.        In northern Honduras there is an excellent site for the construc-
tion of a high dam, namely, E[ Cajon gorge on the Humuya River downstream
from the confluence of its principal tributary, the Sulaco River. The dam
not only would enable a large amount of low-cost electric power, about 45(
MW, to be produced but also would create a large reservoir in the Humuya
and Sulaco valleys which could provide storage for effectively controlling
floods in the Sula valley. The valley is the richest and economically
most promising part of the country but has been plagued with frequent
floods. The power potential is particularly attractive because of proxi-
mity to load centers; however, the project is too big for the present ENEE
system. On the other hand, the neighboring ENALUF system is considerably
larger and in the future would depend mainly on thermal power. Thus,
through interconnection, surplus power of El Cajon can be utilized by ENALUF
to replace thermal generation, making the development of the project
economically feasible and beneficial to both countries.
2.        Feasibility studies of the El Cajon project were started in 1970
by Motor-Columbus of Switzerland with funds provided under ENEE's Rio Lindo
Project and Fourth Power Project. These studies would be continued with
additional money to be provided by the proposed Bank loan and would be
completed by the end of 1972.
3.        Geological explorations at the dam site and the reservoir area
are near completion. Preliminary findings favor the construction of an
arch dam. According to a tentative plan prepared by the consultants, the
dam would be about 220 m. high and the total reservoir capacity would be
of about 8,000 million cubic meters. The power installation would consist
of 450 MW with 6 units of 75 MW each and the average annual energy output
would be about 1,300 GW.
4.        The upper part of the reservoir would be reserved for retaining
floods with a return period of up to 100 years, thereby lowering the flood
stage in the valley considerably. A recent preliminary flood control survey
estimated that the average annual flood damages which could be prevented by
the regulation of El Cajon reservoir would amount to us$4.4 million out of
total damages of US$7.4 million which would occur without the dam.
5.        The cost of the project excluding transmission lines and interest
during construction has been estimated at about US$88 million. Part of the
cost is properly allocable to flood control and should be borne by the
beneficiaries, including the Honduran Government. Pending a detailed cost
allocation study, the portion chargeable to flood control is tentatively
assumed to be US$15 million. The net project cost related to the power
sector would therefore be about US$73 million.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2 pages
6.        Based on the above estimates, the investment per kW would be
about US$162 and the average generation cost per kWh would be about 6.4
US mills. These costs are considered attractive, and it would therefore
be possible for El Cajon not only to supply Honduras' future needs but
also to replace much of ENALUF's thermal power.
7.        It is planned to start construction of the project in the latter
part of 1973 after financing arrangements have been made. Initial power
generation is expected in early 1978 and the project would be completed in
the latter part of that year.
8.        Because of the ready market to absorb El Cajon's power, it would
be highly advantageous for ENEE to expedite its completion. Each year of
advanced completion would contribute some US$7 million to ENEE due to
revenues from energy sales to ENALUF and ENEE's own savings in system
operating costs.

INTERCONNECTION WITH NICARAGUA
Feasibility Study by ELC
1.        ENEE and ENALUF jointly engaged Electroconsult (ELC) of Italy to
make a feasibility study on the proposed interconnection of the two systems.
The Empresas agreed to use the following as criteria for reserves: for
independent developments, each system should have a reserve capacity equal
to that of the largest unit; after the systems are interconnected, each
system should have sufficient firm capability, i.e., assuming the largest
unit out of service, to meet at least 85% of the peak demand in the event
of interruption of the interconnection.
2.        The consultants first studied alternative generation programs for
each system for the period 1972-1985 and selected the most economic one for
each system. Then the proposed interconnection project was compared with
the combination of the two selected programs.
3.        For the independent development in Honduras, the most economic
program, among four alternatives, comprised a 40 MW steam power station
at La Ceiba to be installed in 1975 and a 126 MW El Cajon Chico project 1/
to be constructed in 1979.
4.        For the independent development in Nicaragua, two alternative
programs were compared: one with a mixed hydro-steam development; the other
with an all steam development. The latter,which included the two 60 MW units
to be installed in 1975 and 1977, was determined to be the more economic
solution.
5.        Although El Cajon would be the main source of power for the inter-
connected system over a number of years, both ENEE and ENALUF would need other
generating capacity additions to meet the reserve criteria mentioned in
paragraph 1. ELC proposed the following generation program for the next
decade for the interconnected system:
ENALUF:      60 MW steam unit at Lake Managua in 1975
60 MW steam unit at Lake Managua in 1977
ENEE:        40 MW steam unit at La Ceiba in 1974
6 x 63 MW hydro units at El Cajon in 1978
6.        ELC showed that the interconnection program would be more economic
than the combination of the best independent developments for discount rates
up to 19%.
1/ This project would have a lower dam 125 meters high compared with
220 meters now planned for El Cajon project.

7.        The consultants studied 6 alternative schemes of transmission
systems covering alternative routes, different transmission voltages (138,
230 and 345 kV) and different circuit arrangements (single-circuit arid
double-circuit). They concluded that a single-circuit 230 kV line linking
Leon in Nicaragua to Tegucigalpa in Honduras, to be operated at 138 kV
initially until El Cajon is commissioned, would be the least cost solution.
Final Modifications
8.        During the two appraisals, it was agreed that, in order to reduce
investments by both Bnpresas, ELC's proposed program for interconnection
would be modified as follows:
ENALUF:        50 MW steam unit at Puerto Somoza in 1975
50 MW steam unit at Puerto Somoza in 1976
ENEE:          24 MW diesel units at La Ceiba in 1974
4 x 75 MW hydro units at E1 Cajon in 1978
9.        It was also decided that, due to stability considerations, the
interconnection line would be operated at 230 kV from the start.
10.       The above modifications would reduce the reserve capacity of each
system, thereby lowering the percentage of firm capability from the original-
ly agreed 85% to 80% for ENEE in 1977 and to 79% for ENALUF in 1982 , which
is acceptable to both Empresas. The equalizing discount rate is now expected
to be about 20%.

DIESEL UNITS AT LA CEIBA
1.        The installation of diesel units at La Ceiba has the following
purpose:
a)   to supply the needs of this city, the utility business of
which ENEE plans to purchase from Standard Fruit in 1972,
before the transmission line is extended to it;
b)   to provide the needed additional capacity for ENEE's main
power system before the completion of the interconnection
with ENALUF;
c)   to enable ENEE to meet, before the commissioning of El Cajon,
a substantial part of its demand in the event of an inter-
ruption of the interconnection; and
d)   to provide a standby reserve for La Ceiba area and the Aguan
valley in the event of an outage of the long transmission line.
2.        The proposed capacity of 24 MW is the minimum amount of power
required to meet these needs. Installation of steam units is an in-
appropriate alternative because of the small size required and the nature
of the service. Although the capital cost of gas turbine units would be
lower, their lower efficiency and the higher price of fuel (light diesel
oil) make them non-competitive with the medium-speed diesel units using
Bunker C oil. As shown in accompanying table, the diesels would be the

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT - HONDURAS
(HONDURAS-NICARAGUA INTERCONNECTION)
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
EXTENSIO1N OF POWER SUPPLY TO AGUAN VALLEY
1.        The Aguan valley is potentially one of the richest areas of
Honduras. The Standard Fruit Company has large operations in the valley,
including large banana plantations at½oyoles and Isleta. The plantations
are irrigated with pumps driven by diesel engines with a total capacity of
about 11,000 hp. It is expected that the Company will replace the diesels
with electric motors when low cost electrical power is available. The
Honduras Government has plans to develop the valley through the National
Agrarian Institute; availability of electric power would facilitate the
implementation of the plans.
2.        Under the proposed project ENEE would construct a 138 kV trans-
mission line about 47 km long from La Ceiba to a substation at Coyoles
and from there 34.5 kV subtransmission lines, with a total length of about
90 kmi, would radiate to serve the irrigation pumps and other loads.
3.        The best alternative method of providing the same services would
be the installation of two maedium-speed diesel sets of 6 MW each at Coyoles.
The accompanying table shows the proposed supply from ENEE's main system to
be more economic for any discount rate.
4.        Assuming that ENEE would charge US1.5¢/kWh for irrigation power,
the project's internal financial rate of return would be about 17% over its
estimated economic life of 30 years. The assumed rate would enable Standard
Fruit to save about 50% of its current pumping costs.

The total present value of Stream A is found to be less than that of Stream  B for all discount rates within the
range of 0 to 100%. This shows that Stream A is the least cost solution.
Internal Financial Rate of Return: 17.04% (Stream A vs. Stream C).
