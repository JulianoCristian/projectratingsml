The lessons learned include: (1) The presence\n            in the field of the task manager and the continuity of the\n            Bank's preparation and supervision teams have been a\n            critical factor for the success of the project; (2) A small\n            Project Coordination Unit (only three professional staff)\n            with a strong leadership is able to coordinate various\n            executing agencies and implement two major complex projects\n            simultaneously; (3) Rather than focusing on the\n            institutional aspects of regulation, with the creation of\n            autonomous regulatory agencies (often multi-sectoral), which\n            have generated more problems than solutions, it might be\n            more efficient to provide the Government with regulatory\n            instruments (the financial model) to determine consumer\n            tariffs and sector investments and to rely on the contract\n            to regulate the private operator; (4) A good PSP option must\n            contain properly designed performance incentives for the\n            private sector as well as specific incentives to serve the\n            poor and that regulation by contract can be successful if\n            properly designed; and (5) The use of a financial model at\n            the very early stage--to assess the level of mixed\n            public/private investment that would be consistent with the\n            financial equilibrium of the sector and with socially\n            acceptable tariffs increases--was a powerful tool in guiding\n            the sector to financial health and sustainability."}, "docdt": "2004-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
