PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AVIATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1963-PE)
PkEFACE_
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Aviation Development
Project in Peru, for which loan 1963-PE in the amount of $58.0 million was
approved on February 26, 1981. The loan was closed on December 31, 1987, one
year behind schedule when $19.25 million was disbursed and $38.75 million
canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations Division
of the Latin America and the Caribbean Country Department IV (Preface, Evaluation
Summary and Parts I and III). On April 6, 1990 the Bank sent the Borrower Parts
I and III with the request to prepare Part II by May 30, 1990, but none was
received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision
mission of the Project in 1987, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

AVIATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1963-PE)
EVALUATION SUMKARY
Obiectives
1.       The main objectives of the project, the regional integration of
Peru by improving the airport infrastructure to permit the introduction of
more economical and modern aircraft and to enhance the airport landing and
guidance facilities (para. 3.1), were partially achieved. Only a part of
the project was implemented, and less than one third of the Bank loan of
$58 million was disbursed.
Imvlementation and Results
2.       Implementation of the project was adversely affected from the
start by the lack of availability of local funds (para. 5.3) which resulted
in the Ministry of Economy requesting Bank assistance ir. the analysis and
resolution of CORPAC's financial problems (para. 5.4). The Bank mission,
after analyzing CORPAC's problems suggested a reformulation of the Project
(para. 5.5) which basically trimmed the size of the project to reduce the
need for counterpart funds, and established a plan of action to improve the
financial position of CORPAC, including means to ensure that the airlines
AeroPeru and Fawcett honored their p'- *-nt commitments to CORPAC
(para. 5.7). Although there was som.. 4provement in project implementation
following the reformulation and CORP.i...'s financial position improved to
some extent (para. 5.8), the project was eventually suspended when the
Government stopped making service payments on World Bank loans in 1987,
leading to a general suspension of disbursements. In July 1988, the loan
account for this project was closed.
Results
3.       Project results were therefore limited.  The study for the four
airports Pucallpa, Huanuco, Tarapoto and Tingo Maria was satisfactorily
completed. Much of the work on the Pucallpa airport was done, but only a
part of the national program of procurement of navigational aids,
communications and airport equipment was completed (para. 6.1). However,
although no work was done in Huanuco, Tarapoto and Tingo Maria. the study
for these airports would be useful whenever work is resumed on the
improvement of the aviation and infrastructure in Peru. The Cuzco Airport
study was completed, although its findings remained controversial
(para. 10.1).
Sustainability
4.       The Project as originally conceived had sound sustainibility in as
much as it aimed at the improvement of the airport infrastructure of Peru
through an integrated program of technical economic and financial



- iv-
improvements. However, traffic failed to increase as forecast as a result
of a general economic downturn in Peru, thereby limiting CORPAC's ability
to finance the project. Furthermore, the hiatus in the implementation of
the project caused by the adverse turn in the political and economic
situation of the country has introduced an element of uncertainty, the full
effect of which is difficult to predict at this stage. A final word on the
sustainability of the project willi therefore have to wait until conditions
improve and the situation in Peru permits a reliable reassessment.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.       The project achieved its objectives only partially, as some of the
project components, assessed at the time of reformulation to have lower
returns due to the drop in traffic, were deleted from the project.
However, the part of the project which was completed has been re-evaluated
to have a good overall rate of return (19Z) which is close to the appraisal
forecast of 202 (Table 6(B)). It would appear that the main weakness of
the project was over-estimation of the traffic forecast which in turn led
to over-optimistic expectations of investment funds from CORPAC. However,
neither the world economic recession nor its impact on the Peruvian economy
could have been predicted at the time of appraisal. In addition, both the
Bank and the Borrower responded qui:kly to the new economic circumstances
by reducing the scope of the project and the loan in line with CORPAC's
capability to contribute local currency resources and to service future
debt. The suspension of disbursements and termination of the project, two
years after the project reformulation, was brought about by the Guarantor's
action in stopping service payments for Bank loans.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
AVIATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1963-PE)
PART I: Proiect Review from Bank's Perspective
1. Project Identity
Project Name:  Airport Development Project
Loan No.:       1963-PE
RVP Unit:       LA4IE
Country:        Peru
Sector:        Transport
Subsector:     Airports
2.  Background
2.1      With an area of 1.3 million km2 and a population of over 18
million, Peru is the fourth largest country in Latin America. The Andes
which run parallel to the coastline divide the country into a narrow
coastal region (Costa), a mountainous region (Sierra) and the Eastern
Amazon plains region (Selva). The Costa is the most densely populated and
economically developed part of the country and contains six of the ten
largest urban centers of Peru, including the capital Lima.
2.2      Peru's geographical and climatic conditions make provision of
transport facilities extremely difficult and the transport network, in a
sense, reflects this difficulty. Since the nineteenth century several
isolated railways have been built by private interests to connect mining
areas in the Sierra with coastal ports. However, the railways and ports
are highly specialized and operate mainly as transport systems for
minerals. Only highways, and more recently civil aviation have played some
role in integrating the country, but the lack of an adequate transport
network continues to be one of the most difficult problems confronting
Peru. Expansion and improvement of the transport network, particularly in
the Sierra and the Selva are needed to meet the growing transport
requirements, and to provide access to the isolated and underdeveloped
regions of the country.
2.3      The Transport Sector Plan of Peru (1977-1986) recommended as its
goal "the provision of a rational transport system" which would:
(i)    contribute efficiently to the socio-economic development or
the country, its integration and its national defense;
(ii)   satisfy transport demand requirements with adequate and
appropriate technology;



(iii) support foreign trade and strengthen the balance of
payments; and
(iv) facilitate integration with the Latin American Region.
2.4      In keeping with, and  .onsistent with the above goals, the general
objectives of the Bank in the transport sector have been to: (i) promote
investments designed to integrate and extend the transport system to
support expansion of economic activity; (ii) streamline responsibilities
for investment plans, and strengthen investment planning capacity and the
management of the transport related agencies; and (iii) promote efficient
use of infrastructure and resources through proper pricing and regulatory
policies.
2.5      The Bank has made a total of 15 loans to the transport sector (see
Table 1 (Part 3)) over the latit 30 years. Of these, 4 were for port
operations, two for railways (one of which was cancelled), seven for
highways, one for ports and highways combined, and one for airports which
is the subject of this report. Implementation of these projects has been
difficult, in part because of intractable technical problems caused by the
extremely difficult physical conditions, but also largely due to weak
management, aggravated by low salary levels, for professional staff in the
executing agencies, which resulted in difficulties in recruitment and
retention of qualified managers and engineers. After 1987, when Peru
stopped making service payments on Bank loans, Bank's activities in Peru
have been suspended.
3. Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.1      Project Obiectives.  For reasons of topography, Peru has relied on
air transport as one of the means of regional integration, and as is the
case with other Andean countries, aviation has been particularly useful to
overcome the difficult crossing of high mountain ranges. The route
structure developed by the two principal airlines Aeroperu and Fawcett is
of the "hub and spoke" type with Lima as the centre and all main routes
radiating out to the various cities in the country. The Airport
Development Project was a response to the need for updating the airport
infrastructure to permit the introduction of more economical and modern
aircraft and to improve the airport landing and guidance facilities ta suit
such aircraft. Without any significant investment in nev aircraft the
objectives of the project were to:
(a) allow more economical aircraft within the commercial fleet to
be used at additional existing airports on regular services;
(b) improve the flow and security of air traffic within Peru; and
(c) reduce the aircraft ground handling time.
To achieve these objectives it was initially planned to improve three
airports, construct one new airport, and to acquire new navaid,
communications and aircraft handling equipment to replace the older
equipment in the national system which was rapidly becoming obsolete.



3-
3.2      General Description.  The project to be implemented by the
Corporacion Peruana de Aeropuertos y Aviacion Comercial (CORPAC) over a
five year period consisted of four main parts:
Part Is     Pavement overlay at Pucallpa airport, reconstruction of runways
at Tarapoto and Huanuco, and construction of a r.ew airport at
Tingo Maria;
Part II:    Provision of communication facilities at these sites and
navaids at these and other sites throughout Peru, together with
equipment to calibrate them;
Part III:   Provision of aircraft apron handling and airport electrical
equipment;
Part IV:    Provision of technical assistance in the form of engineering
consultants for the final design of Cuzco, accounting
consultants for CORPAC and airport engineering advisers (from
ICAO) for CORPAC; and
Part V:     Provision of communications, including high frequency
telecommunications equipment, at 33 locations throughout Peru.
3.3      The total estimated cost of the project including contingencies
was about $127.6 million. The foreign exchange component was about $77
million of which $58 million was to be financed by the World Bank loan. In
addition, the foreign exchange component of the communications equipment
($19 million) was to be financed from a proposed German bilateral loan.
These amounts would represent approximately S02 of the total project costs.
The balance equivalent to US$50.6 million, would be provided by: CORPAC
($49.4 million), Ministry of Transport and Communications - MTC ($0.4
million) and Comision Especial para Coordinar y Supervigilar el Plan
Turismo y Cultura - COPESCO ($0.8 mil.ion). It was agreed that CORPAC
would update its 5-year investment plan on a yearly basis and that CORPAC
would increase its revenues in such an amount that it would be able to meet
its operating expenses, local costs of capital investments and debt service
requirements and to obtain a return of not less than 82 on its revalued net
fixed assets.
4. Proiect Design and Organization
4.1      The project was designed as an integ-ated program of technical
economic and financial improvements and was aimed at updating and
modernizing the airport sub-sector. The conceptual foundation for the
project was thus clear and was obviously shared by the Borrower and the
Government. The project content was conventional, although it generated
considerable enthusiasm both in Peru and in the Bank, due to its country-
wide sweep.
4.2      Coordination of work in connection with the project was entrusted
to CORPAC. CORPAC was also entrusted with the responsibility for foreign-
financed airport construction work but was not particularly interested in
paying for local airport improvements. The contracts for the consulting
engineers and the design work for the Cuzco Airport would be administered



by a committee consisting of representatives of CORC'AC, COPESCO,
Directorate General of Air Transport (DGTA) and the Ministry of Finance,
but the responsibility for the technical superviri: of the consultants'
work would rest with CORPAC. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) woul6
be the principal mode for procurement, with the expectation that local
contractors would win about 75? of the construction contracts, whereas most
of the contracts for procurement of equipment would go to foreign firms.
The project was scheduled for completion in June 30, 1986.
5.  Proiect hr-lamentation
5.1      Loan Effectiveness and Proiect Start-up.  Although the .L'rport
Development Project was appraised in February-March 198C, negotiations did
not take place till February 1981 and Board approval was given in March
1981. The delay took place mainly because cost estimates for the four
airports were not ready until the consultant's study for the engineering
design of these airports, financed from a PPF advance and awarded to a
Canadian consulting firm in collaboration with a local company, was well
under way. By April 1981 when the first Supervision Mission visited Peru,
project implementation had started although the Loan Agreement had not yet
been signed. Offers for the Cuzco Airport Study had been invited and were
under evaluation, and the preparation of bidding documents and
specifications for the equipment purchases had started.
5.2      The Loan Agreement was signed in August 1981 and became effective
in January 1982. There was, in the meantime, one more supervision mission
in November 1981. CORPAC had reorganized and become a 7Sociedad Anonima",
and the study of the four airports was nearing completion. The following
supervision missions in March 1982 and July 1982 reported encouraging
trends about traffic and revenues, but procurement of equipment which had
started well had a serious setback when proposals for equipment for
instrument landing systems (not financed by the Bank project) were
evaluated badly and resulted in the controller general of Peru declaring
the award void. The result was that four majority members of the Board
resigned, the acting General Manager of CORPAC was fired and five other
technical managers were suspended. Some of these actions were considered
at the time to be arbitrary and misdirected, and resulted in a drastic
slow-down of the decision-making processes of CORPAC. As a result,
procurement of navaid and other equipment for the project were delayed.
Regarding the design and implementation of a modern cost accounting system
which at CORPAC's request was expanded to include also a study of CORPAC's
management, tenders were received in February 1982. However, award to the
selected firm originally expected for July 1982, was substantially delayed,
pending the issuance of a grant from the Italian Government for US$450,000
which would finance the additions to the study.
5.3      The following mission in December 1982 reported resumptior. of
procurement activity but delays occurred due to lack of availability of
local funds. The consultants working on the final design of the four
Amazon Corridor Airports finished their work financed from the PPF Loan PO-
29.  For the Cuzco Airport final design, a _,pecial committee was appointed
which was headed by COPESCO and included representatives from CORPAC and
the Ministries of Finance, Tourism and Tranenort. There was some
controversy over the selection of the consultant. After a year's delay, an
American engineering consultant in association with a local firm, was



-5-
iinallv selected for the rew Cuzco Airport study. However, CORPAC raised
some d&.bts about the aeronautical feasibility of the site and it was
decided to add an air-space expert from ICAO to assist in the study. The
communications study financed by Lufthansa was presented to CORPAC at the
end of December 1982.
5.4      A mission in July 1983 first signalled the serious financial
problems of CORPAC and the inadequate cash flow resulting from a drop in
passenger traffic, inadequate tariff increases, and the failure of AeroPeru
and Faucett to pay the moneys owed to CORPAC. The Ministry of Economy
requested the Bank to send a financial analyst to help CORPAC analyze acd
resolve its financial problems. This mission, in September 1983 confirmed
that CORPAC's financial position had deteriorated as a result of falling
revenues and a high level of expenditures. Revenue declines were caused
by: (1) a substantial reduction in passenger traffic resulting from the
impact on Peiu's performance of the world economic recession; (ii)
difficulties experienced in collecting fees from the national airlines
AeroPeru and Faucett; and (iii) inddequate tariff adjustments to of;set
rising costs, pa:-ticularly staff costs. As a result CORPAC had a severe
cash squeeze and could not finance its share (local costs) of the project.
The conclusion was that CORPAC could manage, only if the project was made
smaller askd the Government assisted CGRPAC in increasing its revenues and
reducing expenses, notably in personnel.
5.5      Project Reformulation.  The September 1983 mission after assessing
the financial situation of CORPAC suggested four alternatives for -educing
the project scope. By November 1983 there was general agreement between
the Bank, CO0PAC and the Ministry of Economy that the reformulated project
should include navaids and auxiliary equipment for the airports, technical
assistance, and civil works for the airport at Pucallpa. The major cut was
the other 3 airports at Huanuco, Tarapoto and T'ngo Maria which the latest
assessments showed had relatively low rates of return based on revised
traffic estimates. Communications equipment to be financed by a German
institution would also be deleted because co-financing did not materialize.
The final design study of the Cuzco airpor , was already fairly advarced,
and therefore stayed in the project. The study for the Accounting and
Management Systems was also retained, because it was conridered to be a
basic need. The Ministry of Economy and Finance recommended that the modus
operandi for generating the counterpart funds required by CORPAC for the
reformulated project would be as follows:
(a) Exoneration of import duties on the equipment that would be
procured for the project; and
(b) Assignment of certain funds from the Corporation for the
Development of Pucallpa (CORDE UCAYALI) to cover the local
costs of the civil works for the Pucallpa Airport.
In addition, the Bank insisted that a formal agreement should be reached
between CORPAC and the Government to improve the financial situation of
CORPAC, which would include:
(c) Tariff increases and cost reductions by CORPAC; and
(d) a definitive and satisfactory arrangement for the payment to
CORPAC of airport services availed by the airlines, AeroPeru
and Fawcett.



- 6 -
It tcok another year for CORPAC to request the Bank officially for project
reformulation. Major changes to the Loan Agreement were required and these
were made in August 1985. The cost of the Project was reduced from $128
million to about $48 million and the Bank loan from $58 million to
$34.5 million. The date for completion of the project was postponed by one
year to June 30, 1987.
5.6      Meanwhile, although the formal reformulation of the project was
slow in coming, work continued, aLbeit with substantial delays, on the
portion of the project that was to remain in the reformed project. The
airspace study added to the final engineering for Cuzco Airport (in
progress) was concluded, and negotiations continued with the selected firm
for the design and implementation of a modern cost accounting and
management system for CORPAC. Procurement work, almost brought to a
standstill after the 1983 management shake up in CORPAC, resumed.  Bidding
documents were finalized for tenders for communications and apron
equipment, firms were prequalified for the retender on navaids and the
contract for electrical generating equipment was awarded. Although the
total disbursemerts at the end of 1983 stood at $2 million only, the
procurement machinery was moving again and the prospects for the
implementation of the reformulated project appeared bright after the
serious hold ups in the original project.
5.7      By mid 1985 $6.5 million were disbursed and contracts were signed
for navaids, communications, apron and fire fighting equipment to the tune
of almost $10 million. The consultants' consortium which had started work
on the cost-accounting/management study, in December 1984, had to stop as
the financing never materialized. The draft final design for Cuzco Airport
was approved by COPESCO. However, CORPAC which was responsible for the
technical review, was not satisfied with the work and held up final
payments to the consultants, leading to complaints by the latter. Finally,
in early 1985, CORPAC presented, as a requirement for project
reformulation a plan of action to improve its financial position which in
general was judged satisfactory by the Bank and on the suggestion of the
Bank, CORPAC agreed to expand the plan to establish permanent policies in
regard to tariff adjustments and control of working costs. The Government
also issued decrees forcing Aeroperu and Fawcett to service their debts
with CC:'PAC. With all these actions and plans in place, the project was
finally reformulated in August 1985.
5.8      Project implementatior improved steadily and by mid 1986, over $14
million were disbursed, the management of CORPAC was regaining its strength
and project executiun was under effective management. The last supervision
of this project took place in March i987. CORPAC's financial position was
improving and thi.s trend was expected to continuo. It was therefore
unfortunate that developments in Peru led to the suspension of
disbursements by the Bank in May 1987 due to non-payment of debt service by
the Peruvian Government. The Bank continued efforts to sustain project
momentum, and concomitantly to demonstrate its good faith in attempting to
normalize relations with the Government, by agreeing to co;.tinue
supervision of the procurement process including approval of new contracts
with the provision that disbursements would be withheld until normal
relations with Peru were restored. As a result, procurement of some more
materials and equipment (including an FFI aircraft) was approved but not



actually financed. Finally in July 1988 the Bank initiated action for
closinig the loan account for this project. At loan closure, $19.25 million
was disbursed.
5.9      Proiect Costs.  As detailed in para. 5.5 above, the original
project was scaled down due to the drop in traffic leading to CORPAC's
inability to finance the counterpart funds. The estimated cost of the
reformulatad project as amended in 1985 was $47.7 million. When the
project was closed at the end of 1987, the reformulated project had
gathered some momentum in the implementation process, but was as yet far
from complete. The final cost of the portion of the project implemented
was $26.9 million, roughly 56Z of the truncated project as reformulated.
Inspite of the reformulation of the project, CORPAC had difficulty finding
counterpart funds, and over 71t of the total expenditure incurred on this
project was in foreign exchange as against 602 foreseen when the project
was reformulated. Details of the cost estimates (at appraisal and
reformulation) and the actual costs are given in Table 5 (Part III). A
review of this table indicates the following:
(i)    only 702 of the Navigational Aids and 502 of the
Communications program of the reformulated project was
carried out;
(ii)   59Z of the ramp and other airport equipment was purchased;
(iii)  rescue and firefighting equipment was procured in full;
(iv)   100Z of the reformulated Pucallpa project was carried out:
5v)    The Cuzco Airport study was completed, alth!ugh its content
was a subject of controversy and re*ulted in denial of some
of the final payments to the cov.lultants; and
(vi)   in terms of the reformulated proiact estimates, 58.5t of
the local expenditures foreseen were incurred, 55.82 of the
foreign exchange expenditures and 56.51 of the total.
5.10     Disbursements.  Table 3 (Part III) indicates the Estimated and
Actual Schedule of Disbursements. In FY82 only $0.4 million out of the
$8.9 million estimated were disbursed. In FY83 $1.2 million were disbursed
and in FY84 $0.7 million. After project reformulation disbursements picked
up and in FY85 $4.2 million were disbursed, in FY86 $7.9 million and in
FY87 $4.4 million, reaching a total of $19.25 million by December 31, 1987
when the loan was closed. The table shows that the course of disbursements
bears no resemblance to the appraisal forecast, although it compares more
favorably with che standard profile of disbursements for Peru.
6. Proiect Results
6.1      Project Objectives.  The main objective of the project viz
regional integration of Peru, was only partially achieved, first because
the original project had to be curtailed by deleting three of the four
airports of the Amazon Corridor, and secondly only half of the truncated
project was implemented because of the suspension of disbursements and
closure of the project in 1987. Much of the work on the Pucallpa airport



was done but only a part of the work of the procurement of navigational
aids, communications equipment and airport equipment was done (para. 5.9)
and as such the work of updating the airport landing and en-route
navigation facilities was only partially accomplished. The study for tne
four airports Pucallpa, Huanuco, Tarapoto and Tingo Maria was completed
qatisfactorily by the consultants and would certainly be useful whenever
conditions become more propitious for resuming work on the improvement of
the aviation infrastructure in Pertu. The cost-accounting and management
systems stuev was not implemented as the financing failed (para. 5.7). The
Cuzco airv:- t study was completed, although CORPAC did not accept the
findingE .  .he report and a part of the final paynment was not paid to the
Consultani   .ra. 10).
6.2        ,'ic and Operations.  CORPAC's actual traffic figures are shown
in Tabla 5(.  (Girt III).  The overall passenger traffic (national and
internationel) declined over 20Z between 1980 and 1985, the decline having
been the steepe3t between 1980 and 1981 (7?) and between 1981 and 1982
(6Z), easing somewhat between 1982 and 1983 (3.5?), and with a sharp
decline again (8.3Z) between 1983 and 1984. In 1985 passenger traffic went
up (2.7Z) over 1984. Even so passenger traffic figures for 1985 were only
462 of appraisal forecasts indicating that traffic forecasts at appraisal
were overestimated, thus making the reformulation of the project not only
inevitable, but beneficial, in as much as the investments were trimmed
down.
6.3      Economic Re-evaluation.  The methodology followed for the economic
re-evaluation of the project was, basically, the same as the one used at
appraisal. Reduced transport costs and less costly equipment operations
have conservatively been used to determine the direct quantifiable benefits
of most of the project components. However, some of the components,
notably navaids, communications and apron equipments, were only partially
procured, and this fact was considered in the re-evaluation of benefits.
6.4      All items evaluated at appraisal were re-evaluated with the
exception of three airports and a calibration aircraft, which were finally
excluded from the project. The individual ERRs (Table 6(B)) range from 1;Z
to 30?. The economic re-evaluation of the Pucallpa airport, navaids,
communication and apron equipment, gave an overall project ERR of 19Z,
almost the same as the ERR of 20? obtained at appraisal. Of course the two
figures are not entirely comparable because of the major changes to the
initial components. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to
investigate the influence of a shorter life of the benefit-generating
period, or a reduction in the forecasted traffic growth. The results of
the sensitivity test are still acceptable with the exception of the cases
analyzed for the apron equipment with values of 9Z.
6.5      Financial Performance.  CORPAC's financial statements, including
appraisa.i. and actual results for the period 1980-1985 are given in Tables
6(C)l and 6(C)2. As stated previously in this report, CORPAC's
deteriorating financial situation arising from the drop in traffic was
main reason for its failure to carry out the project as originally
designed. CORPAC's operating results began deteriorating sharply in 19
when revenues dropped dramatically mainly as a result of a reduction in
traffic. Further aggravating this situation was the fact that payroll
expenses had been increasing steadily during 1981 and 1982 and were not



- 9 -
being adequately met by tariff increases. As a result, working and
operating ratios deteriorated markedly, from 74 and 81 in 1981, to 101 and
108, respectively in 1982. In the years that followed (1983-1985),
CORPAC's operating results showed an improvement with respect to 1982, not
so much because of higher revenues but rather because of a tighter control
of salary costs. Indeed, CORPAC's vorking and operating ratios improved to
66 and 73 in 1983, deteriorated slightly to 73 and 80, respectively, in
1984, and improved again to 47 and 66, respectively in 1985. There is
reason to believe that the financial situation of CORPAC continued to
improve slightly over the next two years, althcugh no figures are available
to tabulate the position. However, the project could not benefit from this
as the funding of the project had to be stopped by the World Bank
(para. 5.8).
6.6      There was another factor which adversely affected CORPAC's ability
to carry out the project, and to p.iy operating costs, which was a
deficitary cash position resulting from the national airlines' (Aeroperu
and Fawcett) refusal to pay airport fees as billed by CORPAC. Indeed,
while it is true that CORPAC's actual revenues would have sufficed for a
reduced project, after covering operating expenses, CORPAC was unable to
collect a substantial portion of its billing as a result of a long-standing
dispute with the national airlines over the fees that applied. CORPAC's
actual and expected Balance Sheets (Table 6(C)2) show CORPAC's worsening
receivables position during the 1980-1985 period. The dispute with the
national airlines stemmed from the interpretation of the law establishing
Aeroperu. The latter was the institutional successor of Satco, the airline
element of the Peruvian Air Force. Satco was operating domestic flights
and paying only 252 of airport fees; Aeroperu was claiming that it should
continue to benefit from such discount even on its international routes
and, consequently, was not accepting liability for 75% of the above fees.
Fawcett argued it should benefit from the same discounts on grounds of fair
competition. CORPAC, in turn, questioned the extension of this benefit to
Aeroperu, particularly on its international routes.
6.7      The above problem was finally solved in June, 1985, by a
Presidential decree establishing that the national airlines should start
paying CORPAC full tariffs on their international flights and that the
airLines would only be eligible for discount charges on national flights.
In order to solve the problem of arrears, the Government also agreed to
take over all of Aeroperu's obligations with CORPAC as of May 1985,
amounting to US$12.9 million. This aid was made effective by the
Government through the servicing of CORPAC's debts with IBRD up to the
amount agreed starting in December 1986. Although the actual payments to
the Bank haven't materialized since they coincided with the Government's
decision to stop servicing its external debts, CORPAC was released from the
corresponding obligations.
6.8      The solution to the problem of the national airlines as well as
CORPAC's compliance with the commitments of the financial plan of action
signed at the time of project reformulation (para. 5.7) were determinant in
the subsequent improvement of CORPAC's financial position (para. 6.5).
7. Bank Performance
7.1      At over 83 manweeks in the field for project preparation and
appraisal, and 154 manweeks in the field for supervision, the Bank



- 10 -
certainly spent enough effort on the assessment of the airports situation
in Peru and in trying to bring about project implementation in accordance
with the program agreed with the Borrower and guarantor. A fairly thorough
and comprehensive financial analysis was made at the time of the
reformulation of the project in 1983-1985 when it was found that CORPAC was
unable to find the counterpart funds for implementing the project as
appraised (para. 5.5). The project was trimmed substantially to bring it
in line with what CORPAC eould provide in terms of counterpart funds.
Implementation of the modified project was however stalled by developments
resulting in a closure of the project in 1988. In assessing the
performance of the Bank in this project, there is no question that the
suspension of disbursements in 1987 and the closure of the project in 1988
were justified in the circumstances then prevailing in the country.
However, the slow start of the proje:t, the slack pace of disbursements in
the initial years and the inability of CORPAC to find the counterpart funds
for investment arose from an initial overestimation of the traffic
forecasts which led to inordinately high expectations at appraisa.. in
respect of revenues to finance the project, and subsequently to the
reformulation of tie project when the expectations were not fulfilled.
8. Borrower's Performance
8.1      At the time of appraisal, Bank Lissions perceived CORPAC as the
most reliable entity in the constellation of agencies related to the
management of the aviation sub-sector in Peru, because of the experience
CORPAC had in civil engineering work and also its familiarity with airport
operations. Accordingly, CORPAC was selected to be the Borrower and the
executing agency. After project start up CORPAC re-organized and became a
'Sociedad Anonimam, and adopted an organizational structure somewhat better
suited to project management. However, soon afterwards, the detection by
the Controller General of Peru, of a relatively minor irregularity in a bid
evaluation (para. 5.2) resulted in suspension and removal of the general
manager and several senior managers of CORPAC. The punishment inflicted
was perceived to be arbitrary and excessive and dealt a severe body-blow to
the organization of CORPAC. It also proved to be a major factor in slowing
down procurement work for imported items during the first critical stages
of project implementation. With the passage of time there was some
improvement in the pace of procurement and disbursements picked up to some
extent, but the overall rate remained fairly dismal as illustrated in Table
3.
8.2      At best, procurement procedures in public sector agencies in Peru
rema_n cumbroue and time consuming, and would need to be straightened out,
hopefully under better circumstances, in a future project.
9. Proiect Relationships
9.1      Review of project files and mission reports indicates that the
interface between the Bank and the Borrower was a fairly close one. What
is not very clear however is whether the relationship between the Borrower
(CORPAC) and the Government on one side and between CORPAC and the airlines
AeroPeru and Fawcett was clearly established particularly in regard to the
realization of revenues, a the non-recovery of user charges from the
airlines became one of the reasons for CORPAC's failure to provide
counterpart funds for the project. There was also a certain amount of



- 11 -
tension between CORPAC and COPESCO (Corporation for the Development of
Tourism and Culture) which was reflected mainly in the poor administration
of the Cuzco Airport study (para. 10).
10. Consulting Services
10.1     Much of the preparatory work for this project,was based upon a
study of Peru airports which was financed from the Transport Corridor Loan
(1196-PE). This was conducted by a Canadian consulting firm supported by a
local consultants and provided the basic framework for the project.
Further work was done by this consortium for the detailed design work of
the four airports of Pucallpa, Huanuco, Tarapoto and Tingo Maria.  The work
done first by the Canadian firm with the assistance of the local
consultants (who provided the assistance in geotechnical wcrk) was of
consistently sound quality and is likely to be of considerable value
whenever development and construction work in the airports is resumed. The
work done by the consultants for the Cuzco Airport study was more
controversial in nature. Criticism was particularly severe from CORPAC
which had been entrusted with the technical supervision of the study and
questioned the validity of some of the conclusions. This resulted in the
hold-up of the two final payments by CORPAC. As a matter of fact, CORPAC,
along with the principal users of the proposed new airport for Cuzco
(Aeroperu, Fawcett, FAP and the Pilot's association of Aeroperu) has
rejected the proposal for the new airport at Chincero and has recommended
the improvement and expansion of the airport "Velasco Astete" for reasons
of better security, safety and economy in cost. The Consultants have
complained regarding the payments not made and have also taken their case
to court, but to this day there has been no resolution of the problem.
10.2     The study for revamping the accounting systems and management of
CORPAC was done only partially as the financing to be provided by the
Italian Government for a major part of the study failed to materialize
(para. 5.7).
11. Proiect Documentation and Data
11.1     The Staff Appraisal Report provides a good background and
rationale for the project, and the data and tables included should have
provided useful guilance to the Borrower and the Bank missions during the
implementation of the project. The legal documents were well drafted.
Periodic reports from the Borrower were received regularly, despite the
lack-luster implementation of the project. As this PCR has been written
over two years after the closing of the project and as the Bank has no
operations in Peru at present, it has been difficult to obtain some of the
data required. However, in combination with the supervision reports and
the correspondence in the project files, sufficient material was available
to formulate the conclusions presented in this report.
