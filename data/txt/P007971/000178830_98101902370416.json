be\n            to increase the efficiency and security of civil aviation in\n            Peru and improve service to the eastern jungle and jungle\n            highland regions, which currently have poor transport links\n            with the rest of the country. This would be accomplished\n            through: (i) the improvement of three regional airports and\n            construction of a fourth; (ii) provision on a nation-wide\n            basis of communications, navigational and other aviation\n            equipment including a flight inspection aircraft; and (iii)\n            final engineering for the project airports and for a new\n            airport at Cuzco and technical assistance for CORPAC. This\n            project faces no special risks."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
