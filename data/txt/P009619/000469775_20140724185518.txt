                     THE CHAIRMAN:   The first meeting is a Bank meeting,
         and the first item of business is the proposed loan to the
         Indian Iron and Steel Compan7.
                     I would like to call on Mr. Ma.eon.
                     MR. MASON:   Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, steel was
         produced in India before World War I by Tata Iron and Steel
         Company, and soon after it the Indian Iron and Steel Company
         works came into production.      Since that time production at
         both these privately owned companies has risen steadily.
                     Since the Second World War two extensive moderniza-
         tion and expansion schemes have been put into effect at both
         Tata Iron and Steel and Indian Iron and Steel.          In each case
         they have been aided by loans from the Bank.         The two loans
         to Tata add up to $107.5 million, and those to Indian Iron and
         Steel total $51-5 million.
                     The present capacity of finished steel for the two
         companies is now 2.3 million tons per annum -- 1.5 million
         tons at Tata and 800,000 tons at Indian       Iro~   and Steel.   Until
         recently this accounted for practically all of Indiats steel
         production.
                     During the Second Five-Year Plan -- that is, from
         April 1956 until April 1961 -- the Government undertook the
         construction of three steel mills in the public sector which
         toget~er   would also have a capacity of 2.3 million tons.        The
             ll

                                                                                  4
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
         doubling or finished steel capacity in such a short time is
                  an ambitious task for any country, and the pace of this
                  development, superimposed on the simultaneous growth of other

                  heavy industries, has so increased the demand for nigh-quality
                  coal that the insufficiency of its supply had threatened to

                  become an obstacle to the achievement of the target set in the

                  Third Plan.
                              As you are aware, the Bank has already made a loan

                  of $35 million to the Government for the import of equipment

                  needed for the expansion of the private coal eector, and with

                  this help we believe the private coal mining sector will be
                  able to reach its planned expansion of 17 million tons of coal

                  by the end of the Plan, of which 6 million tons ts to be cokin

                  coal.   Nevertheless, the private collieries will be ha.rd
                  pressed by the demands of industry, particularly for this good

                  quality coal.

                              In the meantime the Government has given priority
                  to the movement    or   coal to the steel mills, but ha.a not been
                  able to assure its quality and uniformity, in large part
                  due to the delay in building coal washer1es.       Thi~   had
                  adversely affected Indian Iron and Steel Companyrs production
                  of steel.     It is thus fortunate that the company has coal

                  mines of good quality coal which can be developed near enough
         I

         I to        make it economical to bring 1t by ropeway directly from
         I the        mine to the works.      Hence, when this project is completed
          r
                                                                              5
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
         Indian Iron and Steel will be able to supply its coke ovene
              with a uniform quality or high-grade coal which will not only
              reduce the amount of coking coal required but enable Indian
              Iron and Steel to maintain production of steel at a high level.
                        This would be the Bank's fourth loan to India fer
              projects in the first two years of the Third Five-Year Plan.
              It will bring the total to $125.5 million out of the total or
         I $200 million in loans which the President indicated he would
          i

          jpreeent to you.     Bank loans in toto to India now amount to
              about $800 million.   The five credite approved by the Inter-

              national De·:elopment Association amount to $88.5 million.
                        The provisions of the Loan anc Guarantee Agreements

              follow cloeely the pattern set in the previous two loans to
              Indian Iron and Steel.
                        Apart from the eections which are mentioned in the
              Presidentta report, you will note that this loan will be
              secured by a first fixed mortgage and a f1ret floating charge
              upon all the properties of the company.   You will also see that
              one of the conditions of effectiveness -- that is in Section
              8.0l{c) ·- is that the Bank ah.all be satisfied that the
              Borrower will be able to acquire all land, interests in land,
              properties, adequate electric power supply, and all such rights,

              priv:tlege! and franchises as shall be necessary to carry out
              the project.   The company has already taken action in all these
              matters, and we believe that their completion, thougn dependent

         in many cases on other parties, should not unduly delay the
              Bank in making this loan effective.
                        THE CHAIRMAN:     Thank you, sir.
                        Mr. Wright.
                        MR. WRIGHT:     Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, as you will
              recall, India t:s Second Five-Year Plan ended last March, and
              she is now nearly three quarters of the way through the first

              year of her Third Plan.
                        Changes in Indiate national income still depend
              primarily on the course of agricultural production.     The last
              year of the Second Plan saw a record food grains harveet,
              and preliminary indications are that the present year will
              aleo be a good one for agriculture.     Rainfall during the
              summer monsoon was abundant and fairly well distributed over

         1    the country.
          1
                        Industrial production has continued to rise at the
              rate of around    10 percent a year.   The latest official data
              relate to the month of July, and in the three months from
          ' May to July this year the over-all index was 8 percent higher
              than in the corresponding months of 1960.     This increase was
              achieved in spite of a decline in textile production, which
              accounts for nearly half the total weight of the index of
              production.    Thus, the production increases in the newer
              industries, particularly engineering and chemicals, have been

              much greater than the average.
                                                                                    7
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
                Industrial production would have risen faster but
          for the continued shortages of fuel and power and transport.
         ·The railways     rem~in   under heavy   pre~sure.   Shortage of power
         · has been a tbreat and remains one of the most serious obstacles
          to industrial expansion during the Third Plan.
                       The raw material position is rather difficult to
          asseseo      Clearly, some industries are being held back by
          shortages of imported materials, and this is one factor making
          for under-utilization of existing industrial capacity.              But
          there is no conclusive evidence to show that the situation has
          gotten worFe during the past year.
                        Imports as a whole during the current year -- that
          is, the Indian fiscal year 1961-1962            are expected to be
          coniiderably smaller than forecast a year ago.           Such increases
          as have occurred appear to be mainly in capital goods, and the
          level of maintenance imports ie hardly any higher than in
          1960-61.
                       Exports have done a little better this year.           In the

          five months April to September 1961, receipts were about
          $70 million.     That is 10 percent higher than in the       sa~e

          period of 1960.     Country-wise the largest increases have been

          in exports to the United States and Japan.          Commo~ity-wise
          the   ~ain   increases have been in jute textiles, raw cotton, and
          sugar.

                       In so far as the increase ln the value of jute export

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
         is attributable entirely to the higher cost of raw jute,
         1
          1 the picture is not altogether encouraging.          Iron ore exports
         '
               have increased less than they should, mainly because of
         I
         I shortage of rail transport, and the trends of exports of
         l vegetable     oils and cotton textiles have both been disappointing.
                         The figures of foreign exchange reserves on

               November 24 have been given in the President's Report.         Betwee~

               that date and December 9 there was a very small increase,

               bringing the total reserve bank's holdings, by a remarkable
               coincidence, to $555.555 million.
                         In spite of a net addition of $122.5 million to
               India's resources, resulting from transactions with the
         i''   Monetary Fund during the summer, no significant increase
               in foreign exchange    holding~   can be expected during the curren
               year, and there could be a slight fall.
                         The present year has seen a welcome pause in the

               persistent upward trend of pricea.       At the end of November tbe
               official index of wholesale prices was 1-1/2 percent lower tha
               at the same time a year ago.
                         The increase in money supply during the past 12
               months, a little over 5 percent, haf: been moarate in relation
               to the growth of production.      The favorable agricultural

               out-turn and the marked reduction in deficit financing by
               the Government have both contributed to greater internal
               financial stability.

                     that the execution of the Plan will fall eome way behind the

                     original timetable.   Nevertheless, solid      progres~   is being

                Contributing to the problem of supply of coking coal

              I

              !my full support for this loan.          It seems to be a very efficient

                               I must say that I was a little bit surprised wnen I

         arrangement should be changed.             On the other hand, the terms

           which might be suitable for a firm might not necesearlly be
               suitable for a country, or the country in which the project is

               located.
                          As I understand the situation, India has a very
               heavy external debt burden.       I have heard it said that it is

          . past the danger point.        I am wondering, therefore, whether con-
          ':sideration had been given to making arrangements whereby as

           ,far as the firm is concerned these terms would be maintained,
          1
          11
          1~ut    as far as India the country ls concerned it would be some-
          1~hat     more liberal.

           I
           I
                          or   course, I am thinking of the type of arrangements ,
           I
           rhich have been made in the case of IDA credits.
           '
           I              It may be that part of the anser is the five-year
           I
           period of grace, and I would like some information on this.
           l
           ~llre is a five-year period of grace, and it may be that the
           I
           I

           peak of the external debt burden will have been passed and
           i
           Indiants foreign exchange will have increased substantially.

                          I am wondering if this type of consideration entered
           '
           '
           iinto your recommendation that the loan should be for 12 years
          l~nd     include f1 ve years of grace.
           I
                          THE CHAIRMAN:    Well, I would say that the points you
               ring up are very     import~nt   and are things that we very care-
           !

          we think we ought to keep the two separate. We feel in a
                project that the Bank finances the amortization schedule should
                be geared to the project.
                             Now, if a country has serious balance of payments

                problems and very heavy debt problems, that means they would
                be eligible for IDA, or very likely be eligible for IDA.           But
          ·1
          11
          !i we think it would be a rather dangerous precedent to start

           I thing?
           I                 MR. KNAPP:    No, I don't think so, but I think it has
           i
          j! to be looked at in a broader perspective.          This is just one
           I

           l    part of the whole pattern of Bank-IDA financing for India.
            '
           ': It is true you would have to distort this case from our normal
                project s·tandarde to meet the Indian creditworthinese picture,

                but we just didn't think we ought to do it.
                             THE CHAIRMAN:    I think what you are talking about,
           i Mr.
           I
                       Hudon, is that we would have to review the whole policy of
           ) the Bank and just disregard the project approach as far as the
           l'
           I schedule of payments         is concerned, but I think it is important
           I when a country has a         heavy volume of payments to make that

          I is     when you start thinking about IDA.       Tb.at is what IDA is
           I

            J       the creation of IDA.      That's one of the real reasons for that.

           1'       But if you started gearing your amortization schedule to the

                    is that this was one way of considering the one we are

                    considering now, Iron and Steel, for a specific project in

                    which we were easily able to calculate whether it could pay

                    off.In the case of the coal loan, as you know, it was a very1!

                            MR. MASON:     Well, it was really to help them over
                  the Plan, in a way.    It was also as I say because there lere

                  new mines that wouldn't come into operation until that time.

               report it certainly looks like an extremely good investment,

               good from the private point of view and good from the public

               point of view, too.   But if in fact some calculations have

               been made about the expected return or some idea has been

               obtained of what this might yield, and if as I rather suspect

               this return is quite a significant one, again judging from

               the technical advantages of this scheme -- whether there

               has been any consideration given to the possibility of raising

               private finance for it.    I know there have been previous loans
        I; made in similar circumstances, but as I say I think this is a

        I'
        Ii
               point that did occur to me in reading this, and -- this is
        Iiii
               the opposite of the suggestion raised by Mr. Hudon -- whether
          I
               IFC had been thought of at all in this context.

                         I am asking a lot of questions more for elucidation,

               and as I say I think this sounds on the whole as presented to

               us an excellent project which will benefit the company and

               also India very greatly.

                         THE CHAIRMAN:    Well, I will answer the last two

               questions myself.

                         First cf all, I don't think the time is yet ripe to

            ' be able to float a loan like this in the private market.       We
         I:, are constantly thinking about that and checking with the

               private market, but I don't think the time is quite ready

               yet for that.

                         As far as IFC is concerned, this is just too big.
                                                                           18
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
             This is $19 million.    I   think if it was a smaller project it
             would certainly be a very attractive one for IFC.

                       I think that some day -- it may not be too far

             off -- that a company like the India Iron and Steel Company,

             which is an extremely well managed company -- it would be

             possible to float a loan in the private market, and this is

             something that we talk about.      As a matter of fact, I think
             it might be possible if you had a company like this, the

             Indian Iron and Steel or Tata Steel, to float a loan in the

             private market either here or abroad if it would be possible

        I
        1,
             to make it a convertible issue.      In other words, if you had
        I:
        Ji   some kick to it, either that the bonds that were to be offered:
        11
             had a conversion of the stock or you had an option to buy
        1:
             stock or something of that kind.
        1!

                       I can assure you we are thinking about this all the
        Ii
             time, and the minute we feel that the market wou-ld take this
        11


         I kind of an offering we will certainly go into it.        It may be
        I
        '    that sometime 1n the future the Indian Iron and Steel Company l
                                                                                l
                                                                                I

             in connection with other financing or possible expansion, if       i
                                                                                I

             they need to raise some additional equity money -- I think
                                                                                '
             this might be something that the IFC could take a look at,         i
                                                                                I

          that this is a captive production which is going to provide

              coal for their coking operations, and the aim of the Indian
              Iron and Steel Company is to produce steel.     Now, it is

              extremely difficult to follow through the whole thing and

              find out how many rupees per ton it is going to cost to pro-

              duce the coal.     Nevertheless, we did have some ideas about

              how much the coal was going to cost.     These estimatesl'ere a

              little bit difficult to make because most of the operation,

              which has extremely difficult mining conditions, and we don*t

          I   at about 15 rupees per ton, as against the price they are

              paying now of about 20 reupees per ton.     Now, it looks too

              much on the optimistic side.     There are so many unknowns
                                                                                   i

                lated industry, including severe regulation through the

                system of prices, and although the Indian Government has not

                formulated, as I understand it, its policy on retention prices

          11    for the future I think it is under consideration.       I have
          I!
          II
          11    heard a lot of talk at least about a discriminatory policy

          [\ \lilich would relate prices to costs, and in this sense there

          II is also a close profit        regulation in India's steel industry.
          I!
           i              So if Mr. Goldman is worried we might all be worried
           I

           I about    conferring some bonanza here upon the private companies.

                I don't think there is too much grounds for that.

                          THE CHAIRMAN:     I don 1 t either.

                          Dr. Donner.
                          MR. DONNER:     Mr. Chairman, I do not have any dif-

               , ficulty in going along with this project.      The investment

                takes place in a field with regard to which the Bank in its

                assessment last summer, 1960, of the Third Plan had expressed

                grave concern and has repeated it today that indeed the

                production of coal particularly is a very severe bottleneck.

                This project will help if continued to open up and widen

                somewhat this bottleneck.     It is a favorable project, and the
                                                                               21

             production of this coal will be cheaper for the firm than the

             prices it would have to pay if it buys coal from other places.

             The quality of the coal will be better, and with the realiza-

             tion of the project the railway system, which is heavily over-.

             loaded as we lcnow will not be further burdened.

                       Last and not least, the execution of the pro.ject is,:

             as you yourself, Mr. Chairman, have just said once more, in

             the hands of an excellent firm.

                       So far as I can see on all points this project

             qualifies for Bank financing.

                       Thank you.

                       THE CHAIRMAN:    Thanks.                                     '

               certainly feel that it is a very good investment.

                           I have a few technical questions to ask.

                           I have cc:mpared some of the figures given with

               respect to this project with some general figures presented

               to us in the appraisal report of the Indian Coal Industry,

               to which I referred already.

                           In the present report on page 9, paragraph 36,

               we have the figure of c    ital investment per annum, part

               of the 29.7 rupees for this project in the three collieries

               involved.

                           In the general report of last summe1", R 61-'(8, on

               page 24, paragraph Yl, we find that the capital cost of new

               mines has been estimated at 50 rupees per ton of annual out-

               put.   This particular project, being a joint project for

               the sand gathering and for the opening of new mines, I was

         , interested in comparing, if we take the average of the figures,
          '
         ''
         j     the 50 rupees per ton and the 19 rupees per ton in the

        lI general report, it would come to about 35 rupees, and here we
         1,·

               have a figure of 29.7, which looks favorable.

          the ropeways are excluded, and also the coal washing plant

            is excluded; also administration and engineering and contin-

            gencies are not included in the figure, which is basic for

            the 29.7.

                        I wonder whether if we compare the specific figure

          ' of this project with the general figures in the preceding

            report we would not come to a much higher figure from a

            realistic basis of this particular project.     Perhaps in the

            general report these costs, which I think should be added,

            namely, for the sand gathering and administration and contin-

            gencies, and so on, were also excluded, but I have some doubts

            whether this figure of 29.7 rupees per ton investment cost

            is a realistic one, if we take into consideration that at

            least the sand gathering and part of the administration and

            contingencies expenditures figures should be added to come to

          •:a reasonable investment figure.

                        In this connection, I wonder whether a certain per-

            cent for contingencies is a realistic figure.

                        We find in the technical report that the estimates

            of local currency expenditures in the preceding projects

            have in certain cases been almost double the estimated ones,

            and I would feel safer if in this case, too, a higher figure

            for contingencies would have been taken into consideration.

                        Now, my second question is:   What is the estimate of

            the cost of production per ton of this company, compared with
                                                                        24

          the so-called normal costs which are basic for the price

         policies?    The costs were fully discussed in the preceding

         paper, R 61-78, and they came to about 17.90 rupees per ton.

         Mr. de Alba has already given a tentative figure     of 14 to 15

         rupees per ton for this particulariroject in reply to Mr.

         Goldman's question.

                     I am interested to know how this relatively low

         figure can be achieved, in view of the fact that the report

         points out very clearly that the mines in question are very

         difficult ones to operate, the seams are rather steep and water

         danger is very imminent, and measures have to be taken to

         protect the mines from water and floods.

                     Labor costs certainly are low.   That would explain

         a low cost figure, but for the normal cost calculations in

         general these low labor costs also constitute an element.

                     So I would like to inquire how it is to be explained

         that in this particular case, although the natural conditions

         are not too favorable, the cost estimates are so far below the'
                         ~
         normal costs in gh-e general report.

                     Finally, I would like to inquire whether the staff

         and management are at present more satisfied about the coal

         price policies of the Indian Government than they were some         I

             given by a reasonable price policy, because this is of such

             general importance in this sector of production.
                       I am very much interested to know whether there

             have been any favorable changes in the price policies.

                       MR. DE ALBA:     Mr. Lieftinck, I will try to answer

             one by one your questions.

                       The reason why we exclude from our comparison the

             sand gathering stations and sand ropeways is because that was

             done by the private coal sector also.     The Indian Government

        I! is building a very extensive sector of sand gathering stations.

             and ropeways, and they are going to more or less carry the
        l
        11
             cost of sand storing or giving a premium       it hasn't been

         I   decided yet -- of 2 or 3 rupees per ton.     So what we are
        r trying to do was to precisely make the two things comparable.
        11

                       MR. LIEFTINCK:     You mean for international compari-
        1!
         I son these figures should be revised?
         i

                       MR. DE ALBA:     I am not talking about international
         , comparison.    I am talking exclusively between the Indian Iron
             and Coal project and the private sector coal project.
                       The Indian Iron and Steel project is a specific

         1   project that we had a chance to go and see what we are talking
        I about
         1         and see the actual mining operations and make studies
        I
        1 quite    sizeable and, we hope, accurate.
         I
        II
                       In the case of the private sector you have to keep

        l in mind    that you are going to deal with about not a hundred,

         las Mr. Mason mentioned, tut about 1,500 different collieries,

          from production of a few thousand tons to production of close
                   to a million tons.     That is the range that you have here.
                   You have some holes in the ground where you have a couple of
                   men using picks and shovels and about half a dozen women
                   carrying baskets of coal on their heads to bring the coal out
                   of these pits, and that represents about 20 to 30 percent
          :~       of the coal produced by the private sector.     From there you
          I'


          !I havei'fo fairly mechanized mines.          I haven 1 t seen a fully
          i
          II mechanized, fully modernized mine yet, but we hope to have one,
          1
           1    when we finish up this thing.
           I

                                so you can see the comparison is impossible to make
                   on a sound basis, so really we were just toying with making
                   comparisons as to the sand gathering and sand transportation

                                The coal formation plant is a different proposition

                   also not only in the private but the outside Indian Iron and
                Steel.        The Government has installed and is installing coal
                washers, and thererore the cost of those washers was not

                   included in the estimates made of theprivate coal sector.

          bit off beam, I should say, and we took great pains this time

                   with the ccmpany's executives and the consultants to make
                   sure that they have considered adequate contingencies.

                             Well, anything can happen.   The cost of labor is

                   subject to policies of the Indian Government, andmany other

                   things, and it is not for us to calculate or estimate on this

                   thing.   Blt we are hopeful that this is going to be closer

                   than the previous one.

                             Now, on the foreign exchange I feel pretty sure we

                   Indian Government claim it is a fairly good or was a fairly

                   good estimate at the time it was estimated.    For some other

                   companies they say it is absolutely out of range, that it is
               l



               ! higher or lower.

                             I have seen some fairly mechanized mines with higher

                   cost and have seen many of these small mines extracting coal

               ' by hand with really much less cost than is estimated here.             !

          why we didn't mention specific figures in our report, because
               the mining conditions are going to be especially difficult,
               and we just hope that we are going to be fairly below present
               costs because of the highly mechanized mine we are going to
               have there, and the fact that we are going to have a couple of
               openings which will give us more or less a fair balance in
               the cost of prod.uction.    But what the cost is going to be I
               can tell you five years fran now fairly accurately.
                         THE CHAIRMAN:    Thanks •
                         MR. KNAPP:     I think there was a question also on
               price policies.
                         MR. DE ALBA:     This is again one of the things we
               have discussed with the coal controllers, especially now that
               we are working on the private coal sector, and they are
           : planning to revise the prices. It is a complicated thing,
           I
          II
             because as I mentioned before they have some premium for
          ,,
          11

               sand storing and then they also have special premium if there
          i
           I   is gas.   I mean the Indian Government has allowed them a
           I
               certain amount when you go down to a certain depth, am there
          II
          ,1
               is an allowance.   So it is such a complicated deal that the
          !!
           i
           i
             Indian's claim that this is the best way to do it.       They will
           i
           i
           I
               probably be in favor of some across-the-board price and take
           I
           :   care of all these things in a general way.    That is the way
                                                                                    I

             it.
                          MR. KNAPP:     Mr. de Alba, isn't it generally true to

             say when we presented the loan l:ee::ll we were critical of some

             features of the price policy, and there have not been any

             significant changes since that time?

                          MR. DE ALBA:     I think it would be extremely difficult

             to do it because of the fact that they have their own sector

             of coal production, which is absolutely different from the

             private sector way of producing.            So they are trying to

             provide the standards which are applicable to the public

             sector and large modern mines to the public sector, which has

             all these many complicated little mines and very steep seams

             and all this.     It is very difficult for us to really put the

             pressure on them to make a reasonable price policy.            We are

             trying to,     and they said,     11
                                                    We are trying to do the best we

             can, 11 but we think that until we have the washers installed

             and all the sand ropeways installed and have a fairly good

             idea of what it 1s going to cost to provide these servicei5,

             then we can fairly cane out with a more reasonable price,

             probably in a couple of years or so.

                          MR. LIEFTINCK:     May I just comment on the latter

             part of it, Mr. Chairman.

                          In paragraph 58, on page 15 of the previous report,

        I'   the staff expressed the somewhat different view, which I still
        I
        I: think is the correct one.         They stated that the agreement on

          prices is not satisfactory, that these concessions do not get

                   the Government out of the private coal industry but are

                   getting them in deeper, and instead of an elaborate system of

                   price controls the price should be allowed to find its own

                   level, and the demand from the free market would get quality

                   coal out of the difficult mines much more efficiently than

                   subsidies.

                                Of course, it is not up to the Bank to dictate or

                   even try to strongly influence the Indian authorities with

                   respect to their price policies.                  That is up to them.        On the
               l other hand,      I   think we are entitled to point out what in the

          I opinion of the Bank would

                   reaching the goals which the Indian Government has set.
