The\n            overall project objective was to maximize the impact of the\n            resources available in the highway subsector. It was\n            translated into implementation of a maintenance program,\n            including 800 km of road rehabilitation and 225 km of\n            bituminous concreteoverlays; improvements to personnel\n            management and training; establishment of roadmanagement and\n            cost accounting systems; increases in the density of traffic\n            counts; andimprovements in road equipment maintenance. The\n            Bank identified key organizationalactions that were used as\n            conditions for loan processing. Loan covenants covered\n            organizationalactions and a detailed action plan and were\n            designed to promote achievement of project objectives. The\n            Bank should assess the complexity of the legal steps\n            involved and the related risks of delays when attaching\n            conditions to loan processing steps. Appraisal should\n            estimate the balance of financing between dinars and dollars\n            and related foreign exchange risks, by using variable annual\n            exchange rates based on the  constant purchasing power rule.\n            Similarly, a project account system should be set up\n            allowing to reconcile payments in US dollars and in dinars.\n            Road rehabilitation should extend to solving all identified\n            problems at the same time for a given section; the needs\n            usually include widening or construction of bridges and\n            culverts, raising the road surface above flood levels, and\n            treatment of spots with an abnormal concentration of\n            accidents. Consultants should be more involved in\n            supervision of works to build experience on the site and\n            feed it back in the design of subsequent similar projects."}, "docdt": "1996-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
