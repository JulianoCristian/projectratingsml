The loan\n            seeks to finance: (a) periodic maintenance, including the\n            provision of equipment and workshops; (b) road\n            rehabilitation; and (c) consultancy services and overseas\n            training improvement. The main benefits are reduced vehicle\n            operating costs, the strengthening of the organization and\n            administration of the Highway Department (DGPC), reduced\n            accidents, and savings in travel time."}, "docdt": "1987-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
