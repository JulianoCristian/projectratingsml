      THIRD ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
                        LOAN 7384-POL


BACKGROUND

1.       The overall implementation progress (IP) for the Third Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation (RMR-3) Project is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory together with the
progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO), which is also
assessed as Moderately Satisfactory. At the end of 2010, some 59.1 percent of Poland’s
national roads were confirmed to be in good or acceptable technical condition, marking
the first slight decline since 2005, mainly due to limited funding for rehabilitation during
2009 and 2010. The institutional modernization of the General Directorate of National
Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) is progressing at a slightly slower pace than expected.
Progress in the physical implementation of the road rehabilitation civil works program
completed in 2010 is assessed as Satisfactory. Implementation progress of the
institutional support and technical assistance components is assessed as Moderately
Unsatisfactory, resulting in an overall implementation rating of Moderately Satisfactory.
Over the second quarter of 2011, some improvement was observed in GDDKiA
commitment and in the pace of implementing of their Loan obligations. The attention of
the top management of the Ministry of Infrastructure (MoI) and GDDKiA was drawn to
the need for continuous implementation of the remaining components of the technical
assistance program, particularly the completion and prompt operation of the SAP-based
Management Information System (MIS) in GDDKiA.

2.     The latest Procurement Plan (PP) approved in July 2011 lists all contracts to be
implemented by Loan closing date of September 15, 2011. However, full implementation
of this final set of activities requires reallocation of the loan proceeds among the
categories. The project development objectives and their target values are not affected by
this.

3.       The proposed reallocation is needed to increase the probability of achieving more
sustainable results related to institutional aspects of the Project Development Objectives,
particularly in regard to improvements in the institutional capacity of GDDKiA. The
change is also in line with conclusions drawn from the previous two Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Projects (Loan 7223-POL and Loan 7282-POL) as reflected in the
respective Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs). The two ICRs underlined the
need to continue technical assistance support to GDDKiA and pay more attention to
institutional results of the Project, such as efficiency and safety of road rehabilitation and
maintenance system in GDDKiA. Subsequently the agreed set of TA and training
subprojects for GDDKiA, which is currently under implementation, is aimed at
addressing this recommendation in order to increase chances of achieving more
sustainable institutional results in line with the PDOs.
