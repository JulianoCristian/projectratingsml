                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is closing on September 15, 2011. The main project component related to supporting road rehabilitation and maintenance program is fully completed. While the
                         sustainability of the overall rehabilitation program is still at risk due to relatively low national budget for this component of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways
                         (GDDKiA) program for 2011 and onwards, the set of institutional support and training projects for GDDKiA and Ministry of Infrastructure is expected to improve their capacity and

                         technical assistance components were largely implemented although in some cases with delay. Some of them are expected to be continued by the Polish partners using their own
