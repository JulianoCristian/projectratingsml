The overall implementation progress (IP) for\n            the Third Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation (RMR-3)\n            Project is assessed as moderately satisfactory together with\n            the progress towards achieving the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO), which is also assessed as moderately\n            satisfactory. At the end of 2010, some 59.1 percent of\n            Poland's national roads were confirmed to be in good or\n            acceptable technical condition, marking the first slight\n            decline since 2005, mainly due to limited funding for\n            rehabilitation during 2009 and 2010. The institutional\n            modernization of the General Directorate of National Roads\n            and Motorways (GDDKiA) is progressing at a slightly slower\n            pace than expected. Progress in the physical implementation\n            of the road rehabilitation civil works program completed in\n            2010 is assessed as satisfactory. Implementation progress of\n            the institutional support and technical assistance\n            components is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory,\n            resulting in an overall implementation rating of moderately\n            satisfactory. Over the second quarter of 2011, some\n            improvement was observed in GDDKiA commitment and in the\n            pace of implementing of their Loan obligations. The\n            reallocation is needed to increase the probability of\n            achieving more sustainable results related to institutional\n            aspects of the PDO's, particularly in regard to\n            improvements in the institutional capacity of GDDKiA."}, "docdt": "2011-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
