Some lessons learned includes: when planning\n            sequential operations that involve sector reforms, it is\n            important to ensure that sufficient disbursement leverage is\n            retained to ensure the satisfactory implementation of the\n            institutional development components, as well as a realistic\n            time-frame for the operation; the use of country systems,\n            combined with adequate ex-post audits can contribute to fast\n            disbursement of quality works;  it is crucial to take into\n            account the budget constraints when using Highway\n            Development and Maintenance (HDM) analysis; and objectives\n            are more likely to be achieved when they have comprehensive\n            monitoring indicators. While proper indicators were set for\n            most objectives, there were no indicators linked to the\n            objective of achieving reliable and stable funding of road\n            maintenance or financial viability. This may have\n            contributed to the program's difficulty in achieving\n            significant progress on this sub-objective."}, "docdt": "2013-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
