Some lessons learned includes: The\n            RM&R3 was the last road project in Poland under the\n            Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) concept. It would have been more\n            precise to categorize it as program based, because it was\n            focused wholly on the road sector. The SWAp was a flexible\n            and cost-effective way to support middle-income countries\n            with acceptable country systems. However, the mixing of fast\n            disbursing operations with more labor- and time-intensive\n            institutional-building activities resulted in\n            inefficiencies. As soon as the civil works that followed\n            country systems were completed, the implementing agency\n            became less focused on the institutional-building component.\n            Overall, the Project design for the technical assistance\n            components was overly optimistic. Modernization reform could\n            wind up taking as much as an entire decade to implement. The\n            lesson for the Bank is the importance of policy dialogue\n            outside of the technical and road specific issues. Bank\n            transport teams tend to work closely with the Ministry of\n            Infrastructure (MoI), but less so with the Ministry of\n            Finance (MoF). Prior to the commencement of the program, it\n            might have been possible for the Bank team to come to an\n            agreement with the MoF that sustainability for maintenance\n            requires a stable source of funding and some provision made\n            in the Road Fund. Last, the success of the traffic safety\n            activities was the culmination of technical support through\n            a series of Projects. Institutional change takes time and is\n            often beyond the span of one Project. In moving forward,\n            though the project successfully rehabilitated roads, given\n            availability of other financial instruments and\n            sophistication of the client, the time may have come for the\n            World Bank in Poland to turn increasingly towards transfer\n            of knowledge and experience in this sector."}, "docdt": "2012-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
