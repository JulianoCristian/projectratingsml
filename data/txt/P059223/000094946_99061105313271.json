         the Nakivubo Channel Rehabilitation Project for Uganda,\n            which includes deepening and widening the main stormwater\n            drainage channel in Kampala in order to accommodate the\n            1-in-10-year return period storm flow. These are the adverse\n            environmental impacts and mitigation measures. Construction\n            will likely cause damage to some of the flora and fauna in\n            the area, soil erosion, and adverse aesthetic impacts. Also,\n            the transport of substantial volumes of materials to and\n            from the construction site will cause noise, dust, traffic\n            disruption, and adverse aesthetic impacts. Limiting the work\n            areas to be cleared ahead of construction, and revegetating\n            bank slopes will arrest vegetal removal and the resulting\n            loss of fauna habitat as well as soil erosion. Also,\n            excavated areas below flood water levels will be treated and\n            stone gabions and mattresses used. A traffic management plan\n            including details of lane closures and bridges to be closed,\n            proposed diversions, durations of interruptions, time\n            restrictions on vehicular movements, and construction of\n            footbridges will mitigate traffic disruption. To minimize\n            flooding during channel construction, the contract documents\n            will include restrictions on construction during the rainy\n            season and the use of diversionary works."}, "docdt": "1999-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
