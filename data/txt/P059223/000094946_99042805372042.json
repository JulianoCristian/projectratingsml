The project\n            components include civil works regarding the rehabilitation\n            of the main channel, construction of auxiliary drains, and,\n            the rehabilitation of priority drainage. Consulting services\n            for construction supervision will be financed by the\n            project, as will the required program and policy studies,\n            namely the Kampala Drainage Master Plan Study and the\n            Kampala Urban Transportation Improvement Program Study.\n            Institutional strengthening will support both, the KCC\n            reform program under the strategic framework for reform, and\n            the revenue enhancement program. To facilitate outsourcing\n            of basic delivery functions, seed funds will be available,\n            and training and implementation support will be further provided."}, "docdt": "1999-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
