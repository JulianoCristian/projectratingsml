The lessons\n            learned indicate that institutional change processes are\n            difficult and will encounter resistance. Political will is\n            critical to effect institutional change and must be\n            carefully managed through election turnovers. Institutional\n            change processes cannot be included as a small subcomponent\n            in a 2-3 year project but must be core project objectives or\n            provided in a separate project. Supporting mechanisms to\n            increase accountability and transparency of local\n            governments (e.g. private sector associations, media, NGOs,\n            council committees, communities) are key to ensuring an\n            early warning system and to improving commitment to reform\n            local finances and service delivery, especially through\n            election changes. Maintenance for large investments is tied\n            up with overall financial management (expenditure and\n            revenues) of municipality and cannot be treated as wholly\n            separate. With proper planning, supervision and monitoring,\n            the private sector can provide better quality services more\n            competitively in certain service areas. Basic management\n            techniques and systems are critical inputs to improving\n            performance and accountability and need to be\n            institutionalized early on in project life. Projects of this\n            nature and scale can be properly managed by local\n            consultants with limited support from international consultants."}, "docdt": "2004-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
