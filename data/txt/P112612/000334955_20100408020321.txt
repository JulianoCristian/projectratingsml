                   equitable and transparent compensation system.
                   Consolidation and Control of Public Payroll: reduction in the wage bill from
                   11.8% of GDP in 2005 to 10.4% in 2009.
                   E-Government and Simplification of Procedures: (i) higher productivity resulting
                   from e-government measured by the increased number of public services on line
                   and (ii) greater transparency in public bidding processes.

                   The proposed loan is the second of the second series of programmatic loans
                   designed to support the implementation of the Government's public administration
                   reform support program (PARAP) whose objectives are fully shared. The
                   objectives of the series aim at : (a) improving Government efficiency in the
                   management of budget resources through greater transparency and accountability,
                   and by introducing performance measurement; (b) improving government
Program            efficiency in the management of human resources through the preparation of a new
Development        management system for staffing and remuneration with performance measurement,
Objective(s) and   while streamlining current human resources management; (c) consolidating and
Contribution to    controlling public payroll; and (d) improving public services and simplifying
CPS                procedures through e-government.
                   The proposed loan is complemented and strengthened by an ongoing multiyear
                   Programmatic Economic Sector Work activity through which the Bank is
                   providing the Government with advice, training, and technical assistance as
                   required in the areas of public finance management, civil service reform, and wage
                   bill containment. A new technical assistance activity has just been approved for
                 the e-government component. Other donors supporting this program provide
                 complementary technical assistance.
                 Support to the public administration reform program is a key component of the
                 new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (FY10-FY13). PARL IV contributes to
                 the achievement of the first and second CPS pillars: (i) promoting macro-economic
                 stability and private sector development as an engine of growth and (ii) support to
                 the improvement in access to, and quality of services. In addition the operation is
                 fully aligned with the CPS cross cutting theme of enhancing governance.

                 Challenges remain for the Government to complete its reform efforts. As
                 international experience has shown, public sector and budget reforms are
                 inevitably long and complex processes. It is therefore not surprising that, while
                 Morocco has embarked on this process since 2002 with undeniable
                 accomplishments, there is still an agenda ahead. Consequently the reform
                 process is confronted with potential reform fatigue that might hamper the
                 final consolidation of the efforts made to date particularly with regards to the
                 complexities and political economy issues associated with the future steps
                 necessary to complete the HR reform process. Perhaps more importantly,
                 however, the key challenges ahead rests on the ability of the government to
                 complete the design of and then implement three key components of the PARAP:
                 the budget organic law, civil service reform and public administration de-
                 concentration so as to ensure that the long reform process can finally lead to
                 concrete impacts on the ground. In this regard the need for enhanced inter
                 ministerial coordination will be a key challenge to address. While the Government
                 has maintained its commitment to the PARAP agenda, the Bank will continue to
                 support this process in close coordination with other donors with the appropriate
                 mix of analytical work, technical assistance and operational instruments as
                 appropriate. In the short term, Morocco is confronted with uncertainties on the
                 timing, speed and shape of the recovery process from the global crisis. While
Risks and Risk
                 there are encouraging signs of a possible end to the crisis, it is too early to predict
Mitigation
                 how the global economy will emerge from the recession particularly in the EU, the
                 key international partner for Morocco. Consequently it is not yet clear to what
                 extent Morocco's economy will continue to be confronted with the impact of the
                 economic slowdown on its exports, remittances, ability to attract FDI and
                 sustainability of its public stimulus program. The associated economic risks can
                 be partly mitigated through continued strong macroeconomic management and
                 Morocco's track record suggests that it is well placed to face the uncertainties of
                 the current situation. The Bank will help mitigate this risk through continued
                 monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on the overall macroeconomic
                 context, as well as analysis of options for remedial measures as eventually
                 requested by the Government. In the medium term, Morocco's overall outlook
                 is positive but predicated on the effectiveness of the reforms currently under
                 way. Morocco's growth prospects hinge on the successful implementation of a
                 host of reforms currently under way that would lead to an increased economic
                 competitiveness of the economy both at home and abroad. Should the current
                 reform efforts take longer than anticipated, it is uncertain if the current economic
                 structure can sustain the pre-crisis economic growth performance in the medium
                 term. This potential risk is mitigated by Government's strong commitment to
                 proceed with the envisaged reforms, where the Bank plans support or is already
                 engaged in.

                     PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
 FOURTH PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                  TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO


                                     I.      INTRODUCTION

1.       This Program Document proposes a Fourth Public Administration Reform Development
Policy Loan (PARL IV) to the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of  73.7 million (US$100 million
equivalent). The proposed operation is the second of a series of two programmatic loans first started
with PARL III loan (66 million) approved by the Board in April 2008. This new series continues Bank
support to Morocco's Public Administration Reform Program. A PARL-I loan (82.5 million) was
approved by the Board in July 2004, and a PARL-II loan (98.7 million) was approved in February 2006.
Consistent with the original reform program of the series, the operation has four medium-term objectives:
(a) improve government efficiency in the management of budget resources through greater transparency
and accountability, and by introducing performance measurement; (b) improve government efficiency in
the management of human resources through the preparation of a new management system for staffing
and remuneration with performance measurement, while streamlining current human resources
management; (c) consolidate and control public payroll; and (d) improve public services and simplify
procedures through e-government. This last component was added in the second PARL series following
Government introduction in 2007 of e-governance as a core element of its reform agenda.
2.       Since 2002, the Government has implemented a comprehensive Public Administration
Reform Support Program (PARAP). Public administration reform is viewed as a core component of
improving governance and is central to the economic and social reforms that the Government is carrying
out to improve economic performance and enhance its capacity to achieve sustained growth. The reform
program is aimed at ensuring the viability of the macroeconomic framework by improving the efficiency
of public expenditure and optimally allocating budgetary resources. The key components of the reform
program include: results-oriented budget reform; increased internal and external audit; improved human
resource management; increased quality of public services by introducing localized management;
consolidated public sector payroll management; and, since 2007, simplified administrative procedures
including through the development of e-government.
3.        Following on PARL-I and II, a new series composed of two additional programmatic
operations (PARL III and PARL IV) was designed in 2007-2008 to continue support to the PARAP
agenda. The new series builds on the excellent dialogue with Government, the overall success of
previous operations and the need to consolidate medium-term reforms which are taking longer than
originally anticipated.
4.       The implementation to date of the indicative triggers for PARL IV is satisfactory. The
program document reviews the progress made in the implementation and outlines the lessons learned that
were incorporated in the design of the new series commenced with PARL III.
5.        The World Bank PARL continues to advance in close collaboration with the other
partners. The European Union (EU), the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the World Bank are
jointly collaborating to support Morocco in implementing its PARAP by providing financial and technical
support in a coordinated way and by organizing joint supervision missions.
6.       This operation concludes the second PARL series. Looking forward, a new series is
envisaged to support the next phase of the Government's PARAP agenda. The PARAP agenda will
evolve on several key dimensions that will materialize in the coming months. In line with the objectives
of the new World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with Morocco ­presented at the Board on

January 26, 2010-, the Bank could design a new PARL series to support the next PARAP phase and
continue strengthening the results orientation of the program for enhanced service delivery. In addition a
new series would further reinforce donor harmonization as it would be developed in full coordination
with the next EU and AfDB program which should materialize around the same timeframe and with
similar objectives.

7.        Morocco carried out sound macroeconomic policies and continued to sustain momentum of
structural reforms. As a result, the growth pattern shifted to a higher level averaging 5.1 percent over
2001-08, almost double of the average rate of the 1990s (2.8 percent). The good growth performance
allowed income per capita to almost double over the last decade to reach US$2,850 in 2008.
Furthermore, sound fiscal policies led to the consolidation of public finances, allowing the budget to run
surpluses in 2007 and 2008 (averaging 0.3 percent of GDP). The Government adopted a prudent debt
strategy and central government debt steadily declined to 47.2 percent of GDP in 2008 from 62 percent in
2005. In addition, the Government pursued appropriate monetary policy geared toward maintaining low
and stable inflation (an average 2.5 percent since 2005) and enhanced financial sector supervision.
Furthermore, it sought to deepen its integration into the world economy through the signing of many
FTAs culminating with the recent "Advanced Status" awarded by the UE. Overall, these efforts have led
to a stable macroeconomic stance, stronger public finances, and a sound financial sector. On the basis of
these achievements Morocco gained investment grade rating in 2007 from one rating agency, which
further reinforced the confidence of investors, both domestic and foreign.

higher investment rates geared to dynamic
sectors led to improved diversification and growth potential of the Moroccan economy, and reduced
volatility1. Higher investment also improved the employment situation with the number of jobless
shrinking to 9.6 percent in 2008, down from a high of 14 percent in the late 1990s, although questions
remain over the quality of the jobs currently available to large segments of the population.
9.        Reforms triggered positive changes in the Moroccan economic structure but
manufacturing is losing momentum. The structure of production changed in favor of services with both
primary and secondary sectors' shares in GDP declining over time. The shrinking of the secondary
sector's share is mainly due to manufacturing which has declined over the last two decades, denoting a
weakness of the productive tissue that reduces its productive capacity and hinders its long term growth

   and development. This weakness stems from the slow structural transformation in the manufacturing
   sector, which also explains the modest results of Moroccan exports. The latter continue to be
   concentrated around relatively undiversified, low knowledge, low value-added, traditional products. As a
   consequence, exports do not fully benefit from trade dynamics of Morocco's trade partners and thus have
   been unable to fulfill their potential for contributing to growth and job creation.

A.        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN MOROCCO

10.       In light of the global economic crisis, growth performance in Morocco has been good.
Economic growth in 2008 reached 5.6 percent compared with 6.8 percent expected in the 2008 Budget
Law, but better than the low 2.7 percent of the previous year. This performance is mainly due to a good
agricultural output, which gained 16.3 percent benefiting from favorable rain conditions compared to a
drop of 20.8 percent of the previous drought-stricken year. This shows that agricultural variations due to
weather conditions still affect GDP growth, albeit with less intensity than in the past. The non-
agricultural sector remained robust, but less than projected as the negative impact of the global crisis
started to infiltrate progressively the Moroccan real economy. Growth of non-agricultural output edged
down to 4.2 percent over 2008 compared to 6 percent registered the previous year. This growth
performance was mostly driven by activities of non-traded goods and services that largely depend on
domestic demand.
11.      Data for 2009 show that the economy has suffered only moderately from the effects of the
global economic slowdown that started in late 2008. Growth edged down to 3.7 percent in the first
quarter of 2009 but has rebounded to 5.4 percent in the second quarter and further to 5.6 percent in the
third quarter. Overall, growth is estimated at 5 percent for the whole year. This momentum is mainly due
to a very good harvest, a firming of domestic demand, and, to a lesser extent, slight recovery of external
demand for some manufacture products and tourism.


                                                                    4
12.      The Government has implemented a stimulus package to support the income of the
population and help the most affected sectors (Box 1). The income support package is mostly
benefiting the low income employees. It includes an increase of 10 percent in the wages of civil servants
at the lower end of the salary scale and the Minimum Wage for private sector employees. The wage
revalorization was implemented in two steps, the first increase of 5 percent in July 2008 and the second
one in July 20092. In addition, effective January 2009, the marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent
to 40 percent and will be cut further to 38 percent in January 2010 as envisaged in the draft Budget Law
2010. At the same time, the upper end of the exempt income bracket was extended. Direct support
measures for affected firms included financial relief (guarantees on loans; rescheduling of debt; help with
export insurance) as well as subsidies for training and marketing. Economic stimulus was also provided
through some monetary easing. The total budgetary gross cost of the stimulus package has been
estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP (over the 2008-2010 period), and as such does not pose a risk to the
medium term sustainability of public finances.

                                        Box 1. Fiscal Stimulus Packages and Outcomes
    The Government has implemented several measures to help affected firms cope with the decline of external
    demand. Early in 2009, the government set up a high level Council for Strategic Monitoring (CSM), comprising
    concerned ministers as well as representatives of the business community and banking sector, to follow
    developments related to the ongoing global crisis. The CSM targeted the export sector for support through the
    following measures that would expire at the end of 2010 (and amount to a budgetary cost of 0.2% of GDP):
            Provide guarantees for up to 65 percent for working capital loans;
            Finance up to 80 percent of costs of promotion campaigns and market surveys;
            Extend insurance risk coverage for exports;
            Facilitate rescheduling the repayment of long term debt;
            Ease regulations affecting imports covered by the temporary admission scheme;
            Provide training and logistics in partnership with business associations; and
            Public contribution to the payment of social insurance by employers in eligible cases (applying to firms
              that have had a 20 percent loss but continue to retain employees).
    Subsequently specific support programs have been designed for tourism and remittances and investment of
    Moroccan workers residing abroad.
    Data as of mid-December 2009 show that 59 percent of the demand for support concerned social insurance relief
    and was requested by 421 firms, of which 379 firms operating in the textiles sector and 34 in automotive
    equipment. At the same time, 115 firms benefited from loan guarantees (of which 107 are textiles firms), and 134
    firms benefited from training, of which 111 firms from the textiles sector and 20 from automotive equipment.
    Measures to help low income households were already started in 2008 and included in the 2009 and 2010 Budget
    Laws. For the most part, they consisted of tax relief and wage increases for selected groups as well as an increase
    in social expenditures by relevant government departments. These measures, along with a much higher public
    investment program in place for 2009 and confirmed for 2010, kept domestic demand high as reflected in the
    rising credit to consumption, equipment and real estate (see below). Specific measures included the following:
          The marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent to 38 percent, and the upper limit of the tax-exempt
           bracket was increased by 25 percent;
          Salaries of civil servants at the lower end of the pay scale were increased by 10 percent (5 percent in July
           2008 and 5 percent in July 2009);
          For private sector employees, the minimum wage was raised by 10 percent (5 percent in July 2008 and 5
           percent in July 2009);
          Minimum pension payments were increased by 20 percent and family allowances by 33 percent.
    Economic stimulus was also provided through monetary easing. Reserve requirements for banks were cut in steps
    from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 2009 and then to 8 percent in October 2009. The Central Bank also cut its
    policy rate by 25 basis-points in March 2009 translating into a policy rate of 3.25 percent.

13.        Public finances continue to be well managed globally despite the impact of the global crisis
on the budget. The steady reform efforts of expenditure and tax management and sound debt
management over the last few years have been critical in maintaining public finances on a sustainable
path. These reforms translated into better control of the government's consumption, enhanced tax
collection, and declining public debt. In this context, Public Finances were in slight surplus in 2007 (0.2
percent of GDP) and in 2008 (0.4 percent of GDP)3, which is outstanding given the impact of high
subsidies4 because of the food and fuel crisis. Recent data on budget executions show that the budget
deficit has been limited to around 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009 despite falling revenues impacted by the
global crisis and the introduction of the stimulus package to respond to the crisis. This outcome is mainly
explained by large savings on subsidies­ which have plummet by 59.3 percent ­ and controlled
government expenditures, including the wage bill in spite of wage revalorization. Nevertheless, subsidies
still represent a heavy burden on the budget and thus constitute a potential risk factor for its sustainability
in case of exogenous shocks such as higher world prices of fuels and food and severe drought. The
launch of a medium term scheme to reform the subsidy system through better targeted social programs
would gradually mitigate this risk.
14.      Steady implementation of the PARAP resulted in subdued recurrent expenditures,
including a continued decline in the wage bill relative to GDP. The main measure to control the wage
bill consisted of the successful voluntary early retirement program (ERP) started in 2005 and subsequent
measures to limit hiring to the actual needs, mostly targeted to the education and health sectors. Although
the size of the central government personnel has now reached its pre-reform level, its skills mix, its
geographic and sector coverage, and its age structure improved significantly, thus leading over time to
improved efficiency. Without the ERP, these achievements would not have been possible. The combined
effect of these measures translated into a declining wage bill, which, in 2008 edged down to 10.2 percent
of GDP compared to 10.7 percent the previous year (and 11.7 percent in 2005). In 2009, it would
virtually stay at the same level as in 2008 (10.3 percent of GDP), despite wage revalorization for low-
income civil servants as part of the fiscal stimulus package to alleviate the effects of the global crisis.
15.     The sound fiscal management contributed to further reduce the central government's debt.
Reflecting the good performance of public finances and sound active debt management, the debt stock of
the central government declined to 47.2 percent of GDP in 2008, down by more than 6.3 percentage
points relative to 2007. Most of the decline is explained by the important drop in domestic debt, which
fell by 5.5 percentage points to reach 37.3 percent of GDP, while foreign debt was reduced by 0.8
percentage points to 9.9 percent of GDP.
16.     The government and the central bank showed continued commitment to fight inflation.
Domestic inflation stood at 3.7 percent in 2008 as compared to 2 percent registered in 2007. The rapid
acceleration of prices of food in 2008 ­ which account for almost 42 percent of household consumption ­
explains most of the inflation that year, whereas non-food prices moved relatively slowly thanks to partial
pass-through of the high imported fuels prices. In effect, food inflation reached an average of 7.1 percent
over 2008, an unprecedented rate since 1995. However, helped by declining world prices and ample
domestic food supply, inflation subsequently declined to only 1 percent in 2009.
17.      The external position remains solid despite the sudden deterioration of the current account
due to the impact of the global crisis. For the first time since the 1980s, the current account ran large
deficits in 2008 (5.2 percent of GDP) and over the first three quarters of 2009 (5 percent of GDP). This
follows comfortable surpluses over the period 2001-06 (average surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP) and a
quasi-balance in 2007 (a deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP). The worsening of the current account is
principally explained by the impact of the global crisis on workers' remittances and tourism receipts that
before had been compensating for the rising trade deficits. Consequently, net foreign reserves declined

by US$ 2.69 billion (or down 10 percent) at end 2008 to edge down to US$ 24.3 billion, representing 6.6
months of imports, down from 8.8 months in 2007. However, the decline significantly slowed down in
2009 as net foreign reserves amounted to US$ 24.1 billion at the end of the year. Owing to declining
imports, net reserves improved to a comfortable level of 7.4 months of imports of goods and non-factor
services.
18.     The on-going global crisis revealed once again the weaknesses embodied in the Moroccan
trade structure. The trade deficit deteriorated to 24.7 percent of GDP in 2008, up from 22.3 percent of
GDP in 2007 (and only 11 percent in 2000). It improved in 2009 as imports declined by more than
exports in nominal terms; but it is still high (20.8 percent of GDP). The high trade deficit is mainly a
volume effect rather than a price effect because Morocco actually benefited from positive terms of trade;
while the price of oil and food imports increased, so did the price of key Moroccan exports such as
phosphate products and agri-food. The bad performance of exports reflects their low diversification and
lack of competitiveness. This explains largely why Moroccan exports were not able to benefit fully from
the many FTAs it signed over the last decade such as those with the EU, the USA, and Turkey.

19.     Monetary and exchange rate policies remained appropriate. In 2008, the central bank (BAM)
resorted to raising the cost of money (plus 25 basis points in September 2008) to contain soaring credit
and inflation, while it relaxed its policy to enhance liquidity in the face of the global crisis. As liquidity
tightened and inflationary pressures started to ease over the second half of 2008 through 2009, BAM
relaxed gradually the money reserve rate reducing it from 15 to 12 percent January 2009, and then to 10
percent July 2009. Recently, BAM decided to further cut the money reserve rate to 8 percent in October
2009 to ease the pressure on liquidity. It has also cut its policy rate by 25 basis points in March 2009 to
reach 3.25 percent. Despite these relaxed policies, money supply slowed to 5.6 percent by end 2009,
compared to 10.8 percent in 2008. Although credit to equipment soared at 29 percent, total credit to the
private sector slowed down driven by reduced growth in credit to consumption (up 18.8 percent), and
construction (up 12.8 percent), and declining credit for businesses' cash flow (down 1 percent). At the
same time, the stock of non-performing loans slightly declined by 0.6 percent. In recent years the
exchange rate remained in line with macroeconomic fundamentals with no signs of misalignment.

B.        MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

20.      Sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, as well as efforts to improve sector productivity
and competitiveness, put Morocco in a better position to maneuver with less damage through the
moderate effects of the global crisis, while being in a position to benefit from the recovery of the world
economy (Table 2). The decision of the government to continue its reform efforts and revamp its sector
strategies along the targeted and short term sector fiscal stimulus should allow the Moroccan economy to
expect good prospects over the medium term. Meanwhile, economic growth is estimated to be around 5
percent in 2009 mostly owing to the outstanding agricultural output and a moderate contribution from the
dynamic non-agricultural activities such as construction, finance services, telecommunication, and
tourism.

21.      Growth prospects in the medium term are good. It is assumed that the government will
sustain the reform momentum of the last few years, achieve the ambitious public investment programs it
devised, and continue to implement the main sector strategies it launched, thus consolidating further
economic diversification, growth potential, and domestic demand, and it is also assumed that the world
economy will slowly recover from the current crisis to allow the on-going export promotion strategies to
achieve their targets and contribute to growth. Under these conditions, growth rates will improve from
the low 3 percent projected for 20105 to around 5.2 percent in 2013. Should the underlying sources of
growth assumed above be slow to materialize, growth prospects would have to be adjusted downward.
Moreover, there is a potential risk that even pre-crisis growth levels might not be sustainable over the
medium term if internal demand remains the key driver of growth.
22.       Sound macroeconomic policies would help contain inflation at low levels. Inflation edged
down to 1 percent only in 2009, mainly driven by declining prices of imported food items, and should
remain subdued at around 2 percent thereafter. As Morocco is mainly an exporter of food items, its
inflation rate is only slightly impacted by international food price fluctuations. In addition, subsidies for
key food and energy prices ­ while clearly having an impact on the budget ­ contribute to a stable
inflation rate.
23.     After a temporary higher deficit in 2010, the fiscal stance should remain sound over the
medium term, with fiscal deficits under the targeted threshold of 3 percent of GDP, benefiting from the
ongoing fiscal reform and more targeted social programs, as well as a better-controlled wage bill. The
budget deficit is expected to edge up to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010 before gradually dropping to around

 The low growth in 2010 is mainly explained by normal agricultural output translating into a negative growth rate
for agriculture after an outstanding growth in 2009.

2.3 percent by 2013. Reaching this outcome implies maintaining momentum of the ongoing tax reform to
broaden the tax base, improve the efficiency of the VAT, strengthen tax administration, and remove
unproductive tax exemptions in order to reduce the high tax expenditures. These measures would offset
the negative impact of the reduced top rates on corporate and personal income taxes. Under these
assumptions, revenues are projected to stabilize at around 25 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side,
the consolidation of public finances relies on four critical measures: deepening of fiscal reform,
achievement of oil and food subsidies reform, continued tight control of the wage bill evolution, and an
active debt management. Under these conditions, public debt will slightly increase in 2010 to 48.4
percent of GDP before following a downward trend to decline to less than 45 percent of GDP in 2013.

24.      The financing needs stemming from the higher budget deficit in 2010 and declining deficits
over the medium term are easily financed through domestic market as well as from increased
drawings on external loans (Table 3). In this context, domestic financing would remain the main
source, although external financing would improve its contribution. Indeed, since 2006, net external
financing reversed its long negative trend to turn positive, reflecting the government's strategy to slightly
change the debt composition in favor of external borrowing. This financing strategy would ease the
pressure on domestic financial markets and prevent any crowding out of the private sector's investment
now that the money market is less liquid than over the last years. At the same time it is consistent with
the intention to maintain a comfortable level of foreign reserves.
25.     The Government's debt strategy is to diversify financing sources and take on a greater
proportion of external financing. Three main factors underpin the decision of the government to
reinforce its external sources, especially multilateral and concessional. The first is linked to Morocco's
public debt maturity structure. The maturity of public debt has fallen in recent years and will fall further
given that the central government mostly financed its needs through issuing T-bills of up to 1 year in the
domestic market. The main reason behind this choice is to avoid affecting long-term floating rates for
Banks' domestic lending to the private sector, especially housing credit, as they are indexed to primary
market rates on long-term securities (10 and 15 year bonds). The second relates to the higher balance of
payments needs although the level of foreign reserves remains relatively comfortable. The third is due to
the current higher borrowing requirements of the Budget, in a context of tightening liquidity of the
domestic financial markets after a long period of an over-liquid money market. Consequently, additional
external lending is consistent with prudent debt management which fosters improved terms of debt, while
maintaining a comfortable level of foreign reserves and at the same time avoids pressure on domestic
financial markets.
26.     A comprehensive public debt sustainability analysis shows that the fiscal framework is
robust to downside risk in the medium term (see Annex 7.3). Public debt under the two main shocks




                                                        9
proved sustainable over the medium term6. Under alternative scenarios, six other shocks to the baseline
scenario are simulated7, and public debt sustainability is preserved in all of them. Under these shocks,
public debt would slightly increase in 2010 and, for a few shocks, in 2011 as well, before steadily
declining over the medium term.
27.      The external position is expected to remain sustainable over the medium term. The current
account is expected to slightly deteriorate in 2009 (5.6 percent of GDP) before following a slight
downward trend over the medium term to edge down to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2013, as the impact of
reforms and sector strategies take hold. Indeed, the balance of payments is expected to progressively
improve, with lower trade and current account deficits, which would benefit from improved export
potentials and a recovery of tourism activities and workers' remittances. This scenario assumes that
Morocco would reap the fruits of its continued reform efforts, its sound macroeconomic and fiscal
policies, and targeted sector strategies that entail higher public investments, which would translate into
higher private investments, including FDI, and progressive gains in competitiveness of its exports,
including tourism. In this context, external debt is expected to follow an inverted U path edging up to
25.7 percent of GDP in 2010 from 24.7 percent of GDP in 2009 before steadily dropping to 23.4 percent
by 2013 while net foreign reserves will stay at an average of 6.0 months of imports.
28.     Balance of payments financing requirements don't constitute a serious concern given the
sound economic fundamentals, the country's low external debt stock, and the ample foreign
reserves (see Annex 7). As the current account deficits are projected to steadily improve in the medium
term, there are no constraints on financing them through multilateral and bilateral credit lines along other
private capital flows, including FDI. The latter is expected to gradually improve, attracted by an
improved business environment and the opportunities offered by important structural projects and the
devised privatization program of the country.
29.      In sum, Morocco's macroeconomic framework remains adequate and sustainable in the
medium term. The moderate effects of the global crisis on the Moroccan economy have been muted by
the good economic fundamentals resulting from sound macroeconomic policies carried out over the last
years and by the response of the government through the stimulus package to mitigate these effects on the
population and businesses alike. The stimulus package has allowed supporting investors' confidence and
domestic demand while reducing risks. The government's commitment to maintain momentum of reform
effort supports robust prospects of investment, growth, and employment.

    III.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

30.       In his first speech to the Parliament, when he took office in October 2007, new Prime
Minister Abbas El Fassi presented the guiding directives of his Social and Economic Program
(SEP)8. The SEP seeks continuity of reforms, while accelerating and deepening their content. It seeks to
improve economic productivity, efficiency, and human capital indicators with a view to enhancing
Morocco's growth potential. To this end, the SEP aims at completing reforms launched by the previous
government, while starting new ones on tax reform; modernization of agriculture; social protection to
rationalize and better target the subsidy program; judicial reform and de-concentration supporting nascent
regionalization.
31.      The SEP proposes to strengthen previous achievements under the ongoing public
administration reform agenda, which has been implemented since 2002. Public administration
reform is viewed as a core component of improving governance and central to the economic and social

  The two main shocks are A1: Key variables are at their historical averages; and A2: No policy change (constant primary
balance).

  See annex 7.3 for their description.

  For a full description of the overall reform program of the current Government please see the discussion in the CPS report
(Report No. 50316-MA).

                                                               10
reforms that the Government intends to carry out to improve economic performance and enhance its
capacity to achieve sustained growth. Moreover, the reform is aimed at ensuring the viability of the
macroeconomic framework by improving the efficiency of public expenditure and optimally allocating
budgetary resources.
32.       The key strategic axes of the reform program are:
        Developing a modern administration that is able to contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of
        the national economy and the sustainable development of the country while promoting investment
        through the new sector strategies and ensuring the medium-term viability of the macroeconomic
        framework;
        Develop a new results-oriented Budget system which includes public policy evaluation
        mechanisms;
        Renewed efforts to improve public sector governance through enhanced internal and external
        audits, more transparent budget reporting and simplified procedures;
        Improve Human Resource management by: simplifying civil service employment regulations;
        adopting an efficient and transparent remuneration system and introducing promotion
        mechanisms based on merit, competency and probity;
        Improving the quality of public services by introducing localized management, further pursuing
        the de-concentration process as advances are made in the area of decentralization, controlling
        payroll costs, and adopting performance contracts between the central administration and de-
        concentrated entities;
        Simplifying administrative procedures through the development of e-government so as to
        improve public services and ensure the integrity and transparency of relations between the
        administration and users.
33.       Since the beginning of the reform process in 2002 the PARAP has been the topic of
numerous public debates, seminars and conferences which have received ample media coverage
and have contributed to shape the Government agenda. For its part the Bank has not only participated
in this process as appropriate but has also collected many insights and suggestions from civil society on
the topics considered for this operation through consultations in the context of the preparation of the
previous CAS and CPS. More recently, the consultation process followed in the preparation of the CPS,
highlighted once again several areas relevant for this operation9. Overall, the theme of improved
governance has emerged as a necessary entry point to improve the efficiency and transparency of public
action particularly for enhanced service delivery. In particular, strengthening mechanisms of
accountability and transparency in public administration at all levels has been a recurrent theme consistent
with the outcomes of the 2005 CAS consultation process. The recent CPS consultations have
reconfirmed the adequacy of the strategic objectives of this operation and provided additional valuable
entry points to continue to support the PARAP agenda in the medium term.

                IV.       BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A.       LINKS TO THE CPS

34.      The Bank's support to the implementation of the PARAP is detailed in the FY10-13 CPS
by the Board in January 2010 (Report No. 50316-MA). The new CPS builds on the successful
experience of Bank support to the PARAP and retains public administration reform as a cornerstone of

Board on January 2010.

                                                             11
the Bank partnership strategy with Morocco. The CPS is designed to help achieve Government objectives
in a flexible and responsive way and is organized around three main pillars: the first concentrates on
activities that will help enhance growth, competitiveness and employment. This objective will entail
efforts to foster macro-economic stability and promoting private sector development as engine of growth.
The second pillar supports the improvement in access to, and quality of services. This will involve
treating the institutional aspects of public services through appropriate public management measures with
a view to reinforcing both the diagnostics (targeting) and accountability elements of service delivery. The
third pillar aims at ensuring that Morocco can develop sustainably and address natural resources and
climate change challenges. It reflects the Government's intention to enhance awareness of Morocco's
exposure to climate change impacts while at the same time start stepping up coordination across
departments and agencies for adaptation. In addition, the CPS places a strong emphasis on the
governance agenda which will be mainstreamed across the envisioned program.
35.      The new PARL series, which was initiated by PARL III in 2008, is fully consistent with the
CPS. The lending program envisaged in the CPS encompasses the proposed PARL IV operation which
concludes the series and envisions continued engagement through the possible design of a new series
during the CPS timeframe in line with available financing and consistent with the experience in the
implementation of the first PARL series, described in detail below. The current PARL series continues to
focus on selected issues critical for the improvement in public sector performance in delivering efficient
and effective services to business and citizens and for enhanced macroeconomic stability. It is thus in line
with the first and second pillar of the new CPS while directly contributing to the cross cutting theme of
improving governance.

B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

36.      The World Bank and the IMF maintain close collaboration in Morocco. Regular contacts
between the IMF and World Bank country teams are customary, with discussions focused on the
respective work programs, country priorities, recent developments and prospects. Collaboration between
the Fund and the Bank in Morocco has been seamless, with a shared assessment of the critical
macroeconomic challenges facing the country. Overall there is broad agreement on the division of labor
between the two organizations. The collaboration may also take the form of joint activities such as the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update dissemination and follow-up of its
recommendations.
37.      The Fund regularly participates in Bank project review meetings where relevant.
Similarly, Bank staff contributed to the IMF's 2008 and 2009 Article IV consultation mission to
Morocco. The ongoing analytical work being carried out by the Fund team, which was welcomed by
Bank counterparts, focuses on the medium-term outlook for public finances in Morocco and the
macroeconomic implications of the global financial crisis and economic downturn. The IMF Board has
endorsed on January 25, 2010 the Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation. The overall
assessment of the recent macroeconomic developments, outlook and risks to the economy is well aligned
between the World Bank and the IMF.
38.      Collaboration with the EU and the AfDB is an integral component of the support of the
Public Administration reform agenda. At the request of the Government, this fourth operation is
again being prepared jointly with the EU and AfDB. Donor coordination plays a major role in
program success, and the Bank will continue to ensure that all efforts are made to preserve this unified
dialogue. The World Bank's lending operation, the EU Structural Adjustment Grants, and AfDB support
are based on the same programmatic framework. This has benefited the client by building credibility for
the reforms, but also by focusing the attention and expertise from multilateral donors on a complex
program of reform. It has also helped donors efficiently manage the supervisory activities and technical
assistance programs associated with the reform agenda.


                                                    12
C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

39.       The PARL series benefits from the companion programmatic analytical series, P-ESW,
designed by the Bank to support the development and implementation of the Government public
administration reform agenda with analytical products, policy advice, training and technical
assistance. Since 2003, the P-ESW program for public administration reform is the main analytical
support of the Government's PARAP and designed in full alignment with the PARL series. Every year
the program to be supported by the P-ESW is formally agreed with Government following an assessment
of the activities in need of support over the coming twelve months.
40.     The recently launched TA for e-governance is also directly associated with the PARL
reform program. As detailed later in this document, the e-governance agenda requires dedicated
technical assistance to support the authorities in the final operationalization of the agenda. Moreover,
following the elaboration of a large and ambitious Government plan for the implementation of 89 e-
governance activities, technical assistance will support their implementation with a view to promote faster
and efficient availability of key e-services for citizens and business alike.
41.     The operations in support of the health and education sector, under preparation, draw on
and complement the reform agenda supported by the PARL series. The Bank is currently preparing a
DPL to support Government reforms in education, scheduled for Board presentation in FY10 and an
operation in Health, expected to be presented for Board approval in FY11. Both operations benefit from
and expand on each of the components supported by the PARL as they devote attention to the governance
agenda in relation to improved budget and HR management and mainstreaming on-line sector
applications. Other World Bank operations also aim at strengthening the institutional framework and
enhance service delivery such as the Solid Waste Management DPL, the Financial sector DPL and
multiple operations in the water sector.

D.      LESSONS LEARNED

42.     The lessons learned that inform this operation reflect largely the analysis from the following
reports: the 2007 Quality at entry (QAE) assessment for PARL II, the 2009 ICR for the first PARL series
(PARL I & II) ­ ICR Report No: 0000969, and the recently completed CAS completion report -2009.
43.     The programmatic adjustment loan is considered to be the appropriate instrument for
supporting public sector reforms in Morocco as the country is proceeding step by step in a medium
term program. Using successive single tranche adjustment loans is an effective way to assist structural
reform, provided it is linked to an agreed medium-term reform program with broadly defined milestones
and transparent triggers per subsequent operation.
44.     Continuing to support the program through the P-ESW is important and should continue to
be adjusted on a rolling basis and be flexible to short-term demands. The Bank's AAA and ESW
program have played a key part in helping Morocco prepare and internalize the necessary reforms.
Technical assistance, short policy notes or convening roundtables or workshops are all valuable forms of
assistance as long as they are tailored appropriately to new demands.
45.     Partnership with the client and donor coordination have played a major role in program
success and the Bank will continue to preserve a unified dialogue. The shift from assistance to
partnership with the Moroccan Government introduced with the 2005-2009 CAS informed as well the
conceptual framework of the PARL series and allowed for greater flexibility and adaptation of the
program to client needs. Moreover, the Bank's lending operation, the EU structural adjustment grants,
and the AfDB's lending support to the Moroccan Government are based on the same programmatic
framework. This has benefited the client by building credibility for the reforms, but also by allowing for
a harmonized technical assistance from multilateral donors in support to a complex program of reform.


                                                    13
46.     Ensuring ownership at the highest levels of government as well as at the technical levels is
essential for increasing commitment to the project development objectives and facilitating
implementation. The government has shown strong commitment to the PARAP agenda which has
developed over the years with clear leadership and continued engagement. However additional efforts are
necessary particularly in the two areas that are progressing slowly: de-concentration and some of the
components of HR reform. Furthermore, reforms requiring inter-ministerial coordination have moved
slowly; thus attention needs to be placed, and the Government is aware of it, on how to strengthen
coordination.
47.       Key tools for implementing results-based management at the de-concentrated level ­ e.g.
performance contracts ­ need further rationalization in their implementation. The legal and
administrative constraints causing uncertainty on this front should be addressed in a clear and
participatory way in order to better capture the advantages of the public expenditure reform. As detailed
later in the document, the second PARL series starts to address this issue by fostering the implementation
of performance contracts in key ministries.

E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

48.      The P-ESW program for public administration reform has produced a host of analytical
products and technical assistance to support the Government's PARAP agenda in complementarity
with the PARL series. The P-ESW pre-existed the PARL series, however while initially it was not
meant to help government meet specific prior actions, it has progressively often directly helped meet
these targets in due time. It is a broad technical and policy assistance instrument, providing diagnosis,
methodology and management tools. Although Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) have been prepared
since 2006, the proposed and agreed activities have often been changed in the course of the period, some
activities under the PARAP requesting assistance sooner than expected, or having been planned too early.
P-ESW management has therefore always been based on pragmatism and flexibility, due to a strong client
ownership. P-ESW activities of direct relevance to this operation so far have included, inter alia: a
strategy paper on change management; a workshop on performance budgeting; a handbook on
formulation of the MTEF and its integration into the budgeting process; a handbook on performance
monitoring; a handbook on de-concentration (administrative decentralization), delivered in December,
2006; a study on the wage bill assessing modelling capacity, delivered in 2007; a handbook on Jobs and
Skills Management Planning, GPEEC, delivered in 2008 and the support to the modernization of public
procurement (under the e-Government agenda) where the first phase was concluded in 2009.
49.      In addition to the P-ESW, an extensive program of analytical and advisory activities
underpins the Bank's policy dialogue and PARL programmatic lending (see table 4 for a
summary). Over time a large body of analytical work and technical assistance has been developed in
Morocco. In recent years key analytical products have addressed broad economic and social issues that
inform as well the objectives and design of the PARL series. These include the Public investment
Review, Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and the
programmatic analytical work program on poverty analysis which has been developed since 2004. Key
analytical activities that have had a more immediate impact on the PARL series include: the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) first carried out in 2003 and then updated in 2007; The
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) of 2008; the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) analysis completed in 2009 and summarized below. A joint Moroccan-French
symposium on financial system controls was organized by the World Bank in December 2009 while the
Government has just completed an e-training course on budget performance through the Governance
Institutes Forum for Training in the Middle East and North Africa (GIFT-MENA) network.
50.     Looking forward, additional analytical work is envisioned to further support the PARAP
agenda. The P-ESW agenda for the coming years will focus on (i) further developing performance
contracts in line ministries and (ii) performance budgeting training within all ministries. Other relevant

analytical work include a PER in health and education about to start; there are also indicative plans to
further assess the financial and institutional constraints for improved service delivery through the
implementation of Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) and Quality of Service Delivery Survey
(QSDS) in the same sectors.

51.     Alongside operational support, donor coordination has been developed also for the
analytical agenda supporting the PARAP program, thus allowing for cross-fertilization from work
developed by other agencies. Analytical products, reports, and mission evaluations are shared on a
regular basis among donors. In certain areas the Bank relies almost exclusively on the leadership taken
by partners. For example, the EU has taken the lead in providing technical assistance for the reform of
the Organic Budget Law (OBL). The activity assists a working group, composed of civil servants from
the Budget Directorate of the Ministry of Finance, in carrying out the preparatory work to the reform of
Morocco OBL. The working group has proposed a new budgetary nomenclature and will successively
address the main issues that should structure the new framework law, namely, performance, transparency,
and accountability. The activity once concluded would lead to the production of guidance for drafting the
OBL. The proposal will be subject to an inter-ministerial consultation before being presented to the
parliament. The working group has, at this stage, produced the reports on the new nomenclature and on
the impact of performance budgeting ("Programmation pluriannuelle et gestion axée sur les résultats")
on the future OBL. It is expected that the draft OBL will be presented to Parliament by end 2010 In
addition, between 2003 and 2010 the EU has supported measures to strengthen institutional capacities in
17 ministries and public institutions in the context of the implementation process of the European

Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan concluded in 2004, focussing on know-how transfer or administrative
twinning in the areas defined in the Action Plan.
52.      The Government has also independently developed analytical work to underpin the reform
agenda. Key analytical activities autonomously initiated by the authorities to support reform components
include: (i) a performance audit manual (ii) a comprehensive study of ex-ante controls (iii) the
development of REC for each Ministry by the MMSP and the HR Directors (HRD), (iv) the development
of an in-service training policy, with guides and seminars for the HRDs and (v) the development of a new
job classification.

           V.        THE PROPOSED FOURTH PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM
                               DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

A.          OPERATION DESCRIPTION

53.       The proposed loan will continue support to the multiyear Government's PARAP
summarized above and in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 5). The goal of the PARAP
supported by this PARL series is to improve the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of the public
administration. To this end PARL-IV retains the overall objectives of the series as follows: (a) improve
efficiency in government budget management; (b) improve efficiency in government Human Resources
Management; (c) continue to consolidate the management and the control the public payroll; and (d)
improve public services and simplify procedures through e-government. The specific objectives under
each component are described in detail in the section below devoted to the description of each key
activity.
54.     The support of the PARLs to the implementation of the PARAP has gone through several
related stages. The first phase of the government program emphasized its overall design and internal
consistency, while implementing critical prior actions. The second phase of the government program
introduced new management tools, sometimes on a pilot basis, while containing the share of the wage bill
in GDP. The second series PARL-III-IV sets the stage for consolidating the pilot cases, while introducing
new elements of reform.
55.      Building on PARL I-III, the proposed fourth operation is justified by the need to preserve
momentum for consolidating medium-term reforms, while supporting nascent areas of interest for
the Authorities such as e-government and its associated simplification of procedures. In Morocco,
like in other countries, reforming the public administration is a long and complex process with results on
the ground that materialize only progressively. The Government recognizes that multi-donor support and
scrutiny through analytical and lending instruments has been very useful in strengthening the reform
process. As discussed below, progress in implementing the reform program has been broadly on track.
Some actions of the reform have experienced some delays, but all major elements of the program are well
under way. Progress in implementation of the e-government component, added only recently to the
reform agenda (PARL III), is also broadly on track.
B.          ACHIEVEMENTS
56.      Over the years progress in implementation of the PARAP agenda supported by the PARL
series has led to tangible results on several policy areas. The main quantitative and qualitative results
achieved over the years (outputs and outcomes) directly or indirectly related to the PARAP are
summarized in Table 510. The budget reform actions taken in the context of the PARAP contributed to
the improvement of budget management parameters, especially execution rates of the economic and
social investment projects, which increased from 64 percent in 2002 to more than 73.5 percent in 2008.

                      for the 2000 budget to 24 months for the 2006 budget.

B. Efficiency in government Human Resources Management
                       Strategic Staffing Frameworks (RECs) have been completed in 25 Ministries, representing

reform                 New HRM methods are in place in one third of Ministries based on RECs and are being

                       Staff performance evaluation procedures have been changed and mainstreamed since 2006.
                       New promotion rules have been adopted and the delays in regularization of administrative
                      status of staff have been reduced significantly.
C. Consolidate and control the public payroll
                      The wage bill has decreased from 11.2 percent of GDP in 2003 (and 11.7 percent in 2005)

                     also allowed improving geographic coverage in education and health sectors.

Another important achievement of the PARP has to do with the timely preparation and submission to the
Parliament of the Annual Budget Execution Reports (ABER). Preparation delays have been significantly
reduced during the last few years, when the government has made significant effort to adopt and submit
all overdue ABERs (those of 2003-2006) to the Parliament end 2008. During 2009, the government also
adopted and submitted the ABERs of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008. In addition, the PARP has led to
improved structure of the budget as more resources have been channeled to investment. The share of
investment in total expenditures increased from 17 percent in 2002 to 19 percent in 2008. The
improvement in the structure of expenditures has been achieved through reducing the shares of recurrent
expenditures (from 65 percent to 56 percent), including of the wage bill (from 50 percent to 44 percent).
Regarding HRM actions, the PARP strategy has been to streamline civil service and improve service
delivery in the social sectors. The voluntary retirement program implemented in 2005 allowed the
government to restructure civil service in favor of the social sectors, through targeted recruitments to fill

                                                      17
the gaps in needed skills and in understaffed areas and sectors, especially in education and health. Data
for 2008 show that 89 percent of recruited civil servants (not counting security and military) joined the
education and health sectors (69 percent in education and 20 percent in health). The PARP sought to
enhance the skills of civil servants also through training. In this regard, credit earmarked to training has
been raised by 60 percent since 2002 (from Mad 111 million to MAD 176 million).
57.       The recent diagnostic completed in 2009 under the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Framework (PEFA) allows for a detailed appreciation of progress and achievements in
the performance of the Moroccan public financial management system, procedures, and related
institutions. The purpose of using the PEFA tool was to measure Morocco's performance during the 2005-
2007 period against international standards in five Public Financial Management (PFM) areas: budget
credibility, budget comprehensiveness and transparency, predictability and control in budget execution,
accounting recording and reporting, external scrutiny and audit, and also, donor practices regarding the
predictability of international aid funds and use of national procurement procedures to manage them.
Morocco is the second country in the MENA region after Jordan which used the PEFA as a tool
facilitating harmonization of the dialogue between Government and donors around a common framework
measuring PFM performance and therefore contributing to reduce transaction costs. The PEFA
diagnostic was developed with the joint support of the World Bank and the EU.
58.      PEFA findings provide an overall positive assessment of the PFM system in Morocco. The
result of the analysis contributes to the Government's reform process by determining the extent to which
reforms are yielding improved performance. The results indicate that Morocco has an overall credible,
comprehensive, and transparent budget.
59.       Substantial progress has been made in the regulation, administration, and management of
taxes and customs duties. Fiscal obligations have been clearly codified and explained. However there is
still a need to strengthen computer capability in the tax offices and at customs, and to update hardware in
order to facilitate monitoring and control. Predictability of budget execution is satisfactory and
arrangements for monitoring flow of funds are ensured. Control and audit were found to be good overall
for procurement and payroll. Significant improvements were realized during the period reviewed in the
implementation, frequency, and methods for internal audit. Complete, good quality budget execution
reports are regularly produced; however while reduced in 2008, delays remain in the preparation of
annual financial statements and accounting data categories for recording State assets and liabilities are
still absent from the Chart of Accounts. The General Auditor's Office (Cour des Comptes) is fully
engaged in its role as external auditor of the management and use of public funds. The frequency and
scope of its audits are steadily increasing, follow-up of its recommendations still needs improvement.
60.      There are nevertheless areas which require dedicated attention. These include: (i)
improvement of the budget classification, since despite the level of detail, accuracy, and reliability, it
does not yet allow for reliable direct tracking of program-related spending items that are funded
under priority programs; (ii) progress in systematic recording of procurement complaints and follow-up of
their resolution since they are not common practice as complaints in the form of formal appeals are seldom
made; (iii) strengthen internal audits as current practice leads to scattered or even unavailable information,
such as the reports of the Inspector General (IGF) and the ministerial inspectors general (IGM); and (iv)
improvement of the external audit as the Court of Accounts' external audit reports are submitted for review
with noticeable delays. Furthermore as of 2007 none of the Court's observations in its activity or audit reports
seems to have led to any investigative hearings (auditions approfondies) before Parliament to question the
ministers or administrators concerned.
61.     The expected outcomes of the second programmatic PARL series are broadly on track to be
achieved. Overall progress to date in achieving the overall outcomes of the series is satisfactory. In the
section below, where each program component is described, specific details are provided for each key
objective.

C.        REFORM STATUS AND PENDING ACTIONS

62.      Progress to date in the indicative triggers and actions for PARL IV, agreed at the beginning
of the series (PARL III), is satisfactory. Table 6 provides an overview of each of the 10 indicative
triggers envisaged at the beginning of the second PARL series. Progress to date is satisfactory as eight of
them have been fully met or will be met prior to appraisal. Substantial progress has also taken place in
the remaining two but they have only been partially met. Triggers have been reworded to improve clarity
and specificity and to fully align them with the text of the legal agreement without changing the original
spirit of the activity. Annex 2 provides a detailed review of the status of implementation of all the actions
contemplated in the original matrix for each component of this operation. Annex 3 provides an update of
progress in meeting the agreed output indicators.

SUBPROGRAM A: IMPROVE EFFICIENCY IN BUDGET MANAGEMENT
63.     The PARL program aims at strengthening macroeconomic management and improving the
quality of public services by increasing efficiency of public spending. Three main reforms are being
adopted to reach these goals:
        introducing a medium-term perspective to allow for policies and strategies to be reflected fully by
        the budget while keeping the macro-economic situation as a known and shared constraint;
        increasing progressively but steadily the autonomy and responsibility of line Ministries and their
        branch offices to allow for sector policies and strategies to be actually designed and implemented
        as closely as possible to the end-user of public service; and



                                                                    20
        introducing performance budgeting instruments and procedures and reinforcing auditing
        capacities, leading to improved budget execution and generalized culture of contractual
        arrangements.
Component A.1: Greater visibility of policies and their medium-term budgetary implications by
placing budgetary allocation decisions in a multiyear framework
64.      The objective of this activity is to reach an aggregated Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF), providing budget ceilings and taking into account sector MTEFs, inter-sector
priorities, and financial constraints identified by the medium term fiscal framework (tableau des
opérations financières de l'Etat, TOFT). As an interim step, government has opted for both a three year
rolling TOFT, regularly updated, and sector MTEFs in which credit allocations are presented by large
programs with performance indicators. Ultimately, sector MTEFs, revised after budget arbitrations, will
be integral part of the budget preparation process, and completed at the operational level by program
budgets.
65.     The challenge remains preparing effective sector MTEFs that fully reflect the government's
sector priorities and the constraints of budget resources as set in the TOFT. The current exercise of
sector MTEFs preparation is carried out in parallel to the preparation of the budget law and does not yet
systematically feed into the budget law preparation or execution processes. With the support of the P-
ESW, a methodological guide for the preparation of MTEFs was prepared and adopted by the
government. The P-ESWs also supported the organization of one seminar in April 2007, providing an
opportunity to disseminate the MTEF methodology to all ministries. Subsequently, the Ministries of
National Education, Housing, Health, and Equipment were the pilots for draft sector MTEFs for 2007­09.
As of end 2009 a total of 10 ministries11 prepared sector MTEFs for 2008­10. Government needs to
gradually extend the number of participating ministries to entrench the multi-year budget perspective for
sectors as well as at consolidated level, and to make sure that MTEFs are consistent with the fiscal
framework (TOFT). Thus, the government is preparing to gradually adopting the MTEF as a regular
budgetary procedure in line with the requirements of the new Organic Budget Law.
66.      The indicative trigger for PARL IV "Extension of sector MTEFs 2009­2011 by the
incorporation of 5 new ministries, with the assistance of an ad hoc Working group" is on-going and
expected to be met during the first quarter 2010. Indeed, in addition to two new ministerial
departments that have prepared or updated their MTEF by their own means, five other ministerial
departments (Agriculture, Justice, Youth and Sports, Public Sectors Modernization, and New
Technologies) were selected to strengthen their capacities for the design of their sector MTEF. After
some administrative delays in launching the activity, these ministerial departments have started preparing
their MTEF early January 2010 with the aim to achieve their MTEFs by May 2010, which would raise the
total number of participating departments to 15. As a consequence of the delays in starting the activity
the final prior action has been reformulated as follows: "The preparation of medium-term expenditure
frameworks (MTEFs) for the period 2010-2012 for five (5) additional ministerial departments has been
initiated with the support of an ad hoc working group".
67.     The key expected result of this component is to ensure that multiyear performance
budgeting is fully integrated with the process of preparation of the Budget Law. To this end, first,
all Ministries would have to prepare their MTEF and program budgets together with performance
contracts at the regional level. This will require intensive and extensive training in sector Ministries
central offices as well as branch offices, and in the Ministry of Finance. Second, the on-going OBL

11
   The 10 ministries are: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Maritime Fisheries, High Counsel of Planning,
Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and New Technologies, Ministry of National Education (Primary and Secondary Education),
Secretary of State in Charge of Water, Ministry of Equipment and Transport, Ministry of Housing and Urbanization and Ministry
of Tourism.


                                                             21
reform which puts MTEF and performance-budgeting tools at the core of the Budget Law preparation has
to be completed. Yet, in the meantime, as is currently adopted, the MTEF process could already fuel the
multiyear programming and help ensure better coherence between macro constraints and policy choices.
Component A.2: Greater responsibility in budgetary programming and execution for regional and
provincial branch offices.
        Generalizing budget flexibility and performance indicators
68.     Budget flexibility (globalization) aims at increasing budget management autonomy for line
Ministries and their branch offices through a greater aggregation of budget allocations, first within the
lowest significant level of aggregation called "paragraph" (paragraphe) for investment and some non-
salary current expenditures. This greater flexibility allows managers to reallocate budget resources freely
within this grouping of items, without having to request ex-ante authorization from the MEF. Ministries
engaged in this new approach are requested to provide performance indicators.
69.     Since end 2008, all 34 eligible Ministries have adopted flexible budgeting with performance
indicators. In 2008, two new ministerial departments joined the program of flexible budgeting, which
brings the total ministries participating in the program to 34. As a result, 98 percent of the 2008
investment budget is globalized up from 77 percent in 2007. Depending on the results of the 2009
experience, and in line with CFAA recommendations, the on-going reform of the Organic Budget Law
(OBL) is envisaging to further extend globalization to a higher level of aggregation.
70.      Performance indicators are in place but need further rationalization. For the 2009 Budget
Law, a total of 34 ministerial departments presented their budget to Parliament with performance
indicators, within the classical budget presentation at the paragraphe level, which brings the number of
indicators above 1,900. The number of indicators remains very high and thus does not allow for an
efficient and timely monitoring and evaluation of the programs. Furthermore, many of them are input
indicators rather that output/outcome indicators. Contingent on the development of program budgets at
the Ministry level, the Government PARAP implementation would lead to fewer indicators per program.
71.      The expected outcome is that flexibility will expedite budget execution while performance
indicators will provide tools to monitor expenditure efficiency. Given progress to date, the expectations
are that it will be deepened following the OBL reform.
        Increasing branch offices responsibility for budget management
72.     The reform program supported by this operation is aimed at starting to change an over-
centralized environment, by devolving more responsibilities to branch offices of Ministries. This is
the core of the de-concentration process promoted under the PARL since its onset, to ensure autonomy,
responsibility, accountability and efficiency of branch offices, therefore better service delivery. The
approach to this objective has been twofold: setting de-concentration as a Government priority policy, by
adopting a decree setting a de-concentration policy framework, and creating de-concentration tools in
every Ministry.
73.      In early January 2010, the King of Morocco put in place a Consultative Body to design a
new decentralization-regionalization strategy by June 2010. The guiding principles for the strategy
are as follows: (i) preserve the unity of the State, nation and territory; (ii) institute solidarity mechanisms
that can reflect and enhance inter-regional complementarily and cohesion; (iii) ensure and harmonious
and balanced distribution of powers and resources that ensure an effective coexistence of local authorities
the central Government and the authorities concerned (iv) adopt extensive devolution. The King of
Morocco had previously asked the government to prepare a de-concentration Charter for deeper
administrative de-concentration. The Bank has provided technical assistance for a methodology, but
given that a broader national strategy is now being developed, further national administrative de-
concentration has been put on hold until the new strategy is finalized. On January 2010 the Consultative
Body members have been nominated and activities are now starting.

                                                      22
74.     Tools for performance based budget management at each Ministry level would have to stem
from program budgets which would frame performance contracts between the centre and branch offices.
The Ministry of Health for example, has introduced performance contracts in its relations with regional
agencies, but these have yet to be fully operationalized within the Ministry and in its relations with the
MEF.
75.      The PARL IV indicative trigger has been met: "The Ministry of National Education, Higher
Education, Public Officials Training and Scientific Research and the Ministry of Health have each signed
at least three (3) pilot performance contracts with their respective de-concentrated offices". Indeed, the
number of contracts has been surpassed by the Ministry of Health alone (6 contracts have been signed by
the Ministry of Health with its regional bodies for 2007-2009). In October 2009, the Ministry of
Education has signed 17 performance contracts (with 15 Universities and 2 establishments under public
oversight) and is also about to sign its contracts with the Regional Education and Training Offices (AREFs)
for 2010-2013. The expected outcome from this activity is that the on-going extension of performance
contracts within the context of deeper de-concentration would improve budget execution rates and
increase budget efficiency in service delivery. As international experience has shown such contracts are
difficult to design properly. Often they might lead to a distortion of incentive for providers to adequately
deliver the services they are responsible for. The Government is aware of such shortcoming and adopted
a flexible approach in developing performance contracts whereby as they are open for revisions as
necessary. As mentioned earlier, the World Bank is now supporting through the P-ESW the ministry of
Agriculture in the design of its performance contracts with a view to extend to other ministries the lessons
learned in the process. In addition the PER planned for the health and education sector would investigate
the initial experience with performance contracts.
Component A.3: Improving public performance through internal auditing, evaluation, and
performance control
76.     The objectives of this component are to (a) strengthen a performance orientation and de-
concentration of budget management process in central and de-concentrated units by introducing
performance auditing tools and (b) upgrade basic financial management procedures including internal
auditing, evaluation, and controls. This will take place as the traditional ex-ante controls are
progressively ebbing and are replaced by a newly defined ex-post control system.
1. Introducing performance auditing
77.     Performance auditing requires specific institutional and personal capacities, which take
time to build. The challenge for the PARAP is to keep the capacity building momentum within both the
IGF and the IGMs, and to expand their audit scope in the administration. It also requires a reasonable
number of indicators per Ministry budget, related to program budgets and performance contracts. The
results would be consolidated in a report to Parliament on overall budget performance; planned by the
OBL for each proposed budget law.
78.      A performance audit manual was adopted in December 2006, which follows international
standards for public sector auditing. Since then, intensive training has been provided to inspectors
from the Finance General Inspectorate (inspection générale des finances, IGF) and the 14 Ministry
General Inspectorate (inspections générales des ministères, IGM). Joint IGF/IGM performance audit
missions have conducted a total of 13 performance audits for 2006 budget execution and 22 performance
audits for 2007-2008 budget execution.
79.     The indicative trigger for PARL IV has been met: "The General Finance Inspectorate (IGF)
and the General Ministry Inspectorates (IGMs) have conducted performance audit reports for the year
2007 in at least twenty (20) ministerial departements, and the consolidated performance audit report for
the 2007 budget has been disseminated". 22 audits have been conducted for both 2007 and 2008 and the
consolidated report has been posted on the MEF web site.


                                                    23
2. Improving financial management procedures
80.      After a comprehensive study of its complex and sometimes redundant ex-ante control
system, Morocco has decided to merge its ex-ante control and accounting general directorates and
roles. This reform has a direct impact on sector Ministries flexibility and timely management of
expenditure. Sector Ministries' capacity as payment ordering authority is currently being assessed to
determine the degree of ex-ante control to be retained on a Ministry by Ministry basis. Moreover, the
new chart of accounts was approved in July 2008. In parallel and as a necessary complement to the
accounting reform, a comprehensive computerized management system for expenditure processing has
been developed (Gestion intégrée de la dépense, GID) which allows for better and faster information,
including reporting, between line ministries and the ministry of finance, and between central and branch
offices. GID is planned to be fully rolled-out early 2010.
81.      The indicative triggers for PARL IV associated with this reform component is met "The
Prime Minister has issued Decree No. 2-07-1235 dated November 20, 2008, providing for the
establishment of a new system for the control of public expenditure". A new system of modulated
expenditure control was implemented through the adoption of a related Decree (N. 2-07-1235) on 20
November 2008. The objective is to introduce more fluidity and flexibility of expenditure control, and
orient the control towards performance evaluation.
82.    The expected outcomes for this component are: (i) Lower average delay on expenditures
payments ­already met as delays are declining- ; (ii) Strengthened capacity in budget performance
management -on-going; (iii) Increased reliability and transparency of accounting information -on-going;
and GID in accordance with best practices on integrated IT systems -on-going and almost complete.
Component A.4: Reforming the Organic Budget Law
83.     To date, budget flexibility and pilot MTEFs have been implemented without having to alter
the legal bases of public finance in Morocco. To integrate the new budget management procedures and
tools into the process of budget law preparation, parliament discussions, and budget execution, it is
necessary to reform the OBL.
84.      The government has now decided on a revision of its OBL which will redefine budget laws
and give them a resolute results organization. The new OBL would allow for multi-year and
performance-based budgeting, by introducing program budgeting, flexibility, de-concentration,
performance evaluation and auditing, among other changes to the principles of the current budget system.
It would also greatly increase Parliament's capacity in budget authorization and monitoring. This is the
cornerstone of the reform, although some technical elements have been operationalized within the current
legal framework. It would make the reform irreversible in the medium term. The MEF is now well
engaged in the reform of the OBL and it has set up a platform for the reform with support from the EU. A
new budget classification allowing programs structure has been drafted, while work is progressing on
multi-year and performance-based budgeting. The current expectation is for the submission of the draft
law to Parliament by end of 2010.
85.      Looking forward the next stage of the reform process will center on the approval and
implementation of the OBL. Accordingly, the PARAP would focus on three main directions: (i)
enhance efficiency through increased public accountability (ii) support regional de-concentration and (iii)
further increase transparency of the budgetary process including with Parliament.
Subprogram B: Improve Efficiency in Human Resources Management (HRM)
86.      The objectives of the program are to transform the current civil service by putting skills
and performance at the core of the new system while modernizing the career system. The program
fosters the introduction of modern HRM tools to adapt civil service to key public sector missions and to
manage staff in a more efficient manner. The program has:


                                                    24
      a structural reform component, which aims at transforming the civil service architecture by (i)
      developing a strategic staffing framework (REC) in each Ministry to improve consistency
      between staffing and missions; (ii) creating a new job classification system; and (iii) providing
      the analytical background for a possible reform of the current remuneration system; and
      a component aimed at modernising the career system by (i) improving recruitment and mobility
      rules within the current statutes; (ii) changing rules for evaluation and promotion; and (iii)
      strengthening professional in-service training.
Component B.1: HRM structural reform
1.      Strategic Staffing
87.      The introduction of REC represents the cornerstone of the civil service reform. The REC
provides the tools to: (a) adapt structures and staff to each Ministry's missions, therefore helping de-
concentration to branch offices; (b) create job families to replace the existing corps and cadres, with a
view to ease the current constraints of statutory management; (c) evaluate individuals' performance more
accurately, thus allowing for promotions to account also for performance; (d) design training plans, so
that staff can adapt to new demands, notably the new budget management system and de-concentration;
(e) organize redeployment of staff, as a companion to de-concentration and a tool for service delivery
improvement; and (f) provide a sound analysis and agreed principles for a reform of the current
remuneration system. The full impact of the RECs, through better organization and more accurate
staffing, complemented by the introduction of new promotion and remuneration rules, should facilitate
de-concentration and ensure better wage bill predictability. Major management tools generated by the
RECs are rolling staff management score-cards, HR databases, and rolling in-service training plans.
Although most of the work was done by Morocco through the HR network steering committee chaired by
the Ministry of Public Sector Modernization (MMSP), the Bank P-ESW provided technical expertise at
the beginning of the REC operation.
88.      Twenty two Ministries, including all major Ministries in terms of variety of jobs and of
numbers (more than 90% of civil service employment) have now completed their REC. The whole
administration should be covered by end December 2009. The strategic staffing process is now
institutionalized, the HR network under the leadership of MMSP is in charge and provides Ministries with
budget and technical support, ensuring harmonization and knowledge sharing. The Bank has provided
ample technical assistance over the years, mostly to create technical expertise in the MMSP and sector
Ministries, with EU participation.
2.      New Job Classification
89.      The new job classification is meant to by-pass the constraints of the current 70 or so
statutes, which among others have negative effects on mobility while fueling inter-corps competition
for pay raises. New job families have emerged from the REC process, and the MMSP has completed a
new job classification for which the EU and the Bank have provided technical assistance. It is expected
that this new classification will also reinforce the new performance evaluation system by providing
transparent professional criteria applicable throughout the civil service spectrum, and facilitate mobility.
90.      The PARL aims at having the new job classification implemented throughout the
administration. As RECs are completed, the classification is being fed with new jobs descriptions. The
Bank is providing support to training of HR officers and managers for its production and dissemination.
The MMSP has also tried to merge 22 statutes into three for all administrative jobs. As of today however,
the three decrees creating 3 statutes instead of 22 have not yet been adopted.
91.      The indicative trigger for PARL IV associated with this component is met "The standard job
classification study has been validated by the Steering Committee chaired by the Ministry delegated to the
Prime Minister, in charge of Public Sector Modernization". The new job classification has been validated
by the HR network steering committee chaired by the MMSP in May 2009.

                                                    25
3.      New Remuneration System
92.      The current remuneration system in Morocco has been distorted by ad hoc pay rises in the
form of bonuses to each corps, a process initiated in 1996 and concluded in 2005, which reached its
full impact in 2006. As a result, today payroll consists of a low base salary and in some instances up to
more than 70 percent of the overall remuneration in bonuses. Designing a new remuneration system that
would result in a more predictable and slow growing wage bill can therefore be envisaged. A study is
ongoing that will provide Government with a diagnosis and proposals to rationalize the current structure
of remuneration by reintegrating as much as possible of current bonuses in base salaries as a first step of
overall remuneration system. The study develops proposals for a new remuneration system through the
elaboration of options for reform scenarios.
93.     The indicative trigger associated with this component "The firm in charge of the study on the
development of a new compensation system based on the new job classification has completed the first
two phases of said study, the findings of said phases have been validated by the Steering Committee
chaired by the Ministry delegated to the Prime Minister, in charge of Public Sector Modernization, and
the design of scenarios for the development of said system has been initiated by said firm" is met.
4.    E-Human Resources program for the harmonization of public administration human resource
management systems
94.     The eHR program fosters the establishment of a standard framework for the
harmonization of the individual HRMS (système intégré des resources humaines, SIHR) used by
Ministries to help government better manage its civil servants base while reducing costs of
administration. As of last June 2009, the MEF had set up and launched a SAP-based Human Resource
application to manage staff ­ MEF alone has around 17,000 staff. Other ministries have started to adopt
the new system such us the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Commerce Industry & new Technologies and
MMSP. However other large ministries, such as Education, are working on their own system. So far, no
further action has been taken to harmonize all HRM databases used by the different government
departments. This will require agreement between Ministries as to what database management system
they should use, who manages and maintains it, and what are the processes and protocols to exchange and
update information
95.      The outcomes associated with component B1 are: (i) the use of GPEEC tools increase HR
mobility and HRM transparency; (ii) progressive move from statutes to jobs as a professional criteria for
employment and career management; (iii) a compensation system more equitable and transparent; and
(iii) with the SIRH better and comprehensive management by government of HR and wage bill. All of
them are on-going and on schedule.
Component B.2: Current HRM system reform
1. Recruitment and mobility
96.      A legal text was drafted in 2005 modifying the general civil service statutes reforming
recruitment, mobility, secondment, and external assignment. The draft decree, now became draft law,
opens the possibility of redeployment, making competitive examination the sole hiring mode, creating
contract employment by the State, and exploring at length financial incentives for redeployed employees.
So far, it has been voted by the Lower Chamber, but has been held at the Upper Chamber for more than a
year. Draft implementation decrees have been prepared, but they cannot be adopted without the law. The
government is working on regulatory ways to allow for specific bonuses to staff accepting to be deployed
in remote and difficult areas. Competitive hiring is effective in Education, and for the rest of the civil
administration hiring is so scarce and sparse the impact of the legal stalemate is hardly perceptible.
Education is also bypassing this legal hurdle by using the opportunity created by the statute of the
Regional Education Academies (AREF) planned now for 2011 which will allow the AREFs to hire under
more flexible forms and with geographical postings, thus compensating the absence of legal texts


                                                    26
regulating re-deployment and term-employment. The program has evolved from formal measures to ad
hoc responses to specific issues within each Ministry.
2. Evaluation and promotion
97.      Two decrees were adopted in early December 2005 reforming promotions and establishing
new and transparent procedures for performance evaluation. The first decree set quotas on
promotion opportunities and retroactively confirmed the special promotions that took place between 1996
and 2004. The second decree modified the traditional procedure of annual rating with an evaluation
procedure that must take place every two years and which is presented as a prerequisite for any new
appointment or promotion. A training program was developed afterward. Performance evaluation plays a
determining role in employees' eligibility for future promotions (half of the quota is for best performing
staff meeting the seniority criteria). However, since quotas were not put in place in the evaluation
process, a survey conducted by the MMSP has shown that Ministries tended to push ratings to the higher
levels, thus making it necessary to revise the evaluation procedure to introduce quotas in the ratings as
well. Looking forward this element of the program will require further reassessment.
98.     The outcomes associated with component B2 are: (i) more statutory mobility, and more
transparent promotions; and (ii) improvement of professional skills. Progress is on-going.
Component B.3 Introduction of In-service training
99.      Until the PARL, in-service training was mostly a basis for future promotion and financed
by government without link to the service needs. The PARAP aimed at changing this culture, by
refocusing training on the actual needs of administration. A decree setting a national public
administration training strategy has been adopted in 2007 and a national strategy was adopted in 2009.
Training budgets have been made available, with the target of reaching 1 percent of the wage bill (usually
it is 3 percent in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries), by progressive
steps. Training plans are part of the REC outputs, and are progressively put in place as GPEEC grows.
Self-standing plans pre-exist, in four Ministries (Agriculture, Finance, Equipment and Transport,
Economic and General Affairs).
100.     The agenda for the next five years rest on the finalization and complete roll out of the
reforms envisioned. The tools have been prepared for a new HRM system, they now have to be used
(GPEEC, REC, job classification) as daily management tools and decision-making process elements.
Some significant reforms have been introduced such as performance evaluation or promotion partly based
on merit. Others remain to be done, those which affect the General Statutes of civil service or the
modification of the current wage scale. This will require intensive work from the Government's part,
from IEC to training, with managers, trade unions and the Parliament. A new HRM agenda will stem out
of the de-concentration reform: local hiring, term-employment, overall career design to reflect the shift of
responsibilities between the centre and branch offices and encourage mobility and accountability.
Finally, the SIRH harmonization will likely require sustained attention as it is technically challenging to
implement.
SUBPROGRAM C: CONSOLIDATE AND CONTROL PUBLIC PAYROLL DECREASE
101.    During the early 1990s to mid 2000s, the wage bill of the central Government personnel had
been on an upward trend to reach a record rate of 11.7 percent of GDP in 2005. This rate was one of
the highest in the world. The steady increase of the wage bill relative to GDP not only threatened public
finances sustainability over the medium term, but was also absorbing most of the generated fiscal space
hampering the reinforcement of social and economic infrastructure and the improvement of public service
delivery. Two main factors contributed to this situation. The first has to do with the inadequacy of the
composition and location of the civil service limiting its productivity and efficiency. Indeed, although the
Moroccan public administration was not overstaffed compared to similar countries, its skills mix and its
sector and geographic coverage did not match actual needs for an efficient service delivery. In order to


                                                    27
enhance the civil service productivity, an adjustment in its skills and geographic composition was
warranted that would enhance its productivity and thus reduce its relative cost. The second factor relates
to inappropriate HRM practices in line ministries underpinned by missing institutional mechanisms that
hold line ministries responsible of the wage implications of their HRM decisions. The latter practices
were further exacerbated by the large vacant job positions that have been accumulated over time, which
allowed line ministries to proceed with non-transparent and unjustifiable hiring that exceed the job
positions negotiated in the context of the annual budget laws as adopted by Parliament. In addition to
reforming HRM policies, a mechanism of personnel credit ceilings and capacity building in terms of best
practices in the management of HR in relation to personnel credit forecasting was necessary to improve
the efficiency of civil service while controlling the evolution of the wage bill.
102.     In this context, the Government has taken since 2005 four main measures to reverse this
trend and control the wage bill progression while improving civil service quality. First, it has
implemented in 2005 an ambitious voluntary early retirement program (ERP) leading to the retirement of
almost 39,000 personnel representing some 7.5 percent of total civil service. The ERP allowed public
finances to make budgetary savings of 1 percent of GDP. Second, it has implemented a tighter
recruitment policy geared to meet exclusively the needs of social sectors, such as education health and
security. In fact, without the voluntary ERP, the government would not have been able to hire necessary
employees to match civil service skills mix and geographic repartition to the actual needs for better
efficiency of essential public service delivery. Third, it has systematically started cancelling job positions
vacated by retiring staff for age limit to allow for flexibility in the allocation of the new job posts on the
basis of actual sector needs, discussed and negotiated in the context of the annual budget law preparation.
This policy contributed also to contain the stock of vacant posts. Fourth, it encouraged line ministries to
redeploy the existing staff from overstaffed departments/regions toward those experiencing staffing gaps,
both within each ministry and between different ministries. Those measures have had positive impact on
the composition of civil service, but also on the evolution of the wage bill since 2005. Thus, the wage bill
declined to 10.2 percent of GDP in 2008, close to the government's medium term objective of 10 percent
of GDP. It is expected that the wage bill would stay around this rate in 2009 and 2010, despite the
revalorization of salaries of the low-ranked civil servants as part of the stimulus package to alleviate the
effects of the global crisis.
         Figure 10. The wage bill is declining since 2005, but its consolidation in the medium

103.     The challenge is now for the Government to durably ensure control of public payroll in the
medium term including through the introduction of budgetary ceilings on wage bill appropriations
by line Ministries. While the on-going revision of the Organic Budget Law represents an opportunity to
formally introduce budget appropriation ceilings (crédits limitatifs) to ministries, the PARL is supporting
four types of actions on this subprogram. First, it supports structural reforms of the civil service
management system. The new civil service management system should consolidate control of the wage
bill through enhanced monitoring, redeployment, and control of staff numbers. Second, the PARL


                                                               28
supports measures to improve forecasting accuracy of the wage bill by reducing the uncertainties related
to the time lag deriving from delays in regularizing due staff movements, especially in large ministries
such as education, health, and agriculture. Third, it seeks to build forecasting capacities in line ministries
where human resources management takes place. In parallel to this operation, dialogue continues on the
need for rationalization of the salary revalorization mechanism, based on criteria centered on increased
performance of individual civil servants. Component C.1: Consolidation of the monitoring and control of
the wage bill
104.    The objective of this component is to empower line ministries to monitor and manage their
personnel credits in relation to their HRM decisions, including through the introduction of
forecasting tools for a better projection of their respective payroll. Under the current institutional
arrangements, line ministries in Morocco are not required to conduct timely monitoring and management
of the evolution of their personnel credit in relation to their HRM decisions. Until recently, line
ministries don't even know the impact of their HRM decisions on the personnel credit. The MEF has
been the only institution to forecast and monitor the evolution of the wage bill. Under these settings, the
Budget Directorate makes projections when preparing the annual Budget Law using average estimated
parameters on salaries and on the composition and movement of civil servants while the National Center
of Wage Bill Processing (CNT) pays salaries every month after due diligence. The role of line ministries
is limited to maintaining day-to-day responsibility for administrative management of hiring and
promotions. In this setting, the ministries are only indirectly accountable for the implications of their
human resources management decisions on their personnel credits. As a result, the attempts to control
and accurately forecast payroll growth are currently limited to controls over new recruitments through the
total number of job positions created by the budget laws and to some extent over normal promotions as
these depend also on the processing capacities in line ministries.
105.    Solid and accurate forecasting and monitoring capacity in line ministries in relation to
HRM decisions is a fundamental prerequisite for controlling the wage bill. A study supported by the
P-ESW concluded that the MEF's model for forecasting the wage bill is adequate although it could be
further refined using more detailed data on the composition of civil servants and their programmed
movement. Then it needs to be disseminated into line ministries, accompanied by some training to
concerned staff so that projection of personnel credit can be carried out at a sector level where actual
human resources management takes place that have direct impact on the progression of the wage bill.
However, line ministries lacked sufficient and timely information on detailed data on the evolution of
wages and salaries of their personnel management decisions to help them carry out sound projection
exercises of their personnel credit. This is why the PARL III envisaged the dissemination of such
information by the MEF to line ministries on a regular basis and endorsed it as a trigger to PARL IV.
106.    The PARL IV trigger is met: "The Ministry of Economy and Finance has launched the
dissemination of monthly reports on the evolution of the wage bill and its main determinants in each
ministerial department". It intends to meet the needs of selected pilot line ministries for timely
information so that, on the one hand, budget and human resources managers in line ministries are aware
of budget implications of their HRM decisions, and on the other hand, forecasting exercises are based on
accurate and timely data. In this regard, the Treasury General of the Kingdom has started preparing two
types of reports. The first presents the monthly evolution of the wage bill underlining the impact of
recent HRM decisions with timely information on the average time taken to process the different types of
personnel movements such as hiring, retirement, and promotions. This report is sent to selected pilot line
ministries. The second is an electronic file with all the information on employees by each line ministry,
including salaries and administrative situation. This report is disseminated to each line ministry.
107.    The expected outcome of this sub-component is a better controlled wage bill at aggregate
level and its steady decline to the government's medium term target of about 10 percent of GDP.
This outcome is being accomplished as by end 2008 the wage bill declined to 10.2 percent of GDP, down
from 10.6 percent in 2007. Another related result is the improvement of the wage bill projections.


                                                     29
Recent data shows that the gap between projected and actual wage bill has been shrinking over the last
few years from 7.2 percent in 2006 down to 5 percent in 2008 and more recently to a perfect projection
with an error of just -0.4 percent in 2009 (Table 7).

Component C.2: Introduction of best practices in the monitoring, forecasting and management of
payroll credit in line ministries and stabilization of the number of civil servants
108.    As personnel credits are not constrained by ceilings, line ministries manage recruitment and
promotions without due regard to their impact on personnel expenditures. Currently, even
ministries that have developed an MTEF do not manage salaries. In the case of education, this means that
about 94 percent of their recurrent expenditure budget is excluded from performance budgeting. In
addition, complex processing procedures of HRM decisions translate into uncontrolled regularization
delays, mainly in large ministries such as education and health, with their corollary of unexpected impact
on the level of the wage bill. In this context, the actual wage bill usually exceeds the forecast and
budgeted figure, making control of the wage bill problematic. In the medium term, introducing best
practices of HRM linked to the control of personnel credit is necessary to ensure comprehensiveness of
performance-based budgeting exercise and medium term sustainability of the wage bill. This entails
developing line ministries' capacity for managing personnel credits supported by ceilings over the
medium term and the simplification of HRM procedures.
109.     In complement to the activities under the previous component, C.1, the Government is
gradually introducing best practices in personnel expenditure management in line ministries and
simplifying HRM procedures, thus preparing them to the introduction of budget appropriation ceilings
to personnel expenditures as envisaged by the new OBL under preparation. To this end, a working group
was created within the MEF March 2008 with all concerned Directions as members and led by the Budget
Directorate. The working group was extended to four pilot ministries: Education, Health, Housing, and
fisheries. Through regular meetings, this working group has shared and discussed relevant data related to
HRM decisions and their impact on salaries and the wage bill. It has equally devised monitoring
mechanisms and forecasting tools for personnel credit management in line ministries. It has also prepared
monthly reports explaining the sources of discrepancies of wage bill evolution with respect to HRM
decisions. Furthermore, the five pilot ministries have benefited from training to use the projection model
created by the Budget Directorate (MEF) to forecast their personnel credit in relation to their HRM
decisions. To help improve forecasting exercises in line ministries, the TGR prepared and disseminated
monthly data on the evolution of the personnel credits for each pilot ministry, as well as data on progress
made in terms of HRM decisions regularization. This information has helped line ministries evaluate the
impact of their HRM decisions on the personnel credit. These new arrangements are translating into
improved processing of HR management decisions with reduced backlog payments, which is contributing
to better projections of the wage bill (Table 8). More recently, the working group discussed ways to
improve the processing of HR movements through simplified procedures of job posts. The MEF has
taken two important actions. First it has prepared and disseminated a circular to all line ministries that
introduces streamlined and simplified procedures for the management of job posts aiming at better
management and forecasting instruments of HR. Second, it has introduced in the Budget Law 2010 a
measure allowing cancelling the job posts created by the budget laws but not used over the year. This
measure would encourage line ministries to expedite the regularization of employees' movements within
the year, which would significantly improve forecasting and control of the wage bill.

110.    The PARL IV trigger is met: "The group comprising representatives of, respectively, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of National Education , Higher Education, Public
Officials Training and Scientific Research, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Housing Urbanization
and Spatial Development and the Ministerial Department of Fisheries, in charge of the preparation and
implementation of measures leading to an improved monitoring, forecasting and payroll credits
management and including, in particular, tools for improved forecasting of personnel credits and best
practices for job posts management, has identified and introduced said measures in said ministries, and
Circular No. 189/MOM/2009 date November 30, 2009, of the Ministry of Economy and Finance has
been issued to extend key measures for improved civil service management to all of the Borrower's
ministries". The steps outlined above are fully compliant with the envisioned action.
111.    This component also seeks to keep the number of new hires low, which would contribute to
meeting the payroll ratio target. The Government intends to maintain a ceiling on yearly recruitments.
Past agreed ceilings of 7,000 positions to fill the annually freed positions through normal retirement have
been surpassed over the last years to meet the needs of social sectors, such as education, health and the
needs of security. Nevertheless, the progression rate of civil servants has steadily declined since 2006,
and it is time to stabilize the size of civil service once the social sectors needs are met (Table 8).
Authorities are proposing to stabilize public servants growth at some "optimal" size that takes into
account increasing departures of public servants for age-limit retirement and geographic priorities for
personnel redeployment.

112.    The main expected result of this component is for line Ministries to directly manage their wage
bill in order to improve wage bill forecasting and control while preparing for performance-based
budgeting. This is on-going.
113.     In the future, the objective remains to continue to extend such best practices to other
ministries so as to build capacities in preparation for the new ceilings mechanism. In the medium
term the objective is to ensure that personnel credit ceilings at the level of each ministry are introduced by
the new OBL under preparation. With the new OBL, line ministries would take their HRM decisions
within the limits of their personnel credit ceilings. As a result, the control of the evolution of the wage
bill would be ensured upfront in the context of the preparation of the annual budget laws. The tools
prepared in the context of the PARAP, including RECs and MTEFs would play their full role in the sector
allocation of resources, including personnel expenditures, according to the Government's strategies and
social and economic priorities.
SUBPROGRAM D: E-GOVERNMENT AND SIMPLIFICATION OF PROCEDURES
114.     The e-government subprogram was first introduced with the second PARL Series (PARL
III) as a key complementary tool for Morocco's public administration reforms. It focuses on e-
government to simplify procedures and thus improve the efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and
accountability of the administrations. In addition, it uses e-government as an enabler of changes in
behaviors, processes, and organization to transform these public entities and extend services to the
Moroccan citizens and enterprises.
115.   The Government has consolidated its earlier progress in the creation of a favorable
environment for e-Government, and has included it as a key priority to simplify public procedures and

                                                             31
achieve efficiency gains in public administration management. Government has earlier on established its
eMaroc strategy (in 2005) aiming at making Morocco a model of modern government with relevant and
useful online information and services for its citizens and businesses. In 2009, it published its Maroc
Numerique 2013 strategy (eMaroc2013) building on earlier reforms. The eMaroc2013 strategy was
approved by the King, and is now in implementation
116.   PARL IV includes three key pillars identified as critical for the success of the program aiming
at modernizing and improving government processes and outreach through the use of ICTs.
       Improving the institutional structure to enhance e-government program coordination, facilitation,
       and leadership across the administration;
       Ensuring that the vertical applications used in different government agencies met international
       standards in functionality, security, and quality, provide accelerated on-line services of benefits
       to citizens and businesses, hence delivering demonstrative results to the public; and
       Strengthening horizontal foundations and linkages to provide a stronger "backbone" for the e-
       government program, integrate different data management systems while reducing the cost of
       information management, and to minimize back-office issues across multiple layers of
       government and sectors by using common technical standards and infrastructure for information
       management.
Component D.1: Improve the institutional framework and government leadership
117.    E-government cuts across all public departments and sectors of the economy to deliver
innovative services and transform administrations. E-government provides opportunities for sharing
resources and processes, and integrating services and delivery platforms. It presents unique challenges in
terms of information and change management for traditionally "silo"-driven administrations as it
transforms processes and information access; and hence decision making, and civil service culture. It
requires institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms that ensure the coherence of policies
and investments in modernization and process improvements across all sectors. In addition, it requires
change leaders to help other public officials see the possibilities offered, and to drive the vision of
transformation through administrations by changing day to day business.
118.    Morocco has developed an appropriate institutional framework for e-government. A long
standing obstacle to the development of e-government in Morocco has been the absence of a coordination
body, and the presence of several competing institutional actors aiming at assuming the leadership on e-
government. This situation resulted in overlapping responsibilities, competing decision centers,
duplication of development efforts and information; waste of resources, and slow progress in many areas.
Many ministries developed successful public sector applications in their domain of competence.
However, these attempts were not coordinated, were conducted in isolation, and the use of resources not
optimized. In particular, the lack of a leadership centre resulted in competing applications in many cross
­ ministerial functions (e.g. applications in the human resources management) or between state and local
government (collectivites locales). More recently, the coordination issue witnessed a radical
improvement in May 2009. Morocco has effectively addressed the issue of leadership and coordination in
the area of e-Government. First, it has established a cross ministerial committee in charge of Information
and Communications Technologies (ICT), with the representatives of the relevant ministries involved.
Second, it attributed the leadership of this committee to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and New
Technologies (MICNT). An operational unit is now being established to drive the development and
implementation of e-government in Morocco, presided by Ministry of ICNT. The new structure has
caused a shift of some of MMSP's reform mandates to MICNT.
119.     The indicative trigger for PARL-IV is met: "The Prime Minister has issued Decree No. 2-08-
444 dated May 21, 2009, providing for the establishment of a governance and institutional framework for
the development of the information society and e-government". The official decree defining the
institutional platform for e-Government as described above was approved and published on May 2009. It

                                                   32
documented the creation of a National Council for ICTs and Digital economy, presided by the MICNT
and reporting to the Prime Minister. The national council is now operational and it held its first meeting
on July 22, 2009.
Component D.2: Improvement of public services and simplification of procedures by means of
administration online (e-government)
120.     This area of the e-Government component includes large e-Government applications, aimed
at radically changing the behavior and impact of the actors and the processes associated with delivery of
public services.
1.      E-Customs
121.    An efficient and effective customs system improves the public administration in terms of
revenue collection, combating fraud and illegal trafficking, encouraging international trade, and
providing statistical information on foreign trade for economic planning. In Morocco, the e-Customs
system has completed its migration toward an improved system dubbed Automatic Customs Network
Database (BADR). This new system provides businesses, shippers, and customs agents ready access to
declarations through the Internet. It consists of several online services such as custom guarantees,
clearance of vehicles or motorcycles, and status and progress check in real time. As a result, clearance
time has been reduced from five days to less than an hour, and electronic payments are currently
available. BADR is also connected to the integrated budget information system, the tax system, and the
Direction Générale des Impôts. Looking forward the system might further benefit from inter-operability
with systems used in Treasury, Taxation, and Budget as well as general harmonization and
standardization with international trade and logistics systems.
2.      E-Procurement
122.    Morocco has successfully initiated a comprehensive reform to introduce e-Procurement, as
a tool for public administration reforms. E-procurement increases transparency, and government
accountability in public spending leading to lower prices for government contracts, and less waste. It
increases the speed and process efficiency of public procurement, thereby minimizing delays in bringing
the benefits of the procurement to the public. More broadly the development of e-Procurement systems
may contribute to prevent and fight fraud and corruption.
123.     A comprehensive e-procurement platform is operational and all ministries are compelled to
use it. The decree 2-06-388 of February 2007 required the establishment of the e-procurement portal
under TGR's leadership (article 76). In October 2007 the Parliament voted for mandatory use of e-
Procurement for all government purchases, and the Prime Minister's Office is expected to mandate its use
to all agencies and public entities. A bi-lingual e-procurement portal was established for all the
government administrations in 2007 (www.marchespublics.gov.ma) and started to be used for publishing
all tenders in 2009. The system is also used by all local communities and public entities. Practically 100
percent of the central agencies (i.e. 1703 public buyers) and local government (i.e. all 1664 collectivites
locales) now provide on line offers, terms of reference and results. 112 state controlled public agencies
(44% of the total number of public establishments) are using the e-procurement portal today. As of
November 2009, 35,410 tenders were published online. However there is still a need to reinforce the
legal requirement to publish results on the bulletin boards and on the e-procurement portal. Training
agencies' communication officers on web publishing and using the web as a tool to make information
more transparent and accessible would also contribute to reach the objective. The roll-out of e-
procurement to 100% of all the administration procurement activities requires process reform and change
management, as well as sustained, long term technical assistance to the implementation teams.
124.   The functionality of the platform is however not fully completed as bidders can not yet
submit technical and financial offers on-line. This particular module (online submission) is suffering
from some technical delays due to the complexity of the programming work required, and will be


                                                    33
completed around April 2010. It is also related to the third component of the e-Procurement platform,
that of the supplier database, which is still currently under design. Similarly, the completion of the
module on the reverse auctions, which also depends on the completion of the on line submission
component and the supplier database, is delayed. Finally, further work is required to ensure a secure
Internet platform that permits interested businesses to submit tenders containing technical and financial
offers electronically. This time frame is consistent with international experience as custom-based
development of e-procurement system takes years before the entire system is completed.
125.     The original indicative trigger for PARL IV is met other than for the completion of the
"submission of bids on line" activity which will require more time: "extension to some public
entities, as well as some local administration, of the existing tools as regards public bids on line
(download offers, terms of reference, results and the submission of offers on line)". As detailed above,
progress has been substantial as the extension of e-procurement practices has been accomplished for
practically 100 percent of central and local administration entities and 36 percent of state controlled
public agencies, thus surpassing expectations. However the underestimation of the time necessary to
complete all the necessary steps to allow for the submission of offers on line will not allow for this last
sub component to be realized in line with the PARL ­IV timetable. Nevertheless Government is
progressing in implementation with a view to complete the process by 2010. Accordingly the final prior
action has been revised as follows: "Existing tools for public bids on-line (down load offers, terms of
reference and results) have been extended to at least twenty five percent (25%) of state controlled public
entities and eighty percent (80%) of local administration, and the action plan for the submission of offers
on-line to be operational by December 31, 2010 has been completed12".
Component D.3: Externalization of public services and public-private partnerships in the field of
public administration on line.
1.         Externalization
126.     The externalization of some IT functions may bring multiple benefits. It can help relieve
public administrations of the financial and administrative burden of providing services. If placed within a
Public-Private Partnership framework, externalization also facilitates the sharing of risks with the private
sector, enables faster deployment of better services to constituents, and facilitates transfer of know-how,
best practices, and methodology. Concurrently, governments can still retain an important role in
regulating and monitoring the performance of private partners. The Government has been contracting the
private sector to deliver several of its ICT applications for public sector management. Such examples are
BADR, the current government portals (www.maroc.gov.ma), the e-Procurement system modules already
existing and the development of the HR Management system. Regarding PPP's, while institutionally
Morocco's e-government committee encourages their use for new e-services, to date this approach had
not yet been implemented. A feasibility study to assess the general viability and affordability of PPP for
these services could benefit progress in implementation.
2.         Interoperability framework and standard norms
127.    A coherent interoperability framework is vital for a coordinated and integrated rollout of e-
government services. Standard norms are needed to provide clear guidelines for achieving
interoperability across public administrations with regard to management of information, and have to be
elaborated for the technologies involved. The use of standard norms can also contribute to making web
services truly citizen-centric, avoid duplication of information across agencies and ministries, ensure
record accuracy and integrity, and cut down the costs of ICT systems development, maintenance and
operation for the government. The e-government Committee has recognized the importance of such
norms and therefore identified several domains for normalization that relate to issues of accessibility,
content, and navigation and formats. After delays due to institutional changes the study defining the

     Please note that as mentioned earlier the final prior action has also been re-worded to improve clarity and specificity.

                                                                  34
norms, previously under the MMSP, is now pending validation. The Interoperability and Technology
standards mandate is now under MICNT.
128.    The key outcomes for component D are: (i) an increased number of public services on line (ii)
by decreased time devoted to imports and exports procedures, stockage periods and passage through
Customs services and (iii) Greater transparency in public bidding processes and associated savings. All
of them are well under way to be achieved.
129.     To foster the overall e-Government agenda a dedicated TA has been put in place to support
the inter-ministerial committee in meeting its strategic objectives. The TA will help strengthen its
institutional base and will provide capacity building to its members and their stakeholders; and will have
specific deliverables such as: agreements on technical standards, cyber-security, a web/information
management strategy, a consolidated approach to infrastructure management for government owned
Local / Wide area networks, integrated approach to using existing programs (such as GENIE) to increase
outreach for new services. It will also support the implementation of the 15 priority applications selected
among the 89 identified e-government projects thereby enhancing the availability of e-services for
citizens.
130.     In the coming years the EMaroc 2013 Strategy provides a solid base for the government to
implement its ambitious plan. As the objectives and the results expected are clear, the challenge is for
the implementation efforts to effectively mobilize the required skills and adopt international best practices
as well as increase collaboration and coordination between the different stakeholders. The strategy
includes interventions in all the priority sectors such as public financial management, education, health,
employment and skills development.

D.      FUTURE PROSEPCTS FOR BANK ENGAGEMENT

131.     PARL-IV concludes the second PARL series. Looking forward a third new series is envisaged
to support the next phase of the reform program. The PARAP agenda is expected to evolve on several
key dimensions that will materialize in the coming months: (i) the finalization of the draft Organic Budget
Law (OBL); and (ii) the completion of the de-concentration strategy (iii) the conclusion of the preparatory
work and subsequent implementation of the current phase of the HR reform and (iv) the deepening of e-
government throughout the public administration. In line with the new CPS objectives, the Bank is
prepared to design a new PARL series to support the next PARAP phase and further strengthen the results
orientation of the program for enhanced service delivery thus fostering the mainstreaming of the reform
objectives in key line ministries. Specifically the finalization of the OBL would contribute to: (a)
improved performance by strengthening multi-annual programming and results-oriented budget
management; (b) increased accountability through higher civil servants responsibility for delivering on
agreed objectives, simplified budget management, generalization of performance contracts and
decentralization of personnel and payroll management; (c) enhanced transparency with an simplification
of the Budget structure and greater clarity in its presentation to Parliament including improved rules for
Budget approval process as well as for the submission of the Budget execution law. De-concentration
would lead to improved local management for better service delivery including though the development
of public-private partnerships. Finally e-government would also contribute to enhance the quality of
service delivery by improving access and efficiency. In addition the new series would further reinforce
donor harmonization as it will be developed in full coordination with the next EU and AfDB programs
which should materialize around the same time frame and with similar objectives. Joint discussions with
government to develop the new program are tentatively planned to start in the spring of 2010. This will
contribute to an even more effective multi-donor support to the government reform agenda. A dedicated
series of consultations would also be envisaged to inform the design of the new series.

                           VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

132.     The proposed PARL-IV does not support any reforms that are expected to have significant
distributional impacts. The focus of the operation is centered on reforms aimed at: (i) improving public
management of budget resources; (ii) supporting the preparation of a new management system for staffing
and remuneration anchored on performance measurement; (iii) consolidating payroll management; and
(iv) supporting the introduction of e-government to improve the efficiency of the administration and
public service delivery. The activities supported by this operation aim at improving the functioning of the
public administration in its core functions with a view to improve in due time the equity, efficiency,
transparency and accountability of the whole system (e.g. better budgetary planning, improved internal
auditing and evaluation procedures, enhanced instruments for wage bill management to continue sustain
macroeconomic stability, progress in rationalization of the HR system, e-governance as a tool for
increased transparency and efficiency in service delivery and public procurement). Upon review of each
individual measure, none of the activities supported by this operation have distributional implications that
would warrant a poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA). Independent from this operation, an
assessment of poverty and social impacts is envisaged as necessary once Government will have further
defined the timing and scope of the new management system for staffing and remuneration currently still
under design. Distributional analysis will take place if, upon completion of the scenarios for a new
remuneration system, gaps will remain to be addressed. As mentioned earlier, PARAP reforms have long
been the subject of a broad debate with multiple public events devoted to the discussion of some of the
reforms in question. The 2009 CPS consultations have further highlighted civil society expectations for
such reform efforts to lead to enhanced transparency and improved service delivery. Overall,
Government remains committed to understand the distributional impact of key policy reforms and
economic events. PSIAs have been done in the past or are planned in the coming months to inform
critical policy issues. For example, a PSIA was completed in 2008 to inform the design of the solid waste
management reform program and two were done for the water sector reform. An evaluation of the
voluntary retirement program implemented in 2005 did not show any sizable negative impact of the
availability of key service delivery staff in rural areas. On the contrary key service delivery ministries
have been given recruitment priority in the following years to address front line staff shortages (see the
Annex 6 of the PARL III program document, in Report No. 41981-MA). In the context of the envisaged
reform of the social protection system, Government is currently evaluating the distributional impact of
various options including the introduction of subsidized health insurance and conditional cash transfer
programs in education. PSIA is also foreseen for the potential reform of the energy tariff system.

B.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

133.     The PARL-IV program does not pose any significant environmental effects. PARL-IV is a
development policy credit in support of a broad program of policy and institutional reforms, for which the
environmental requirements of OP/BP 8.60 apply. However, the PARL-IV program is not likely to have
any significant positive or negative effects on the environment, forests, and other natural resources.
Furthermore, the Bank's overall strategy focuses on strengthening of the Government's legislative and
institutional capacity to address environment and natural resource management through a dedicated
portfolio of analytical and operational activities. The Government has just launched a new
comprehensive plan to address environmental and climate change issues. The new CPS describes in
detail the array of activities that support this agenda.




                                                    36
                                  Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
     Principle 1: Reinforce ownership.
     The design of this operation has been fully client driven and thus enjoys solid country ownership. Following
     reform efforts that started as early as 2002, the new government declaration announced in October 2007 further
     reinforced Government commitment to public administration reform as a key priority for the period 2008-2012.
     Government commitment to continuous analytical work and technical capacity building reinforces ownership
     on the content of the program; in addition communication with the media and Parliament facilitates public
     awareness.
     Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government on other financial partners on a coordinated
     accountability framework.
     The program is jointly prepared with the European Union and the African Development Bank. All institutions
     have actively contributed to the design with Government of coordinated policy matrices, while continuously
     participating in joint missions. Donor alignment on the reform program objectives was also sought and
     achieved through continued informal consultations and progress updates particularly by field based staff of
     respective institutions.
     Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
     circumstances.
     By design, the program fully reflects country's circumstances, priorities and institutional responsibilities as
     indicated by the Government. More complex policy reforms, like those affecting MTEFs' and result-oriented
     budgeting, HR management, and e-government have been supported by a programmatic ESW on areas agreed
     annually with the Government. The proposed DPL operation has also benefited from the lessons learned from
     the previous PARL series and other prior policy development operations in Morocco, and benefits from the
     flexibility embedded in the CPS.
     Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement.
     Prior actions and benchmarks have been identified through a process of extensive consultations with the
     Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Modernization and relevant sector ministries. The number of prior actions,
     (10), the number of benchmarks, (20), is aligned with good practice principles. Some prior actions refer to
     necessary process measures (for example, completing the standard job classification for the Public
     Administration and launching the scenario analysis for a new remuneration system) that only later will
     materialize in the final expected actions.
     Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
     financial support.
     Since 2007 the supervision of the overall PARL program is conducted within the context of joint donor support
     reviews agreed with Government twice a year. The amount of the operation is communicated to Government
     appropriately for its budget planning needs. In addition, certain areas may benefit from additional progress
     review. For example, the Bank has launched a dedicated technical assistance activity on e-governance which
     has objectives that complement those of the PARL. Over time, this will allow for even more timely and in-
     depth progress reviews.


C.         IMPLEMETATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

134.    The responsibility for implementing the program rests with the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Sector Modernization. Building on the positive
experience accumulated over the course of the previous three PARL operations, the Government
continues to take the lead in monitoring progress in implementation. The Ministry of Economy and
Finance is coordinating inputs from all the relevant ministries. The Bank staff in the field will continue to
maintain dialogue with the key counterparts and the relevant sector ministries and will conduct periodic
reviews with the other partners in the context of the joint donor missions on public administration reform
to assess progress in implementation of the program supported by this operation as well as of the broader

                                                           37
reform agenda pursued by the Government. In this context, dialogue and joint reviews will continue to
focus on the outcomes of the program and eventual adjustments that may be necessary in order to take
into account the latest country developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for realizing the
intended development goals. Consequently, specific attention will be devoted to monitoring indicators
and goals of the program.

D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

135.    No major fiduciary issues are expected for the proposed DPL. The Moroccan public
administration operates in a structured and reliable control environment, with uniform public accounting
rules and procedures.
136.    Financial Management Diagnostics and Risk Rating: In response to the government request,
the Bank issued a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) update in 2007 following the
first CFAA of 2003. Like the first one, the CFAA update assessed the Moroccan public sector fiduciary
risks as low. Morocco's public finance system is governed by a well-developed legal and regulatory
framework, and generally is adequate in terms of reliability and transparency. This system is predicated
on the principle of the strict separation of the roles of payment authorizer (ordonnateur) and public
accountant, who are financially responsible to the Audit Office, and on the principles governing ex ante
expenditure control and internal and external audits. The rating is due in large part to the steady and
continued Government efforts and major reforms to modernize and improve the efficiency of the public
sector including the public financial management of the past several years. These reforms are still
ongoing.
137.    The CFAA update recommended improvements in a number of areas; including (a) reducing
the delays to produce the year end government financial statements and accounts and the audited accounts
by the Court of Accounts; (b) further simplification of the a priori internal controls while continuing the
strengthening of the ex-post controls and internal audit already underway; and (c) continuing the progress
in the Management Information System (GID). As described earlier in the document, public financial
management reforms to further enhance the efficiency of the system remain central to the government
reform program, CFAA recommendations have been integrated in the agenda and progress in
implementation has taken place.
138.     Funds Flow. Morocco has had no safeguards assessment by the IMF. However, over the many
years of working with the Moroccan government, the Bank has had no major fiduciary issues in relation
to the funds flow. The Government budget is comprehensive, unified and subject to centralized treasury
account. Cash flow and debt are professionally managed by the Treasury Department of the Ministry of
Finance under generally satisfactory conditions. Loan proceeds are deposited in a government designated
account at the Central Bank and transferred to the Treasury single account for government budget.

E.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

139.    The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for Development Policy
Loans and will be disbursed in one installment. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in a single
tranche in the amount equivalent to 100 million dollars upon loan effectiveness. Hence, once the loan is
approved by the Board and is declared effective, loan proceeds will be deposited by IBRD in an account
designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the Central Bank of Morocco (Bank Al
Maghrib). The Borrower should ensure that upon deposit of the Loan proceeds into said account an
equivalent amount is credited in the Borrower's budget. The loan proceeds will be administered by the
MEF.
140.    Although an audit of the use of the funds may not be required, IBRD reserves the right to
require audits of the deposit account at any time.


                                                    38
F.       RISK AND RISK MITIGATION

141.    While the broad PARAP reform is progressing, challenges may lie ahead for the
Government to be able to complete its efforts. As international experience has shown, public sector
and budget reforms are inevitably a long and complex process. It is therefore not surprising that, while
Morocco has embarked on this process since 2002, with undeniable accomplishments, there is still an
agenda ahead. Consequently the reform process is confronted with potential reform fatigue that might
hamper the final consolidation of the efforts made to date particularly with regards to the complexities
and political economy issues associated with the future steps necessary to complete the HR reform
process. Perhaps more importantly, however, the key challenges ahead rest on the ability of the
government to complete the design of and then implement three key components of the PARAP: the
budget organic law and public administration de-concentration so as to ensure that the long reform
process can finally lead to concrete impacts on the ground. In this regard the need for enhanced inter
ministerial coordination will be a key challenge to address. While the Government has maintained its
commitment to the PARAP agenda, the Bank will continue to support this process in close coordination
with other donors with the appropriate mix of AAA, TA and operational instruments as appropriate. In
the short run the P-ESW and the recently launched PER will be the key analytical and technical assistance
components of Bank support. A new PARL series is tentatively envisaged to support the next phase of
the reform process in alignment with other donors' programmatic support. In addition following the
approach proposed by the new CPS, PARAP and governance reform at large will be further mainstreamed
in the current pipeline of sector DPLs under preparation (e.g. Health and Education) thereby reinforcing
mainstreaming of reforms in sectors and fostering enhanced inter ministerial coordination. Finally recent
new Ministers' appointments13 are widely perceived as an additional indication of commitment to key
reforms and enhanced inter ministerial collaboration particularly in fostering the public sector
modernization, justice and regionalization reform agenda.
142.     In the short term, Morocco is confronted with uncertainties on the timing, speed and shape
of the recovery process from the global crisis. While there are encouraging signs of a possible end to
the crisis, it is too early to predict how the global economy will emerge from the recession particularly in
the EU, the key international partner for Morocco. Consequently, it is not yet clear to what extent
Morocco's economy will continue to be confronted with the impact of the economic slowdown on its
exports, remittances, ability to attract FDI and sustainability of its public stimulus program. The
associated economic risks can be partly mitigated through continued strong macroeconomic management
and Morocco's track record suggests that it is well placed to face the uncertainties of the current situation.
The Bank will help mitigate this risk through continued monitoring and dialogue with the authorities on
the overall macroeconomic context, as well as analysis of options for remedial measures as eventually
requested by the Government.
143.    In the medium term, Morocco's overall outlook is positive but predicated on the
effectiveness of the set of reforms currently under way in several sectors. As detailed earlier,
Morocco's growth prospects are predicated on the successful implementation of a host of reforms
currently under way that should lead to an increased economic competitiveness of the economy both at
home and abroad. Should the current reform efforts take longer than anticipated, it is uncertain if the
current economic structure can sustain the pre-crisis economic growth performance in the medium term.
This potential risk is mitigated by Government's strong commitment to proceed with the envisaged
reforms as well as the Bank engagement in several domains of intervention such as financial sector
reform, energy reform, business climate improvement, agricultural and water sector reform.
144.    Morocco remains vulnerable to drought, adverse climate changes and fluctuations in energy
prices. The dependency of Morocco agriculture on rain-fed yields, particularly for poor and vulnerable

farmers, coupled with increased water scarcity and adverse evolution of climate changes in the medium
and long run pose serious social and economic concerns. The Government is increasingly aware of the
situation and has devoted considerable efforts that would lead to an integrated strategy to address climate
change issues. The new strategy addressing the impact of global warming as well as the strategy for
agriculture (Plan Maroc Vert) are key contributions to foster this agenda. The Bank will continue to
support such efforts as the entire third pillar of the new CPS is devoted to the challenge of climate change
and sustainable development. Regarding energy prices the current reflection on the reform of subsidy
system and of energy tariffs will provide the basis for mitigating the risks associated with international
price fluctuations.

ROYAUME DU MAROC
NOI 1632/E

                                       MONSIEUR LE PRESIDENT DE
                                         LA BANQUE MONDIALE
                              1818 H Street N.W Washington D.C 20433
                                                 -U.S.A-

OBJET : Lettre de politique de développement relative à la stratégie de réforme de
          l'administration publique.
REFER :     Ma lettre n° 2693/E du 08 avril 2008


           Monsieur le Président,


J'ai l'honneur de vous faire part ci-après des principales actions et mesures prises par
le gouvernement pour la réforme de l'administration publique qui constitue l'une des
priorités inscrites dans le cadre de son programme présenté devant le Parlement en
2007 avec l'appui technique et financier de la Banque Mondiale, de l'Union Européenne
et de la Banque Africaine de Développement ainsi que des orientations générales devant
présider au plan d'actions afférent à ladite réforme au cours des années prochaines.


Les principaux objectifs poursuivis à travers ladite réforme se présentent comme suit :


      disposer d'une administration moderne qui puisse contribuer à renforcer la
           compétitivité de l'économie nationale et le développement durable du pays;

      améliorer la qualité des prestations de l'administration à travers la mise en place
           d'une    gestion    de   proximité,     l'approfondissement    du    processus    de
           déconcentration comme base à la régionalisation avancée, la maîtrise des coûts et
           la recherche de la performance de l'action publique ;

      simplifier       les    procédures    administratives   et   développer   l'administration
           électronique en vue d'améliorer les services publics rendus et d'assurer l'intégrité
           et la transparence dans les relations entre l'administration et les usagers.

I- Bilan des réalisations
Depuis son le lancement, la mise en oeuvre du programme de réforme de l'administration
publique a enregistré des avancées notables au niveau de ses différents axes. Il s'agit
notamment de :



                                                   58
1.      L'amélioration de l'efficacité de l'administration dans la gestion des ressources
        budgétaires à travers :


        l'institution de la programmation budgétaire pluriannuelle par la mise en place d'un
Cadre de Dépenses à Moyen Terme triennal glissant (CDMT). Ce nouveau dispositif
budgétaire vise     à assurer une meilleure prédictibilité et flexibilité dans l'allocation des
ressources publiques et une meilleure visibilité sur l'évolution des dépenses publiques et
leur compatibilité avec l'objectif de maîtrise du déficit budgétaire. Dans ce cadre, les
étapes suivantes ont été réalisées :
         l'élaboration d'un guide méthodologique de préparation du CDMT par une
           commission interministérielle et son test par des départements pilotes;
         la diffusion dudit guide à l'ensemble des départements ministériels par circulaire
           de Monsieur le Premier Ministre ;
         l'organisation d'une journée sur la thématique du CDMT au profit de l'ensemble
           des départements ministériels en vue de leur permettre de s'approprier la
           méthodologie retenue pour l'élaboration dudit cadre.
Ainsi et à ce jour, 10 départements ministériels ont élaboré leurs CDMT sectoriels et 5
autres départements ministériels ont entamé l'élaboration de leurs CDMT avec l'appui d'un
bureau d'études dans le cadre d'une opération de renforcement des capacités financée par
un don IDF de la Banque Mondiale.
        Le déploiement du dispositif de globalisation des crédits qui constitue un axe
majeur dans la mise en place d'une gestion axée sur les résultats, la recherche de la
performance et la reddition des comptes. Ce dispositif vise notamment l'octroi d'une plus
grande autonomie aux gestionnaires dans l'utilisation de leurs dotations budgétaires en
contrepartie de la réalisation de leur engagement à atteindre des objectifs prédéfinis
mesurés par des indicateurs de performance et à rendre compte des progrès réalisés au
regard des moyens utilisés.
Les efforts menés dans ce cadre ont permis, à fin 2009, de généraliser le dispositif de
globalisation des crédits à l'ensemble des départements ministériels éligibles. En outre, un
recueil des indicateurs de performance est établi annuellement et accompagne les projets
de budgets sectoriels transmis au Parlement.
        le renforcement de la déconcentration administrative
Il s'agit en particulier de développer une véritable gestion de proximité et de rapprocher
l'administration de ses usagers à travers la révision de l'organisation des structures
administratives et en réhabilitant le rôle des services déconcentrés dans la mise en
oeuvre des politiques publiques. Les efforts déployés dans ce cadre portent notamment
sur :




                                                 59
      la publication du décret n°2-05-1369 du 2 décembre 2005 fixant les règles
         d'organisation    des    départements      ministériels   et    de   la    déconcentration
         administrative dont que la mise en oeuvre est de nature à renforcer la
         déconcentration et conforter le dispositif de contractualisation des relations entre
         les administrations centrales et leurs services déconcentrés. De même, le décret
         précité a prévu l'élaboration par les départements ministériels des schémas
         directeurs       de     déconcentration        administrative        qui     comprennent
         notamment les attributions à transférer aux services déconcentrés, les moyens
         humains, matériels et financiers alloués aux services déconcentrés et les
         mesures et délais nécessaires à la réalisation desdits schémas.

      La mise en oeuvre du dispositif de contractualisation des relations entre les
         administrations centrales et leurs services déconcentrés notamment dans les
         secteurs de la Santé (06 contrats), de l'Enseignement Supérieur (17 contrats) et de
         l'Agriculture (16 contrats).


     La réforme du contrôle de la dépense publique visant à conférer plus de souplesse,
de fluidité et d'efficacité aux dépenses publiques. A ce titre, les principales étapes
réalisées portent sur :
      la fusion, à partir du début de l'année 2006,                     du Contrôle Général des
         Engagements de Dépenses de l'Etat et de la Trésorerie Générale du Royaume en
         vue d'assurer un nouveau partage des responsabilités entre les différents acteurs
         de la dépense publique et de raccourcir le circuit du contrôle et d'en réduire le
         coût ;
      la publication du décret n°2-07-1235 (4 novembre 2008) relatif au contrôle des
         dépenses de l'Etat qui vise l'institution d'un nouveau mode de contrôle qui
         permet de moduler le niveau et l'intensité du contrôle de la dépense publique en
         fonction de la capacité de gestion de chaque ordonnateur. L'adhésion de
         l'ensemble des ordonnateurs audit contrôle modulé est prévue à l'horizon 2012 ;
      l'organisation des journées de sensibilisation et des sessions de formation au
         profit des acteurs de la dépenses publiques en vue de mener à bien la mise en
         place du contrôle modulé de la dépense ;
      le renforcement des capacités des ordonnateurs à travers la mise en place d'un
         Forum de performance regroupant les représentants de plusieurs ordonnateurs
         dans le but de mutualiser les bonnes pratiques ministérielles en matière de
         gestion budgétaire et de dépenses publiques.
     La mise en oeuvre de l'audit de performance à travers la réalisation des missions
d'audit conjointe entre l'Inspection Générale des Finances (IGF) et les                 Inspections
Générales des Ministères (IGM).



                                                   60
Les efforts déployés dans ce cadre portent notamment sur :
      l'élaboration d'un manuel d'audit de performance conforme aux normes et à la
           pratique internationale en matière d'audit et adapté au contexte de la législation
           et de la réglementation marocaines ;
      la réalisation des actions de formation sur l'audit de performance sur la base
           dudit manuel au profit des inspecteurs de l'IGF et des IGM ;
      la réalisation des missions d'audit de performance conjointes entre l'IGF et les
           IGM qui ont couvert 22 départements ministériels et ont porté sur les exercices
           2007 et 2008. Ces missions ont fait l'objet d'élaboration d'un rapport de
           synthèse qui résume les principales constatations et recommandations des
           rapports des auditeurs concernant les 22 départements précités.
     La mise oeuvre      du Système de Gestion Intégrée des Dépenses (GID) qui vise la
simplification des procédures pour une meilleure fluidité dans l'exécution de la dépense
publique et le respect les délais impartis pour l'élaboration des projets de lois de
règlement. L'année 2009 a été marquée par la mise en ligne du premier palier du
système GID qui couvre un périmètre à forte valeur ajoutée pour les différents
intervenants dans le circuit de la dépense publique. L'accès aux services offerts par ce
premier palier a bénéficié dans un premier temps à onze ordonnateurs pilotes et leurs
sous-ordonnateurs respectifs ainsi qu'à la Direction du Budget et les Trésorerie
Ministérielles auprès desdits départements pilotes;
     Le lancement des travaux de réflexion sur la réforme de la loi organique relative à la
loi de finances qui vise la consolidation des acquis en matière de réforme budgétaire
et la consécration des principes de la nouvelle approche budgétaire axée sur les
résultats, la recherche de la performance et la reddition des comptes. Dans le cadre de ces
travaux, une plateforme       pour la réforme qui arrête les différentes thématiques à
traiter a été préparée. Lesdites thématiques ont fait l'objet chacune de rapports détaillés.
2.   L'amélioration      de    l'efficacité   de        l'administration   publique   dans     la
     gestion des ressources humaines:
     la généralisation de la gestion prévisionnelle des emplois et des compétences à
travers:
      la mise en oeuvre des référentiels des emplois et des compétences (REC) outils
           privilégiés pour assurer une visibilité à court et à moyen termes en matière de
           ressources humaines et permettre la délimitation qualitative et quantitative des
           besoins en emplois. Ainsi, à fin 2009, 25 départements ont achevé leur REC.
      L'élaboration du guide méthodologique de la GPEEC et sa diffusion auprès des
           administrations au niveau central et déconcentré
      la mise en oeuvre de systèmes d'information dédiés à la gestion des ressources
           humaines;



                                                   61
       la modernisation des outils de gestion des ressources humaines à travers la
           mobilisation des fonds d'appui financiers.
A cet effet, le Fonds de Modernisation de l'Administration Publique (FOMAP), institué par la loi
de Finances 2005 a contribué au financement de 53 projets proposés par les différents
départements ministériels et afférents aux opérations de modernisation de l'administration
publique, portant essentiellement sur l'élaboration des référentiels des emplois et des
compétences, la gestion prévisionnelle des effectifs, des emplois et des compétences (GPEEC) et
le développement de l'administration électronique.
      L'institutionnalisation de la formation continue au sein des administrations publiques
et qui constitue, aujourd'hui, le principal instrument permettant de combler les écarts
dégagés par les cartographies des emplois et partant sur la différence entre les profils
existants dans chaque entité et les compétences requises pour assurer les nouvelles
missions de l'administration. Ainsi, la stratégie nationale de la formation continue des
fonctionnaires et agents de l'Etat a été publiée en décembre 2009 et constituera la base de
l'élaboration des plans sectoriels de formation continue au niveau de tous les
départements ministériels.
      La réalisation de l'étude sur la classification des emplois dans une nomenclature
commune        qui vise à classer tous les emplois civils de l'administration dans une
nomenclature commune, afin de mieux ajuster les ressources humaines aux besoins en
emplois. Cette étude, achevée en 2009, permettra de promouvoir le mérite et de faciliter
l'harmonisation et le regroupement des statuts, la mobilité et le redéploiement des
fonctionnaires ainsi que la mise en place d'un système de rémunération équitable et
transparent. A ce titre, des séminaires sur l'ingénierie de l'évaluation des emplois et leur
classification ont été organisés avec la contribution des experts internationaux en vue
d'initier les responsables de la GRH aux techniques de la classification.
      Le lancement       de l'étude portant sur la conception d'un nouveau système de
rémunération fondé sur la nouvelle classification des emplois dans une nomenclature
commune. Cette étude vise la mise en place d'un nouveau système de rémunération
motivant, équitable et transparent, valorisant le mérite, la performance des agents et
l'effort   réellement   fourni   pour   atteindre   les   résultats   préalablement   définis   par
l'administration. La première phase de cette étude relative au diagnostic et analyse de
l'existant et la deuxième phase concernant l'ajustement technique sans surcoût pour la
masse salariale ont été validées par le comité de pilotage. Les travaux de la 3ème phase
relative au développement du scénario retenu pour un nouveau système de rémunération
ont démarré.
3. La maîtrise de l'évolution de la masse salariale
Les principales mesures réalisées dans ce cadre portent sur:
       la réalisation d'une opération de départ volontaire des fonctionnaires civils qui a
           bénéficié à près de 39.000 fonctionnaires dont 69% ont plus de 50 ans. Cette
           opération qui a fait l'objet d'une évaluation, a permis la réduction de 7,6% des

                                                    62
         effectifs de la fonction publique, le gain de plus de 1 point de la part de la
         masse salariale dans le PIB, le reprofilage qualitatif de la fonction publique et
         l'amélioration de son niveau d'encadrement ainsi que son rajeunissement ;
      l'interdiction de recrutement dans les échelles 1 à 4 tout en procédant à la
         titularisation du personnel occasionnel et le recours à l'externalisation de
         certaines tâches exercées par cette catégorie de personnel ;
      la limitation des recrutements dans la fonction publique au strict besoin
         nécessaire des secteurs prioritaires,         notamment, l'Education, la Santé et la
         Sécurité ;
      la suppression des postes devenus vacants suite au départ à la retraite pour
         limite d'âge ;
      la diffusion mensuelle par le ministère de l'Economie et des Finances d'un
         rapport sur l'évolution de la masse salariale ;
      les travaux réalisés au sein de la commission de suivi de la masse salariale
         regroupant cinq départements pilotes qui ont permis de généraliser les
         meilleures pratiques de gestion des postes budgétaires à l'ensemble des
         départements ministériels (circulaire n° 189 du 30 novembre 2009) dont en
         particulier :
               l'appropriation de la méthodologie de prévision de la masse salariale ;
                la maîtrise des délais dans la préparation des tableaux des effectifs
               budgétaires en vue de les mettre à la disposition des ordonnateurs dès le
               mois de janvier de chaque année ;
               la suppression des postes vacants non utilisés qui devrait permettre aux
               ordonnateurs de mieux gérer les effectifs budgétaires et par conséquent
               contribuer à la maîtrise de la masse salariale en prévisions et en
               réalisations. Cette mesure a été adoptée dans le cadre de la loi de finances
               pour l'année 2010.


Ainsi, les efforts déployés dans ce cadre ont permis de réduire le poids de la masse
salariale par rapport au PIB pour passer de 11,8% en 2005 à 10,3% en 2009 et de
réduire son poids dans le total des dépenses du Budget Général de près de 49% en 2005 à
40% en 2009.

SUBJECT: Letter of Development Policy on the public administration reform strategy.

REF TO: Letter No. 2693/E, dated April 8, 2008

Mr. President,

It is my honor to share with you the following key actions and decisions taken by the government to
reform the public administration which constitutes one of the priorities under the Government program,
presented to Parliament in 2007, with technical and financial support from the World Bank, the European
Union and the African Development Bank, as well as the action plan's general directions to be addressed
under this reform in the coming years.

The main objectives of the reform are the following:

       Building a modern administration that can help strengthen the competitiveness of the national
       economy and the country's sustainable development;
       Improving the quality of services provided by the administration by strengthening local
       management, pursuing the de-concentration process as a basis for advanced regionalization,
       controlling costs and seeking public policy performance;
       Simplifying administrative procedures and developing e-government to improve the provision
       of public services to ensure integrity and the transparency of interactions between the
       administration and the end-users.
I-Summary of achievements

Since the beginning of its implementation, the reform program has achieved significant improvements in
key areas. These include:

1.    Improved administration efficiency in managing budgetary resources through the following:

    Implementing the multiyear budget programming by setting up a rolling three-year Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The new budgetary framework seeks to ensure greater


                                                   66
predictability and flexibility in allocating public resources and a greater visibility on trends in public
spending and its compatibility with the objective of controlling the budget deficit. In this context, the
following steps were taken:
       Developing a methodological guide to prepare the MTEF by an interdepartmental commission
       and testing the guide in pilot Departments;
       Disseminating that guide to all government Departments through a Circular signed by the
       Prime Minister;
       Organizing a one-day event on the MTEF for all Ministerial Departments to allow them to take
       on board the methodology chosen to prepare the framework.

So far, 10 Ministerial Departments have developed their MTEF and 5 other Ministerial Departments have
begun preparing their MTEF with the support of a consultancy firm as part of a capacity building IDF
grant from the World Bank.

 The deployment of the credit globalization system constitutes a major axe in implementing results-
based management, improving performance and accountability. This system grants a greater autonomy to
managers in using their budgetary allocations in return for carrying out their commitment to achieve
predefined objectives measured by performance indicators, and to report achievements of the resources
utilized.

Efforts in this context led, in late 2009, to the generalization of the credit globalization system to all
eligible Ministerial Departments. In addition, a collection of performance indicators is established
annually and accompanies the draft sector budgets submitted to Parliament.

      Strengthening administrative decentralization

This relates in particular to developing local management and to bringing the government closer to its
users by reassessing administrative structures and by restoring the role of de-concentrated services in the
implementation of public policies. Efforts made within this framework include:

       The publication of Decree No. 2-05-1369 of December 2, 2005 laying down the rules for the
       organization of Ministerial Departments and administrative de-concentration for which the
       implementation is likely to strengthen both decentralization and the system of
       contractualization between central and decentralized services. The Decree also provides for the
       development by Ministerial Departments of administrative de-concentration schemes which
       include the powers to be transferred to de-concentrated services, human resources, material and
       financial resources allocated to de-concentrated services, as well as the actions and time
       required to carry out such schemes.
       Implementing the contractualization scheme between central and de-concentrated services,
       particularly in the sectors of Health (06 contracts), Higher Education (17 contracts) and
       Agriculture (16 contracts).

       Reforming the control of public expenditure which targets better flexibility, fluidity and
efficiency of public expenditure. In this regard, the main steps undertaken include:



                                                    67
       The merging, in early 2006, of the CGED (Organization responsible for the auditing of the
       Government's expenditures) and the General Treasury with the aim of providing a new
       distribution of responsibilities between the various public expenditure stakeholders and to
       shorten the audit circuit while reducing costs;
       Publication of Decree No. 2-07-1235 (November 4, 2008) on controlling government
       expenditure to establish a new control method able to adjust the level and intensity of public
       expenditure control according to the power of each officer. All audit control officers are
       scheduled to be covered by 2012;
       Organizing awareness events and training sessions for key spenders in order to complete the
       implementation of the adjusted control of expenditures;
       Capacity building of officers by establishing a Performance Forum comprising representatives
       of several tax agents with the goal of pooling best ministerial practices in budget management
       and public expenditure.
      Implementing of performance audits through carrying out joint audit missions between the
Inspection Générale des Finances (IGF) and the Inspections Générales des Ministères (IGM).

Efforts deployed in this framework include:
       Elaboration of a manual for performance audit standards guide consistent with international
       practices in auditing and adapted to the context of Moroccan legislation and regulations;
       Implementation of training sessions on performance audit on the basis of the above mentioned
       guide intended for IGF and IGM agents;
       Carrying out joint performance audit missions between the IGF and the IGM - which have
       covered 22 Ministerial Departments for FY 2007 and FY 2008. These missions have produced
       a report summarizing the main findings and recommendations for the 22 Departments
       mentioned above.

      Implementation of the Integrated Expenditure Management System which aims to simplify
procedures for a greater fluidity in the execution of public expenditure and meeting deadlines for drafting
regulations. In 2009, the first step of the Integrated Expense Management System was made available
online, covering a high value added area for the various stakeholders in the public expenditure system.
Access to services provided by this first step has benefited initially eleven pilot officers and their
respective sub-officers, as well as the Budget and Treasury Departments with those pilot Departments;

      Reflecting on reforming the Organic Law on the Budget Bill - Aims to consolidate the
knowledge acquired in budget reform, and the consecration of the new results-based budget approach, the
quest for performance and accountability. As part of this work, a reform platform to decide upon various
topics to be addressed was prepared. These themes have been assessed in separate detailed reports.

2.    Improved public administration efficiency in managing human resources:

      Generalizing the jobs and skills projection management by:
       Implementing jobs and skills repositories - a preferred tool to ensure visibility of human
       resources in the short and medium terms and to allow qualitative and quantitative staffing
       needs. As of late 2009, 25 Departments completed their jobs and skills repositories.

                                                    68
       Preparation of GPEEC's methodology guide and its dissemination to central and de-
       concentrated governments.
       Implementation of information systems dedicated to the management of human resources;
       Upgrading of human resources tools by mobilizing support funds.
To this end, the Fund for the Modernization of Public Administration (FOMAP), established by the
Finance Act of 2005, helped finance 53 projects submitted by various Departments and bodies implicated
in the modernizing of the public administration, pertaining mainly to the development of jobs and skills
repositories, workforce planning, employment and skills (GPEEC) and e-government development.

       Institutionalizing continuous training within public administrations is now the main instrument to
bridge the gaps identified by job mapping tools and findings on the difference between the existing
profiles in each entity, and the skills required to ensure the government's new tasks. Thus, the national
strategy of continuous training of government officials and agents was published in December 2009 and
will form the basis for the development of continuous training sector plans for all Ministerial
Departments.

      The completion of the job classification study in a common nomenclature aims at ranking all
civil servant positions in a common nomenclature to better adjust the staffing levels. This study,
completed in 2009, will help promote merit while fostering harmonization and consolidation of status,
mobility and redeployment of civil servants while ensuring a fair and transparent pay system. As such,
seminars on job evaluation and classification techniques were organized with inputs from international
experts to introduce classification techniques to the HRM.

       Launching a study to design a new pay system based on the new job classification in a common
nomenclature. This study aims to establish a new motivating, fair and transparent pay system - rewarding
merit, worker performance and actual efforts undertaken to achieve previously defined outcomes. The
first phase of this study deals with the diagnosis and assessment of the current context. The second phase
relating to the technical adjustment without additional cost for payroll has been validated by the steering
committee. Tasks included in the 3rd phase on scenario development for a new pay system have started.

3. Payroll evolution controls

The main actions completed in this framework include:
       Voluntary retirement of civil servants has benefited to nearly 39,000 employees of which 69%
       were over 50 years. This action which was audited, has allowed a reduction of 7.6% of civil
       servants - a saving of more than 1 percentage point of GDP point from the payroll - the
       reshaping of the qualitative public service and the improvement of supervision and rejuvenation
       levels;
       Prohibiting recruitment of people in the pay scales of 1 to 4 while changing temporary
       employees' status to permanent and outsourcing specific tasks usually performed by this
       personnel;
       Limiting public service recruitment to the strict minimum requirements in priority sectors,
       including Education, Health and Security ;
       Cancelling positions that become vacant due to following the retirement age limit retirements;

                                                    69
          Monthly publication by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of a report on the evolution of
          payroll;
          Work within the Monitoring Committee of the payroll Department consisting of five pilot
          Departments which have been successful in disseminating the best management practice of
          budget posts in all Departments (Circular letter No. 189, November 30, 2009) including:
                  ownership of the payroll forecasting methodology;
                   reducing delays in preparing actual staff posts tables to deliver it to officers every
                  January;
                  cutting unused vacancies - enabling officers to better manage the job posts and thus help
                  control payroll in both projections and achievements. This action was adopted under the
                  2010 Budget Law.

Thus, efforts made on this front helped reducing the payroll volume as compared to the GDP - going from
11.8% in 2005 to 10.3% in 2009 and to reduce its volume in the total general budget expenditure from
nearly 49% in 2005 to 40% in 2009.

3. Procedures simplification and e-government:

The main activities carried out under this area include:
          Developing the 2009-2012 National Strategic Plan for Information Technology and
          Communication, which aims at making telecommunications a competitiveness factor while
          creating added value for companies - hence encouraging the government to become
          increasingly open and transparent;
          Publication of Decree No. 2.08.444 of 5/21/09 establishing the National Council of Information
          Technology and the Digital Economy responsible for coordinating and overseeing national
          policies in this area;
          Dissemination of the Prime Minister's circular letter No. 17/2009 of 10/21/09 on the creation of
          the Interdepartmental Committee for e-government and sector committees in charge of e-
          government projects.
          Extension of the public procurement portal to more than 30% of state controlled public entities
          and to the totality of Local Communes. The action plan to submit tenders online that will be
          operational by the end of 2010 has been completed.
II.      Key directions

The main orientation for the public administration reform for the year 2010 and subsequent years aim at
accelerating and further improving the knowledge acquired and revolve around the three following areas:

1 ­ Consolidation of the various budget reform actions in the context of the Budget Organic Law
overhaul by continuing to reflect in 2010 on the topics mentioned below before achieving the preparation
of a draft law to be submitted to Parliament:

          Performance dealing with aspects of multi-annual programming and results-oriented budget
          management.

                                                     70
       Accountability: particularly on raising the awareness of managers on their responsibilities
       regarding the objectives measured with performance indicators, the flexibility of credit granting
       management procedures, generalization of the contract-agreement approach, transfer of
       workforce management and personnel credits to the officers to which they belong;

       Transparency particularly on aspects related to improving the structure of the Government's
       budget and its presentation, enhancing the information quality destines to the members of
       Parliament, to the rules to be introduced into the Budget Organic Law to strengthen public
       finances sustainability, presentation and voting schedule for the Budget Law, timely submission
       and voting of the supplementary budget law and settlement Act.

       Accompanying measures to achieve appropriation and implementation of the reform.

2 - Strengthening administrative de-concentration as a basis for advanced regionalization. The
objectives pursued in this area include:

           -   Developing local management by establishing the necessary conditions to that effect;
           -   Ensuring a better convergence of actions at the territorial level by coordinating local level
               interventions of the various stakeholders;
           -   Developing synergies at the local level through public-private partnerships;
           -   Establishing good governance at the territorial level by clearly defining the
               responsibilities of the various local-level stakeholders.

3 - Development of e-government is a key factor to improve the quality of services provided to users
and to provide a better access at a lower cost to public services.

Thank you for your support in achieving this major reform of the Moroccan public administration
program. Yours faithfully,

 IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Morocco

On January, 25, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Morocco.14

Background

Morocco's strong starting position, reflecting macroeconomic and structural reforms introduced over the
last decade, has given Morocco greater room for maneuver in its policy response. The direct impact of
the global crisis on Morocco has been limited, primarily affecting Morocco through real channels.
Exports, tourism receipts, remittances, and foreign direct investment (FDI) have all declined this year, due
primarily to the slowdown in Europe, although most recent data suggest that some flows are gradually
improving. In particular, Morocco has low public debt and low inflation, and the financial system is
sound, with little exposure to international markets. In this setting, domestic demand has been resilient.
Moreover, Morocco is benefitting from an exceptional cereal harvest. As a result, overall gross domestic
product (GDP) growth in 2009 is projected at around 5 percent.

The authorities responded quickly to the unfolding crisis and have been successful in maintaining
confidence. In particular, the fiscal balance will shift from a small surplus in 2008 to a deficit of about 2½
percent of GDP in 2009 as the authorities proceed with already-planned fiscal reforms, a boost in public
investment, and targeted support to key sectors. A drop in revenue, partly due to already planned fiscal
reforms, was offset to a degree by a fall in subsidies due to lower world commodity prices. With
inflationary pressures low, the central bank--Bank Al-Maghrib--likewise lowered its key policy rate by
25 basis points, and, to boost liquidity, gradually reduced reserve requirements from 15 to 8 percent in
2009. The stock market remains well below its highs in early-2008, but the fall in 2009 has been
moderate. Continued sizable support from Morocco's external partners has also served as a source of
resilience.

   Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

In the financial sector, the rapid credit growth in recent years is expected to lead to a moderate increase in
nonperforming loans (NPLs) and thus continued vigilance is needed. Credit growth has averaged 23
percent per year over the 2006­08 period, slowing to about 12 percent growth in 2009. At the same time,
the share of NPLs to total loans has fallen sharply over the last five years. The real estate sector, which in
some cities has seen a correction after a run-up in recent years, is a specific concern, although NPLs in the
sector remain low and provisioning is high. The authorities continue to take steps to improve monitoring
of the financial sector, including establishing a credit bureau, and planning to fully implement Basel II
recommendations and raise the capital adequacy ratio to 12 percent for certain banking institutions, based
on their risk profile.

The peg to the basket has served Morocco well. Staff analysis suggests that the exchange rate is broadly
in line with its fundamentals. Other indicators, such as current account developments and movements in
price-based indicators, point to a mild appreciation of the real exchange rate in 2009.

The authorities are deepening structural reforms to increase productivity, boost growth and improve social
indicators, including reducing youth unemployment, which remains high. The authorities continue
liberalizing trade and simplifying the tax regime and plan to reform the justice system, increase
infrastructure investment, and strengthen support for industry, tourism, and energy. In addition, the Plan
Vert ("Green Plan"), which aims to increase productivity in the agricultural sector, is moving ahead and
more recently the government launched a similar effort to expand the country's fishing sector. A number
of reform efforts are underway in the education and health sectors, the success of which will be a key
element of improving living standards and boosting Morocco's potential growth while reducing
unemployment.

The authorities plan to continue publishing all documents relating to the Article IV consultation.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors observed that Morocco faced the global crisis from a strong position, reflecting in
large part the range of macroeconomic and structural reforms introduced over the last decade, and was
well-positioned to respond to and weather the crisis. Directors also noted that Morocco's financial system
is sound, with limited exposure to international capital markets. Thus, the direct impact of the global
crisis on Morocco has been mild, with the economy being affected mainly through real channels as a
result of the slowdown in Europe.

Directors commended the authorities' response to the worsened global outlook. A moderate loosening of
fiscal and monetary policies, coupled with vigilant financial sector supervision, has supported confidence
and domestic demand, while containing risks. These policies, together with an exceptional cereal crop,
contributed to strong real GDP growth in 2009.

Directors stressed that the challenge for 2010 will be to continue efforts to sustain economic activity in
the face of a weak external environment. They supported the authorities' plan for a further temporary
widening of the fiscal deficit, with spending increases focused appropriately on capital rather than current
spending.

Directors stressed that maintaining macroeconomic stability through sound fiscal policy--a notable
achievement of recent years--will remain critical. They welcomed the authorities' commitment to return
to fiscal consolidation, which will be phased in gradually starting in 2011. This will be important to

                                                     73
stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio, preserve low borrowing costs in the economy, and facilitate the
implementation of monetary policy. Replacing the universal subsidy system gradually with a system
targeting vulnerable populations would improve efficiency and reduce fiscal risks.

Directors noted that the strong bank credit growth of recent years has moderated. However, they
cautioned that, after a sharp fall in recent years, nonperforming loans are likely to pick up somewhat
given the economic slowdown. The authorities should remain vigilant and continue to pay close attention
to the capital requirements of the banking system. Directors also welcomed the continuing
implementation of Basel II.

Directors agreed that the current pegged exchange rate regime has served Morocco well. Many Directors
considered that the authorities' medium-term objective to move to a more flexible monetary and exchange
rate regime could help the economy to adapt better to changes in the international environment. They
considered that prerequisites for a move to inflation targeting are largely in place; the risk of imported
inflation is now much less; and balance sheets in the economy have little exposure to exchange rate
movements. However, many other Directors considered that the timing of a move to a more flexible
monetary and exchange rate policy should be carefully assessed, and they supported the authorities'
caution in this regard.

Directors stressed that continued structural reforms remain critical to boost growth, enhance
competitiveness, and help improve Morocco's social indicators. The authorities should push forward with
the ongoing and planned reforms, including improving the efficiency and composition of public spending
and further simplifying the tax and trade regimes. Directors welcomed the envisaged structural reforms to
increase productivity by improving the business environment and raising capital investment.
Strengthening social services will be critical to reducing poverty and addressing the persistent problem of
youth unemployment.

 Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views
 and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned,
 PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its
 surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of
 member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
 discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r -  (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

(1) The two main shocks are A1. Key variables are at their historical averages; and A2. No policy change (constant primary balance).

(2) The other shocks are: B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations; B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half
standard deviation; B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation; B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter
standard deviation shocks; B5. One-off 30 percent real depreciation in 2010; B6. Increase in "other debt-creating flows" in 2010 of 10
percent of GDP. Standard deviations for B1 and B2-B6 are calculated over the last ten years, while for B2, "GDP shock", it is calculated
