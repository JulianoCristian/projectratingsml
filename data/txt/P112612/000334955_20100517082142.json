of programmatic loans designed\n            to support the implementation of the Government's\n            public administration reform support program (PARAP) whose\n            objectives are fully shared. The objectives of the series\n            aim at: (a) improving Government efficiency in the\n            management of budget resources through greater transparency\n            and accountability, and by introducing performance\n            measurement; (b) improving government efficiency in the\n            management of human resources through the preparation of a\n            new management system for staffing and remuneration with\n            performance measurement, while streamlining current human\n            resources management; (c) consolidating and controlling\n            public payroll; and (d) improving public services and\n            simplifying procedures through e-government. Public\n            administration reform is viewed as a core component of\n            improving governance and is central to the economic and\n            social reforms that the Government is carrying out to\n            improve economic performance and enhance its capacity to\n            achieve sustained growth. The reform program is aimed at\n            ensuring the viability of the macroeconomic framework by\n            improving the efficiency of public expenditure and optimally\n            allocating budgetary resources. The key components of the\n            reform program include: results-oriented budget reform;\n            increased internal and external audit; improved human\n            resource management; increased quality of public services by\n            introducing localized management; consolidated public sector\n            payroll management; and, since 2007, simplified\n            administrative procedures including through the development\n            of e-government."}, "docdt": "2010-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
