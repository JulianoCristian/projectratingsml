The main sub-project is a\n            priority component of the P&T Telecommunication\n            Branch's investment program for three years (April 1,\n            1978 to March 31,1981). It will result in a significant\n            extension of the present telecommunications network into\n            rural areas of India with the provision of an additional\n            7,500 rural Public Call Offices (PCOs), and 260,000 new\n            direct exchange lines (DELs) the majority of which will be\n            in the rural areas. It includes the expansion of the trunk\n            and telex networks and imported equipment for the\n            Telecommunications Research Center and the Training and\n            Technical and Developmet Circles. The three other\n            subprojects are concerned with upgrading and modernizing the\n            production facilities of the three major government owned\n            telecommunications equipment manufacturers, Indian Telephone\n            Industries Ltd. (ITI), Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL) and\n            Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL). They comprise provision\n            of replacement machinery in the production and tool-making\n            units and addition of modern testing and measuring equipment\n            to replace and supplement obsolete and inadequate existing\n            equipment. There are no special risks."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
