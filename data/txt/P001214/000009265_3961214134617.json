on a\n            sustainable basis; and 3) improve the ability of the\n            Ministry of Public Health (MSP) to analyze health problems,\n            and to formulate, monitor and evaluate policies, strategies\n            and programs. The project components are as follows: 1) the\n            minimum package of health services (PMA); 2) reproductive\n            health; 3) health planning and management; and 4)\n            information and health.

The last two components -\n            institutional strengthening activities - cover the following\n            areas: (a) organization development of the MSP; 2)\n            information systems, including epidemiological surveillance\n            and continuous monitoring and feedback of user perspectives\n            on services; 3) training of prescribers in use of generic\n            drugs and strengthening of quality control laboratory\n            services; 4) health care financing; 5) financial management;\n            and 6) review of training programs and strengthening of\n            personnel management."}, "docdt": "1996-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
