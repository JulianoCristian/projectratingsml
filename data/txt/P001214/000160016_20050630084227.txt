3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) should be read keeping in mind the following two
facts: (i) the Côte d'Ivoire Integrated Health Services Development Project (PDSSI or Projet de
Développement des Services de Santé Intégrés) was a complex project with a life span of 7 years
and (ii) its ICR was prepared through a desk review rather than a visit to the country.

The initial hope was that the PDSSI project would establish the foundation for universal
availability of cost-effective, technically, and culturally appropriate health services that are
affordable and sustainable to the people in Côte d'Ivoire. The three original PDOs of the project
were as follows:
   l To expand access to health services in Côte d'Ivoire and improve their utilization;
   l To make health services available in Côte d'Ivoire on a sustainable basis; and
   l To improve the ability of Côte d'Ivoire's Ministry of Health (MOH) to analyze health
        problems and to formulate, monitor, and evaluate health policies, strategies and programs.


These objectives were fully consistent with the National Health Development Plan (PNDS or Plan
National de Developpement Sanitaire) that Côte d'Ivoire adopted in 1995 for the period
1996-2005, as well as with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was discussed
on June 28, 1994.

The PDSSI's original PDOs appeared overambitious given the project's limited time frame (45
months) and the fact that the Côte d'Ivoire's MOH had limited capacity and a culture antipathetic
to primary health care because it was based on more than 40 years of heavy investments in a
highly medicalized model of health services. For that reason, a decision was made to revise the
PDOs.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The PDOs for the PDSSI were formally revised in November 1998 and in July 2000. They were
informally revised in December 2003. Table 3.2.1. summarizes the chronology of revisions. In the
final revision, as shown in the table, the PDOs read as follows:
   l PDO1: Develop the health system in the Borrower's territory by the introduction of
        reforms and the promotion of access and utilization of care in health districts, especially in
        the areas of reproductive health, family planning, sexually transmitted diseases and
        HIV/AIDS.
   l PDO2: Create and make operational a framework to improve the performance of health
        district management teams (ECD or Equipes Cadres de District)..
   l PDO3: Improve the performance of the health system by introducing the PMA (Paquet
        Minimum d'Activites) program, especially including reproductive health, family planning
        services, and services required to combat AIDS, sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
        and tuberculosis and to address any need created as a result of the conflict.
   l PDO4: Improve the management and financing of the health sector.
   l PDO5: Execute and publish a General Census of the Population and Housing and analyze
        the results.

Key:
 PDO1 = First project development objective as stated in the last version of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA); PDO2 = Second
 project development objective as stated in the last version of the DCA, etc.
 (+) means Addition and (-) Deletion.


Overall, the successive amendments to the PDOs were ineffective. They failed to improve
project performance, particularly during the first 48 months of the project life, when the RCI was
still enjoying a high level of political stability. The July 2000 revision of the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) intended to make the project lighter in addition to putting more emphasis on
decentralization and institutional development. Instead, as indicated in the table, the restructuring
actually increase the number of PDOs from four to five.

3.3 Original Components:
According to the original DCA, the PDSSI was organized into five components, each of which
had numerous subcomponents (Table 3.3.1.).

3.4 Revised Components:
Reviews and amendments to the PDSSI project in 1998, 2000, and 2003 (Table 3.2.1.) were
intended to improve the original design of the project by making it less ambitious and more
consistent with the country's needs and capabilities. In fact, however, the successive amendments
ended up adding to the dispersion of activities to be carried out under the project. In December
2003, one of the PDOs was changed to include addressing any health need created as a result of
the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire. Ultimately, the PDSSI project ended up with five components and
numerous subcomponents (Table 3.4.1).

3.5 Quality at Entry:
As discussed below, quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory for the following five reasons:
   l The PDOs, though pertinent to the needs of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (RCI), were not
       achievable.
   l The project design did not adequately take into consideration the quantifiable and
       non-quantifiable risks that were correctly identified at the time of project appraisal.
   l The project design did not incorporate relevant lessons learned from major previous
       operations--particularly the Health and Demographic Project (Ln 2619-IVC), and Human
       Resources Development Program (Ln 3428-IVC).
   l The project design was grossly inadequate at entry with regard to monitoring and
       evaluation aspects.
   l The Bank Team agreed to the integration of the Integrated Public Finance Management
       System known as SIGFIP (Système Intégré de Gestion des Finances Publiques) into the
       PDSSI.

First reason: The PDOs, though pertinent to the health needs of the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire
(RCI), were not achievable

The PDOs were pertinent as they targeted the unacceptably low performance of the health
sector--a nagging issue that was preventing RCI from enjoying health results commensurate with
its spending in the sector. The project aimed to improve the impact of the sector through an
adequate combination of interventions at two levels: service delivery and management.

The service delivery level was to be improved through provision of the minimum package of
health services (PMA or Paquet Minimum d'Activites) by districts with technical support from the
regional and national levels and in partnership with nongovernmental partners. The content of
PMAs to be provided by the various levels of the health pyramid was clearly defined by the MOH
in the Arrêté No 741/MOH/CAB dated December 9, 1996. Financing of PMA introduction at the
local level was to be driven by request from health districts formulated as district level
development plans. It was clearly understood that success with the PMA implied not only delivery
of quality health care services but also the availability and financial accessibility of a limited
number of essential drugs and acceptable levels of utilization by beneficiaries.

At the management level (i.e., national headquarters, regions, districts, and departments), the
PDSSI was to support an institution-building program of action research, studies, training, and
implementation of pilot projects and ensure execution and effective follow-up on an institutional
assessment of the organization, including strengthening of its informatics capacity. A gradual
change in perspective in the MOH was planned, with increasing attention to demand variables and
beneficiary perspectives. Private voluntary providers and community associations would be
engaged to the maximum feasible extent. Over the 45-month period of project execution, the
groundwork would be laid for a substantial increase in voluntary private insurance, to complement
the planned mutual insurance program, and for the gradual reallocation of priority in public sector
financial and human resources from the tertiary to the primary and secondary levels.

The original PDOs of the PDSSI were pertinent also because they were fully consistent with the
National Health Development Plan (PNDS or Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire) which


                                               - 7 -

the country adopted for the period 1996-2005. They also showed consistency with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).

Notwithstanding their pertinence, the original objectives were too ambitious to be achievable
within the time limit of the project (45 months). The time required for the MOH to correct its
weak capacity and for changes to reverse the impact of past investments made in RCI was gravely
underestimated. For more than 40 years, RCI has invested heavily in a highly medicalized model
of health services. Health professions have become heavily oriented, in numbers and values,
toward medical specialization. The various associations of health professionals are powerful
politically and concentrated more on the economic interests of their members than on regulating
their respective professions. In addition, the RCI civil service is well known to be hampered by
rules and regulations which have the global effect of inhibiting innovation and attention to clients,
especially the unempowered seekers of social services. Moreover, reluctance to change had been
more than amply demonstrated by failure of the Human Resources Development Project to effect
reallocations.

Second reason: The project design did not adequately take into consideration the quantifiable
and non-quantifiable risks that were correctly identified at the time of project appraisal

The non-quantifiable risks related to the PDSSI project included (a) the Borrower's limited
commitment to universally accessible, cost-effective primary health care interventions that were
feasible and sustainable, including particularly reproductive health, with the associated risk of
political interference; (b) the resistance to change generated by substantial past investment in
facilities and human resources oriented towards highly medicalized models for health services
provision, and a centralized public sector management culture; (c) limited MOH and community
group capacity, both at the center and at the periphery, to execute Government and
donor-financed programs; and, more importantly, (d) many MOH officials' unwillingness to be
held accountable.

An increase in the cost of PMA, a decline in Government financial support to health, and the
impact of reduced economic growth were the major quantifiable risks identified at appraisal.
Although an operations manual acceptable to the Bank was developed prior to negotiations, the
project design failed to appropriately take into account the risks that had been identified with
regard to the MOH institutional capacity and culture. In particular, the design failed to recognize
the tremendous difficulty for an excessively broad and complex project to be implemented by a
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) integrated in the fiber of a ministry plagued with weak
management and dominated by a culture antipathetic to public health. Moreover, the Bank
accepted as coordinator for such project a man who was close to the then minister of health, but
who obviously lacked the energy and vision required to get things done across numerous
organization units.




                                                - 8 -

Third reason: The project design did not incorporate relevant lessons learned from major
previous operations--particularly the Health and Demographic Project (Ln 2619-IVC), and
Human Resources Development Program (Ln 3428-IVC)

The project management and procurement aspects of the project design were far from being
adequate to the complexity and ambitious nature of the PDSSI. This inadequacy was highlighted
in the cover letter which the then sector director of the African Regional Human Development
Group sent to the Government to complement the aide-memoire for the April 1997 Supervision
Mission. The average disbursement time for the country was not taken into account when setting
the number of implementation months for the project. This project of $40 million was initially set
to be disbursed in 45 months, when at the time of project approval, a $40 million of IDA lending
took an average of 7 years to disburse in RCI (Source: MIS data).

Fourth reason: The design was grossly inadequate at entry with regard to monitoring and
evaluation aspects

The project appraisal document (PAD) provides that before effectiveness, the Government would
have adopted a project implementation manual, satisfactory to IDA, including performance
indicators. As shown in Annex 1, however, the indicators were not identified for most
components, and when they existed, they were seldom defined adequately. The preparation team
did not succeed in establishing incentives for sound monitoring and evaluation..

Fifth reason: The Bank Team agreed to the integration of the public finance management
system known as SIGFIP (Système Intégré de Gestion des Finances Publiques) into the
PDSSI

The Team agreed to the integration of SIGFIP into the PDSSI even though it was well aware of
problems related to the system. The Government has adopted SIGFIP with the view to ensuring
accountability, but the system has never worked effectively. On the contrary, it has plagued
virtually all IDA investment projects in RCI. In the case of the PDSSI, the integration of the
SIGFIP proved to be a curse from the onset.

Overall achievement of the PDSSI is rated unsatisfactory. Even though the project has
provided some contribution to the establishment of the foundation for universal availability of
cost-effective, affordable, technically and culturally appropriate health services for RCI as a
whole, no data can be made available to support any significant improvement for the period
1996-2004 with regard to the overall performance of the health system and the other PDOs, with
the exception of the General Census (PDO5). Moreover, available data seem to confirm the
Borrower's opinion that the performance of the health system seem has deteriorated during the
aforementioned period

Overall, achievement under Component 1 is rated marginally satisfactory. This component
has allowed finalization of various implementation support tools. By the closing of the project,
training plans, trainers guide and trainees manuals, which constitute training materials for primary
health care facilities (ESPC or Etablissemenst de santé primaire et communautaire) had reached
the editing level. Algorithm manuals elaborated in 2002-2003 were in circulation by December
2004. A core of PMA trainers has been trained. The training of district PMA field staff began in
May 2004 and continued until project closure.

The pilot districts had their action plans prepared. Decentralized accounts were opened for the
Directions de District level, administrators appointed despite long delays. In addition, the MOH
organized the training of heads of its regional directorates (DRS or Directions régionales de
santé) and health district in the utilization of various management tools during September and
November 2003. Unfortunately, however, the absence of transfer of funds required for
performance-based management prevented the actual implementation of annual work plans,
including in the four pilot districts of the PDSSI. The framework that has been created for
improving the performance of the district health teams (ECD or Equipes Cadres de District) is
yet to operate. It is hoped that this could become possible in future.

A technical unit, known as UTAD (Unité Technique d'Assistance aux Districts) was established
and later restructured to Service Autonome d'Appui aux Services Extérieurs et à la
Décentralisation (SASED). The support unit organized regular supervisory visits and
complementary training in the four pilot districts: Tiassale, Grand-Lahou, Guiglo, and Duekoue.
The unit was instrumental in the creation of the framework required for improving the
performance of ECDs as well as the training of MOH personnel in the utilization of various
management tools. The unit also pressed in favor of the MOH's decentralization, the concept of
performance-based management, and various other aspects of the general reform program. By the
end of 2002, the contribution of this unit had facilitated the elaboration and validation of various
tools, including the management procedure manual; document on the choice of indicators; and
planning modules for DRS (Direction régionale de santé), DS (District sanitaire), and CS (
Cercle sanitaire).

During the PDSSI, significant progress was made to improve cooperation between the MOH,
local authorities, community associations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for the
delivery of PMA services. It became possible to provide support to NGOs on the basis of mutual
agreement between the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and civil society associations.
Significant support was channeled through NGOs. Unfortunately, some NGOs and beneficiary
associations were involved in misappropriation of funds. Eight NGOs misappropriated CFAF177
million. This prompted the PCU to take measures to forestall future occurrences. One of these
measures was to attach to each funding agreement signed with the NGOs and the associations, an
endorsement which was meant to centralize checks and facilitate documentation of expenditures
in line with Project procedures. For subsequent contracts, the project introduced a new clause in
the standard contracts with NGOs which indicated they would be sued if funds were not
documented.

Effort to introduce reforms in the curricula for medical and paramedical studies led to the

(Atelier de Restitution de l'Evaluation Institutionnelle de l'UFR-SMA; Formation des Comités
de Réforme Pédagogique UFRSMA et INFAS; Participation à la Conference Internationale
Science et Santé au Canada) were organized. At the closing of the project, however, the
introduction of the reforms had yet to become effective.

Overall, achievement under Component 2 is rated marginally satisfactory. Of the 106
targeted reproductive health and family planning (FP) centers, the PDSSI has succeeded in
rehabilitating 95, in addition to constructing three regional offices for the AIBEF (Association
Ivoirienne de Bien-Etre Familial). Two health care staff per FP center benefited from training.
Unfortunately, the PDSI has not been able to ensure smooth operation of FP services, including in
the centers which the project has rehabilitated. Up to the closing date of the project, the
equipment ordered under the project could not be distributed, some because they could not be
conveyed by the Government to the occupied North, and some because they were seized at
customs point. The equipment acquired for the FP centers was finally handed over to the MOH
Directorate in charge of reproductive health and family planning in January 2005. A study has
been envisaged under the project for phase one of a process leading to the adoption of an

appropriate law on reproductive health. The study was carried out and completed in November
2004. Relevant documents to that effect were handed over to the Bank team during the June 2004
supervision mission. The second phase--which is to ensure actual elaboration of the law--was
far from being completed by the closing of the project on December 31, 2004. In the first months
of 2005, a draft law was submitted by the Government to the parliamentarians for review and
possible adoption.

With regard to the relaunching of priority activities of the health system in post-conflict context, a
total of eight programs--HIV/AIDS, STIs, Malaria, Tuberculosis, Water and Sanitation,
Reproductive health, Nutrition, Immunization Program--were expected to receive substantial
support from the PDSSI in response to emergency situation. By the closing of the project, some
limited interventions had been carried out within the framework of programs for the control of
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and STIs, and tuberculosis.

Overall, achievement under Component 3 is rated unsatisfactory. The project has failed to
establish a functioning system for monitoring and evaluating PNDS and PDSSI implementation
and impact. Throughout the life of the project, the Bank repetitiously requested draft budgets and
public investment programs (PIP) from the MOH and MOF, but most of the requests did not
generate responses that could permit useful inputs. After 1999, the RCI's environment

deteriorated so much that the country had to resort to budgets prepared on a monthly basis.
However, terms of reference for studies on the modalities of collaboration between the external
service management team and the general council within the context of health development for
conducting certain number of studies on key areas were prepared. A study related to the
preparation of a Financial Procedures Manual for Decentralized Structures was initiated in 1999.
In 1988 and 1999, the PDSSI also organized workshops for the training of regional cadres in
budget preparation and financial management. In addition, terms of reference for workshop on the
validation of studies results and exchanges between the external services and the general council
have been prepared. A Public Expenditure Review was carried out for the health sector and
completed in October 2003. To improve the MOH's management information system (MIS), the
PDSSI ensured preparation of modules for chief doctors and the general hospital supervisors on
the use of MIS tools and organization of a workshop for training on the use of these tools. The
completion of the related training of the health personnel in the use of those tools occurred in the
last months of the project, more exactly in August 2004. The MOH put in place a committee,
charged with the evaluation of the PNDS. The MOH organized the evaluation of the PNDS with
support from the PDSSI even though but by the end of 2004, capacity building of MOH and other
personnel for better collaboration and monitoring and evaluation system had not been carried out.

With respect to the decentralizing the financial management of MOH services, lack of funds
transfer prevented the effective establishment of the required system. However, some preparatory
activities were carried out with the view to promoting this aspect of decentralization. A study on
modalities of collaboration between the general Councils and the district core teams was
envisaged and carried out. Following technical discussions with the World Bank in 2002 and
2003, the component financed revision of legal status of local management committees (COGES
or Comité de Gestion). These committees are conceived as community entities charged with the
management of public health institutions. In districts with restructured COGES, the PDSSI
supported the training of local members and conducted experimental studies on the financing of
community health services. The PDSSI has helped put in place procedures for direct funding of
the COGES as well as for the administration of rolling fund accounts at the district level.

In terms of improving the cooperation between the MOH, local authorities, community
associations, and NGOs, significant progress occurred during the PDSSI. By the end of
November 2002, the project had financed 61 subprojects plus institutional support.
Approximately 30 NGOs and community associations benefited from this program among which
there were nine associations of people living with HIV/AIDS. Total cumulative financing granted
to these NGOs and local associations was FCFA750.5 million, and FCFA647 million of this had
been disbursed by the end of May 2004. After the second restructuring (in July 2000), the
subprojects were limited to five priority areas, namely Toulepleu, Guiglo, Duekoue, Bangolo and
Yamoussoukro.

During the September 2003 restructuring, 20 out of the 61 subprojects, based on mutual
agreement between the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and the NGOs and beneficiary
associations, were readjusted, and priority was given to social and medical activities to benefit of
the displaced persons. The restructuring resulted in the PDSSI supporting the provision of clinical
allowances and nutritional rehabilitation. Another result was the financing of the construction of



                                                - 16 -

health installations and provision of pharmacy office equipment in the buffer zones of Toulepleu,
Guiglo, Duekoue, Bangolo and Yamoussoukro the aforementioned priority areas. An evaluation
was planned around June 2004 to assess the impact of activities carried out by the NGOs and the
community based associations. Unfortunately, the exercise could not be carried out, because the
RCI was under suspension from June to December 2004.

The PDSSI has positively affected the development of the MOH's pharmaceutical policies and
services. The tools for training of dispensers and the use of drugs, modules and other support
have been designed even though the Research and Training Directorate, which presently handles
the documents is yet to actually provide training to prescribers, pharmacists, and other
pharmaceutical personnel. The training modules were finalized in May 2002, then validated at the
national level in September 2003. The workshop for the de validation of therapeutic protocols
was organized in September 2004, as well as the session for the training of trainers in drug
prescription and handling.

The PDSSI has failed to effectively improve the information systems and services and the
decision-making capacities of the MOH. Nevertheless, a few activities have been carried out in an
attempt to move toward this goal. Preparation of the health map (Carte Sanitaire) has been
initiated, even though it is yet to be finalized. The "hardware" computer equipment required for
the MIS has been acquired, but some "software problems" still prevent the MIS from functioning
effectively.

In the field of health insurance, the PDSSI has failed to effectively strengthen the RCI's capacity.
The project financed three studies (namely : Etude sur l'Assurance Maladie by Shepard 1999,
Etude sur la Mutualisation du risque Maladie, by GTZ, Septembre 2001; and Experience Pilote
de Financement Communautaire de la Sante dans les Districts du PDSSI, Novembre 2004).
However, the conclusions of the studies have never been applied. At present, no reliable data can
be produced to support any progress generated by the PDSSI in the field of health insurance. The
PDSSI was expected to create a program of primary care mutual insurance on a pilot basis in
Tamousoukro and Daloa, but the program did not materialize.

Overall, achievement under Component 4 is rated highly satisfactory. The two objectives of
this component were completely achieved. The general population census was carried out as
planned and the results have been published. A web site has been designed and made functional.
At present, it facilitates access to data on the RCI population.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
In terms of institutional development, the impact of the PDSSI has been positive but
negligible. The project has developed a series of structures, tools and procedures. It has
established a specialized technical unit known as SASED (Service Autonome d'Appui aux
Services Extérieurs et à la Décentralisation) and strengthened the MOH's Directorate of
Community Health (DSC or Direction de la Santé Communautaire), which is responsible for
providing assistance to the departmental directorates (DDs or Directions départementales). In
addition, the PDSSI has succeeded in opening four decentralized accounts at health district level
and ensuring appointment of administrators. The project has also assisted in the development and
adoption of tools required to ensure performance-based management. The SASED helped in the
reorganization of the COGES by training their members in two of the four pilot districts. This and
other efforts have been complemented by rehabilitation of facilities and acquisition of new
equipments.

The aforementioned structures, tools and procedures could have a significant and sustainable
impact on the national institution only if the return of stability allows their effective utilization. A
satisfactory impact will also require a radical change in the culture in which the MOH is currently
embedded as a result of past investments in favor of a highly medicalized health system. Political
change may require further adaptation of some of the tools that the PDSSI has helped develop. In
addition, a major effort is likely to be needed to establish incentives that encourage effective
utilization of the tools.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Sociopolitical Unrest

A long string of sociopolitical events in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (RCI) hindered
implementation of some activities in the last 48 months of the life of the PDSSI. These
unfortunate events are detailed in Annex 9. Notable among those are: (a) the rebel occupation of
the northern part of the country following the September 2002 coup attempt; and (b) the rioting
that followed the November 6, 2004, bombing of rebel positions, by Government forces. This
situation created long periods of uncertainties and delays. The persisting political crisis impeded
implementation of activities, particularly in the North, thereby limiting the attainment of project
development objectives (PDOs). At the close of the project, the RCI was still divided into two



                                                     - 18 -

zones--one controlled by Government forces and the other by rebels--and large sections of the
country were not accessible.

Economic Performance of the Country

The debilitating social and political upheaval in RCI during 1999 and 2000 negatively impacted
the country's economy. The treasury situation that resulted made the RCI unable to fulfill its
payment obligations. Government arrears led IDA to suspend disbursements during the period
September 2000 through January 2002, and there were adverse consequences on project
implementation.

RCI's sociopolitical situation remained unchanged as of June 2004. In addition, the country has
been under IDA disbursement suspension since June 14, 2004, for nonpayment of arrears. RCI
depends on the export of cocoa and agricultural products for its revenues, but the country has no
control on the prices of these commodities on international markets. And prices for cocoa and
agricultural products have plummeted in recent years, while the oil and some other essential
products that RCI must import have become increasingly expensive.

Cabinet Reshuffling

The Ministry of Health (MOH) leadership underwent frequent changes as a result of government
reorganizations. The PDSSI was implemented under five different ministers of health, and the
frequent changes contributed to slowing project implementation.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
During the PDSSI project's implementation, the MOH created several delays in postponing
implementation of agreed actions that crippled the project effectiveness. Particularly during the
first 3 years of the PDSSI project, when RCI was still enjoying political stability, the Government
could have avoided some of these delays.

After the Board's approval in June 1996, the PDSSI project became effective after a 6-month
gap. In 1996, the MOH was reluctant to take actions required for sound financial management of
the project, and there were delays in disbursements and completing of covenanted obligations.
The MOH delayed submission, among other things, of (a) the public investment program (PIP)
required under the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) to strengthen financial management at
peripheral health facilities; (b) complete, detailed accounting of project expenditures; and (c) a
proposal for restructuring the project. The belated submission of the proposal resulted in a
2-month delay of the restructuring exercise meeting of both parties. The poor implementation of
the SIGFIP also contributed to slowing down tremendously all IDA-financed projects.




                                                    - 19 -

Staff Recruitment and Retention

Many critical units, such as he Community Health Directorate subcomponent of the District/PMA
health services component was plagued with staffing problems. Although the MOH found it
difficult to locate within and attract into the civil service skilled public health specialists, it
remained reluctant to turn to external consultants, despite availability of credit to finance external
expertise. In addition, frequent changes in top-level management, particularly the ministers of
health, impeded smooth implementation of activities.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:


Management

The management of the PDSSI was crippled by serious problems, most of which could have been
avoided by suitable administrators. Notable among those were discrepancies in the management of
counterpart funds. Approximately $400,000 in counterpart funds was misspent, either on items
not foreseen or not included in a work plan subject to the Bank's no-objection, or procured
outside Bank guidelines. The funds were supposed to be repaid into the project account by the
end of May 1997. Despite close monitoring of this issue by the Bank, and as at end of January
1998, the reimbursement of the project account for improper spending had not been completed.

Staffing

During a long period, the staff charged with managing the PDSSI had insufficient skills,
experience, and motivation to run the day-to-day activities of the project, particularly in the first
half of the project life. The situation was aggravated by the illness of the Project Coordinator. An
interim coordinator was appointed, but the individual's main job as director of the minister's
Cabinet made it impossible for him to give the required attention to the project. The result was
long delays in the establishment of sound procurement plans and low rates of implementation.

5.4 Costs and financing:
  Tables 5.4.1. and 5.4.2. present successively the actual project costs as computed by the
Borrower in the Borrower's currency (i.e., CFA francs) and the disbursement profile of the
PDSSI during its 87-month life. As indicated in Annex 2, the total cost of the PDSSI project at
appraisal was estimated at US$52 million. Of this, IDA funding was to be US$40 million (i.e.,
77 percent of the total cost). Domestic counterpart funding was to be US$12 million, including
US$11.8 million from Government allocations and the rest from beneficiaries.

By the close of the project, a total of US$ 29.73 million (i.e., 74.3 percent of the initial credit) had
actually been disbursed. As SDRs7 million (equivalent to US$10.14 million) were cancelled in
July 2000 from the initial credit, the end-of-project disbursement represents about 81.69 percent
of the revised credit.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is rated unlikely. The PDSSI has chalked some commendable
achievements, particularly in creating a basis for institutional capacity building, but three factors
critical to maintaining the achievements of the PDSSI are lacking--namely, peace, availability of
financial resources and political commitment. Peace is essential for the establishment of social,
economic and political conditions that could prevent the annihilation of investments made in
goods and people. An appropriate level of financing--in addition to a change in the MOH's
culture--is essential for the sector to support the operating costs required for the implementation
of the procedures that the project has established.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Not applicable

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's overall lending performance in the PDSSI is rated unsatisfactory. Although the
Bank kept a documentation with excellent analysis of quantifiable and nonquantifiable project
risks, these were not adequately taken into account in the design of the project. An overambitious,
complex project was conceived despite the obvious weakness of the MOH and its cultural bias
toward a hospital-centric health care system. The Bank underestimated the Borrower's resistance
to the pivotal changes implied by the PDSSI despite numerous interactions with national officials.
During identification, preparation and appraisal, the Bank's staff had extensive negotiations with
the Government on the project development objectives. It maintained and engaged a wide range
of stakeholders in a series of client consultations and dialogue. In the context of client
consultations, assessment was carried out on health perceptions, attitudes and practices of a wide
range of heads of households as well as on motivations and behaviors of health care providers in
Cote d'Ivoire.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's overall supervision of the PDSSI is rated marginally satisfactory.
Implementation progress was sufficiently reported and various components of the project were
realistically rated in the PSRs. There were at least two supervision mission undertaken prior to
project restructuring. Bank staff detected a host of implementation problems, which impeded
progress during the first three years of the project execution, and addressed them in consultation
with MOH officials during the technical discussions of 1999 mid-term review exercise. Except for
the period of sociopolitical unrest, intensive supervision missions, with high caliber of experts,
were organized after the mid-term review. The Bank team showed a high level of flexibility in
undertaking three restructuring exercises, and a partial one, with the Ivorian counterparts. During
the mid-term review, activities which were considered unachievable were scaled down to
jump-start implementation. In September 2003, Bank staff held a technical discussion meeting
with the Ivorian counterparts in Paris to again restructure the project to reflect the country's
post-conflict needs. To prepare for the closure of the project, the Bank team worked closely with
the project coordination unit, during the course of the June 2004 supervision mission, on a
number of activities which would be carried out.


                                                  - 22 -

However, the operation was executed under four different task team leaders (TTLs), which
indicates a high turnover of TTLs. In addition, the Bank was too slow to take the required
actions, for instance when extensions were needed, and when substantial amount of nonresident
consultant assistance was urgently needed to support the execution of the National Family
Planning Program. Because of management changes, re-evaluation of these requirements became
necessary. Actions were slow and ineffective when frequent discussions with key officials led the
Bank to realize the fantastic resilience of the MOH's and other powerful stakeholders' culture and
the obstinate tendency of the Government to underestimate the challenges of executing the project
and impede capacity building.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
In light of the aforementioned ratings, the Bank's overall performance with respect to the PDSSI
is rated unsatisfactory

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's overall performance with respect to the preparation of the PDSII is rated
unsatisfactory. Project preparation was hampered by administrative delays in releasing
counterpart funds for the PPF. As a result, prior to negotiations the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
had to transfer 82 million CFAF, which was the remaining counterpart funds for the IDA PPF to
an MOH account. Additionally, as a condition for effectiveness, IDA asked the MOF to deposit in
an MOH account funds required for the first four months of the project execution an amount of
315 million CFAF to be replenished on quarterly basis or whenever its balance was less than 200
million CFAF.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Borrower's performance with respect to the implementation of the PDSII is also rated
unsatisfactory. Despite giving assurances during the course of negotiations, the Government
could not meet a key condition of IDA credit to undertake a comprehensive implementation
review (mid-term review) on December 31, 1998. This review was done in September 1999. The
counterpart fund constraint, which greatly affected project preparation, persisted almost
throughout the entire period of the project demonstrating lack of government commitment. For
instance, the MOF could only provide 50 percent of the projected counterpart funds for 2002.
This reflects the treasury problems that engulfed the country around that year.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The overall performance of the implementing agency is rated as satisfactory. Although
project implementation was impeded by long delays, and intractable problems in the use of funds,
staffing, and completing of project dossiers at the Project management level as long as the project
was completely integrated in the ministry's fiber, project management improved significantly
during the later part of the project cycle with the creation of a separate unit staffed with
contractual staff, and with the selection of a new competent project coordinator. This happened
despite the worsening of the country's sociopolitical conditions.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
On the basis of the information just discussed in the preceding sections, the overall Borrower



                                                - 23 -

performance is rated as unsatisfactory. Lack of Government commitment to changes implied by
the PNDS and the PDSSI coupled with overall weak capacity of the implementing agency
impacted negatively on project implementation.

8. Lessons Learned

The following lessons were learned from the PDSSI in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (RCI):
1. Ownership of PDOs by the Borrower is critical. The RCI enjoyed political stability until
   late 1999. Despite this and many other assets, the country could not progress toward the
   development objectives set in the project. The ownership of the National Health Development
   Plan (PNDS or Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire) 1996-2006--and subsequently
   for the PDSSI--was deceptive. The preparation of the PNDS, the implementation of which
   the project was meant to support, has been largely championed and handled by an
   authoritative French advisor. Most cadres of the MOH did not share the changes implied by
   the plan and felt rather comfortable with the traditional system of providing health services.
   This feeling was comforted by the country's good reputation. Institutional commitment for
   changes further waned after the foreign champion left the country. In the absence of political
   commitment and willingness to change, projects that promote reforms have no chance to
   succeed. Success can spring where, and only where there is will.

2. Incorporating previous lessons into project design is essential. The PDSSI has highlighted
   the need for a project design to incorporate lessons learned in previous operations and take
   into consideration to all the risks that are identified during project preparation to ensure
   smooth implementation. In particular, the average disbursement time for a country should be
   factored in when setting the number of implementation years for a project in a country.

3. Reforms are long and demanding processes, particularly in countries that do enjoy a
   high level of socio-political stability. The introduction of a PMA, for instance, is a
   time-consuming endeavor in countries with highly "medicalized" models of health services
   and/or with regulations and cultural norms which have the global effect of inhibiting
   innovations and attention to clients, especially the unempowered seekers of social services.
   Paradoxical as it may sound, the outbreak of a crisis may result in undermining resistance to
   change, making a country more receptive to advice and eager to try international good
   practices. In the case of the PDSSI, the disarray caused by the civil war seems to have
   combined with the selection of a more adequate project coordinator to slightly boost project
   implementation.

4. Establishment of proper system for managing, monitoring and evaluating project
   operations is crucial. No project should be approved without an appropriate and
   cost-effective monitoring and evaluation system, as this forces accountability. The impact of a
   system such as SIGFIP on an IDA-financed project should have been examined earlier and
   corrective actions taken promptly.

5. Realistic periods of extensions for project implementation should be considered for any
   future operations in difficult situations. The Bank should not give short extensions for
   project implementation. As short extensions did not allow the PDSSI project to progress,
   constructions, ICB procurement, and some other activities which require a period of at least 9




                                              - 24 -

    months should not have been launched.

6. Autonomous or semi-autonomous project implementation units offer several
    advantages. Autonomous structures within ministries to coordinate projects have some
    interesting advantages. In the case of the PDSSI, the shift from civil servants to contractual
    staff helped tremendously. It allowed recruitment of staff who are fully committed to the
    project and can concentrate on well-defined tasks.


9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Extracts from comments about the PDSSI provided by Côte d'Ivoire's Ministry of Health (MOH)
are presented below. (See details in Annex 10).

Project Implementation Methods

The PDSSI was generally implemented in compliance with World Bank Directives dealing with
procurement and financial management of loans. Beyond the obligations of the Monitoring
Committee, internal periodical reviews, World Bank supervision missions and the Annual
Accounting Audits formed the basis of project monitoring. In addition, the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) was forced to constantly adapt to national directives in terms of public finance
management and procurement. The establishment, in 1999, of the Integrated Public Finance
Management System known as SIGFIP (Système Intégré de Gestion des Finances Publiques)
required project managers to adapt further. Consequently, the implementation manual designed at
the start of the project was replaced by management platforms and tools, which were developed
and introduced in the context of the SIGFIP.

The PDSSI project sought to develop the institutional capacity of the MOH, especially the
development of skills to implement specific component activities. This meant that central and
remote actors had to be heavily involved in starting, implementing and monitoring planned
activities. A certain level of enthusiasm--spurred by the direct involvement of the Office of the
Minister--was observed early on in the project. However, this spirit weakened with time for
various reasons. Procedures for managing the project at the decentralized level (health districts)
were absent and ill defined at the start of the project. They were discussed throughout the
project's life, but these discussions failed to establish an efficient and direct financing system for
health districts.   None of the options that were considered (subaccounts within the special
account, payment of advances financed by the national counterpart, etc.) could be implemented.
As a result, one of the major reforms anticipated under the project--which was to establish
performance contracts between headquarters and districts--could not be introduced. The PDSSI
has not been able to put to practice the performance-based district management approach, among
other things. This will certainly count as one of the major failures of the PDSSI.

Without questioning the role of international consulting firms in assisting with procurement, MOH
officials express mixed views of those that were hired in the context of the PDSSI. Although the
relevance of this assistance at the start of the project is understood, the issue of a quick transfer of
the responsibilities of these firms to national officials will need to be examined in future. It was
shown that, as far as the PDSSI is concerned, local professionals could have efficiently carried out


                                                  - 25 -

these tasks at a lower cost.

The Government appreciates the excellent work of the National Office for Technical Studies and
Development (BNEDT) despite some difficulties experienced by this national facility because of
the general situation. These difficulties are compounded by the impossibility for IDA credit to
finance BNETD. This issue will need to be reviewed with the intent to open access to this
financing.    Should it prove impossible to finance BNETD directly from project funds,
consideration should be given to the option so that the loan could contribute to strengthening the
capacity of this Office as it assists in the implementation of investment projects.

At the start of the project, the Directorate for Infrastructure, Equipment and Maintenance
(DIEM) certainly had the skills and technical capacity needed to play a primary role in
procurement. This option was not given to the DIEM despite the will and advocacy of Ministry
officials in that regard. Only one focal point was assigned within the DIEM to take part in the
procurement process in collaboration with BNETD and SGS, the consulting firm. When this
focal point left for another job, DIEM became completely excluded from ongoing activities,
specifically those related to civil works.        This weakness was partly compensated by the
reassignment of the person who conceived the "Health Map" component to the Coordination
Unit. This solution will not address the issue of regaining control of the existing portfolio in order
to complete civil works as well as the procurement of equipment commissioned in the context of
post-conflict management.

Results from Components

The PDSSI aimed essentially to support PNDS implementation, specifically to achieve several
reforms meant to deeply transform Côte d'Ivoire's health system by 2000, which was the first
5-year middle point of PNDS implementation. They were mostly institutional development
activities and their results up to now can seem mixed. There is no doubt that PDSSI helped
introduce, to a certain extent, a dynamic of change in various key parts of the sector. However,
results will need to be assessed in light of the unfavorable circumstances that prevailed throughout
project implementation.

During implementation, the project experienced a series of events, which, in the end, had a
negative impact on its overall performance.                The initial difficulties, coupled with
misunderstandings between the Government and the World Bank about a number of key issues
(procurement assistance, the role of BNEDT, the role of DIEM, the assignment of officials, etc.)
contributed to slowing down substantially achievements expected in the first few years of project
implementation. Later on, the successive adjustments and restructurings were further
compounded by new and unexpected external factors, including: political instability following the
military coup, suspension of disbursements, which lasted 14 months the first time, deterioration of
the sociopolitical situation following war, institutional instability at the Department of Health from
1999 to 2002 and a weakening of the country's economy.

Despite this unfavorable environment, several components of the project can be credited with
several positive results. In the case of the PMAs, several tools were developed (including the
Methodology for the Preparation of Health Development Plans at District Level, PMA Directives,


                                                  - 26 -

Supervision Handbook, Training Guidelines, Organizational Charts). The PDSSI contributed
substantially to the strengthening of the institutional framework for the fight against AIDS and
helped catalyze the multisectoral approach, including NGO involvement and capacity building for
the main actors involved in fighting the disease. In terms of reproductive health and family
planning, the project helped open several service centers and supplied them with contraceptives
over a long period of time, in addition to the financial support given to AIBEF. In terms of sector
management and financing, the project carried out the last public expenses review for the health
sector and completed the feasibility study for a pilot mutual benefit health insurance scheme.
Several other important results were achieved by the various components.

One question remains in terms of reaching the goals of the project and the impact of results
achieved on the development of the Côte d'Ivoire health system. It is worthwhile to determine the
extent to which the project has helped improve the health conditions of the population. While
waiting for a final evaluation and a more formal assessment of project results in terms of efficiency
and effectiveness, the PDSSI seems to have, in fact, helped move along reforms stated in the
PNDS. The project has also significantly assisted the sector in getting ready to better consider
future challenges. Constraints to project implementation and the lack of concrete results do not
take anything away from the work done. All recommendations to be made will need to take into
account the real delays in implementation. The PDSSI was practically inert for 3 years before
activities actually started and disbursements were suspended for about 24 months. Numerous
internal factors also weakened project implementation.

Project Coordination and Management

The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was in charge of technical coordination and administrative
and financial management of the project, in compliance with World Bank procedures. Starting in
1999, the unit also complied with national procedures adopted within the Integrated Public
Finance Management System (SIGFIP).

At the start of the project, difficulties emerged in terms of procurement and financial management.
Some management weaknesses were corrected through measures taken during the first project
restructuring. Generally, starting in 2000, project coordination and administrative and financial
management improved sharply. On several occasions, project staff showed initiative and acted
proactively, particularly when disbursements were on hold.             To a certain extent, these
improvements helped make up for the delays that occurred at the start of the project. Indeed,
while the project was initially expected to last 4 years, implementation ended up lasting 8 years.
Considering the initial 3-year inertia and the cumulative 24 months of suspension, it is not an
overstatement to say that, between 2000 and 2004, the project effectively made up for the delays
and this, despite the fact that it was actually implemented over a shorter period than was
anticipated initially.

The Government acknowledges the important role played by the PCU and congratulates the team
for the disbursement levels it achieved (85 percent) despite the constraints it faced throughout
project implementation. Everything points to the fact that, had it not been for the suspensions and
the successive socioeconomic crises, the project would have achieved a disbursement rate very
close to 100 percent and completed all planned activities.

World Bank's Performance

The performance of World Bank financed projects is closely related, to a certain extent, to the
efficiency of World Bank follow-up and the quality of relationships between national and Bank
experts. Two additional elements need to be considered: first, steps prior to expenses and which
require prior approval from the World Bank; and, on the other hand, special account
replenishment channels (processing of Requests for Fund Withdrawal, RFW)

The start of PDSSI was particularly difficult due to the size of the project and a weak
understanding and grasp of World Bank procedures on the part of national staff involved in
implementation. Despite a great willingness to learn on the part of MOH professionals during
project preparation and in the early stages of implementation, Bank staff often lacked flexibility in
that regard. The insistence that documents submitted for approval should be perfect seemed
excessive to MOH staff who, in some cases, ended up losing interest in the project. This
prevented the development of mutual trust at the start of the project.

Lengthy Bank processing delays were constantly cited as causing delays in implementing several
key project activities. This was particularly the case for procurement early on in the project. At a
much later stage of project implementation, the assignment, by the Bank, of a procurement
specialist in Abidjan proved effective. During the last stages of project implementation, The Bank
made an effort to strengthen its team at the Abidjan Regional Office. Nevertheless, several issues
had to be referred to Washington for direct processing by headquarters staff. The long delays,
throughout project implementation, in processing RFWs also contributed to slowing down
implementation. In the case of PDSSI, the processing of RFWs took an average of six weeks.

Government's Performance

The Government had high hopes for the achievements of the project and the part it could play in
meeting the needs of the ultimate beneficiaries in the targeted health districts. It was therefore
committed, through the MOH, to support project implementation. Representatives of many
ministries participated effectively to the project's Monitoring Committee, in compliance with the
decree that created it and defined its operation.

The State's financial contribution (Government's counterpart financing) was substantial, despite
constraints related to the economic crisis. Throughout the project, the Ministry of the Economy
and Finances approved all the exemptions necessary for the procurement of imported goods and
equipment (customs duties, fees, etc.). Criticisms of delays caused by SIGFIP led the Minister of
the Economy and Finances (MOF) to take appropriate measures to facilitate and speed up
disbursements (commitment outside SIGFIP, cash advances, assignment of managers, etc.) A
committee was established under the coordination of the General Directorate for the Economy to
monitor disbursements of projects within emergency programming, including PDSSI.

However, weaknesses and deficiencies were observed within the Project Monitoring Committee.
The Committee only met a few times and actually had a very limited role in project
implementation. This is probably related to the institutional instability that prevailed within the



                                                - 28 -

MOH, which chaired the Committee. Among the various ministers, who were successively
assigned to lead the Health Department, many did not keep their positions long enough to
understand the project and take a closer interest in its implementation. However, due to the size
of the project, the project staff kept the ministers informed regularly of implementation progress.

Another weakness in the involvement of Government during project implementation came from
delays in setting-up Expense Control Mechanisms for health districts. In fact, the issue of a
decentralized financial management within the project was not given sufficient attention during
project preparation and launch. All attempts resulted in failure for various reasons (delays in
issuing the decree creating the Control Mechanisms; assigning managers; or agreeing on how to
deal with the issue of private bank accounts, minutes for managers' assignments, suspension of
special accounts, transfer of funds to managers, disbursement procedures, circulation of financial
data from and to the PCU). The World Bank shares some of the responsibility in these
weaknesses. Indeed, one of the solutions considered by project staff was to request that
subaccounts be opened for health districts involved in the project. This would have allowed
districts direct access to financial resources but this suggestion was not approved by the World
Bank.

Project Achievements and Contributions

The achievements and contributions of the PDSSI are twofold.                A first group of project
achievements are related to reforms of he health system. These include institutional development
activities dealing with the building of management capacity within the sector, PMA activities,
health district operations, sector financing, coverage of health risks, partnership experiences with
civil society, curriculum reform for medical and paramedical training, drug policy, capacity
building for health information as well as institutional support for the fight against HIV/AIDS.
The second group of achievements is related to material contributions, especially contraceptives
and other drugs, equipment and infrastructure.

The National Health Development Plan (PNDS or Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire)
that Côte d'Ivoire adopted in 1995 for the period 1996-2005 introduced several major reforms.
During the last 8 years, the PDSSI was the preferred instrument to push for such reforms. Thus,
it is in the area of reforms that the project was most efficient. The project outlined several paths,
which now need to be either deepened or included in future considerations. As health districts
became operational, PMA training modules and supervision tools were developed and made
available nationally. Unfortunately, the collaborative framework with civil society led to mixed
results. The curricula for medical and paramedical training have been reformed, but the reforms
remains blocked due to a lack of financing. Conversely, issues related to the decentralized
financial management and the development of a health map were not addressed. Activities carried
out in relation to sector financing have not lead to satisfactory results. It was unrealistic to expect,
on one hand, effective introduction of all the reforms that were anticipated in under the PDSSI,
and, on the other hand, completion of the reforms that were introduced and supported by the
project within the proposed short timeframe.




                                                 - 29 -

In terms of material contributions, project efficiency was much weaker.                    Procurement
constraints--and, more generally, implementation delays related to factors that emerged
throughout the project life--in many cases prevented the project from reaching anticipated
objectives. In particular, civil works were not completed in most cases. The equipment of health
facilities that were rehabilitated or built within the project also was not completed in most cases.
This situation had adverse implications for the credibility of health officials as well as for the
future budgetary resources.

Achievement of Project Objectives

The PDSSI aimed to provide quality basic health services through the development of health
districts.  It was also supposed to support the institutional development of the MOH and
introduce the reforms needed to deeply transform the system and the sector. The goal was to
substantially improve the health of the population, especially the most vulnerable. Activities and
components were developed in order to meet specific objectives.

Given the changes that occurred within the project and the various constraints that emerged
throughout project implementation, it is almost certain that most specific objectives were not met.
There is even a concern that the sociopolitical events that took place during project
implementation may have led to a degradation of the health situation. This could be the case for
health districts located in conflict areas. This raises the issue of the efficiency of activities carried
out within the PDSSI with the exception of the General Population and Housing Census (RGPH).
Objectively, despite some achievements, the overall efficiency assessment is highly unfavorable.

This assessment of project efficiency should be tempered by taking into account the unfavorable
circumstances that occurred. Never before has a project generated so much hope and ambition
and, at the same time, so much frustration and uncertainty. Assessing project efficiency becomes
even more delicate and complex considering that the health districts that were to benefit from
PMA delivery were not able to obtain the inputs needed to reach the objectives assigned to them.
Beyond developing tools and some minor activities during the very last few months of the project,
health districts were unable to access additional financing needed to support PMA delivery
because of a lack of an adequate mechanism to channel funds to them.                Assessing project
efficiency becomes more complex when considering the circumstances of project completion
(second disbursement suspension since June 2003 and constraints related to Government
financing).

Additional Annex 8. Procurement of Goods and Services

Activities initially planned under PDSSI included the building of family planning clinics, hospital
restoration and offices at district level, purchase of equipment, various supplies and drugs, and
conduction of consultant and NGO services. According to the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD), 41 percent of the loan was intended to finance procurement of goods and services through
ICB and 31 percent through NCB, while 28 percent was to be allocated to services from
consultants, NGOs, and others. Clearly, the PDSSI activity plan anticipated intense procurement
activities and called for the establishment of an appropriate efficient organization.

A. Organization of Procurement

During project preparation, the intent was to make the most effective use of existing facilities and
services. Project implementation was to be streamlined as much as possible within the daily
activities of Ministry of Health (MOH) line managers (ref. Section 5.6 of PAD). It was therefore
agreed that the Directorate for equipment, supplies and maintenance (DESM) of the MOH, which
is in charge of similar processes for several projects financed by other donors, would have primary
responsibility for procuring construction works and supplies. In case technical or human
difficulties prevent the DESM from meeting deadlines, provision was made in the PAD to resort
to the services of a consultant. In addition, it was agreed that the Public Health Pharmacy (PHP)
would be in charge of procuring drugs and pharmaceutical items. Similarly, it was agreed that an
international consultant, to be joined by a local consultant, would carry out the process of
selecting consultants. It must be noted that the PAD has made no mention of evaluating the
capacity of the DESM during the preparation of the project.

Upon the start of the project, the structure anticipated in the PAD for procurement was not
immediately implemented. Initially, other types of structures were put in place during the first 2
years of the project (initially scheduled to last 4 years). Responsibility for procurement went
through several organizations during implementation. From December 1996 to April 1997, the
Project's Financial Manager, who lacked the required skills for this task, carried out procurement
activities. As a result, 35 contracts (including wages for ineligible staff) amounting to a total of
FCFA 192,974,005 were found not to be in compliance with procedures. The MPH hired a
consultant from April 1997 to April 1998 to handle procurement within the project without even
mentioning it to the Bank. After a request from the Bank, the consultant's TORs, curriculum
vitae, and signed contract were submitted for consideration. After examining the resume, the
Bank noted and informed the project that the consultant did not have the required experience to
undertake this task. As a result, the Bank asked the project not to renew this consultant's contract
(which was for one year) and to recruit a firm with international experience as recommended in
the PAD. On May 29, 1998, the firm SGS was hired following a competitive process and charged
with the procurement of supplies and equipment as well as with civil works. Similarly, a national
expert was hired on September 1, 1998, with the view to ensuring transfer of skills through
closely working with the international consultants. CHEMA, and other firm, was hired for
procurement of consulting services on February 8, 1999.

Given the above, it is obvious that an actual structure reflecting the initial agreements only took
place 2 years after the loan became effective. This unfortunate situation had a negative effect on


                                                 - 46 -

project implementation. The midterm review noted disturbing results with very low achievements
and disbursements. The project was then restructured and the credit reduced by SDR7 million.
Procurement processes were identified as one of the main problems of the project. They were
reorganized during the restructuring that took place in September 1999. For reasons of efficiency,
it was decided that the construction works component would be removed from the mission of
SGS and transferred to a new agency, namely BNETD. SGS was asked to focus on issues related
to goods and equipment.

When the SGS and CHEMA contracts expired in 2001, their portfolios were transferred to two
consultants, one of whom had assisted the two international firms for several years. This team
handled the bulk of procurement tasks from 2001 to the close of the project on December 24,
2004, but their skills were sufficient.

Clearly, the project was faced with enormous procurement problems during the first years of
implementation due to poor organization and noncompliance with initial agreements. The DSMM,
which was supposed to play a major role, ended up practically not being involved at all during
implementation. Obviously, had the initial PAD agreements been respected, the project would
probably have performed better.

B. Evaluation of Procurement Quality, Transparency, and Efficiency

During its first years, lack of skills and poor understanding of procedures, needs, etc., plagued the
PDSSI. During the first 2 years, the project did not have a procurement plan even though such a
plan is critical for planning activities. The first plan was prepared only after the arrival of
international firms in 1998 and 1999.

After the firms' SGS and CHEMA were hired, the quality of the files and reporting as well as
adherence to and monitoring of procedures improved sharply. Nevertheless, these consultants
found it very difficult to reach the objectives outlined in their respective TORs. The problems
they encountered included, among others, the following: (a) political instability (including a
military coup in December 1999), which led to successive regime changes; (b) untimely changes
of counterparts in charge of technical components (several within a year) following new
ministerial appointments (instability); (c) the suspension of disbursement by the Bank between
October 2000 and January 2002; (d) the delayed vote on the Budget Laws (6 months delay)
without which no activity can take place; (e) the quarterly ceiling imposed on expenses by the
ministry which slows down the implementation of activities; (f) the lack of counterpart financing;
and (g) excessive delays in payments through SIGFIP.

The project performance review (PPR) shows that the recruitment of consultants charged with
handling procurement tasks after the contracts of the firms ended helped maintain and even
improve FY04 and FY05 project performance, which was rated as acceptable. This team's efforts
helped achieve a noticeable disbursement rate of 84 percent at project completion. Better result
could have been achieved if disbursements had not been suspended a second time on June 15
2004 due to nonrepayment of the debt. This suspension suddenly prevented a series of
procurements planned for the last 6 months of the project.




                                                 - 47 -

C. Availability of Key Project Documents

In addition to the credit agreement and the procurement plan, key project documents include the
Implementation Manual, the Management and Accounting Handbook, and the NGO Procedure
Handbook. The existence of the Implementation Manual was one of the conditions for loan
effectiveness (which occurred on December 16, 1996). However, the document was made
available only in April 1998. In addition, the April 1998 draft did not contain the section on
organization and procurement. The NGO Procedure Handbook was validated only in February
1998.

On the basis this analysis, it can be stated that the PDSSI was characterized by the absence of
timely key management documents even though some of them were initially required for loan
effectiveness. The lack of such documents could partly explain the fact that early expenses
occurred without reference to procedures (leading to a rejection by the Bank) normally detailed in
the Implementation Manual.

D. Factors that Benefited or Impeded Procurement Activities

Procurement activities benefited from the following:
   l Good performance by national experts following the departure of the procurement firms;
   l Good management of the construction works component, which was eventually handled
        by BNETD;
   l Preparation and update of the procurement plan during the last years of the project;
   l Even though it came late, the hiring of the firms SGS and CHEMA for the procurement of
        equipment and consultant selection respectively; and
   l Recruitment of national experts charged with assisting the procurement firms in the
        transfer skills.

Procurement activities were impeded by the following:
   l Noncompliance with the initial set-up anticipated in the PAD regarding ownership of the
        procurement tasks;
   l Lack of timely availability of key management documents (various Handbooks);
   l Absence of a procurement plan during the early years;
   l Absence or difficulty in raising counterpart financing;
   l Unstable and volatile political situation in the country leading to several changes that
        affected Implementation; and
   l Project suspensions. The project was suspended twice for a total duration of 21 months
        (24 percent) out of a total project life of 87 months.




                                                 - 48 -

E. Conflict and Complaints

In the context of the implementation of PDSSI, several NGOs were contracted to implement
community subprojects aimed at improving health coverage and use of health services. During this
operation, 14 NGOs and associations did not account for expenses made during implementation
of their subprojects. NGOs failed to account for a total amount of FCFA 129,540,326. As
reminding letters remained unanswered, the Project Coordination Unit filed complaints against
most of these organizations. The file is currently being monitored by the Judiciary Agency for the
Treasury of Côte d'Ivoire.

Keeping in mind this early difficulty in operations involving NGOs, the project took care to amend
the financing agreement with NGOs in order to strengthen the monitoring and control system to
better ensure that expenses and their accounting are effective.

Additional Annex 9. Project Context


Political Context in Côte d'Ivoire

1. In a region characterized by political instability, the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (RCI) showed
   political stability from its independence from France in August 1960 until late 1999. Felix
   Houphouet-Boigny presided over this West African country from August 6, 1960 (when he
   took over from Auguste Denise) until his death on December 7, 1993. During this period, the
   country maintained a close political allegiance to France because Felix Houphouet-Boigny was
   a strong proponent of the Communauté Française d'Afrique (CFA).

2. In 1980s and early 1990s, RCI experienced negative growth partly as a result of the 1974 oil
   shock and the fall of cocoa prices on the international market. In 1988, the deepening of the
   economic crisis combined with the push for democratization and multi-party system to force
   Felix Houphouet-Boigny to appoint Allasane Dramane Ouattara, the former Governor of
   BCEAO, as Head of the Comité Interne Autonome de Crise Economique, a Task Force in
   charge of economic stabilization. In 1991, Allasane D. Ouattara was designated to become
   RCI's first Prime Minister. He was very instrumental in slowing the RCI's economic decline.
   Consequently, he became a prominent political figure in RCI. Notable among his innovations
   was la Carte de Séjour pour Etranger which Allasane introduced as a means to control
   immigration into RCI as the country was attracting numerous migrants, especially from
   neighboring countries. This document sew the first seeds of a concept, that will later be
   known as "Ivoirité." In the late 1980s, it became evident that Felix Houphouet-Boigny had
   become excessively weak. Unlike Leopold Sédar Senghor of the Republic of Senegal and
   Nelson Mandela of the Republic of South Africa, however, the senescent Felix
   Houphouet-Boigny remained reluctant to clearly designate Allasane or any other personality
   as his political heir. RCI and its allies failed to take measures required for smooth succession.

3. Upon Houphouet-Boigny's death, Allasane D. Ouattara attempted to act as President of RCI.
   The attempt was stopped by the Army and Konan Bedie, the President of the National
   Assembly, became RCI's second president according to Article 11 of the Constitution adopted
   in 1958. However, the new president failed to conform to the rule that calls for the
   organization of presidential elections within 60 days. Instead, he decided to complete his
   predecessor's mandate until 1995, where normal elections had been scheduled to take place.
   In 1995, Bedie organized and won the elections against Vodié Vanga, Secretary General of
   the Parti Ivoirien de Travail (PIT).

4. On December 24, 1999, the government inability to pay salaries led to an army upheaval.
   Following a bloodless coup, Bedie was deposed; General Guei formed a government of
   national unity and promised open elections. He drafted a constitution to replace the one
   drafted in 1958 before independence in the spirit of French Commonwealth. The new
   constitution was ratified by referendum in the middle of 2000. Elections were scheduled for
   the last quarter of 2000, but the Supreme Court disqualified the candidates from the two
   major parties- the PDCI and Rassemblement des Républicains (RDR) some on the ground of
   "ivoirité" and other on allegations of previous embezzlement. These measures led to the
   withdrawal of Western support and monitors. The RDR called for a boycott, setting the stage



                                                  - 50 -

   for low election turnout in a race between General Guei and Laurent Gbagbo, the candidate of
   the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI) and long time opponent of President Félix
   Houphouet-Boigny. When early polls results showed Gbagbo in lead, Guei stopped the
   process, claiming polling fraud- disbanded the election commission, and declared himself the
   winner. Within hours, Gbagbo supporters took to the streets of Abidjan. A bloody fight
   follows as crowd attacked the guards protecting the presidential palace. Many gendarmes and
   soldiers joined the fight against the junta government, forcing Guei to flee. Having gained the
   most votes, Gbagbo was declared the President. Later on, the RDR then took to the street
   calling for elections because the Supreme Court had declared their presidential candidate and
   all the candidates of the PDCI ineligible. More violence erupted as forces loyal to the
   government joined the FPI youth to attack the RDR demonstrators. Hundreds were killed in
   the few days that followed. Alassane D. Ouattara, the RDR party leader, called for peace and
   recognized the Gbagbo presidency. The crisis subsided and life began to return to normalcy.

5. On January 7, 2002, another coup attempt shattered the temporary calm. However, some
   weeks later, in the spring, local municipal elections were conducted without violence and with
   the participation of all political parties. The RDR, who had boycotted the presidential and
   legislative elections, won the most local seats, followed by the PDCI and FPI. Some economic
   aid from the EU began to return by the summer of 2001, and the IMF re-engaged the
   government. Questions surrounding severe human rights abuses by the government during the
   presidential and legislative elections remained unresolved (e.g., the mass grave at Yopougon),
   but day-to-day life began to return to normal. In August 2002, President Gbagbo formed a de
   facto government of national unity that included RDR party.

6. On September 19, 2002, rebellious exiled military personnel and conspirators in Abidjan
   simultaneously attacked ministers as well as government, military, and security facilities in
   Abijan, Bouake, and Korhogo. In Abidjan, government forces stopped the coup attempt
   within hours, but the attacked resulted in the deaths of Minister of Interior Emile Boga
   Doudou and several high-ranking military officers. General Guei was killed under still unclear
   circumstances. Almost immediately after the coup attempt, the government launched an
   aggressive security operation in Abidjan, where shanty-towns- occupied by thousands of
   immigrants and Ivorians- were searched for weapons and rebels. Government security forces
   burned down and demolished a number of these shanty-towns which displaced over 12,000
   people.

7. The failed coup attempt quickly evolved into a rebellion, splitting the country in two and
   escalating into the country's worst crisis since independence in 1960. The rebel group calling
   itself the "Patriotic Movement of Côte d`Ivoire" (MPCI), retained control in Bouake and
   Korhogo, and within two weeks moved to take the remainder of the northern part of the
   country. In mid-October 2002, Government and MPCI representatives signed a ceasefire and
   French military forces already present in the country agreed to monitor the ceasefire line. In
   later November 2002, the western part of the country became a new military front with the
   emergence of two new rebel groups, namely: the Ivorian Popular Movement for the Great
   West (MPIGO) and the Movement for Justice and Peace (MJP). MPIGO and MJP were allied
   with the MPCI, and the three groups subsequently called themselves the "New Forces." In
   January 2003 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) placed
   approximately 1,500 peace keeping troops from five countries--Senegal (commander),


                                                - 51 -

   Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Niger--on the ground beside the 3,000 French peacekeepers. The
   troops maintained the East-West ceasefire line dividing the country.

8. In late January 2003, the country's major political parties and the new forces signed the
   French- brokered Linas-Marcoussis Accord (LMA), agreeing to a power sharing national
   reconciliation government to include rebel New Forces representatives. The parties agreed to
   work together on modifying national identity, eligibility for citizenship, and land tenure laws
   which many observers see among the root causes of the conflict. The LMA also stipulated a
   UN Monitoring Committee to report on the implementation of the accord. Also in January
   2003, President Gbagbo appointed Seydou Diarra as the consensus Prime Minister. In March,
   2003, Prime Minister Diarra formed a government of national reconciliation of 41 ministers.
   The full government did not meet until mid­April, when national peacekeepers were in place
   to provide security for rebel New Forces ministers. On July 4, 2003, the government and New
   Forces militaries signed an "End of the War" declaration; recognized President Gbagbo`s
   authority; and vowed to work for the implementation of the LMA and a program of
   demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR). On September 13, 2003, 6 months
   after the formation of the Reconciliation Government, President Gbagbo named politically
   neutral Defense and Security Ministers, after consulting with the political parties and New
   Forces.

9. The year 2004 saw serious challenges to the Linas-Marcussis Accord. Violent flare-ups and
   political deadlock in the spring and summer led to the Accra III talks in Ghana. Signed on July
   30, 2004 the Accra III Agreement reaffirmed the goals of the LMA with specific deadlines
   and benchmarks for progress. Unfortunately, those deadlines--late September for legislative
   reform and October 15 for rebel disarmament--were not met by the parties. The ensuing
   political and military deadlock was not broken until November 4, when government forces
   initiated a bombing campaign of rebel targets in the North. On November 6, a government
   aircraft bombed a French military installation in Bouake. Claiming that the attack was
   deliberate (the Ivorian Government claim it was a mistake), French forces retaliated by
   destroying most of the Ivorian Air Force. Mayhem ensued for several days as anti-French
   forces mobs rioted in Abidjan and violence flared elsewhere. On November 15, 2004, the
   U.N. Security council issued an immediate arms embargo on Côte d`Ivoire and gave leaders
   one month to get the peace process back on track of face a travel ban and a freeze on their
   assets.

The Country's Health Sector

1. Cote d'Ivoire has consistently given high priority to human resources in the expenditure of
   public funds. It spends more than most African countries on health both as a share of GDP
   and in per capita terms. In 1960s and 1970s, Cote d'Ivoire invested heavily in health sector as
   its economy expanded significantly. , particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1996, the share
   of national budget allocated to health was 52 billion for operating expenditures and 42.7
   billion for investments (i.e. 8% of the total). Households contributed around 10 billion.
   Overall health expenditure ­ public and private ­ amounted to over CFAF 11,000 (equivalent
   to US$22) per inhabitant. As a result of these and other efforts, the country has a relatively
   well-developed health infrastructure: 1400 public health sector facilities, including four
   university hospitals, eight regional and general hospitals, 29 bases de sante rurale, 340
   maternities, and 700 dispensaries. The country's doctor per inhabitant ratio, 1/9,000, is much
   higher than in SubSaharan Africa (SSA) as a whole, 1/24,000.

2. The country has not enjoyed health improvements commensurate with its spending in the
   sector. In 1996, health outcomes in Cote d'Ivoire were below the regional average. The
   country's infant mortality rate of 96.3 was higher than the average of 70 for Sub Saharan
   Africa. The country had the highest HIV prevalence in West Africa. Its maternal mortality
   ratio was estimated around 1,000 per 100,000 live births in 1998, well above the Africa-wide
   average of 750. In the late 1980s, 16 percent of children under five years old suffered from
   stunting, and 7 percent from wasting. In 1996, this age group had a mortality rate of 160.6 per
   thousand. The fertility rate of 6.6 for 1992 was higher than for any other West African
   country.

3. Prior to the 1990s, the structure of public expenditures on health was gravely distorted. First,
   too much was spent on curative care relative to preventive care. Curative care is generally
   both expensive and a private good; preventive care generates many positive externalities, is
   much less expensive and is usually cost-effective, even though private demand is generally
   low. Second, too much was spent on salaries relative to nonsalary recurrent expenditure. The
   personnel share of recurrent expenditures grew from two-thirds to over three-fourths. Third,
   the share of medicines in recurrent public sector health expenditure declined continuously. The
   structure of health personnel in Cote d'Ivoire was distorted in the 1980s by inappropriate staff
   ratios and competency profiles. The structure was top-heavy, with low and deteriorating
   nurse-to-doctor ratios. The capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to plan, program and
   monitor health activities was weak, reflecting the lack of trained personnel as well as poor
   technical and financial information systems. Most curative health services were located in
   urban centers, and therefore were out of reach of majority of the population. Also, it appeared
   that the population did not expect benefits from consulting the existing curative services
   because the perceived quality of the service provided was poor.

4. At the beginning of 1990s, RCI started considering a change in its health policies. This
   facilitated by the environment created as a result of the implementation of a series of projects
   financed by the European Union, the World Bank, and other donors. Bank-financed projects
   included the Health and Demographic Project (HDP; 1986-1994), the Human Resources
   Management Technical Assistance Project (HRMTA; Cr. 2505-IVC), and the Human



                                               - 53 -

   Resources development Program (HRDP, 1991-1995). The HDP, a highly focused project,
   initiated a program of strengthening the management capacity and efficiency of health
   services. The HRMTA also provided support in this area. Under the HRDP-- which was a
   SECAL operation driven by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) rather than the MOH--progress
   was made on a series of issues, including pharmaceuticals, decentralization and region-level
   management, and cost recovery. The HRDP allowed the MOH to participate in a Bank
   research project, which helped develop tools for more effectively targeting public financial
   resources more effectively on the basis of geographically delimited poor areas. In October
   1994, public sector primary care activities were allowed to recover the costs of medicines and
   curative medical interventions. In rural areas where 90 percent of these revenues can be
   retained in blocked accounts to replenish drugs used in public sector facilities and finance
   locally determined operating costs.

5. On June 28, 1994, discussions were held on the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to
   Côte d'Ivoire. The CAS underscored the need to (a) give effective priority to basic services
   and better identify and target the poor, especially women; (b) adopt more decentralized
   approaches to service delivery; (c) address systematic issues of low quality, high cost and low
   access; and (d) make better use of NGO and donor support.

6. In 1995, RCI officially adopted a National Health Development Plan (PNDS or Plan National
   de Développement Sanitaire) for the period 1996-2005. The PNDS was prepared in parallel
   with which the.CAS. The plan aimed to improve the impact of the health system including
   through the provision of minimum packages of health services (PMA or Paquet Minimal
   d'Activités). The PMAs were to be provided by districts with technical support from the
   regional and national levels and in partnership with nongovernmental partners. The document
   called for the promotion of a combination of interventions at two levels, namely at the service
   delivery and management levels. The service delivery level was to be improved through
   provision of the minimum package of health services The MOH clarified the content of PMAs
   to be provided by the various levels of the health pyramid was clarified in the Arrêté No
   741/MSP/CAB dated December 9, 1996. The costing, financing, and introduction of PMAs in
   an initial series of health districts were the central operational objective of the project.
   Financing of PMA introduction at the local level was to be driven by request from health
   districts formulated as district level development plans. It was understood that success with
   the PMAs implied not only delivery of quality health care services but also the availability of
   financial accessibility of a limited number of essential drugs and acceptable levels of utilization
   by beneficiaries.

7. On July 11, 1996, a Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed between the Republic
   of Côte d'Ivoire (RCI) and IDA for the execution of a project known as the Integrated Health
   Services Development Project (PDSSI). The project was developed on the basis of 1994 CAS
   and the 1996-2005 PNDS. Its overall goal was to contribute to the implementation of the
   PNDS, including through the establishment of the foundation for universal availability of
   cost-effective, technically and culturally appropriate health services that are affordable and
   sustainable to the people and the country as a whole. One central objectives of the PDSSI was
   to expand availability of the PMA. The project represented the first three-year phase of a
   process, which the MOH had already initiated with the establishment of a set of studies and
   pilot projects using a Project Preparation Fund (PPF). The process was expected to lead to a


                                               - 54 -

   fully integrated sector development and expenditure program.

8. The PDSSI, which was viewed as a key element of the Government's development plan for
   the health sector, was fundamentally conceived as an institutional development program. Its
   emphasis was put on making change in service delivery so as to benefit to priority target
   populations. At the management level (i.e., national headquarters, regions, districts, and
   departments), the PDSSI was to support an institution-building program of action research,
   studies, training, and implementation of pilot projects and ensure execution and effective
   follow-up on an institutional assessment of the organization, including strengthening of its
   informatics capacity. A gradual change in perspective in the Ministry was planned, with
   increasing attention to demand variables and beneficiary perspectives. Private voluntary
   providers and community associations would be engaged to the maximum feasible extent.
   Over the 3-year period of project execution, the groundwork would be laid for a substantial
   increase in voluntary private insurance, to complement the planned mutual insurance program,
   and for the gradual reallocation of priority in public sector financial and human resources from
   the tertiary to the primary and secondary levels. The country expressed satisfaction as to the
   feasibility and priority of the PDSSI. On May 28, 1996, the RCI sent a letter to IDA declaring
   its commitment to the project. The project was approved on June 27, 1996 and became
   effective on December 16, 1996. The DCA was amended three times--on November 12,
   1998; on July 18, 2000; and on December 5, 2003. The closing date of the project, originally
   fixed for September 30, 2000, was extended three times, first to September 30, 2000, then to
   March 31, 2003, and finally to December 31, 2004.

Additional Annex 10. The Ministry of Health's Contribution to the Report

The Integrated Health Services Development Project (PDSSI) in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire
(RCI) was initiated and developed in the context the economic recovery that followed the
devaluation of the Franc CFA in 1994 and as a follow-up of the Human Resources Development
Program (HRDP). The PDSSI has been presented as critical tool for the implementation of the
1996-2005 National Health Development Plan (PNDS). The plan was formally launched during
the Donor Roundtable in June 1996 in Abidjan. The World Bank made a strong commitment to
support the PNDS. The PSDSSI has concretized this pledge.

Changes in the Political, Economic, and Social Context Between 1996 and 2004

Between 1995, when the PDSSI was identified and 2004, when the project was closed, the
political, economic, and social context for the project in RCI has gone through four phases: (a)
from January 1995 to June 1996; (b) from July 1996 to December 1999; (c) from January 2000
to October 2001; and (d) from November 2001 to December 2004.

The period from 1995 to 1996 was characterized by the completion of the Human Resources
Development Project (HRDP). This project has outlined the reforms needed in social sectors,
especially health. It has also established the foundations for the reestablishment of sectoral
dialogue for future World Bank involvement. The improvements in the macro-economic
framework that followed the 1994 devaluation of the Franc CFA created favorable circumstances
for substantial World Bank involvement in the health sector after a structural adjustment period
supported under the HRDP. Following successive Consultative Group meetings in Washington
and Paris in 1995, the Health Sector committed itself to outlining a 10-year plan, which eventually
became the National Health Development Plan 1996-2005 (PNDS). This plan was shared with
donors during the Roundtable held on June 10-11, 1996 in Abidjan. Concurrently, a dialogue with
the Bank led to the outline of a major operation, known as the Integrated Health Services
Development Program (PDSSI).

The period between 1996 and 1999 saw the launch of the PNDS and PDSSI in a promising
macro-economic environment. A real momentum for reform existed during that period, with
PDSSI as the main source of financing for the first 3-year period of PNDS implementation.
Important sectoral and national events occurred during the final year of that period. In June 1999,
a conflict with the European Union led to the immediate replacement of the Head of the Health
Department and the arrest of several officials at the Ministry of Health.          As a result, the
implementation of both PNDS and PDSSI was severely affected.              In December 1999, the
Government was toppled in a military coup. This new situation, which immediately followed the
first project restructuring, was further complicated by a new change of leadership at the Ministry
of Health.

The third period was marked by the establishment of a Government of National Security, the
organization of presidential elections and the installation, in March 2001, of the first Government
of the Second Republic. During this time, disbursements were suspended for 14 months and the
project was restructured a second time. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health (MOH) was crippled
by an unprecedented level of institutional instability. This governmental entity was transformed


                                                - 56 -

into a "junior ministry" with very confusing relations to the Ministry. Furthermore, two officials
were successively assigned to lead the Health Department.

The fourth and last period saw the eruption of civil war on September 19, 2002, and the
establishment of a National Reconciliation Government in the context of the Linas Marcoussis
Agreements. The MOH became a Ministry of State. During this period, the project was also
restructured in June 2003 in Paris and in June 2004, disbursements were unexpectedly suspended.

Changes in the Institutional Framework of the Ministry of Health During Project
Implementation

Between 1996 and 2004, the institutional framework of the Health Ministry was highly unstable.
A total of seven Health Ministers were successively named and five organizational charts were
drawn up for an average 10 months. This combined with a long series of changes among
representatives and key actors involved in the project within the Programs, Units, National and
Regional Directorates as well as Health Districts. Two Health Districts (Tiassalé and Guiglo)
involved in project implementation were subdivided into four separate health districts (Tiassalé,
Grand-Lahou, Guiglo and Duékoué). To take into account the new entities just created.
(Grand-Lahou and Duékoué), the activities initially planned had to be doubled and costs
readjusted. Finally, in the context of post-conflict activities in the Western part of the country,
Toulepleu was integrated into the project as an additional health district.

In 1999, during implementation of PNDS, a unit was created and charged with coordination and
monitoring of PNDS. A Project Implementation Office (BEP) was also set-up within the Ministry
of Health. Later on, the office was renamed the Project Coordination Office (BCP).            This
innovation did not alter the project's institutional framework, which remained in compliance with
the Document Credit Agreement (DCA). The agreement has provided for the establishment of the
Coordination Unit within the Office of the Minister.

Summary of Project Objectives

As a part of the National Health Development Plan 1996-2005 (PNDS), the PDSSI aimed to: (a)
increase access to and use of health services; (b) provide such services to the population on a
sustainable basis; and (c) help the Ministry of Health to better analyze health issues and to
develop, monitor and assess policies, strategies, and programs.

These initial objectives were reviewed in August 1999 during the first project-restructuring
mission. The exercise was carried out with the view to taking into account the trends that had
emerged at the time. Following the review, the project's goal read as follows: to support, in the
context of PNDS, the development of the care system in Côte d'Ivoire through reforms that
would increase access to and use of health care services in health districts, particularly in
Reproductive Health, Family Planning, STIs, and HIV/AIDS. More specifically, it was now
supposed to: (a) develop and implement a framework to improve the performance of health
district management teams; (b) improve health system results through the establishment of a
Minimum Activity Package (PMA), especially Reproductive Health and Family Planning services
and activities to fight against HIV/AIDS, STIs and Tuberculosis; (c) improve health sector



                                                 - 57 -

management and financing mechanisms; and (d) carry out the General Population and Housing
Census (RGPH) and analyze the results. These objectives were maintained until the end of the
project even though new components and activities were added during project implementation.

Summary of Project Components

Initially, the PDSSI had four components, namely:           a Minimum Activity Package (PMA);
Reproductive Health; Planning and Management; Information and Health. Following the first
project restructuring in 1998 however, the PDSSI's components were redefined as follows:
   l PMA and strengthening of Departmental Directorates;
   l Reproductive Health/Family Planning and STIs/AIDS/Tuberculosis;
   l Sector Management and Financing; and
   l General Population and Housing Census (RGPH).


This restructuring thus eliminated the "Information and Health" component.

During the March-April 2002 supervision mission, additional activities were added to the main
project components as follows:
   l Minimum Activity Package (PMA) and Strengthening of the Departmental
        Directorates. This component includes activities to (a) prepare and implement an action
        plan for carrying out new building and restoration work planned for the four health
        districts targeted by the project;   (b) intensify action to strengthen COGES with an
        emphasis on their legal status and autonomy; (c) launch and implement a
        performance-based management system; and (d) include the three Regional Health
        Directorates in charge of providing technical support to the four health districts targeted
        by the project and prepare and implement their action plans.
   l Reproductive Health/Family Planning and STDs/AIDS/Tuberculosis. The role of this
        component was to provide support for the preparation of an HIV/AIDS project (MAP)
        under IDA financing, including (a) pilot initiatives at community level and with NGOs; (b)
        office equipment; (c) a study on medical waste management; (d) planning/coordination
        meetings; (e) technical support for the Task Force; (f) any other activities to be identified
        in consultation with the World Bank Team, charged with the preparation of Cote d'Ivoire
        MAP.
   l Health Sector Management and Financing.                 This component includes       (a) PNDS
        mid-term review; (b) capacity building for the Permanent Technical Secretariat in charge
        of coordinating PNDS; (c) a survey of beneficiaries; and (d) support for the preparation of
        the health section of the PRSP.

In June 2003, the last project restructuring was an opportunity to take into account new
components related to the Government's general political trends as well as needs created by the
crisis and changes in the situation. The restructuring resulted in the inclusion of new components
related to changes in the national situation and to the crisis, such as decentralization, post-conflict
activities. Some activities were eliminated from the project.

Institutional Framework and Organization of the Project Within the Ministry of Health

The PDSSI was implemented in compliance with the terms of the DCA. These terms provided
for the establishment of a Monitoring Committee chaired by the Minister of Health and
component leaders. The main mandate of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was to facilitate
project implementation by providing general and technical support to project components. The
various positions stipulated under this unit were filled. Some adjustments were made following
the first project restructuring: the position of Project Coordinator became a technical position.
This change was made to take into consideration the needs of various project components.

Project Design, Implementation, Results, and Impact


Assessment of Project Design

The PDSSI was a follow-up to the HRDP, which helped introduce major sectoral reforms
between 1991 and 2004 in areas such as drug policy, decentralization of health management as
well as sector financing including through cost recovery. The PDSSI was designed at a time of
favorable trends for economic recovery following a 50 percent devaluation of the Franc CFA in
January 1994. Its goal was to deepen reforms initiated under the HRDP. During the Consultative
Group meeting of June 15 and 16 in Paris, the Government took the opportunity to specify its
sector strategy and consider the preparation and implementation of the PNDS.

The sector dialogue between the World Bank and the Government following the Paris
Consultative Group meeting helped outline a program and consider World Bank support for the
implementation of this program. The terms of this program are detailed in a Policy Letter sent to
the President of the World Bank on May 28, 1996).


Analysis of Project Implementation Methods

The PDSSI was generally implemented in compliance with World Bank Directives dealing with
procurement and financial management of loans. Beyond the obligations of the Monitoring
Committee, internal periodical reviews, World Bank supervision missions and the Annual
Accounting Audits formed the basis of project monitoring. In addition, the PCU was forced to
constantly adapt to national directives in terms of public finance management and procurement.
The establishment, in 1999, of the Integrated Public Finance Management System (SIGFIP)
required project managers to adapt further. Therefore, the implementation manual designed at the
start of the project was replaced by management platforms and tools, which were developed and
introduced in the context of the SIGFIP.

The project sought to develop the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health, especially the
development of skills to implement specific component activities. This meant that central and
remote actors had to be heavily involved in starting, implementing and monitoring planned
activities. A certain level of enthusiasm--spurred by the direct involvement of the Office of the
Minister--was observed early on in the project. However, this spirit weakened with time for



                                                - 59 -

various reasons. Procedures for managing the project at the decentralized level (health districts)
were absent and ill defined at the start of the project. They were discussed throughout the
project's life, but these discussions failed to establish an efficient and direct financing system for
health districts.   None of the options that were considered (subaccounts within the special
account, payment of advances financed by the national counterpart, etc.) could be implemented.
As a result, one of the major reforms anticipated under the project--which was to establish
performance contracts between headquarters and districts--could not be introduced. The PDSSI
has not been able to put to practice the performance-based district management approach, among
other things. This will certainly count as one of the major failures of the PDSSI.

Without questioning the role of international consulting firms in assisting with procurement,
Health Ministry officials express mixed views of those that were hired in the context of the
PDSSI. While the relevance of this assistance at the start of the project is understood, the issue of
a quick transfer of the responsibilities of these firms to national officials will need to be examined
in future. It was shown that, as far as the PDSSI is concerned, local professionals could have
efficiently carried out these tasks at a lower cost.

The Government appreciates the excellent work of the National Office for Technical Studies and
Development (BNEDT) despite some difficulties experienced by this national facility because of
the general situation. These difficulties are compounded by the impossibility for IDA credit to
finance BNETD. This issue will need to be reviewed with the intent to open access to this
financing.     Should it prove impossible to finance BNETD directly from project funds,
consideration should be given to the option so that the loan could contribute to strengthening the
capacity of this Office as it assists in the implementation of investment projects.

At the start of the project, the Directorate for Infrastructure, Equipment and Maintenance
(DIEM) certainly had the skills and technical capacity needed to play a primary role in
procurement. This option was not given to the DIEM despite the will and advocacy of Ministry
officials in that regard. Only one focal point was assigned within the DIEM to take part in the
procurement process in collaboration with BNETD and SGS, the consulting firm. When this
focal point left for another job, DIEM became completely excluded from ongoing activities,
specifically those related to civil works.        This weakness was partly compensated by the
reassignment of the person who conceived the "Health Map" component to the Coordination
Unit. This solution will not address the issue of regaining control of the existing portfolio in order
to complete civil works as well as the procurement of equipment commissioned in the context of
post-conflict management.

Main Results from Different Components

The PDSSI aimed essentially to support PNDS implementation, specifically to achieve several
reforms meant to deeply transform Côte d'Ivoire's health system by 2000, which was the first
5-year middle point of PNDS implementation.             They were mostly institutional development
activities and their results up to now can seem mixed. There is no doubt that PDSSI helped
introduce, to a certain extent, a dynamic of change in various key parts of the sector. However,
results will need to be assessed in light of the unfavorable circumstances that prevailed throughout
project implementation.


                                                  - 60 -

During implementation, the project experienced a series of events, which, in the end, had a
negative impact on its overall performance.                The initial difficulties, coupled with
misunderstandings between the Government and the World Bank about a number of key issues
(procurement assistance, the role of BNEDT, the role of DIEM, the assignment of officials, etc.)
contributed to slowing down substantially achievements expected in the first few years of project
implementation. Later on, the successive adjustments and restructurings were further
compounded by new and unexpected external factors, including: political instability following the
military coup, suspension of disbursements, which lasted 14 months the first time, deterioration of
the sociopolitical situation following war, institutional instability at the Department of Health from
1999 to 2002 and a weakening of the country's economy.

Despite this unfavorable environment, several components of the project can be credited with
several positive results. With respect to the PMAs, several tools were developed (including the
Methodology for the Preparation of Health Development Plans at District Level, PMA Directives,
Supervision Handbook, Training Guidelines, Organizational Charts). The PDSSI contributed
substantially to the strengthening of the institutional framework for the fight against AIDS and
helped catalyze the multisectoral approach, including NGO involvement and capacity building for
the main actors involved in fighting the disease. In terms of reproductive health and family
planning, the project helped open several service centers and supplied them with contraceptives
over a long period of time, in addition to the financial support given to AIBEF. In terms of sector
management and financing, the project carried out the last public expenses review for the health
sector and completed the feasibility study for a pilot mutual benefit health insurance scheme.
Several other important results were achieved by the various components.

The question remains in terms of reaching the goals of the project and the impact of results
achieved on the development of the Côte d'Ivoire health system. It is worthwhile to determine the
extent to which the project has helped improve the health conditions of the population. While
waiting for a final evaluation and a more formal assessment of project results in terms of efficiency
and effectiveness, the PDSSI seems to have, in fact, helped move along reforms stated in the
PNDS. The project has also significantly assisted the sector in getting ready to better consider
future challenges. Constraints to project implementation and the lack of concrete results do not
take anything away from the work done. All recommendations to be made will need to take into
account the real delays in implementation. The PDSSI was practically inert for three years before
activities actually started and disbursements were suspended for about twenty-four months.
Numerous internal factors also weakened project implementation.

Project Coordination and Management

The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was in charge of technical coordination and administrative
and financial management of the project, in compliance with World Bank procedures. Starting in
1999, the unit also complied with national procedures adopted within the Integrated Public
Finance Management System (SIGFIP).

At the start of the project, difficulties emerged in terms of procurement and financial management.
Some management weaknesses were corrected through measures taken during the first project


                                                 - 61 -

restructuring. Generally, starting in 2000, project coordination and administrative and financial
management improved sharply. On several occasions, project staff showed initiative and acted
proactively, particularly when disbursements were on hold.             To a certain extent, these
improvements helped make up for the delays that occurred at the start of the project. Indeed,
while the project was initially expected to last four years, implementation ended up lasting 8 years.
Considering the initial three-year inertia and the cumulative 24 months of suspension, it is not an
overstatement to say that, between 2000 and 2004, the project effectively made up for the delays
and this, despite the fact that it was actually implemented over a shorter period than was
anticipated initially.

The Government acknowledges the important role played by the PCU and congratulates the team
for the disbursement levels it achieved (85 percent) despite the constraints it faced throughout
project implementation. Everything points to the fact that, had it not been for the suspensions and
the successive socioeconomic crises, the project would have achieved a disbursement rate very
close to 100 percent and completed all planned activities.

Critical Analysis of the World Bank's Involvement in the Project

The performance of World Bank­financed projects is closely related, to a certain extent, to the
efficiency of World Bank follow-up and the quality of relationships between national and Bank
experts. Two additional elements need to be considered: first, steps prior to expenses and which
require prior approval from the World Bank; and, on the other hand, special account
replenishment channels (processing of Requests for Fund Withdrawal, RFW).

The start of PDSSI was particularly difficult due to the size of the project and a weak
understanding and grasp of World Bank procedures on the part of national staff involved in
implementation. Despite a great willingness to learn on the part of Ministry of Health (MOH)
professionals during project preparation and in the early stages of implementation, Bank staff
often lacked flexibility in that regard. The insistence that documents submitted for approval should
be perfect seemed excessive to MOH staff who, in some cases, ended up losing interest in the
project. This prevented the development of mutual trust at the start of the project.

Lengthy Bank processing delays were constantly cited as causing delays in implementing several
key project activities. This was particularly the case for procurement early on in the project. At a
much later stage of project implementation, the assignment, by the Bank, of a Procurement
Specialist in Abidjan proved effective. During the last stages of project implementation, The
Bank made an effort to strengthen its team at the Abidjan Regional Office. Nevertheless, several
issues had to be referred to Washington for direct processing by headquarters staff. The long
delays, throughout project implementation, in processing RFWs also contributed to slowing down
implementation. In the case of PDSSI, the processing of RFWs took an average of 6 weeks.




                                                 - 62 -

Critical Analysis of the Government's Action in the Project

The Government of Côte d'Ivoire had high hopes for the achievements of the PDSSI and the part
it could play in meeting the needs of the ultimate beneficiaries in the targeted health districts. It
was therefore committed, through the Ministry of Health (MOH), to support the project's
implementation. Representatives of many ministries participated effectively to the project's
Monitoring Committee, in compliance with the decree that created it and defined its operation.

The state's financial contribution (Government's counterpart financing) was substantial, despite
constraints related to the economic crisis. Throughout the project, the Ministry of the Economy
and Finances approved all the exemptions necessary for the procurement of imported goods and
equipment (customs duties, fees, etc.). Criticisms of delays caused by SIGFIP led the Minister of
the Economy and Finances to take appropriate measures to facilitate and speed up disbursements
(commitment outside SIGFIP, cash advances, assignment of managers, etc.) A committee was
established under the coordination of the General Directorate for the Economy to monitor
disbursements of projects within emergency programming, including PDSSI.

Unfortunately, however, there were weaknesses and deficiencies within the Project Monitoring
Committee. The committee only met a few times and actually had a very limited role in project
implementation. This situation is probably related to the institutional instability that prevailed
within the MOH, which chaired the committee.          Among the various ministers, who were
successively assigned to lead the Health Department, many did not keep their positions long
enough to understand the project and take a closer interest in its implementation. Because if the
size of the project, however, the project staff kept the ministers informed regularly of
implementation progress.

Another weakness in the involvement of Government of Côte d'Ivoire during project
implementation came from delays in setting-up Expense Control Mechanisms for health districts.
In fact, the issue of a decentralized financial management within the project was not given
sufficient attention during project preparation and launch. All attempts resulted in failure for
various reasons (delays in issuing the decree creating the Control Mechanisms; assigning
managers; or agreeing on how to deal with the issue of private bank accounts, minutes for
managers' assignments, suspension of special accounts, transfer of funds to managers,
disbursement procedures, circulation of financial data from and to the PCU). The World Bank
shares some of the responsibility in these weaknesses. Indeed, one of the solutions considered by
project staff was to request that subaccounts be opened for health districts involved in the project.
This approach would have allowed districts direct access to financial resources but this suggestion
was not approved by the World Bank.

Analysis of the Project's Achievements and Contributions

The PDSSI project's achievements and contributions are twofold. A first group of project
achievements are related to reforms of the health system in Côte d'Ivoire. These include
institutional development activities dealing with the building of management capacity within the
sector, PMA activities, health district operations, sector financing, coverage of health risks,
partnership experiences with civil society, curriculum reform for medical and paramedical training,
drug policy, capacity building for health information as well as institutional support for the fight
against HIV/AIDS. The second group of achievements is related to material contributions,
especially contraceptives and other drugs, equipment and infrastructure.

PNDS introduced several major reforms. During the last 8 years, the PDSSI was the preferred
instrument to push for such reforms. Thus, it is in the area of reforms that the project was most
efficient. The project outlined several paths, which now need to be either deepened or included in
future considerations.     As health districts became operational, PMA training modules and
supervision tools were developed and made available nationally. Unfortunately, the collaborative
framework with civil society led to mixed results. The curricula for medical and paramedical
training have been reformed, but the reforms remains blocked due to a lack of financing.
Conversely, issues related to the decentralized financial management and the development of a
health map were not addressed. Activities carried out in relation to sector financing have not lead
to satisfactory results. It was unrealistic to expect, on one hand, effective introduction of all the
reforms that were anticipated in under the PDSSI, and, on the other hand, completion of the
reforms that were introduced and supported by the project , within the proposed short timeframe.

In terms of material contributions, project efficiency was much weaker. Procurement constraints
and, more generally, implementation delays related to factors that emerged throughout the project
life prevented, in many cases, the project from reaching anticipated objectives. In particular, civil
works were not completed in most cases. This was also the case for the equipment of health
facilities that were rehabilitated or built within the project. This had implications in terms of the
credibility of health officials as well as future budgetary resources.

Analysis of Achieved Objectives

The PDSSI aimed to provide quality basic health services through the development of health
districts.   It was also supposed to support the institutional development of the MOH and
introduce the reforms needed to deeply transform the system and the sector. The goal was to
substantially improve the health of the population, especially the most vulnerable. Activities and
components were developed in order to meet specific objectives.

Given the changes that occurred within the project and the various constraints that emerged
throughout project implementation, it is almost certain that most specific objectives were not met.
There is even a concern that the sociopolitical events that took place during project
implementation may have led to a degradation of the health situation. This could be the case for
health districts located in conflict areas. This raises the issue of the efficiency of activities carried
out within the PDSSI with the exception of the General Population and Housing Census (RGPH).



                                                  - 64 -

Objectively, despite some achievements, the overall efficiency assessment is highly unfavorable.

This assessment of the PDSSI's project efficiency should be tempered by taking into account the
unfavorable circumstances that occurred. Never before has a project generated so much hope and
ambition and, at the same time, so much frustration and uncertainty. Assessing project efficiency
becomes even more delicate and complex considering that the health districts that were to benefit
from PMA delivery were not able to obtain the inputs needed to reach the objectives assigned to
them. Beyond developing tools and some minor activities during the very last few months of the
project, health districts were unable to access additional financing needed to support PMA
delivery because of a lack of an adequate mechanism to channel funds to them. Assessing project
efficiency becomes more complex when considering the circumstances of project completion
(second disbursement suspension since June 2003 and constraints related to Government
financing).
