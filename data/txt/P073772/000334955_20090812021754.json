follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was substantial, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: stakeholders welcomed the opportunity to\n            conduct bottom-up planning under the project and many\n            believed that establishing the capacity to conduct evidence\n            based planning was a major achievement of Health Work\n            Services (HWS). Participants at the central level felt that\n            the Minister of Health (MOH) components will have been\n            stronger had there been more concerted efforts on behalf of\n            MOH during project preparation. Complex projects like HWS\n            require a lot of learning and adaptation, particularly\n            during the first years of implementation, and a longer\n            implementation period is warranted. Workshop participants at\n            all levels agreed that clear objectives and indicators are\n            important for guiding project implementation and to keep it\n            focused. Central level participants mentioned that the\n            objectives of the central components were not well defined.\n            The unclear role of the province level at the beginning of\n            decentralization contributed to the rather loose description\n            of the provincial component of the project. Participants\n            confirmed that districts appreciated being invited to\n            participate in designing the district component during\n            project preparation. Participants agreed that performance\n            during implementation was better where the project appraisal\n            document (PAD) clearly described the scope of project activities."}, "docdt": "2009-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
