The\n            project will adopt mitigation measures in designing\n            specifications for hospitals to minimize disruption of\n            natural habitat and vegetation, redesign of building layout\n            in flood prone areas, restrict work to daylight hours to\n            limit noise and dust emissions, prohibit use of building\n            materials containing asbestos.
