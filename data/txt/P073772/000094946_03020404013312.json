This report\n            focuses on specific measures to safeguard isolated\n            vulnerable peoples, or IVP. The latter are individuals or\n            communities including but not limited to indigenous people\n            that share similar characteristics such as being outside the\n            mainstream of political and economic power, physical\n            isolation, language and cultural barriers, or part of an\n            ethnic minority. By targeting the welfare of IVP the project\n            addresses health care for some of the poorest segments of\n            the society. Approaches to developing the capacity of the\n            government to collect data on IVPs as a discrete group will\n            be incorporated into the project's implementation. The\n            project will ensure that measures are incorporated into\n            proposals that involve stakeholders in project design and\n            implementation, including training for participatory\n            planning. The report also advocates that community groups be\n            provided an opportunity to give feedback directly to the\n            Bank on implementation issues to enhance transparency. It is\n            expected that improved transparency and community\n            participation will reduce the incidence of\n            \"unofficial\" charges and user fees. Infrastructure\n            will be developed as appropriate in remote areas to improve\n            access for isolated communities. Options to be considered\n            include the construction of more health centers and the use\n            of mobile health units. Additionally, the project will\n            consider options for increased recruitment and training of\n            health workers from IVP communities as well as developing\n            culturally appropriate approaches to working with IVP. By\n            improving the quality of health care providers, it is\n            expected that there will be an opportunity to build trust\n            among communities. Lastly, the project will support\n            developing culturally appropriate communications materials\n            in order to improve the access of IVP to health information;\n            option for incorporating traditional beliefs, medicines, and\n            health care practices into the training of health care\n            workers will be considered."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
