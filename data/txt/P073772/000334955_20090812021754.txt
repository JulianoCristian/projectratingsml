1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Health Work Services Project / Provincial Health Project III (known also as HWS
Project or PHP III) became effective 31 December 2003, during a period of rapid
political and administrative reform in Indonesia following the Asian Financial Crisis, the
downfall of President Suharto, and the Reformasi movement. At the province and district
levels PHP III focused on West Sumatera, Jambi, West Kalimantan and East Kalimantan.
PHP I (Lampung and Yogyakarta) became effective in August 2000 and PHP II (North
Sumatera, West Java and Banten) in April 2002. All three projects aimed at helping the
government implement "effective decentralization" of the health sector.

Sector-related CAS goals for PHP III were to (i) promote broad-based growth and
income generation; (ii) support decentralization of public sector services and the
involvement of the private sector in health care delivery; and (iii) contribute to improved
health status of the population.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO as stated in the PAD (dated 19 May 2003) was to support health sector
decentralization in four provinces for sustainable financing and client-centered delivery
of health services. More specifically, the main objectives were to:

    1. Improve financing and delivery of essential health services in the provinces of
       Jambi, East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, and West Sumatera to enhance access
       to care, quality of care and health outcomes at the district level.

    2. Strengthen health workforce policy, management and development in a
       decentralized context in order to improve allocative efficiencies and equity in the
       distribution and use of health resources in the districts.

    3. Empower the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of National Education
       (MONE), and the Indonesian Medical Association (IMA), the three key
       stakeholders in the sector, through assistance to redefine their roles and
       responsibilities vis-à-vis health work force policy, planning and management, and
       through building their institutional capacity for effective stewardship in fulfilling
       the functions of policy making, legislation, regulation, quality assurance/control
       and technical assistance to provinces and districts.

The PAD listed two sets of performance indicators.
(1) Non-project-specific indicators included:
    a. Health outcome indicators of Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Under-five Mortality
       Rate (U5MR), Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), and other locally relevant
       disease-specific indicators (Tuberculosis, Malaria, HIV/AIDS prevalence rates).



                                             1

    b. Tracer health services indicators, including proportion of pregnant women
        receiving at least four ante-natal visits, proportion of births attended by skilled
        health personnel, and immunization coverage rate.
    c. Health service utilization indicators, including outpatient visit rate, admission
        rate, average length of stay, and bed occupancy ratio.

(2) Project-specific indicators were largely institutional and organizational in nature, and
included:
    a. Preparation and use of a Health Development Master Plan for all capital
        investment in human, financial and physical resources.
    b. Design and implementation of new provincial and district level institutional
        mechanisms (District Health Councils (DHC), Joint Health Councils (JHC), and
        Technical Review Teams (TRT)) for increased pluralism and client involvement
        in policy making, planning and system management.
    c. Design and implementation of financial mechanisms at the district level (block
        funding) for increased efficiency in resource allocation.
    d. Proportion of districts reaching per capita health expenditures threshold of Rp
        51,000 in 2002 prices, or 15 percent of the total local government spending,
        except in East Kalimantan where it is to reach 8 percent, excluding the resources
        allocated for civil works and equipment.1

The Loan Agreement and Development Credit Agreement (signed 1 October 2003)
established the following performance indicators:

(1) By 30 June 2008, in each of the project provinces:

    a. Under-five mortality rate to decrease to 34 per 1,000 live births so as to stay on
        course with the Millennium Development Goal target of 2/3 reduction by 2015.
    b. The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel to increase to 90
        percent.


1This PI is not clear in the PAD but it is clarified in the DCA.

                                                         2

    c. The proportion of pregnant women receiving at least four ante-natal visits to
        increase to 90 percent.
    d. The lowest income quintile of population to have increased their service
        utilization by 50 percent, measured as the number of out-patient visits per capita
        relative to baseline data.
    e. The share of local government health spending to reach 15 percent of total local
        government spending, except in East Kalimantan where it is to reach 8 percent, or
        at least Rp. 51,000 per capita in 2002 prices.

(2) By 30 June 2008, at the national level:
    a. IMA to have established an institutional structure and instruments for a national
        medical examination and certification, for formal, graduate and continuing
        medical education.
    b. The proportion of medical students in Mulawarman and Andalas Universities
        surveyed as satisfied with the curriculum and education provided to be at least 80
        percent.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO were not revised. The Midterm Review (MTR) noted the need to simplify the
project where possible and better focus some of its activities; this resulted in more
emphasis on improving maternal and child health status among the project's activities.
The re-focusing of project activities was done so that the District Grant components
would primarily refer to the PDO indicators in the credit agreement. The justification was
to help districts focus as the MTR found too much fragmentation which in part was due
to lack of focus during project design with regards to the District Grants which were
supposed to be used for many reforms.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries were identified in the PAD as some 13.7 million residents in the 4
provinces, including 3 million poor. The poor were expected to benefit from the Project
through improved access to better quality health services.

The project would also benefit current and future health care providers, medical students
and faculties, and flow-on effects would benefit the whole sector.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had 3 main components focusing respectively on the district, province and
central levels of administration (Table 1). The design built on the previous PHP I and
PHP II projects while adding a new component on human resources development.

Component A ­ District Health Offices and Health Facilities (US$ 374.67 million;
Loan/Credit amount: US$ 74.5 million)

Component A1. Improved access to and quality of health services
Bank support would be based on (a) health development master plan and annual health
plan developed by district, endorsed by DHC, approved by JHC; and (b) use of block
grants of District Funding Allocation (DFA) for increased efficiency in resource
allocation and utilization. In addition districts would be expected to participate in a pilot
program (under Component C) to train health care specialists, to improve the quality of
hospital-based care; and West Sumatera and West Kalimantan districts would be
expected to pilot a family-physician model of service delivery (also under Component C).

Component A2. Project management
This component would be the responsibility of the District Implementation Unit (DIU),
supervised by the District Bappeda.

Component B ­ Provincial Health Offices and Health Facilities (US$ 28.96 million;
Loan/Credit amount: US$ 9.07 million)

Component B1. Health workforce development
Health workforce planning and management to be supported by (a) adapting the
minimum service standards to local conditions; (b) determining the numbers, skills, and
specializations of existing and future health workforces needed at provincial and district
levels; and (c) implementing measures to ensure appropriate numbers of adequately
trained staff in the health facilities. In addition the project would support studies, pilot
tests, and operational research concerning incentives, motivation, performance appraisals,
etc., for improving workforce performance.

Component B2. Health system coordination, planning and management
The PHO's role was to strengthen the performance of districts in the following areas: (a)
workforce development; (b) guidelines for health information and education campaigns;
(c) epidemiological monitoring and response; (d) cross-sectoral cooperation; and (e)
health system financing.



                                                 4

Component B3. Project management
The project would support a Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU).

Component C ­ Central Level (US$ 25.74 million; Loan/Credit amount: US$ 22.03
million)

Component C1. Effective health system stewardship (MOH)
The project would support the Board for Development and Empowerment of Human
Health Resources (BDEHHR), including its different centers (for Health Human
Resources Management, Health Manpower Education, Health Training, and
Empowerment of Health Profession and International Workforce). MOH's capacity
strengthened to (a) fulfill its human resource development responsibilities; (b) improve
the quality of pre-service education programs; (c) ensure the quality of in-service training
provided at the district level; and (d) promote self-regulation of the nursing and
midwifery professions. The project would also support IMA through MOH.

Component C2. Enhancing the quality of medical education (MONE)
The project would support MONE to: (a) increase its institutional capacity to organize
and manage medical education; (b) improve the quality of formal medical education; and
(c) enhance the learning and teaching environment for both undergraduate and post-
graduate medical education and training.

1.6 Revised Components

The components of the project were not revised.

1.7 Other significant Changes

No other significant changes took place. However, by 3 June 2008 the project had only
disbursed 46.6 percent of the original project allocation. An extension on was entertained
by both the Bank and the GOI, but the Government revised its decision late in 2008 and
the project closed on 31 December as originally planned. In December 2008, The
Government requested cancelation of Project funds amounted USD 48.9 million (Loan
30.8, and Credit 18.1) which was later approved by the Bank.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Context

A key factor which subsequently affected implementation and outcomes was that project
preparation was completed at a time when the Government's own policies and
mechanisms regarding decentralization were still very much "a work in progress." The




                                              5

1999 Laws on Local Autonomy (which came into effect 1 January 2001)2 laid out the
broad framework but many details were unclear and soon became the subject of intense
discussion and negotiation. The Bank's background analysis of pre-decentralization
problems in the health sector was extensive, and the Bank also developed a deep
appreciation of the possible risks and opportunities for the sector posed by
decentralization (based on its international experience and consultation with Indonesian
officials and experts), but no one could predict with confidence exactly how the
definition and practical allocation of responsibilities for health across the main levels of
government would evolve. Central level agencies were often worried about losing
authority while many districts were keen to test the limits to their new powers. Much
discussion in the provinces during early project preparation focused on lending
conditions and the respective roles central line ministries, especially MOF, would play in
project implementation; provinces and districts were interested in being involved in the
project conditional on what they perceived as a satisfactory resolution of these issues; in
the last analysis such resolution would depend more on the evolution of national policy
than on any agreements specific to the project. The result was a project design that tried
to accommodate the interests of a range of organizational and political interests at the
expense of logical consistency and overall cohesion. The project documents have been
aptly described as pot-pourri.

Limitations

A review of the PAD reveals a number of weaknesses. First, the PDO are confusing in
the way each is expressed as a means to an end. "Improve financing and delivery of
essential health services ... to enhance access to care, quality of care and health
outcomes." Is the main objective here to improve financing or to enhance access to care?
Is the relationship between the former and the latter supposed to be empirical (if so,
where is the evidence?), or is the latter supposed to be a set of restrictive criteria which
project management should apply to the former (i.e. limit project efforts to improving
financing to those which are specifically related to enhanced access to care, etc.). The
PDO are not clear.

The PAD asserts, "The PHP model has proven to be viable and is readily embraced by
central, provincial and district authorities alike," but gives little consideration to whether
this model is as well-suited to the project's workforce goals as it is to the goals of
protecting and improving health services. In the view of the ICR, the workforce part of
PHP III, involving two ministries and the IMA at the central level, as well as provinces
and districts, fits rather uncomfortably as an overlay on the PHP structure adopted from
PHP I and II. During preparation MOH asked that the project be kept simple but PHP III
is actually far more complex in terms of the range of its objectives and the number of
organization types involved than its forebears.3


2Law 22 of 1999 on Regional Autonomy and Law 25/1999 on Financial Balance between Central and
Regional Government.
3Given this complexity a diagram showing explicitly which subcomponents relate to which PDO would
have been helpful. This design issue may have been clear in the minds of those who designed the project
but it is not immediately clear in the PAD. Without making these relationships explicit it is hard for

                                                    6

Third, although the PAD included long lists of "key performance indicators" and "data
collection strategies" there were few clear guidelines on how the project was to be
monitored and evaluated, except for its financial aspects. It is understandable in the case
of a complex project facing many uncertainties that the definition of objective criteria for
assessing substantive progress towards project objectives and outputs should be left for
the implementation phase, but the PAD did not make it clear who would be responsible
for this, or when and how they would do it.

These limitations in quality at entry disclose a situation where the key government units
involved in the project (and the IMA) were able to present their varied interests and plans
in their respective PIPs during project preparation but there was insufficient time for the
Bank to fully harmonize all these inputs in the PAD (and fill in the remaining gaps in
planning).

2.2 Implementation

A number of factors in the institutional context within which the project operated at
various times helped and/or hindered implementation. National policies defining and
regulating decentralization continued to evolve during the course of the project. Most
significant were the new decentralization laws passed in 2004 (Laws 32 and 33) to
supersede those of 1999. The new laws created a firmer legal and regulatory framework
for decentralization, but in the short term they produced more confusion since the
associated government regulations stipulating how the new laws should be implemented
were not released until 2007 (PP 38 and 41). On the positive side the 2004 laws
established clearer responsibilities and authorities for the province level of government,
very much in line with the philosophy enshrined in all three PHP.

The most difficult obstacle frustrating implementation was the perennial lateness in the
central government's disbursement of project funds to provinces and districts. The
underlying reasons for this are complicated.4 The MOF agreed in 2003 that HWS would
be on-granted to districts, but it changed the channeling mechanisms it used to implement
this agreement twice in 5 years. Project management and the Inter-agency Coordinating
Committee (IACC) were proactive in seeking positive changes to these mechanisms for
the benefit of HWS but on those occasions where MOF agreed to changes they were
subsequently negated by further revisions to national financial policy. During the first 3
years of the project "actual implementation [was] only about 18 months," according to
the Mid-Term Review (MTR), resulting in disbursement of only around 38 percent after
36 months compared to an original projection of 71 percent.5 2007 was a relatively good


implementers of a given component to keep focused on the desired substantive results rather than simply on
an arbitrary set of PIs.
4See Supartini Hanafi, 2008. "Implementation Process of HWS Project 2004-2008: Supplementary
Document for Final Evaluation." Pp. 7-9. Jakarta: HWS.
5There were other factors too contributing to the low disbursement rate, as the MTR noted ("Lack of
experience, particularly among the districts, in applying Bank Guidelines on procurement and consultant
selection, combined with heavy prior review requirements resulted in further delays"), but the major issue

                                                      7

year, but in 2008 disbursement of project funds was again problematic with three
provinces receiving their money in September and one in October. By the end of the
project actual project implementation at the province and district levels was only 25
months (in 5 years).

Frequent turnover of officials, including project staff, was also cited by project staff as a
hindrance to efficient implementation. At the district level exceptionally high turnover
was often due to the local bureaucracy "settling down" during the first couple of years
after decentralization.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

As indicated earlier the PAD was not specific on how data of sufficient quality would be
collected for monitoring and evaluation purposes. The MTR noted, "Project M and E is
weak due to several factors, however one of the most important ... seems to be
inadequate attention to the M and E design during project preparation. ... One of the
conclusions of the MTR mission is the need to clarify indicators, and to strengthen
substantially the monitoring capacity of the project at all levels so that information is
timely and adjustments can be made if required."

A task team for strengthening M&E was established by the Bank and an international
consultant prepared a report (completed in November 2007) proposing "the use of
performance measures which incorporate `milestones' in such a way that, even if the data
are collected late in the project's life, a `historical record' of the project can be recreated
and the performance of the project components reviewed across the years 2004, 2006 and
2008 (corresponding to the dates for baseline, mid-term, and final reviews)." The project
only had one year left to run, so changes in routine monitoring could hardly be used for
routine management purposes; the consultant's report "therefore recommended that most
of the data needed to measure the monitoring PIs [performance indicators] be collected at
the time of the final review, and responsibility for this activity be `folded into' that for
conducting the final evaluation." This approach was adopted (at least to some extent) by
the project in its own final review of HWS,6 but it was not formally adopted as a revision
to the logframe.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Following confirmation of fraudulent practices in PHP II in 2005, the Bank conducted a
special mission and proposed an action plan to strengthen financial control of all three
PHP. The plan included (i) strengthening controls by moving financial and procurement
management control from the Bureau of Planning to relevant units within MOH, (ii)
recruiting a firm to conduct internal audits of the projects while working with the IG's
office to strengthen internal control within MOH, and (iii) appointing BPK to replace
BPKP as external auditors.


which project management was powerless to control was, at least until 2007, the late release of funds by the
MOF.

The HWS procurement post review findings for FY 2006 and FY 2007 included signs of
collusion and other irregularities regarding procurement procedures, especially at the
district level. The MTR rated implementation of procurement activities unsatisfactory.
This could be ascribed to lack of familiarity with the Bank's standards and procedures at
the district level,7 and it was also not always easy to harmonize the Bank's procedures
with the Government's own regulations. The Bank worked with the MOH IG and the
CPCU to address this issue, and the ex-post review report for FY 2008 found the signs of
collusion had decreased sharply. However the Bank's Financial Management Review,
conducted in December 2008, still concluded that in general "progress has been less than
satisfactory as there are many outstanding items, such as no status of follow up action of
audit findings, excessive outstanding of unclaimed expenditures and DFA balance, which
should be resolved before the project closes. The progress of technical assistance in MOH
IG has also been slow." A review of procurement management conducted at the same
time with the ICR Mission, to assess interventions to address procurement issues during
the Project. The following were the key findings:
a. There have been some improvements in the quality of procurement documents in the
    last two years of the Project as the CPCU was more actively involved in preparing
    annual plans and procurement plans with implementing units. The CPCU and the
    Bank have organized several workshops and training sessions for capacity building
    purposes.
b. The Bank and the MOH have agreed on actions to follow up on the findings of the
    post review carried out in FY 2006 and FY 2008 which indicated a pattern of
    collusion among bidders for packages using shopping at the district level. These
    actions included technical assistance for the Inspectorate General (IG) and a
    procurement consultant for the CPCU, dissemination of training materials, and
    sanctions to firms involved in collusive practices.
c. Ex post review in FY 2008 indicated a sharp decrease in the number of suspected
    cases for collusion. While a wider sampling would be needed to assess the
    effectiveness of the above measures, it appears that the increased attention from the
    Bank, IG and CPCU may have helped in raising the awareness and sending the
    message to interested bidders.

Despite these shortcomings many officials expressed the view that becoming familiar
with the Bank's principles regarding RFPs, procurement, and financial transparency
served to strengthen good governance in many districts.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Provinces and many districts expressed a commitment to maintain at least some of the
institutional innovations introduced by HWS (DHCs, TRTs, use of HRH master plans to
improve efficiency on a province-wide basis, new licensing and certification
arrangements for health professionals, etc.). While adequate funding is not assured in all



7Appropriate training in these principles and procedures was provided but with rapid turnover of staff at
the district level this was not always sufficient.

districts, HWS has contributed to the capacity of DHOs to develop coherent evidence-
based plans and to use these to advocate more effectively to district heads and DPRD.




3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The three PDOs were of high overall relevance to the country's development priorities at
the time of inception and they remain so today; they are also still highly relevant to the
Bank's country and sector assistance strategies.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The ICR assessed the extent to which the project achieved each of the three PDOs in turn,
especially in terms of the PIs listed in the PAD and DCA.8 Data from a number of
sources was used, including the Final Evaluation of HWS conducted for the GOI by
independent consultants9 (henceforth designated Independent Evaluation); the ISR
conducted by the CPCU at MOH10 (MOH ISR); and the Aide Memoire to the Bank's
final review of HWS11 (WB Final Review). None of these reports focuses explicitly on
the level of achievement of each PDO, however. The Independent Evaluation introduces
"revised key performance indicators" without making it sufficiently clear where these
came from,12 the MOH ISR uses a variety of indicators and the Bank's FR relies on the 7
indicators from the DCA. (None of the three reflects on whether the PIs it uses are
sufficient to produce a fair and objective assessment of project outcomes.)

First PDO/District Level: Improve financing and delivery of essential health services in
the provinces of Jambi, East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, and West Sumatera to
enhance access to care, quality of care and health outcomes at the district level.

The PAD envisioned that support for improved service delivery at the district level would
be based on a health development master plan and an annual health plan, both developed
by the district with support from the project. During project preparation it was clear
districts found it extremely difficult to prepare satisfactory plans and the Bank fielded a
consultancy in June 2003 to assess the situation. "The overall finding was that the current
district proposals were weak particularly in linking proposed activities to the situational
assessment. Regardless of the health needs presented, the districts tended to split the


8Strictly speaking HWS (as described in the PAD) had only one PDO, specified in terms of three "main
objectives." The exposition seems clearer if each main objective is treated as a separate PDO, and this is
consistent with the design of PHP I and II as well.

12Or why they were introduced; the main stimulus appears to have been the November 2007 consultant's
report on M and E.

budget between existing programs. ... It was clear that the districts had limited capacity
and that significant technical assistance would be required to strengthen the district
proposals." Over the course of the project districts became far more skilled in producing
health plans (with associated detailed budgets) of appropriate focus and quality. To have
helped districts develop this capacity is regarded by many connected with the project as
one of its major achievements. This capacity certainly needs to be strengthened further.
Despite of the progress made so far the activity failed to address the stated objectives,
hence this outcome is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory.

PI-2: Experience with the provincial- and district- level institutional arrangements
introduced by the project (the DHCs, JHCs, and TRTs) was mixed. The JHCs evolved
into province-wide fora for discussion of health policy issues and less into policy
development institutions (as originally envisioned). DHCs worked well in some districts
and not in others. The TRTs were generally a success and the provinces said they will
endeavor to keep them beyond the life of the project. Performance is considered
moderately satisfactory on this indicator.

PI-3: HWS demonstrated that block grants to districts can, under the right conditions, be
an effective instrument for improving efficiency in resource allocation. However many
districts tended to use the additional funds for mostly routine activities, and project
management, despite its best efforts, was never able to fully counteract this tendency and
ensure the DFA were used for improvements in financing. Moreover the on-granting
mechanisms used by the MOF meant the funds always arrived far too late for them to be
used with maximum efficiency and effectiveness. Performance for the design and
implementation of financial mechanisms is considered unsatisfactory.

PI-4: None of the 3 provinces achieved the target of 15 percent of APBD devoted to
health, nor did East Kalimantan achieve its target of 8 percent (Table 3). The Rp 51,000
per capita target appears to have been reached in East Kalimantan.13 Performance on this
indicator is moderately satisfactory for East Kalimantan and moderately unsatisfactory
for the other 3 provinces.

PI-5: Reliable data on the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) by province for 2007 or 2008
are not available. The 2007 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) estimates
of U5MR by province are averages for the previous 10-year period. (The All Indonesia

allocation, not actual spending.

estimate is the average for the previous 5 years.) The mid-point for the reference period
reported in the 2007 survey therefore actually coincides with the beginning of HWS, not
its closure.14 Comparing 2007 with 2002/03 data suggests the U5MR in East Kalimantan
has probably declined to the target of 34 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2008 (regardless
of any improvements in child mortality brought about by HWS interventions). Indirect
estimation techniques applied to 2010 population census data when available may be able
to show whether there has been an acceleration in the decline of child mortality in the
HWS provinces. In the absence of data and clear causality between implemented actions
and observable indicators the ICR was not able to assess this PI.

PI-6: Using IDHS data the WB Final Review found no significant improvement in the
proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel in the HWS provinces, and no
province was within 10 percentage points of the target of 90 percent by 2007 (Table 5).
The performance rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

PI-7: By 2007 there was some modest improvement in 3 provinces in the proportion of
women receiving at least 4 ante-natal visits, according to MOH data,15 but none had
reached the 90 percent target. Performance rating is moderately unsatisfactory for all 4
provinces.

PI-8: According to the WB Final Review, a comparison of Susenas data for 2003 and
2007 shows that (i) utilization of health facilities by the lowest income quintile has
increased in the HWS provinces, but (ii) only one (West Kalimantan) has achieved the
targeted 50 percent increase. The Bank report also notes this increase in utilization
follows a national trend and undoubtedly has more to do with the introduction of the
national Askeskin program (free services for the poor) than with HWS interventions. The
ICR rates performance satisfactory in West Kalimantan, moderately satisfactory in East
Kalimantan, and moderately unsatisfactory in West Sumatera and Jambi.

The overall assessment of the extent to which the project achieved the first PDO is
moderately unsatisfactory.

Second PDO/Province Level: Strengthen health work force policy, management and
development in a decentralized context in order to improve allocational efficiencies and
equity in the distribution and use of health resources in the districts.

The project was designed (according to the PAD) to "support the PHO's new
responsibilities under decentralization to provide technical and administrative support to
the Districts for: (a) strengthening health workforce management and training capacities;
and (b) improving the coordination, planning, and management of health sector
resources." Only three of the key PIs listed in section 1.2 above pertain directly to the
second PDO (see Table 5) so this ICR also used several associated output indicators
(taken from the Project Design Summary in the PAD) to substantiate its assessment.16

PI-9: No surveys were conducted to collect data on provider and/or client satisfaction.
Performance on this PI was not rated (n.r.).

PI-10: Competency-based standards for doctors, dentists and midwives were established
at the national level during the course of HWS and each of the four provinces made
considerable progress in implementing new standards for licensing, certification, and
registration of health professionals in ways reflecting the new emphasis on demonstrated
competence. The necessary decrees and regulations were already enacted in East
Kalimantan by December 2008 and were at various stages of preparation in the other 3
provinces.17 All 4 provinces developed an HRH Master Plan. The project also supported
fellowships and training for health workforce development, including the improvement of
in-service training at the province and district levels. Developments in accreditation of
health facilities were slight by comparison. Overall rating on this PI is satisfactory.

16Aside from the 10 key indicators listed in section 1.2 above the PAD lists an additional 49 "output

"Percentage of providers satisfied with reformed health care system" and "Formative monitoring and
supervision and technical assistance.")

PI-11: Law 32/2004 makes it clear that the central government retains control over the
main parameters of personnel policy for civil servants. Nonetheless regional governments
have considerable leeway in introducing reforms to increase productivity, performance
and motivation, but a constraint during HWS was that regional governments were still
waiting for clarification from the central government regarding the limits of their
devolved authorities. The project was able to help districts and provinces develop HRH
master plans and use these for more efficient assignment of staff (including to remote
areas) but the gains so far have been modest. There were also improvements in the use of
job descriptions, regular "mini-conferences" (staff self-assessments of their performance
in work units), and in the use of income generated at service delivery points to enhance
incentives for good performance (and to retain the services of experienced staff). There
was significant movement in the right direction, but it was slow and piecemeal in the
absence of clear and consistent guidelines from the central government. The rating for
this PI is moderately satisfactory

Provinces and districts report that the main contribution of HWS to workforce policy,
management and development was in the form of fellowships and training. Table 6 shows
the allocation of fellowships by province (as of May 2008). There has been no attempt to
assess systematically the contribution of these fellowships and training to the
development of the workforce and improvement in performance.

The ICR overall assessment of the extent to which the project achieved its second PDO is
moderately satisfactory.

Third PDO/National Level: Empower the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of
National Education (MONE), and the Indonesian Medical Association (IMA), the three
key stakeholders in the sector, through assistance to redefine their roles and
responsibilities vis-à-vis health work force policy, planning and management, and
through building their institutional capacity for effective stewardship in fulfilling the
functions of policy making, legislation, regulation, quality assurance/control and
technical assistance to provinces and districts.

As with the previous PDO, the ICR used data on associated output indicators as well as
data on relevant key performance indicators in order to give an objective assessment of



                                             15

performance on this PDO. This PDO had national scope and the organizational changes
envisaged are not easy to identify and measure objectively.

PI-12: The project was not able to strengthen the IMA as a key self-regulating
professional association in the health sector, partly because the channeling of funds to

IMA as an NGO was problematic.18 Nor was it able to help IMA develop a capacity for
in-service training. HWS was able to support the association's role in designing the
internship program for primary care physicians (under component C2), and its College
for Primary Care Physicians was also involved in the development of the new
competency-based medical education curriculum. Performance on this PI is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

PI-13: A major achievement of the project was to work with MONE on the development
and implementation of a new competency-based medical education curriculum, using
problem-based learning. Medical schools at Gadjah Mada University and the University
of Indonesia were already moving in this direction before the project began, but it was a
major accomplishment to get a new curriculum written and approved and the deans of all
52 medical schools as well as the medical associations to agree on this. It is too early to
assess the overall impact of this achievement or how well the new curriculum is being
followed in different medical schools. MONE and the World Bank are currently
preparing a new project to further improve health professional education, including
medical education using the competency-based approach.

According to the Independent Evaluation a survey was conducted of first-year medical
students at Mulawarman (East Kalimantan) and Andalas (West Sumatera) Universities
after the introduction of the new curriculum and more than 80 percent expressed
satisfaction. Performance on this PI is rated satisfactory.

PI-14: Progress on redefining MOH's roles and responsibilities regarding workforce
policy, planning and management has been slow. An information system for all public
health sector personnel is now available at the MOH, but it is still a very simple system
which does not allow analysis of the rate of staff turnover, for example, or of how the
existing workforce compares with anticipated changes in need brought about by the
epidemiological transition; and it does not include the private sector. Performance on this
PI is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

PI-15: The MOH has made none of the structural changes described in this PI. The PAD
was not specific on how the MOH might define and exercise its new stewardship
functions regarding policy development, legislation development to empower health
professions, and quality assurance and technical assistance to districts and provinces in a
decentralized setting. During implementation the MOH showed little interest in



18The most important recent development concerning the IMA's professional right to self-regulation was
the passing of Law 29/2004 on medical practice (including dentists), but this development took place
independently of HWS.

                                                   16

reorganization and the project provided little to stimulate such interest. Performance on
this PI is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The ICR considers the costs involved in achieving project objectives to be reasonable, but
no technical cost-benefit analysis was undertaken at the close of the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The ICR rates overall outcome as moderately unsatisfactory. The justification for this
rating is as follows:

The Project idea was largely appropriate to the challenges brought upon by
decentralization in health. However during implementation it became clear that the
Project design was too broad and ambitious, particularly with wide range of objectives
and the number of organization types involved.

The overall outcome rating reflects the combination of all three PDO ratings. The First
PDO, represents District component which is the largest component of of the Project, is
rated moderately unsatisfactory. This rating reflects that most of the targets were not
achieved despite the efforts to focus District activities to be more alligned with PDOs
after the MTR. Although there were significant improvements in District's capacity in
planning and budgeting, severe delays in budget availability has reduced the Project's
effective implementation months.

There were important achievements and some significant movements in the right
direction, at the Provincial and National level, but they were in general slow and
piecemeal in the absence of clear and consistent guidelines from the central government.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Many project activities in the districts were seen by project staff as pro-poor but the
activities themselves were generally not well-targeted at improving availability and
accessibility of health services for the poor and it is difficult to assess their impact on the
poor. Utilization of outpatient care in public facilities increased in 3 of the provinces but
this was most likely mostly due to the introduction of the Askeskin (Health Insurance for
the Poor) program in 2005.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

There were no further institutional changes noted by the ICR other than those already
discussed.



                                              18

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The provinces have indicated a follow-up project would be welcome. The MOH has
expressed no interest in a follow-up project at this time.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No Beneficiary Survey was conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

The ICR rates the risk to development outcomes achieved in West Sumatera and East
Kalimantan as generally low, but considerably higher in Jambi and West Kalimantan.

The risk to the new competency-based approach to medical education is also substantial;
implementation has only recently began in the medical schools, many faculty are not
trained in the new approach, and the first cohort of doctors to be trained under the new
curriculum will not graduate for several years yet. The new approach needs sustained
support if it is to develop deep roots. MONE and the World Bank are currently preparing
a project to strengthen quality assurance of health professional education. The new
project will enhance the sustainability of, and further progress regarding the HWS Project
achievements in introducing the CBC by institutionalizing accreditation of medical
schools, certifying the competence of graduates, and improving and assuring the quality
of medical education.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The ICR rates QAE as moderately unsatisfactory. HWS was very ambitious in its
objectives but was too loosely organized in its design to be able to marshal effectively the
available resources to achieve its objectives. The Project aimed to address decentralizing
health sector management issues but failed to foresee potential risks that might arise from
an ongoing decentralization process. The PDO indicators measured improvement in
health outcomes which was unrealistic to attain in a five year project addressing health
workforce issues. Those indicators show weak alignment with project components.

(b) Quality of Supervision

The Bank invested considerable time and effort in supervising HWS, especially in the
early years when it reviewed and commented on all district grant proposals. The ISRs and
mission aide memoires show the Bank monitored the project's progress closely and made
suggestions as to how to overcome obstacles and speed up implementation when it could.


                                             19

In the Bank's mission aide memoire January ­ February 2007, the Bank stated that "the
project has made good progress but performance need[s] to be enhanced to achieve the
development objectives of the project. This can be achieved, in part by simplifying the
project where possible and focusing some of its activities." What was missing was
explicit recognition that not only was the project overly ambitious and complicated but
that also some of the basic assumptions on which its design rested were not valid.19
Arguably many of the problems confronting project management were far more deeply
rooted than the Bank's exhortations for enhancing performance suggest. The Bank
missed the opportunity to restructure the project (and amend some inappropriate
procurement rules and thresholds) after the MTR. However, during and after the MTR,
the Bank has consistently engaged the implementing units in re-focusing Project annual
plans and activities to be more aligned with the PDO indicators. The task team also
conducted a supervision QER after the MTR which focused on monitoring of project
performance. Important mitigation steps were also taken to improve procurement
management performance which resulted in a sharp decline in collusion practices by the
end of the Project. The ICR rates quality of supervision as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The ICR rates overall Bank performance rating moderately satisfactory. The rating for
Quality at Entry is moderately unsatisfactory reflects ambitious Project's design and
objectives, yet weak alignments between performance indicators in the Project's legal
documents and specific project components. During the Project implementation, the task
team has taken important steps including re-focusing Project activities to be more aligned
with PDOs, and mitigation measures in procurement management which led to its
improved performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
The Borrower was the central government and the ICR rates its performance as
moderately unsatisfactory. The central government's failure to disburse project funds to
the districts in a timely fashion seriously undermined the chances of success at the district
level.


(b) Implementation Agency or Agencies Performance



19For example, among "critical assumptions" the PAD lists: Funds allocated to the sector are consistent,
sufficient and predictably disbursed; Increased coordination amongst MOH, MONE and IMA allows the
center, provinces and districts more flexibility in identifying their workforce needs and in finding
mechanisms to hire, retain and compensate adequately their health staff; Agreement of the respective roles
and responsibilities pertaining to health workforce management and training issues across all three levels of
health systems; Agreement on the respective roles and responsibilities pertaining to health workforce policy
issues across all three levels of health systems; Commitment by MOH to strengthen provincial health
management and public health units; Commitment by MOH to assume a stewardship and advisory role
instead of top down and technocratic mode of system management.

                                                       20

The CPCU worked hard to make HWS a success but the fact remains the MOH (the main
implementation agency) did not reorganize or downsize in a way consistent with its new
roles and responsibilities under decentralization for health workforce policy and other
functions. Without reorganization (and modernization of its management structures20) the
MOH was not able to coordinate efficiently and effectively a project aimed at facilitating
decentralization. Performance was moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The ICR rates Overall Borrower Performance as moderately unsatisfactory. This rating is
mainly driven by the government's inability to disburse project funds to districts, and also
weak guidance and coordination at the MOH.

6. Lessons Learned

The CPCU, in collaboration with the PCIUs, organized two learning workshops at the
province level (in East and West Kalimantan respectively) and one at the central level. A
summary of the main points that came out of these workshops follows:21

Project design
     In general, province and district stakeholders agreed that the design of the HWS
         project was overambitious and was not well organized. However, some of the
         Project features were appropriate for a decentralized setting as it provided equal
         opportunity for all three administrative levels to build capacity in the new
         decentralized era
     Stakeholders welcomed the opportunity to conduct bottom-up planning under the
         project and many believed that establishing the capacity to conduct evidence-
         based planning was a major achievement of HWS
     The "services" component channeled through the District Funding Allocations
         (DFA) became the most challenging component administratively as it involved
         over 50 implementing units (districts) and received the largest fund allocation
     Participants at the central level felt that the MOH components would have been
         stronger had there been more concerted efforts on behalf of MOH during project
         preparation
     Complex projects like HWS require a lot of learning and adaptation, particularly
         during the first years of implementation, and a longer implementation period is
         warranted




Project objectives and indicators



20A complex project like HWS really needs a Project Director who can function like a CEO, but the
management structure imposed by MOH means the PD functions more like a Board Chairman. The
structure is not conducive to effective implementation.
21These points are summarized and discussed in more detail in WB Final Review.

                                                    21

    Workshop participants at all levels agreed that clear objectives and indicators are
       important for guiding project implementation and to keep it focused
    When asked about project objectives, province participants were most familiar
       with the objectives to improve the capacity of human resources for health (HRH).
       Only a few stakeholders were aware of the project objectives as written in the
       legal documents and the PAD
    There needed to be continuous "socialization" of the project given the high staff
       turnover
    Central level participants mentioned that the objectives of the central components
       were not well defined
    There was general agreement that lack of awareness of project indicators and their
       importance for measuring project performance contributed to lack of focus during
       implementation

Project components
    The unclear role of the province level at the beginning of decentralization
       contributed to the rather loose description of the provincial component of the
       project
    Participants stated that the largest contribution to HRH at the sub-national level
       was the fellowship program (especially for midwives and nurses)
    Participants confirmed that districts appreciated being invited to participate in
       designing the district component during project preparation
    Participants agreed that performance during implementation was better where the
       PAD clearly described the scope of project activities

Institutional arrangements
    Rather than forming JHC, participants believed it was better to foster cross-
       district collaboration using existing fora such as "musrenbang" and setting aside
       time in these fora for discussion specifically on health issues
    An important determinant for a well-functioning DHC is good leadership by the
       Head of the DHO and his or her strong advocacy skills in developing
       commitments for health among key stakeholders
    There was consensus among the provinces and the districts that the TRT is an
       important project contribution for strengthening the planning process and for
       improving province-district collaboration

Financial management
    Multiple changes in the mechanism to channel funds to the districts resulted each
       year in long delays in getting money to the districts
    Despite the frustration, some considered an unexpected contribution of HWS was
       to function as a laboratory for MOF, Bappenas, and the line ministries for testing
       alternative ways to channel foreign loans to the districts
    The absence of a clear fund channeling mechanism to non-governmental
       institutions, such as the IMA, was also considered a constraint.

General comments on advantages and disadvantages of HWS

                                             22

     Could be used to fund activities that are difficult to finance under APBD/APBN
        (e.g. fellowships, pilot studies, comparative studies, TA) (Advantage)
     Allowed flexibility to allocate funds according to local needs instead of rigid
        allocation according to centrally defined interventions (Advantage)
     Provided additional resources to implementing units (Advantage)
     Provided seed money to initiate dialogue for bigger funding from APBD/APBN
        (Advantage)
     Project performance was very much influenced by uncertainties since it was
        prepared and implemented in the early years of decentralization when policies and
        regulations were still evolving (Disadvantage)
     Difficult to follow WB procurement guidelines and obtain WB NOL
        (Disadvantage)

The ICR wishes to add some further general points. To be successful a project needs clear
goals, perspicuous organization, and a rigorous mechanism for monitoring progress.
HWS was found lacking in all three areas. Its development objectives were extremely
broad and its key performance indicators were too arbitrary and were never adequately
operationalized or monitored. It was never clear how project management was supposed
to coordinate activities across so many components operating simultaneously on so many
organizational levels, or integrate their outputs. The result was a proliferation of activities
with few major impacts verifiably attributable to those activities. The project had many
successes, but most tended to be small and local rather than project- or sector-wide. It
may be better to view (and subsequently assess) an omnibus project like HWS as a
program more than a project.

One important lesson not previously mentioned is the need to strengthen risk assessment
in a project like HWS and have a "Plan B" ready for when project activities are seriously
threatened by external factors over which the project has no control. The money came
late every year, yet those entrusted with implementing the project always acted as if in
the next year things would be different. No strategy was developed aimed specifically to
help districts implement 12 months' activities in just 4 or 5 months if the money was only
available in August.

Experience with HWS also underlines the importance of robust scientific monitoring and
evaluation. All three PHP experienced similar problems. Many of these problems might
have been avoided if when the PAD was drafted instead of including inadequately
thought through performance indicators an M&E specialist was invited to contribute. The
relative scarcity of good data, and the misuse of the good data that do exist, are perennial
problems in the Indonesian health sector, and the Bank is wasting a valuable opportunity
to alleviate the situation if it launches projects with weak M&E.

This project would have accomplished so much more if funds had been disbursed in a
more timely fashion. This factor combined with the implementing agency's decision
towards the end of 2008 not to proceed with an extension almost guaranteed many
objectives would not be achieved in the provinces and districts.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
Notes : The final ICR text has incorporated some changes in response to the comments
provided.

(a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies

I. Background

    ICR HWS Project is an important document and give more information about input,
    process, output, impact and managerial environment of the project. Data collection by
    the ICR team / World Bank Consultant, facing many problems such as limitation of
    time, language capacity of the respondent, and opportunity for some government
    official attended in FGD's. To support the ICR team CPCU, PCIU and some
    Implementing units had delivered many documents and data to the consultant.

    The MOH comments as an effort to complete the above information and suggest
    some revision in order for comprehensiveness ICR HWS. We hope that government
    and Bank will have the same perception for determine conclusion/rating the result.


II. Comments on Content of ICR

A. Data and presentations suggested improvement

    1. There are difference data and presentation on draft ICR e.g.

                Implementing Unit was the Head of District Bappeda and Executive
                Secretary was the Head of District Health Office),

            b. Date and amount disbursement (Page 5, Point 1.7 By 31 Dec 2008 The
                Project had disbursed USD 55,720,152.13 (52,77 percent from the original

              project allocation) or 88,15% after cancellation. An extension plan had
              proposed by the Director of the Project but the Government decision on 11
              October 2008 suggest to close as originally planned),

   3. Adding statement at some paragraphs for clarification of role, clear perception,
      completing information, etc.

   4. Improvement rating status

B. Specific comment :

   1. The attempt to assess the contribution of fellowship and training.

   Assessment of fellowship and training was not conducted because:


                                                 25

   a. We certainly sure that there will be no any significant result. Around 50% of
       fellows were graduated on year 2006, the rest gradually completed their education
       on 2007- 2009 (around 10% were financed by APBD and APBN in 2009). It
       meant that they contributed for one year only to health service/ program, since the
       final evaluation was based on 2007 data. In fact all graduates still has to adapt to
       their task or function, and need to improve their knowledge, attitude ,skill ,and
       increase experiences to meet the competence as needed. Behavior changes need
       many years to process, in our opinion it's more effective if assessment conducted
       after at least 2-3 years of practice.

   b. To assess that contribution will need Consultant to carry out, which will cost a
       sum of fund much higher than the very low threshold of procurement, and lead to
       9 months long process of QCBS method; it will be unlikely to complete till the
       closing of the project.

   c. Amid the late fund release, in 2008 CPCU has already had a very heavy load of
       consultants procurement.

   We wish that The ICR would like to look at the fellowship mater in a positive way so
   that be able to acknowledge the real need of so many young and very young Districts
   to improve their health workforces quality.

C. Assessment of Performance Indicator of PI -14 and PI-15.

   1. It was true that this PI implementation was generally slow, but - refer to Team
       statement on page 19 on the bottom- it was not true that HWS did not produced
       National Policies!

       a. CBC developed by MONE is a National Policy.

       b. Even though the process was very slow, Specialist Medical Training also
          raised as one of priority National Policy.

       c. Internship Program, prepared by IMA, now was taken over by MOH due the
          long last and complicated implementation on the field.

       From positive perspective, it can be said that HWS Project has left behind historic
       mile stones to HHR Development, which are now financed by APBN, high
       committed and sustainability has been secured. It's a very good remark, isn't it?

       Information System business was a very long story of bitterness in MOH, we can
       not imagine how this kind of weakness of one IU can significantly influence or
       even "ignore" other central IUs performances

   2. Concerning Reorganization Issue

       On the very beginning of HWS, the Issue of reorganization as written on PAD,
       was meant to change the status of Health Academics belong to MOH to a kind of
       State Owned Company Schools. Several preparation activities had been
       conducted, such as consultation, data collection, meetings and workshops; but it
       was found that kind form of school will never be able to be established due to the
       lack of laws to refer to.


                                            26

      That finding had been informed and discussed in a meeting with The Bank
      Supervision Team that time , and since then the issue was never been raised,
      mentioned or questioned any more.

      BDEHHR did reorganization ­ partial reorganization- twice during HWS life
      time, but it focused to adjust to its tasks and functions.

      We wonder if The ICR in the end of the Project still raised that issue as a negative
      finding.

D. Cost Benefit Analysis

   Since in 2008 all activities still in progress, we thought that kind of analysis should be
   conducted after everything were completed. The condition as stated on number I.2
   and 3 above was also taken as a consideration. However if The Bank Team felt that
   mater was important, it can be done by external Consultant like Procurement's

E. The possibility of inconsistency in rating.

   1. In Table 8, under C component, it was written CI rating as MU, C2 as S, while the
      conclusion was MU.

      Was it because the intensity of MU of C component so bad when IMA also
      included in? This kind of unclearness might be happen if qualitative approach was
      used.

   2. The last two tables tended to mislead the readers. In case of Bank Performance, it
      can be perceived that lower table was as explanation of the upper, but it seemed
      not match (MS versus MU). Or, the MU as stated on upper table was re-graded

F. Proposition for Bank Performance changing.

   On the process of planning, MOH/ Borrower was closely assisted and directed by
   Bank experts, until agreement was achieved, and the PAD officiated.

   We thought that the relationship between MOH/Borrower and the Bank was as "two
   faces of a coin".

   Learning from the way The Bank assessed C component, we are inspired to make
   some comparison as follows:

   Refer to Statement written on page 6, alinea 4--

      "These limitations in quality of entry............but there was insufficient time for
      the Bank to fully harmonize all these inputs in PAD (and fill in the remaining
      gaps in planning)"

   And

      Page 16 on the bottom....> "HWS was very ambitious in its objectives was too
      loosely organized in its design to be able to marshal effectively the available
      resources to achieve its objectives." (Haven't all parties known and agreed?)

      Page 20 alinea 2- " Experience with HWS................Many of the problems
      might have been avoided if when the PAD instead of including so many " off the

                                              27

       top one's head" potential performance indicators an M& E Specialist was invited
       to contribute."

       Even though The Bank International Experts together with Government Officials
       and Indonesian experts had extensively prepared, "but still no one could predict
       with confidence exactly how the definition and practical allocation of
       responsibilities for health across the main levels of government would evolve."

G. Finding of Final Evaluation by Independent Consultant note that: "Considering the
       variety of problems faced by the project within the limited time frame, the
       implementation of the HWS Project could be categorized as quite satisfactory,
       particularly, the HWS Project is the first project which includes the anti
       corruption plan as one of its project activity. " (Integrated Final Report, Final
       Evaluation HWS Project 2008)

Recommendation ICR Draft Revision: We propose the rating of Government quality of
entry should be changed into MS.
