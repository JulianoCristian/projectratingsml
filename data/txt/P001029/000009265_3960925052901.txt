PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIRST POWER PROLECT, CREDIT 1085-GUI
PREFACE
This is a completion report of the First Power Project in Guinea
(Credit 1085-GUI) for which an SDR 22.1 million (US$28.50 million) credit
was approved on December 18, 1980. The Credit was made to the Republic
of Guinea and its proceeds transferred as a grant to the Societe
Nationale d'Electricite (SNE), a state-owned corporation responsible for
generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for public
consumption throughout Guinea. The Credit was signed on February 10,
1981 and fully disbursed and closed by October 21, 1986.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by an IDA
consultant based on the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 3055-GUI) of November
25, 1980, the President's Report ,. P-2895-GUI) of December 1, 1980,
the Development Credit Agreement o& February 10, 1981, progress reports
prepared by SNE and its consultants, correspondence with the Borrower and
the Beneficiary, and internal IDA memoranda on the project issues
contained in the IDA files, and a visit to Guinea in July 1986.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for comments,
however none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIRST POWER PROJECT, CREDIT 1085-GUI
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was conceived as a part of the Government's 1980-
1984 Program for the reinforcement, rehabilitation, and expansion of the
power generation, transmission and distribution systems for the City of
Conakry. The objectives of the projeet were: (i) to rehabilitate,
reinforce and expand power distribution in Conakry II; apd (ii) to
strengthen the Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNE), the power sector
entity.
The physical part of the project was completed successfully, and
the estimated Rate of Return on the investment was achieved, however, the
project failed to strengthen the institutional set-up of SNE, and the
power sector.   Throughout the project implementation period, GOG
constantly interferred with SNE's day-to-day operations and refused to
give any autonomy to SNE's management. Recently, the new Government of
Guinea showed interest in reforming the power sector and creating an
autonomous power utility.  It is expected that the dim picture presented
of SNE in this report will be brightened in the foreseeable future.
expected to be brighter in the foreseeable future.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      This report reviews the First Power Project which was aimed at
rehabilitating the operations of Guinea's Soci4t6 Nationale d'Electricite
(SNE), the public utility in charge of electricity supply. SNE was formed
to take over responsibility for the operation of public power systems
throughout Guinea in 1961 following the nationalization of the private
company which operated the Conakry power system. During the project
implementation period, SNE operated for all practical purposes as a
department of the Ministry in charge of energy. This Ministry was first
the Ministare de l'Energie et du Konkoure (MINEK), and later the Ministere
des Ressources Naturelles, de l'Energie et de l'Environnement (MRNEE).
1.2      In 1978 SNE operated 65 MW of hydro and thermal generating
capacity and about 170 km of related transmission lines. The Conakry
system accounted for 45 MW of total installed capacity and consisted of:
(i) two hydroelectric plants on the Samou river, namely, the Grandes Chutes
plant (20 MW installed with four units of 5 MW each) and the Donkea plant
(15 MW installed with 2 units of 7.5 MW each); (ii) the Tombo thermal power
plant (10 MW installed with seven units); (iii) transmission lines
interconnecting the hydropower plants with the thermal power station
located in Conakry; and (iv) distribution systems in Conakry and nearby
townships.
1.3      In 1977 SNE had about 23,000 billed customers nationwide, of which
12,000 were in Conakry; these represented electrical service to about 202
of the capital's 600,000 population. However, taking into account the many
illegal connections, SNE was providing electricity to about 602 of the
city's population. The Conakry system accounted for about 852 of public
electricity consumption in Guinea.
1.4      In 1977, the Guinean economy was suffering from a scarcity of
local expertise and lack of foreign exchange to pay for imports of
equipment, spare parts, and foreign technical assistance. These factors
had seriously harmed the power sector and a complete breakdown of the
Conakry system was feared by the Government and the aid community. IDA's
assistance was sought to strengthen SNE and rehabilitate the Conakry power
system.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin and Prelaration of Proiect
2.1      Early in 1977, the Government of Guinea (GOG) requested IDA's
assistance in rehabilitating the Conakry system including the
rehabilitation of the existing hydropower and diesel generating facilities,
and the transmission and distribution systems. Following identification
and preparation missions in April, July, and August 1977, IDA made an
advance in February 1978 of US$220,000 (P035) under the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF). This advance was to finance the services of engineering
cons-ltants to carry out the technical studies for rehabilitation work and
prepare the bidding documents, the financial audit of SNE, and the services
of consultants to analyze the financial functions of SNE. In the course of
this preparatory stage, it became obvious that urgent repairs were
necessary to the Grandes Chutes dam, which was leaking badly and on the
verge of collapse, in order to avoid a complete breakdown of power supply
in the Conakry area. IDA agreed to finance these repairs under a US$1.14
million Engineering Credit (Power Engineering and Repair Project--Credit S-
22-GUI of January 12, 1979), while continuing preparation of the Power I
project.
2.2      During preappraisal (mid-1979), it became clear that, given the
precarious condition of the various generating, transmission and
distribution facilities serving Conakry, and the abysmal situation of sNE,
the project would be extensive and would require finance beyond the amount
available from IDA. Cofinancing was sought and the Kreditanstalt far
Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
agreed to provide the needed additional financing. The overall
Rehabilitation Program was divided into three packages: ti) the
rehabilitation of Conakry's Tombo diesel power piant and related
facilities, to be financed by R*W; (ii) the rehabilitation of the Grandes
Chutes dam and power plant, consulting services for an optimization study
of the Samou's hydro potential, and a tariff study to be financed by CCCE;
and (iii) the rehabilitation and extension of power distribution in Conakry
II1 a training center, workshop, housing for expatriate staff, as well as
technical assistance and consulting services to improve the performance of
the power sector, to be financed by IDA.
2.3      The main issue confronting IDA was SNE's organizational,
operational, and financial deficiencies. SNE's organization was informal
and was characterized by fragmented responsibilities ana inadeqlate
communication between service functions. The operation of the Conakry
system was carried out haphazardly by personnel with little training--SNE
had no training facilities nor did it have any training program.
11 The City of Conakry comprises: Conakry I - an island attached to the
mainland by a short causeway, which is the administrative and business
center and original residential area; Conakry II and Conakry III - the
industrial and new residential areas.

Preventive maintenance did not exist. No internal information system
existed for operational and financial performance measurement purposes.
The audit of SNE's accounts for 1976 and 1977 revealed many serious
deficiencies and the auditor's report called for extensive improvement in
accounting systems and procedures.
2.4      In December 1979, the project was appraised by IDA, together with
KfW and CCCE. During appraisal, additional studies were found necessary in
order to address the many institutional issues facing SNE. An additional
advance of US$300,000 under the PPF was approved in March 1980 to finance
studies necessary to analyze the organizatiozn of the power sector, SNE's
manpower training and maintenance requirements, and to prepare an
institution-building component for the project. During negotiations in
November 1980, assurances were obtained that a comprehensive Management
Improvement Program (MIP) would be implemented by GOG and SNE. The MIP
included agreed targets to be attained by the end of 1982 in the areas of
investment planning, staffing, training, operations, organization,
commercial, and financial management. Assurances were also obtained that
adequate quarterly progress reports would be sent to IDA covering both
project implementation and the MIP. GOG further agreed that the project
would be executed directly by SNE.
Project Obiectives
2.5      The project had the following objectives: (i) to improve the
reliability of electricity service to SNE's custumers through the
rehabilitation, reinforcement and expansion of the power distribution
system of Conakry II; and (ii) to strengthen, over time, the institutions
of the power sector by upgrading SNE's managerial, technical and financial
capabilities through technical assistance and training. The project was a
part of GOG's 1980-84 Power Sector Rehabilitation Program; the other parts
of the program being the KfW and the CCCE financed projects (para. 2.2).
It was expected at the time that the rehabilitation program would correct
both the physical and the institutional deficiencies of the Guinean power
sector.
Project Description
2.6      The IDA project comprised:
(a)  rehabilitation, reinforcement and exter.sion of Conakry II
distribution system, prcvisions of connection materials to
about 2,000 three-phase customers and about 18,000 single-
phase customers, and completion of the change-over to 20 kV of
the primary distribution voltage from the existing 15 kV and
6.3 kV;
(b) construction of, and equipment for a training center, a
maintenance center and a relay and metor repair and calibration
laboratory as well as the construction of, and furniture for 17
houses for staff;



(c) a training program for all levels of SNE personnel consisting
of 64 staff-years equivalent of scholarships and overseas
training, and training of lower level personnel at the new
training center;
(d) a three-year technical assistance program (36 staff-years);
(e) consulting services for an organization study of the sector and
a feasibility study for a possible second project; and
(f) refinancing of the Power Engineering Credit (Cr. S-22-GUI) and
of the PPF.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Proiect StartuR
3.1      The Development Credit Agreement of February 10, 1981. did not
specify any special conditions of effectiveness other than the legal
requirements. The Credit was declared effective on May 12, 1981. The
project had already started with PPF financing for some of the studies
(para. 2.4).
Revisions to the Proiect Scone
3.2      A number of relatively modest revisions were made to the project
scope during implementation:
(i) the organization study carried out under the project addressed
the manpower and training needs of SNE. During implementation,
it was found necessary to broaden the study addressing the
relations between Government and the utility, and proposing a
legal framework for an autonomous entity.
(ii) a Power Master Plan was included to determine the sequence of
the power sector development and the first hydroelectric site
to be developed on the basis of the UNDP-financed Water
Resources Master Plan study completed in 1984 (UNDP 79/004),
which had identified several potential hydroelectric sites.
3.3      Two factors affected the project cost and the Credit value as
follows:
(i) due to the strength of the US dollar, only US$23.68 million was
disbursed, compared to US$28.50 million which was the
equivalent credit amount at negotiations; and
(ii) project implementation in general was delayed by more than a
year which resulted in cost escalation of about 5I.



3.4      Faced with the increase in the project scope, the reduction in
the dollar value of the Credit, and the increase in cost of the project
components, the following measures were taken by GOG and SNE, in
agreement with IDA:
(i) reduction of the overseas training of SNE staff from 64 staff-
years to 32 staff-years;
(ii)  reduction of the equipment for the maintenance center and meter
calibration laboratory by about 30Z. This did not diminish the
effectiveness of the center because quantities originally
specified by the consultant were in excess of actual
requirements;
(iii)  reduction of the scope of work for the distribution contractor
by cancelling from the contract some 8,000 customer connections
and the transfer of existing customer connections from the old
network to the new network. These were to be completed by SNE
before the end of 1987; and
(iv)  seeking other sources of financing (para. 3.17).

3.6      The table shows that, although the receipt of bids was on
schedule for the Conakry II Distribution, the contract was completed
about one year late due to an 18-month delay in awarding and signing the
various contracts involved in the work (para. 3.11).
3.7      The construction and equipping of the training and maintenance
centers (including the relay and meter calibration laboratory) were
completed with a delay of 18 months. This was mainly due to
unanticipated delays in removing old structures existing at the sites and
in shipping equipment and furniture.
3.8      The housing component was also completed, with a delay of 25
months. In this inbtance, the major problem that delayed the start of
zonstruction was the protracted negotiations required to secure the site.
3.9      The main cause of delay in engaging the technical assistants was
indecision in selecting the foreign public utility that would provide the
team of experts to assist SNE. Several months were employed in
discus:tions with the contenders.
3.10      It took over a year to define the scope of the program for
training, including overseas scholarships, and to then convince GOG that
overseas training was desirable. Finally, late in 1982 GOG gave its
assent and contracts were signed with Tractebel, HQI and Price
Waterhouse.
Procurement
3.11     Rehabilitation of Conakry II Distribution.  Supply and erection
of the distribution work was divided into 12 lots. All bids were jointly
evaluated by MINEK and Tecsult. They used a point system to rank the
bidders.  As a result, they proposed award to bidders who had not
submitted the lowest evaluated bids. IDA accepted only four of the 12
awards proposed. Following consultation with IDA staff, bids were
awarded in accordance with IDA's guidelines on procurement. Procurement
for the Conakry II component would have been simplified if it had been
let in a single lot for supply and erection of all works.
3.12     Training, Maintenance Centers, and Housing Compound.  The bidding
process for these two components developed without major incidents except
for delays in awarding the contracts due to the withdrawal of the three
lowest evaluated bidders.
3.13     Obtaining required technical assistance proved to be an unusually
difficult task. This was due to the limited number of qualified franco-
phone operating utilities who are willing to accept such types of assignments.
Further, conditions in Guinea and particularly at SNE made for difficult and
protracted contract negotiations. The TA team finally was fielded in October
1982.



- 7 -
3.14     ScholarshiPs.  Consultants and operating utilities  were
requested to submit proposals for overseas training to SNE staff. SNE
finally decided, with IDA agreement, to contract the trairring as follows:
(i) 54 staff members with two operating utilities (a total of 260 staff-
months); (ii) 4 accountants with a public accounting firm (12 staff-
months); and (iii) Three engineers with Ecole Supdrieure Interafricaine
d'Electricite (ESIE) in Bingerville, C6te d'Ivoire.
Proiect Cost
3.iS     The table below summarizes estimated and actual costs of the
project. Annex 1 shows the detail of actual costs per contract. Local
costs were calculated on the basis of the average exchange rates
prevalent for the period 1981-1985 during which, except for minor
aspects, the project was executed. Since the Syli was grossly overvalued
during the project period, the values of local costs expressed in US$ may
not accurately reflect real costs. For the foreign costs, the actual
disbursements made by IDA have been converted into US$ on the basis of
the average exchange rate during the project implementation period. This
amounts to US$23.68 million as compared to 1lS$28.50 million at Le time
of negotiations (November 1980). The total. amount of foreign cost
component of the project is US$27.41 million, representing a cost overrun
of US$3.73 million or about 16Z of the foreign cost of the project.

3.16     Total payments, under practically all contracts, exceeded the
original base contract figures, mainly due to the application of price
escalation clauses (Annex 1). However, in addition three-contracts
suffered large overruns ($2.5 million) in excess of price increases. The
contracts were for: the supply of concrete poles; the construction of
Conakry II Distribution; and the foundations and infrastructure for
expatriate houses . The overruns on the contracts for distribution
material and installation occurred because the bidding documents had been
prepared before the detailed design of the distribution system had been
made. (For the same reason there was a large underrun on the contrac;
for distribution transformer cabins.) The overrun on the foundation
contract was caused essentially by a change in the location of the
housing compound and rock foundation problems in the new location.
Proiect Financing
3.17     The foreign cost of the project was financed by US$23.68 million
from IDA Credit 1085-GUI, US$0.68 million from PPF (P299-GUI), about
US$1.0 million from the Petroleum Exploration and Promotion Project (IDA
Credit 1438-GUI), and about US$1.2 equivalent from CIDA (Canada) who
cofinanced the technical assistance. In addition, about US$0.85 million
for Technical Assistance were financed by the ongoing Second Engineering
and Technical Assistance Project, Credit 1595-GUI. The local costs of
the project (equivalent to US$2.68) were provided by GOG.
Disbursements
3.18     Initially, disbursements of the IDA Credit fell behind schedule
because of delays incurred in awarding contracts and in taking the
decision to proceed with the overseas training of personnel. However, the
disbursement ratio later improved, and reached 93Z of the appraisal
estimate in 1984, the penultimate year of the project period. The dis-
bursement profiles are compared in the Basic Data Sheet.
Project Execution
3.19     Proiect Unit.  The project execution was managed by SNE through
a Project Unit, located in a building which was remodeled and furnished
under the project. The Project Unit consisted of three engineers and one
accountant: one engineer leading tie unit and responsible for the
rehabilitation program and the IDA project, one engineer responsible for
the KfW project and one engineer for the CCCE project. In view of the
high volume of work, the large number of contracts to be supervised and
the number of consultants to be followed-up, in June 1984 GOG assigned a
new engineer, who was familiar with Bank procedures and procurement
guidelines, to head the IDA project. Reporting procedures and project
implementation then improved considerably.
3.20     Rehabilitation of Conakry II Distribution.  Although some delays
occurred in the production of the detailed designs, this component can be
considered to have been satisfactorily executed. The construction has
been done in a workmanlike fashion and actording to accepted practices
and the equipment is performing satisfactorily. However, the masonry



-9-
cabins which-house the distribution transformers and switching equipment
were not provided with adequate ventilation, which may eventually cause
overheating of the equipment. Still pending is the removdl of a large
portion of the old distribution system and the completion of about 502 of
the transfer of the consumer connections from the old network to the new
network.
3.21     Training and Maintenance Centers.  The design is functional and
the quality of construction is good. Both centers are adequately
equipped. Execution of this part of the project proceeded without major
problems except those experienced in the removal of old structures at the
sites.
3.22     Housing for Expatriate Personnel.  Quality of the housing
compound infrastructure (roadways and sidewalks) and of the prefabricated
houses is satisfactory. Its execution proceeded normally.
3.23     Technical Assistance.  The TA team arrived in Conakry before the
signature of the housing contract and had to live in a local appartment
building under difficult conditions (including lack of power and water).
The TA team initially was faced with the absence of working tools and
equipment, and had to use their own tools brought with them until
materials purchased under the project were delivered. Nevertheless, the
team has made worthwile efforts to introduce modern power utility
practices into SNE, including proper planning, maintenance, operating and
financial controls. In spite of the major efforts of the TA team to
bring about changes, they had only minimal impact on SNE.  The members of
the team had only advisory functions and found themselves stymied by the
absence of effective SNE management, Government apathy, the indiscipline
of SNE's personnel, and the general disarray of the country. The TA team
can be given credit for operational improvements including the discovery
of the oil theft at Tombo, the repairs to the 110 kV and 66 kV towers,
and the operation of Donkea hydroelectric plant under difficult
conditions prior to its rehabilitation.
3.24     Studies.
(i)  Institutional Study.  An organization and manpower study was
carried out in 1981. The study was limited in scope and
addressed only the organization of the operating departments of
SNE and the training needs for the utility. It became apparent
during project implementation that a more comprehensive study
was needed, addressing the relations with the Government and
the organizational structure of SNE. In October 1984,
following the change in Government, a new study was
commissioned by GOG and aiming at the creation of an autonomous
power utility responsible for planning, financing, constructing
and operating its facilities. The study has been completed.'
GOG is now implementing the recommendations.
(ii)  Preparation of a Second Power Proiect.  A Power Master Plan
study to determine the least- cost expansion program was
commissioned in September 1984, and was completed in May 1986
and recommended: (a) the installation of 88 MW of diesel
capacity from 1986 to 1992 for a total cost of about US$150



- 10 -
million (1986 dollars); and (b) the development of Fomi
hydroelectric site approximately 450 km from Conak:y (87 MW,
374 GWh) for the period 1993 to 2000, at a-cost of US$350
million (1986 dollars). The financing of these recommendations
and project implementation capability required, were judged to
be beyond Guinea's capabilities. It was then decided by GOG and
the institutions which lend to the power sector, that further
reconnaissance investigations involving mapping at relatively
larger scale and geophysical work were necessary to determine
the possibilities of less costly alterna.ive hydro sites closer
to Conakry, the load center. These investigations are now in
progress.
Performance of the Consultants
3.25      Five consulting firms were retained by SNE to prepare the
feasibility study of the rehabilitation and extension of
Conakry Distribution, supervise the SNE 1980-84 Rehabilitation
Program, supervise the construction of all civil works, prepare
the institutional restructuring plan and the power master plan
studies. Performance of the consultants was generally good.
Their performance could have improved had two or three
appropriately qualified consulting firms been responsible for
studies of larger scope and tasks and had they been retained in
a more timely manner.
Performance of the Contractors
3.26     The performance of the contractors involved in construction work
and installation was generally good.
Performance of the Beneficiary (SNE)
3.27     The Project Unit established at the start of the project (para.
3.19) performed commendably well in the face of an indifferent SNE
management and MINEK's constant interference in SNE's operations,
particularly in contract awards. Altogether, control from the Project
Unit was highly beneficial both for the implementation of the physical
part of the project and for SNE's overall.1980-84 Rehabilitation Program.
Othet aspects of the Beneficiary's performance are treated in the
following hapters.
Status of the KfW and the CCCE Financed Program Components
3.28     The status of the KfW and the CCCE program components is as
follows:



- 11 -
RfW Component
(i)  Supply and installation of a third 5 MW Deutz diesel electric
unit at Tombo. Completed in July 1983.
(ii)  Rehabilitation and extension of the 60/20 kV substation at
Tombo. Completed in late 1986.
(iii)  Installation of a new control room for the Tombo thermal power
station. Completed in July 1983.
(iv)  Rehabilitation of the Donk4a hydro plant.  The work originally
contemplated was completed in mid-1985, but important
additional work remains to be done: (i) replacement of the
stators of the two 7.65 MW units (the insulation of the
windings of existing stators has aged and is unreliable);
(ii) installation of an aspiration system to remove bearing oil
mist from the air chamber between the upper and lower generator
bearings (the oil mist injures the winding insulation); and
(iii) construction of a spillway on the headrace canal below
the intake at the Kale reservoir, to prevent water spilling
over the canal lining which had seriously eroded the hillside
and damaged the canal. RfW and their consultant are looking
into this matter for financing the needed work.
(v)  Installation of a 60 kV single circuit 3 phase cable between
Libraport and Tombo.  Completed in August 1985.
CCCE Component
(i)  Rehabilitation of the Grandes Chutes dam and headrace tunnel.
Completed in April 1983.
(ii)  Rehabilitation of units 1 and 2 and the step-up substation at
the Grandes Chutes plant. Completed in April 1983.
(iii)  Rehabilitation of the 60/20 kV substations at Kipe, Sonfonia,
Maneah, Youssoulou and Matoto. Three substations were
rehabilitated in November 1986 and the rest of the work was
completed in June 1987.
(iv)  Rehabilitation of telecommunication equipment.  This work was
completed in December 1986.
(v)  Supply and irstallation of two 8.8 MW units at Grandes Chutes.
Completed in November 1986.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1      SNE's expected operating performance was not achieved.  Between
1978 and 1985:
-    the generation plunged by more than 252 during the period
1978-1982 from 126 Glh to 92 GWh;
-    performance considerably improved in 1983 and 1984 and
production grew by 402 and 292 respectively. However, the
1985 production level of 152 GWh fell short of the 258 GWh
forecast at appraisal;
-    due to the frequent service interruptions, private diesel
electric sets with an estimated capacity of 25 MW have
been installed in Conakry and are estimated to produce
about 50 GWh annually; and
-    the financial situation of SNE remained about the same.
4.2      The main reason for SNE's poor operational performance is the
poor management practices at all levels of SNE's organization.
Preventive maintenance is non-existant, breakdowns are frequent on all
SNE's facilities, and the problem of materials pilferage extends
throughout SNE's activities.
4.3      The growth in generation in 1983 and beyond which is attributed
directly to thc. rehabilitation of the generating plants and the
distribution system indicates an improvement in the availability of power
to the consumers. However, the distribution system in Conakry I (the
lower tip of Conakry) has not been rehabilitated and reliability of
supply in that area is still poor. The Conakry system continues to
suffer from power shortages and service interruptions. These problems
are exacerbated by the lack of a good disconnection system for overdue
accounts, and the increase in illegal connections.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      The following discussion on the development of SNE's finances
during project implementation is based on financial statements presented
for years 1983-1985 as reviewed by the external auditors. They declined
to certify the accounts principally because  ccounting information was
unreliable due to lack of internal controls.
5.2      Given the qualifications indicated above, comparisons between
actual figures and project appraisal forecasts are only roughly
indicative. SNE's comparative financial statements are given in Annexes
2. 3 and 4. In contrast with the positive income projected during
appraisal, SNE shows consistent deficits through 1985. The main reasons
were as follows:



- 13 -
(i) much lower thaL anticipated sales figures due to both
continued generation deficiencies and poor billing
practices; and
(ii) fuel expenses were higher than forecasted in 1983-84,
because of theft of diesel oil. The improvement in 1985
reflects increased availability of hydroelectric plants
after rehabilitation, and the reduction of specific fuel
consumption at the diesel station as improved fuel
handling practices were put in place.
5.3            Key financial indicators are as follows:
1983             1984             1985
Actual Forecast Actual Forecast Actual Forecast
Operating Ratio (Z)               177       90      150      87     11,7     89
Rate of Return (Z)               (17)        3     (14)       5     (6)        5
Current Ratio                      .24     2.3      .35    1.1      .32     2.2
Receivables (Months
outstanding)                    9.5        3     10.9       3     5.5       3
The key financial ratios illustrate the poor financial performance of
SNE, although it shows some slight improvement by 1985. The decrease in
the operating ratios as well as the small increase in rate of return can
mostly be attributed to the reduction of fuel expenses and 55Z increase
in revenues by 1985. In 1984, GOG cancelled all of SNE's debts for
transactions prior to 12/31/84, and consequently SNE had no long term
debts after this period. Accounts receivables improved over the three
year period reducing from 9.5 months to 5.5 months. This reduction was
mainly caused by the write-off of arrears.
5.4      Billing and collection continues to be a serious problem.  In
1985 only 60? of the energy generated was billed, and of this only 602
was collected. SNE's total number of legally connected consumers is not
known; the current estimate (1986) is 41,000 of which 23,000 are in
Conakry. The technical assistance team is currently implementing an
improved system for metering, billing and collection and for the control
of accounts receivables.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
General
6.1      SNE's performance throughout the implementation of the project
has been affected by its lack of autonomy. As an example, all
expenditures above GF 5,000 (equivalent to about US$13.00) had to be
cleared by NRNEE. This often involved lengthy negotiations with
Government bureaucrats, who were jealous of their own prerogatives and
insensitive to the urgencies of public utility operations.
6.2      Some GOG actions concerning SNE have been irrational.  In
December 1981, IDA was informed that on November 17, 1981, the Government
had issued Decrees 625, 626 and 627, reorganizing the Power Sector.
Decree 625 transformed SNE into la company for the technical and
financial coordination of autonomous electricity companies, with MINEK as
its supervisory authority". Decree 626 created an autonomous company
PRODULEC in Conakry, as a subsidiary of SNE under the supervision of
MINEK. PRODULEC would be responsible for generation and transmission of
electrical energy to 10 autonomous distribution companies in the
districts of Conakiy (SORELEC's). Decree 627 created 20 regional
autonomous electricity companies for the specified administrative
regions, as distribution or generation and distribution entities.  The
new set-up would have fragmented the already fragile power sector, and
negated the main objective of the IDA project which was to develop a
strong SNE. It took almost a year of very strong representations from
IDA, including the threat on August 3, 1982, of suspending disbursement
on the IDA Credit, to have GOG reverse the decision.
6.3      However, after the change in Government in 1984, GOG agreed to
give autonomy to SNE, and to implement the recommendations of the
institutional study (para. 3.24) financed by IDA.
Management
6.4      SNE was poorly managed throughout project implementation.
Decisions were poorly thought out and are taken only when disaster hit.
This is exemplified in two cases: (i) rather than tetke the necessary
steps to correct the prob.lems arising from the theft of structural
elements from the transmission towers, SNE's management waited until the
lines collapsed, keeping Conakry in the dark, before making repairs; (ii)
to protect the bearings, oil changes in hydro unit bearings have to be
done at regular intervals; although requisitions for importing the
required lubricating oil were made by the technical assistance teams, no
action was taken by SNE's management until one of the bearings failed.
By then, given the urgency of the situation, the lubricating oil had to
be imported by air at high cost.
6.5      Nothing illustrates better the lack of effective management than
the appearance of SNE's offices and operating facilities. Conditions are
appalling, even elementary housekeeping has noc been done for years. The
general impression is of total disarray.

Personnel
6.6      Although SNE requires no more than 1,000 staff to efficiently
conduct its activities, it currently Las 1,350. Salaries are meager, and
to supplement them, the staff apply themselves more to outside activities
than to their work with SNE. The precarious economic situation of SNE's
personnel creates an atmosphere of indiscipline and lack of motivation
within the utility. Absenteeism reaches 50Z, and is particularly high in
the operatione department.
Tra.;inig
6.7      It is too early to judge the results of the ambitious training
effort undertaken urder the IDA project, although so far there appears to
be little noticeable improvement either in the attitude and motivation of
SNE personnel, or in SNE's operations. Overseas training for engineers
and high level technicians may have given them a glimpse of how to do
things properly, but has not corrected the poor basic education of the
trainees. Undergraduate technical education in Guinea is not comparable
to that imparted elsewhere at university-level technical colleges. These
shortcomings, coupled with low pay and an environment of borruption and
lack of discipline, cannot be expected to produce substantial results in
the foreseeable future.
Covenants
6.8      Annex 5 lists the principal covenants in the Development Credit
Agreement. SNE did not fulfill any of the major financial covenants and
only partially complied with the administrative covenants. The Guinean
economy deteriorated drastically during the project implementation
period, to such an extent that a monetary reform and structural
adjustment had to be implemented in early 1986. It was unrealistic to
expect SNE to meet the elaborate set of financial covenants of the
project under these circumstances.
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution for S7stem Expansion
7.1      The rehabilitation of the existing hydro generation facilities
on the Samou River (Grandes Chutes and Donkea) was clearly the least cost
solution when compared with the cost of adding thermal generation.
Without rehabilitation, the Grandes Chutes hydro facilities would have
been limited to a 10 MW operating capacity, endangered by the precarious
state of the equipment and the risk of collapse of the Grandes Chutes
dam.  The incremental cost of rehabilitation tas about US$0.015 per kWh
versus a minimum of US$0.12 per kWh for thermal generation with new
diesel units.
7.2      The voltage change-over from 15 kV to 20 kV for primary
distribution throughout Conakry resulted from a comparison between
investment cost and cost of losses. Voltage regulation has improved
noticeably in Conakry II, and technical losses are expected to come down
to acceptable levels.

Return on Investment
7.3      The economic rate of return on the IDA financed project cannot
be estimated in isolation from the total 1980-84 Rehabilitation Program.
The internal economic rate of return has been, therefore, calculated as
the discount rate that equates: (i) the present value of expenditures in
constant 1985 prices of cap'tal rehabilitation and expansion works,
technical assistance, and operation and maintenance; and (ii) the present
value of revenues derived from the male of all incremental electricity
distributed to final consumers in the Conakry interconnected system.
Incremental sales are defined as the difference between total demand
satisfied with and without the project. Without the project, it is
assumed that SNE's ability to satisfy demand would have fallen to zero by
end 1985. The valuation of benefits has been done at the current average
tariff of GF 60 per kWh. On this basis, the return of the program is
ibout 201 compared with 231 estimated at project appraisal. (See Annex
5.)
VIII. IDA PERFORMANCE
Assessment of the Beneficiary's Capability
8.1      The results of the project in the institutional area clearly
signal that IDA's assessment at project appraisal was overly optimistic.
In fact, given the political and economic climate in Guinea at that time,
there was no way the institutional reforms in the power sector could be
achieved as expected.
Supervision
8.2      Supervision by IDA was not adequate, both in terms of frequency
and duration of missions, and staff continuity. The average interval
between supervison missions was six months over the five years of project
implementation, and the average duration was 1.5 weeks. Two engineers,
four financial analysts, one training expert, and one consultant
participated in the supervision. Relations between IDA staff, Government
and SNE officials were reasonable.
IDA's Role
8.3      IDA played an important role in coordinating the intervention of
the three lending agencies--IDA, CCCE ard KfW--in the context of the
1980-84 Rehabilitation Program. The fact that at least the physical part
of the Program was completed successfully is in large measure the result
of IDA's efforts.
8.4      The Power Master Plan Study was based on the results of the
Water Resources Master Plan, which were weak and incomplete for power
planning purposes. IDA failed to request the additional investigations
(aerial photography, mapping and geophysical work) prior to the
commencement of the study. On the oth6r hand, the Master Plan Study
contributed to divert GOG's attention from the development of the
Konkoure hydropower and aluminum smelter project (US$3 billion) which had
inhibited the development of the power sector.

8.5      Also, with hindsight but on a more specific level, the technical
assistance component of the project was ill conceived. IDA should have
provided the technical assistants with the proper tools, equipment, and
an operating budget rather than having them rely on an ill-equipped and
poorly managed SNE.
8.6      IDA acted resDonsibly in insisting that GOG rescind the decrees
to reorganize SNE into 30 utilities.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1      Although the physical components of the project have been
successfully completed, the institutional objectives were not achieved
during the life of the project.  Over tte p;3ject period SNE was badly
managed and its performance has been totally inadequate.  The project
was, nevertheless, partly successful in. prov,ding facilities important
for the future development of Guinea's pove'. sector.
9.2      However, the Government has recently taken measures which should
improve the institutional framework, including the appointment of a new
management team and a management committee to oversee the creation of an
autonomous utility. In addition a new electricity law, which will inter
alia provide autonomy to SNE, is before the President for signature.
Continued support to SNE's new management by the donor comtunity is
essential in order to capitalize on recent gains. The Second Engineering
and Technical Assistance project, which was made effective in June 1986,
provides a good means to assist the Government in reaching its
objectives.
9.3      The main lesson the Bank should draw from this proJect is that
it is not possible to rehabilitate such a sector or a major public
enterprise when the rest of the economy is not functioning. It was also
unrealistic for the appraisal team to have expected to redress the
institutional set-up of the sector and the personnel issues (motivation,
compensation, etc.) of SNE in isolation of improvements in the overall
Government policy towards public enterprises.
