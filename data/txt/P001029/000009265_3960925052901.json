The project achieved some of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was less than satisfactory.\n            The main lesson that can be learned from this project is\n            that it was not possible for the Bank to rehabilitate such a\n            sector or major public enterprise when the rest of the\n            economy was not functioning. Also, it was unrealistic for\n            the appraisal team to have expected to redress the\n            institutional set-up of the sector and the personnel issues\n            (motivation, compensation, etc.) of SNE in isolation of\n            improvements in the overall Government policy towards public enterprises."}, "docdt": "1988-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
