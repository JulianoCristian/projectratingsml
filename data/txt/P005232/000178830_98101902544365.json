The project\n            covers the following five road sections scattered from the\n            south to the north of the country: (i) a link to the new\n            port of Umm Qasr; (ii) the reconstruction of the only outlet\n            to the north of the port of Basrah; (iii) a new road\n            connecting the Euphrates and Tigris rivers through an\n            intensively cultivated area; (iv) the final link in the new\n            highway between Baghdad and the Kirkuk oilfields; and (v)\n            the last leg of the Baghdad-Mosul highway. In addition, a\n            bridge on the Euphrates will improve Iraq's\n            communications with the neighboring countries to the west\n            and with ports on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The\n            roads and bridge to be financed are substantially the same\n            ones as appraised in 1964 except for the deletion of two\n            road sections and the substitution of a new one following\n            the 1965 re-appraisal."}, "docdt": "1966-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
