IRAQ: ROAD PROJECT
Su7mmary
i.        The Iraq Government has asked tlhe Bank for a loan to cover the
foreign exchange cost of a road project comprising:
a.  The construction and reconstruction of five roads totaling
427 km,, and a 500 m. long bridge,
b.  Consultants1 services for supervision of (a), and for a road
transport study.
c. A maintenance improvement program consisting of the expansion
of facilities and equipment and an expert reviewi of maintenance
operations.
This is the second Bank project in Irao. The first loan, a flood
control project signed in 1950, was cancelled by Iraq in 1955 before completion
and prepaid.
ii.       Total estimated cost of the project is US$63 millionl equivalent,
including contingencies, of which the foreign exchange cost is estimated at
UTS$23 million equivalent.  The local cost of ID 14h3 mill'ion, or UIS$40 mi.ll1ion
equivalent, would be provided by the Government from yearly allocations from
development funds.
iii.      Road construction and maintenance are the responsibility of the
Directorate General of Roads and Bridges, a division of the t1inistry of
Communications.  The Economic Planning Board and the iNinistry of Planning
control overall planning and the allocation of development funds.
iv.       Final surveys and designs have been or wyill shortly be completed bv
the Directorate General of Roads and Bridges or by foreign consultants who
will be in charge of supervision.
v.        Contracts for execution of work in Iraq are awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding, and the present procedures are satisfactory
to the Bank. Two contracts were awarded at the beginning of 1964 to the
lowest bidder after international competitive bidding; the rernaining contracts
will all be let before the end of 1964. The roads and the bridge included in
the project are expected. to be completod before the end of 1968.
vi.       The Directorate General of Roads and Bridges needs technical assis-
tance in improving its maintenance operations and funds for procuring
additional equiprnent for maintenance and for expanding its repair shops and
soil laboratories.
vii.      The roads are important as final links in major highways of the
country's primary inter-city road network. The project is economically
justified by its contribution to lowxer transportation costs over routes



- ii -
linking major centers of production anid consumption and will stimulate the
growth of production and comnerce above levels that would othenrwise prevail
One of the roads will contribute directly to the development of the most
important cereal-grain region in southern Iraq. Talcing into account no
benefits otiher than direct road-user savings, the 5 roads and the bridge
have estimated economic returns ranging from 10 to 20°'.
viii. The project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$23 million
equivalent. A 20-year term including a 4-year period of grace would be
appropriate.



IRAQ: ROAD PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Iraq has approached the Bank for a loan of US$23
mjillion equivalent to help finance a) construction of five hard-surfaced roads
totaling 427 kmi, and of a 500 m. bridge; b) consultantst services for the
supervision of some of the road secuiJons and the bridge, and for an overall
transport study; c) a maintenance improvement program, including procurement
of equipment for the Roads and Bridges Directorate, and the cost of consultants
to assist in reorganization of maintenance operations.
2.        This would be the first Bank-financed transportation project for
Iraq. The only other Bank loan to Iraq, a 1950 flood-control project, was
cancelled by Iraq in 1955 before completion and the outstanding amouit prepaid.
3.        The appraisal of the project is based on the findings o- a Bank
klission visiting the country in January/February 1964, and, on final survey
and design of the roads and the bridge undertaken by foreign consultants and
by the Directorate General of Roads and Bridges (linistry of Communications)
which is responsible for the country's prim7ary road netw^.ork,
II BACKGROUND
A. General
4.        Iraq covers an area of 172,000 square miles, roughly the size of
Swieden, with a population of about 7 million. The Euphrates and Tigris rivers
run through the country from north to south; if properly used their water can
support scme of the most productive agriculture in the Middle East.
5.        The region south of Baghdad, the flat and low-lying area of ancient
ilesopotamia, is traversed by the two rivers.  Here, irrigated agriculture
produces important crops of rice, barley, wJheat, dates, and vegetables. To
the north, the hilly country receives sufficient rainfall for dry cultivation.
6.        Since the beginning of 1950 Iraq has acquired the needed capital for
development through expanded oil revenues, which have increased during the
years and in 1962 reached ID 95 million, or UJS$265 million equivalent, Half
of the oil revenues are today earmarked for development projects.
7.        The Development Board created in 1950 was, inter alia, in charge of
planning and execution oL road projects financed from oil revenues. In the
first years, the Board, staffed with foreign experts, was mainly concerned
with flood control schemes and irrigation projects. In this period steps were
taken for planning and execution of a network of roads based on modern design
standards which would connect the rqain towns ir.-the north, south and west
with Baghdad, the capital.



- 2 -
8.        The Board iwas not quite successful in its first attempt to get an
overall road Drogram underiay, mainly because of staffing prob]ems, inadequate
designs and inexperienced contractors.   Arolnd 1956, however, more consultants
were called upon to assist in the design and supervision of the work and
experienced foreign contractors were encouraged to participate in bidding.
Gradually, the construction of the new roads gained momentum, only to be inter-
rupted for a certain period after the revolution in 1953.
9.        Towards the end of March 196ht, a Planning Board consisting of four
permanent members and four i4inisters (The Prime Minister and the Ministers of
Planning, Finance and Economic Affairs) iwas established by law and put in
charge of drafting a newr Five-Year Plan covering the per-od April 1965-
lIarch 1970. The Prime Minister will preside over the Planning Board. The
responsibility for the execution of the projects has been transferred to thle
different ministries.  Road planning, construction and maintenance is nov
under the jurisdiction of the Director General of Roads and Bridges writhin
the Hinistry of Communications.   The Board makes final decisions on matters
relating to the execution of the projects.
B. The Road NetTTork
10.       Today Iraq has about 8400 Inm of main roads in the followTing categories
C4
/0
New paved roads built to modern standards    14CO km     1'7
Old paved roads                              2050 km     24
Earth and gravel roads                        4950 knm   59
Total        8400 km    100,
11.       The 1400 km of new paved roads have been constructed since 1950.
These connect the most important towns with Baghdad.   (See map)  They have
been designed to modern standards, normally a 2-lane carriageway of 6.80 mi
to 7.30 m. width with shoulders between 2.50 m. and 3.0 m.   These roads are
wel]. built and have been well maintained.  There are still some missing links
in the main road netwjork, but those links are either under construction or
will be started shortly, as part of the project.   hhen these roads are ccm-
pleted the 1400 Im will be increased to 1770 km.
12.       The second category of roads are those built and paved before World
War II. Their standards and condition are inadequate for present traffic. The
roads are gradually deteriorating despite vigorous efforts by the ?iaintenance
Department to keep them passable.   Base failures and poor alignment make a
reconstruction necessary in the near future.
13.       The earth and gravel roads are all in poor shape.   They are slowi,
rough, and costly to vehicle oiners, shippers, and to the economy.   Because
they lack a base, these roads are unable to carry traffic during the rainy
season.



-3
C. Design Standards
14.       Table 1 shows the design standards adopted by the initial Development
Board and applied so far to all newr roads constructed since. The standards
are similar to Curopean and USA standards for modern highways and are, as such,
acceptable to the Bank.
15.       The present relatively high max-ium design axle-loads of 14.5 tons
for Class A roads and 12.8 tons for Class B roads include a safety factor
required by the tendency for trucks to overload. However, the legally
permissible axle-load is 11 tons.
D. Directorate General of Roads and Bridges
16.       The creation in 1958 of a Ministry of Plaining to replace the
Development Board necessitated a complete reorganization of the Ministry of
Communications, which today consists of the following Directorates, covering
all modes of transportation within the country:
Roads and Bridges
Port Administration
Railways
Post and Telegraph
Civil Aviation, including Iraq Airways.
-17.       The directorates are each headed by a director general (D.G.), liho
reports to the Ilinister through the Undersecretary.  The Directorate of Roads
and Bridges (DRD) has a director general, assistant director general, and a
chief engineer, both the latter reporting directly to the director general.
Roads and Bridges is divided into 12 divisions, each headed by a division chief.
Six of the divisions are dealing with administrative matters, such as account-
ing, legal matters, personnel, etc., and report to the assistant director
general. The other divisions are technical divisions such as constructiorl,
design, maintenance, etco., and report to the chief engineer.  The country is
divided into 5 districts, each with a resident district engineer and his staff
in charge of maintenance and construction (see chart Table 2).
18.       The staff, central office and districts, consists of 55 Iraqi engin-
eers and technicians and 15 foreign engineers, mostly from Poland and Pakistan.
The dhief engineer is a German wiho has been with the Ministry the last 10 years.
19.       The DRB is today under-staffed; experienced road engineers are needed.
The present worlcload of DRB goes beyond its capacity and has necessitated the
increased use of consultants for survey, design and supervision. Execution
of the work has been by local and foreign contractors and only in a few cases
has work been undertaken by Roads and Bridges' oam forces.
20.       DRB is in charge of the execution of the road work and its activity
is controlled by the Planming Board. Thne DRB has recently obtained authority
to decide contract changes in quantities, prices, alignment, etc., without the
need for approval of the Planning Board provided the amount of work involved



does not exceed ID 250,000 (US$700,000).  On the w¢hole, the cooperation between
the Planning Board and DRB has recently improved and is now satisfactory.
21.       For the past decade, road contracts have been awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding9  Through advertisemnent of the bids in
the local newspapers, including the English-language IRAQ TnIES, foreign
embassies and legations have always been alerted, and have informed interested
firms in their respective home countries, On request, the embassies and lega-
tions receive a copy of the tender documents free of charge. A number of
interrnational contractors have participated in road contracts in the past and
are interested in future contracts. IMeanwihile, a number of local contractors
have gained experience and are now competing heavily with foreign firms. About
12 to 15 local companies can today be considered as capable road contractors.
Foreign contractors are on equal terms with local contractors and are requested
to stipulate in their offer the amount required in foreign exchange. The bids
are not opened in public but the proces-verbal of the opening is presented
together with the recomnmendation of the DRB and the consultants to the Planning
Board for final decision.
22.       Some of the foreign contractors were caught with their work unfinished
when the revolution took place in 1958. Some are still waiting for settlement
of their claims. Howiever, final agreement on outstanding payments to foreign
contractors is expected in the foreseeable future and these contractors are
reportedly interested in resuning activities in Iraq as soon as their claims
have been settled.
23.       Contract conditions and the technical specifications used for road
works are generally based on European standards and are acceptable to the
Banl.  The DRJB now has a practice of splitting up contracts into segmients of
about 50 km each, the cost of which is generally between ID 1.2 and 2.5 million
(equal US$3.4 to 7 million).
E. Maintenance
24.       Of the 8400 km of roads under maintenance, the 1400 km of new paved
roads recently built are all well maintained. On the 2050 km of old paved
roads, maintenance is lagging because of insufficient funds and the difficult
task of keeping roads built to inferior standards in fair shape only by main-
tenance.  The earth roads are scarcely maintained at all,
25.       The main bottleneck in maintenance operation has been insufficient
funds provided by the Government, Table 3 shows available maintenance funds
over the period 1960 to 1964, declining from $260 equivalent per km per year
in 1960/61 to US$190 in 1963/64 (fiscal year from April 1 to March 31).
Despite a yearly increase in total kilometers of roads maintained, maintenance
funds available for routine maintenance and periodic resurfacing have declined.
26.       The amount of about US$200 per km per year to maintain the type of
roads under operation is insufficient. An increase of funds for routine and
periodic maintenance has been discussed during the loan negotiations and the
Government has given assurances that maintenance budgetary allocations would
gradually be increased in the future.  Such maintenance fumds include an
allowance for the replacement of depreciated equipment. Considering the
amount of ID 6 to 7 million which has been speint yearly on road construction,
it is essential to allocate at least ID 1 million per year for routine and



- 5 -
periodic maintenance, even on the existing road netwJork.
27.       The available maintenance equipment consists of about 550 uni-ts,
half of iwhich are more than 5 years old. Additional maintenance equipment is
needed for a better balance of the types of equipraent and to provide the
additional equipment and workshops made necessary by the growfth of the country's
road network.
28.       The main wsorkshop in Baghdad requircs additional tools and equip-
ment.  Because it is the only major shop, a similar shop is needed in NMosul
in the north and Basrah in the south.. Each of the 5 maintenance districts
has a small workshop suitable for minor repairs, but for major overhauls, equip-
ment must be shipped to Baghdad.  The main soil laboratory in Baghdad is fairly
well organized, but some of the field laboratories are poorly equipped.
29.       The Maintenance Division needs strengthening and improvement of its
operation.  The employment of outside experts to study the present organization
and propose improvements has been imade part of the road project.
F. Control of Vehicle Loads
30,       Overloading of trucks has been common, but now appears to be under
reasonable control. As a precaution, the roads have been designed for an
axle-load of 14.5 tons for trunk A roads as mentioned be-fore, although -the
legal axle-load is fixed at 11,0 tons only.
31,       Public Road Law No. 47 of 1959 deals wsith the dimensions and weig-lt
of vehicles moving over public roads and provides the authori-ties wTith the
legal basis for controlling loads.  Since 1957, 15 permanent weighing stations
have been imder operation in various places in the country controlling the l6ad
of vehicles. Ten more stationary scales are held in stock, ready for instal-
lation if a need for additional stations should arise. There has also been a
prohibition on the import or use of tires capable of carrying illegal loads.
Go General Conditions of Inland Transportation
32.       There has been a very substantial expansion in the vehicle fleet.
Iraqfs present investment in vehicles is now twjo or three times its investment
in roads; ten years ago the reverse was true. Over the last ten years, the
total number of motor vehicles has grown from 23,000 (in 1953) to nearly
75,000. This is a growJth in one decade of over 200%, with an annual average
growth of about 12%,  Private cars hlave shoxir the fastest growjth, followred by
taxis, trucks and buses in that order. (See Table 4)
33.       Although private cars and taxis outnumber buses and trucks by 2 to l,
trucks and buses account for much more than half the traffic outside the cities,
Thus the main direct beneficiaries of road improvement are the operators of
commercial vehicles, and especially truckers. flowever, road transport today
is highly competitive, and reductions in the operating costs of commercial
vehicles are to a large extent passed on to shippers and consumers through
lowler rates resulting from competition.



34.       In response to competitive pressures the trucking industry has
experienced changes in its organization and technology.   Over the past decade
the industry has become increasingly characterized by a large number of very
small firms in which the drivers (key factors in controlling opera-ting costs)
are either part-o-rners or have some other personal relationship wvith the
vehicle oimer. Large users of transport services have found it cheaper to
sub-contract this function. Technologically, there has been a pronounced shift
towards larger vehicles and diesel traction,   The larger truck sizes offer
economies of scale. Diesel traction is advantagcous because diesel fuel costs
one-quarter as much as gasoline and yields more kilometers per gallon.
35.       The past decade has also seen the emergence of increasingly keen
competition among different means of transport over three of the country's main
routes:  Baghdad-Basran, Baghdad-i*osul, and Baghdad-Kirkuk (plus their
surrounding regions). Baghdad and Basrah are linked by rail, road, and river
transport (the Tigris but not the Euphrates carries barges and motor tugs;
these do not go north of Baghdad). The Baghdad-I4osul and Baghdad-Kirkuk routes
are served by road and rail surface transport.   The Government's oil refinery
in Baghdad is also connected to the northern oilfields by pipeline. An exten-
sive pipeline network carries oil moving into international trade.
36.       The most severe competition exists on the Baghdad-Basrah route,
linking the capital with the country's only port.   This route accounts for
nearly half the country's total railway traffic,   However, Tigris barge traffic
on this route exceeds that of the railway.   The decline of grain and other
exports in recent years, coupled with rising imports, has meant thiat all modes
of transport over this route now experience much lighter loads in the south
direction than northi from Basrah.  The latter traffic is therefore more
profitable; a 1961 study showied Basrah traffic to the north was distributed as
follows among the three modes of transport:
Percentage Distribution of Northbound Traffic, Basrah-Baghdad
Barges                    5%
Railway                  Y5)
Trucks                   2O0
T0o
37.       The Baghdad-Basrah railwfay section is now being converted from meter
to standard gauge.  Traction is being changed from steam to diesel.   Average
wagon size is being doubled.  The expected result of this project will be a
four to fivefold expansion in the railway's capacity over this important route,
although short-term capacity may be held dowjn by limiting investment in rolling
stock.
38.       A high proportion of lowler-value bulk imports (e.g., timber, iron
bars, steel pipe, grain) move to Baghdad by river barge. Barge rates are less
than half rail rates except during the lowq-wiater surmer season of 3 months



-7-
when the journey lengthens from 8-10 days to 25-30 days and barge rates nearly
double. Cement from Baghdad is today the staple southiwTard cargb;quantities are
sufficient to keep returning barges three-quarters full. Although two foreign
consultants have been studying possibilities for river improvements to cheapen
river transport, no projects are under way or definitely planned. Ilowever,
private investment in river transport is expanding.
39.       The railway normally earns 75-80 percent of its revenues from carry-
ing goods, 20-25 percent from passengers. Goods traffic is heavily concentrated
in a few categories that make up two-thirds or more of the total tonnage. Of
over 60 items carried, the followJing six have accounted for most of the tonnage
during the past 12 years:
Commodity Distribution of Railway Freight
1961/62
Tons     Percent
Petroleum products                                     751,000      31
Grains                                                 151,000       6
Miscellaneous                                          216,000       9
Limestone                                              193,000       8
Cement                                                177,000        7
Dates                                                  125,000       5
Sub-total:                 1,613,000 CTO6
Grand total:               2,419,000     100
400       Sugar has been a fairly important commodity, running 60-80,000 tons
annually over the above period. Fresh fruits and vegetables together have
averaged between 30-50,000 tons. No animals are normally transported by rail.
41.       The bulk of the railway's traffic is concentrated in low-value
non-perishable bulk commodities (grains, dates, limestone and cement) and
petroleum products. Such commodities are least likely to be diverted to
common-carrier truck transport when such competition arises, The miscella-
neous and other minor categories undoubtedly contain an unknown portion
of divertible goods, mostly smaller shipments of higher-valued goods that
are better suited for truck transport.

42.       During the past 4-5 years the central government has been spending
betwjeen ID 7-9 million annually for road construction and ID 800,000 for
maintenance.  The amounts spent by the provincial governments are insignificant.
New construction is financed out of Plan funds.  Maintenance funds come out
of the regular budget appropriation for Dl-B. There is no earmarking of any cf
the various types of goverrment revenues generated by activity in the road
sector (e.g., customs duties on vehicles, tires, spare parts; fuel taxes,
and vehicle registration and driver license fees). All such revenues go into
the Treasury's general funds (see Table 5).



.- 8 -
43.       Although the available data do not permit refined analysis, on
the wihole it appears that revenues received from road users are currently
meeting the economic costs of the facilities provided by the government.
These costs are rising and will continue to do so, due to the higher capital
and maintenance charges required by the national program for uDgrading and
extending the road network, but they will mostly be covered by the automatic
revenue increases resulting from the expansion in the number of road users
and their use of the roads.
III. 'ilE PROJECT
A. Description
44.       The project consists of:
a)  the construction and reconstruction to modern standards of
427 lam of main roads in different parts of the country and
of a bridge over the Euphrates;
b)  the employment of consulting firms for:
1.  the supervision of construction of certain roads and the
bridge included in the projecL;
2.  an overall road transport study to advise the Governnent
of Iraq on a coordinated program of inland transportation
investments;
c)  a road maintenance program including the employment of a um.ber
of experts to advise the Roads and Bridges on improvements in
maintenance operation and organization, and the procurem,ent of
additional equipment for mai.ntenance, repair shops and soil
laboratories.
a) Construction
45.       This part of the project consists of the following (see map):
1. Road Sections:
1. Shirgat - Mosul                3h6 kmrT
2.  Kut - Nassiriya               176 km
3. Zubair - Safwan                 31h km
4. Garmat-Ali - Basrah             IL km
5. Baghdad - Khalis         _      57 ,km
Total      427 km



9-
2. Bridge Section:
Fallujah bridge over the Euphrates:            500 m. length.
46.       The Shirgat - Mosul road is the last missing linik in a modern
highway connecting Baghdad, the country's Capital, (1.5 million population)
and Mosul in the north, the second largest tow,n with a population of 250,C00.
The road has been realigned to the west, not following the present road along
the river for two reasons:  i) the new road will be shorter than the present
one and open up new areas; and ii) should a contemDlated dam across the 1Tigris
at Shirgat be built at a later date, part of the present road would be inun-
dated. The new road has 2 spurs to the unportant towTns of Alil and Qaiyarah
by the Tigris river.
47.       The Kub - Nassirya road serves the important area betwieen the two
rivers, Euphrates and Tigris, supplying the Gharraf irrigation schene with a
proper road connection and also connecting the important town of Nassiriya
with proper access to the country's overall road netwjork. The present dirt
road is inadequate for the traffic and the importance of the area.  The new
road will partly follow the old road's alignment, and partly be relocated.
48.       The road from Zubair to Safwqan near the Kuwait border is the last
link in an international highway between Kuwait and Basrah.  Traffic between
the two cities is already substaritial, and is growing. The road will be a
complete new construction through the desert, shortening the length of the
present road, which is an old asphalt paved road in poor condition.
49.       The Garmat-Ali - Basral road will link the new Garinat-Ali bri dge
crossing the Shatt-al-Arab river north of Basrah wfith the towJn and the nearly
completed trunk road to Baghdad.  The new bridge wil.l replace the present
inadequate ponton bridge over the Shatt-al-Arab. The construction of the new
bridge, designed by the HTungarian consulting firm of Komplex, will start soen
and will be supervised by the same consultants. The construction of the bridge
will be financed entirely by the Iraqi Authorities and is not included in the
Bank-financed project.
50.       The Baghdad - Khalis road is an important link in the main road to
Kirkuk serving also the heavy traffic out of Baghldad and-easing the congested
traffic on the present road, Baghdad - Baqouba - Khalis. This road is new
construction.
51.       All roads being part of the main overall road network will be built
to Class A standards with a paved carriageway of 7.30 m, and shoulders of
2.50 m. to 3.0 m, wTidth.
52.       The construction of the new bridge at Fallujah, on the newly
reconstructed road Baghdad - Ramadi, is part of the project and w:Jould
eliminate the traffic bottleneck created by the present one-lane steel bridge
over the Euphrates,  The 500 Mo, long bridge has been designed by the Yugoslav
contractor and approved by the consulting firm of Rendel, Palmer and Tritton.
It will be a prestressed concrete beam structure with average spans of 40 m,
supported by reinforced piers on pile foundation.

b) Emplovmeent of Consultants
53.       Tha roads and the bridge included in the project have bcen or are
being final designed and surveyed (including preparation of tender docuwnents)
either by foreign consultants or by DRB, The following table shows the status
of the design and tenderiag and the consultants engaged:
Road                   Consultants             Design         Tender documenb
1. Shirgat-ilosul      Dorsch-Gehrinann         90" complete  partly completed
2.  Kut-Nassiriya      Dorsch-Gehrmnann       100$ complete   100,1 complete
3. Zubair-Safwan       Roads and Bridges      100/0 complete  Con-tract awiarded
4. Garmat-Ali-Basrah   Roads and Bridges       1CO  complete  100' complete
5. Baghdad-Dhalis      Roads and Bridges        90% complete         -
6. Bridge at Fallujah Rendel, Palmer & Tritton
1 0 0$ complete  Contract awtarded
54.       The contracts concluded in 1952 and 1960 with the consultants also
include supervision of the construction wrork.  For the Zubair - Safwan road
and the Garmat-Ali - Basrah road, the supervision is in the hands of Roads
and Bridgest own forces.  For the Baghdad - Khalis road, DoGo of Roads and
Bridges is completing the desigrn and specifications, and will also be in charge
of the supervision0
55.       Until recently road planning has been guided by the obvious need to
connect the mnain tow^7ns with moder-n roads. FAuture road planning will have to
be based on less obvious factors.  I'either the 1iinistry of Coimaunicationos nor
the M4inistry of Planning is adequately staffed to conduct the kind of econcmic
studies which should guide road investments over the next v-10 years. The
government has agreed to engage consultants to help it identify road priorities
and to help prepare a general construction program beginning about 1967, Con--
sultants wjill need to divide their attention between the further extension of
main roads and the development of a much larger netwiork of f6edor-rosacss.
designed to appropriate standards, They also have to evaluate n:otent-ial road-
rail competition over certain main routes, particularly alon- the Lurhrates
between Diwaniya and the Gulf.
c) 1Maintenance Program
56.       As mentioned earlier, the present maintenance equip.nienb is insuffi-
cient and needs to be increased in some specific areas. Two new workshops
planned for Basrah and iMiosul complementinig thle main slhop in Baghdad ',ill
need to be equipped. Also, the Baghdad shop requires some additional equip-
nient. The soil laboratories, especially those in the districts, are short
of facilities and should be modernized.
57.       To assist the Roads and Bridges in strengt.iening and improving their
maintenance operation, the GovOrrment has agreed to employ a team of maintenance
experts, the cost of which has been included in the project. It is expected
that 3 to 4 experts will be needed for a period of about a year.



B. Cost Estimate of the Project
58.       The total cost of the projcct is estimated at ID 22,500,000 or
US$63.0 million equivalent and is summarized below (see detail in Table 6):
Total Cost Foreign Cost Foreign Cost
000 ID       000 ID        000 US$
1. Construction:
a. Road construction (427 Ian)       15,850        b750         13,300
b. Bridge construction (500 in.)      1,600          800         2,240
2.  Supervision by consultants:             790          475         1,320
3. Overall T'ansport Study:                  80           64           180
4. Maintenance:
a.  Equipment                         1,130        1,130         3,150

5. Contingencies:
a.  15%, of item 1                    2,625          840         2,340

or: US$63,0CO      ID 8,227       $23,000
59.       The cost estimates for the roads and bridge are based on quanltities
obtained from final or nearly final plans and design, as prepared by con-
sultants or by DAB, and on unit prices recently offered by contrac'&ors. The
estimates therefore appear reasonably accuratec  Hoevevr, to safeguard against
possible increase in actual quantities during construction and in tnit prices
offered by tle contractors, a 15% contingency has been applied to the estimated
cost of construction and supervision.  I!itthout contingenc-es, road costs per
km will range from about ID 17,000 on the lZubair - Safiwan road to ID 49,COO
on Kut-Nassirlya,  or US$148,000 and US$137,000 resnectively per km, IJ}licil is
a normal cost, considering the long haul of construction materials for the
more expensive roads.
6o.       The cost of equipment for maintenance, shops and laboratories is
based on tcntative lists prepared by Roads and Bridges.  Final lists will be
worked out later and checked by the maintenance experts.
61.       The foreign exchange ccmocnent of' the project is estimatcd at
US$23 millioni. This figure is based on thle percentaaes .or the different items
dS shown in Table 6. Thle 30, Lorci-n exzc3ian.e cost Lor road construction
is bNased on ex-perience in pa'st cornti-cts, acsuizing that about ona-quarter
of the contrlacts would be awarded to foreign contractors, the rc:.ining
thrUe-qu.arters to local firns. 



- 12 _
62.       The foreign exchange component for the consultants' services for
supervision is based on conditionas stipulated in the existiog contracts.  The
foreign exchange cost of experts for maintenance and for the overall Transport
Study might be as high as 802' of total cost.
C. Execution of the Project
63.       The execution of the wiork will be undertakein by local and/or foreign
contractors on the basis of international compecitive bidding as outlined in
paragraph 21,
64.       Table 7 shows the construction schedule for the roads and the bridge
included in the project.   Tender documents being already available for the
greatest part of the project, the awarding of contracts for all construction
works is expected to takc place before the end of 1964.
65.       The wfork will be supervised either by the Roads and Bridges' olm
engineers or by consultants already engaged (see paragraph 53).
66.       Two contracts have been awarded recently after international competi-
tive bidding.  The road Zubair - Saf-.an was awarded to a local contractor in
November 1963, with work starting December 1, 1963.   The Fallujah bridge wqas
awqarded to a Yugoslav firm on January 21, 1964e  The procedure followed and
the aw.arding of the contracts are acceptable to the Bank, and it is proposed
that reimbursement on the contracts included in the project should be made
retroactive from December 1, 1963. As of June 1, '1?64 an amount of about
ID 80,000 had already been spent on these contracts.
D. Financing of the Pro.iect
67.       It is proposed that the Bank finance the foreign exchange cost of the
project, estimated at ID 8,225,000, or US$23 miljion equivalent, which repre-
sents 37% of the total cost. The local cost of the project, ID 1h,275,000,
would be provided by th1e Goveriment from yearly allocations from dev&elopment
funds,
68.       The project execution will start in full in the second half of 196h,
to be completed in mid-196u.   Dcpected annual expenditures in connection with
the project would be:

(in 000 ID)        (in 000 ID)         (in 000 US$)
1964             2,000               1,265              2,050
1965             6,500               4,150              6,600
1966             6,000               3,820              6,100

69.       The proposed road project and the Fallujah bridge are all included
in the original 1961-66 Development Plan. This Plan is now being revised; a
new 5-year Plan is expected at the end of this year covering the period
1965-70.  The local funds required for the proposed Bank-financed project
would amount to about 50, of expected total expenditures -for road construction.
Because the funds are allocated from a part of the oil revenues earmarked for
development, no difficulties are expected in providing the annual funds rc-
quired for the project.
IV, ECON01MIlC JUSTIFI1CATION
7o.       The proposed roads, and the TFallujah bridge, all make sensible con-
tributions to the building up of Iraq's primary netwo.rk of main highways.
Three of the five roads provide final links in roads connecti.ng the capital
with the country's second, third, and sixth largest cities (jiosul - 250,000,
Basrah - 240,000, and Kirkuk - 100,000). A fourth road links Basrah to the
Kuwait border, a busy route already served on the Kuwait side by a modern
highway.  The fifth and longest road traverses the major grain-growing region
of southern Iraq, a region in tThich some major agricultural projects are
already in progress and others are under studvy. The new bridge at F'allujah
will replace a 35-year old one-lane structure across the Euphrates with a
modern bridge capable of accommlodating, safely and w.Fithout inconvenience, the
growJing volume of corumercial and private traffic betwqeen Baghdad, Ramadi, and
points beyond in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.
71.       The common-sense justification of these investments has been chec[ced
against calculations of their economic returns. Using rough guesses basad on
a few one-day spot checks, information gathered .2rown local officials, and
assumptions on traffic growth consistent w,ith the economic growth as described
below, the economic returns on thne separate roads of the project range from
minimum 10 to 20 lpercent. on the investrment over thei.r assumed economic li-e
of 25 years. These figures take into account only road-user savings which are
the more measurable and objective of the projectys direct benefits.   Theyare not
the only direct benefits, however.   Two of the roads (.ut - Nassiriya and
Baghdad - Khalis) are likely to generate agricultural production benefits, The
Baghdad - Khalis road is also lilely to open up a new source of urban buildilg
materials.  These production benefits are more conjectural and less me'asuirabie
than road-user savings.
Traffic Estimates
72.       Although 30 automatic traffic counters have recently been ordered by
the DRB, no organized system of traffic counting exists at the present tirme.
However, the Government has agreed to set up such a system and to improve its
statistic and traffic-counting services in the imi-mediate future.  Reliable
data for the accuraLe calculation of road-user benefits do not now exist.
It wiould take a year or more to collect data in which high conafidence coul.d
be placed.  T'he estimates of present traffic-(see Table 3) are based on
one-time "spot" vehicle counts by Bank personnel   ile trave]lling the roads,
on judgrments given by public and private persons familiar with transport on
the roads in question, and on five "spot" counts made by the DRB in response
to requests from the mission. The Roads and Bridges counts all resulted in
figures 2 to 5 times higher than the mission's independent estimates.   .'ile



- 14 -
the one-time DRB counts are too sketchy and informal to be fully acceptable,
they suggest that the mission's estimates (from which the traffic projections
begin) are conservative.
730       Future increases in traffic are based prjiarily on the rate of
growth of vehicle registrations over the past decade, the prospect that abundant
foreign exchange will make possible a continuation of the liberal import policr
for vehicles, that the country's development program will entail a high rate of
irvestment, rising consumer incomes, and hence increased effective demand for
both imported and domestic goods. The annual growth rate in traffic assumed
for 1964-74 on the roads in the project varies between 5 and 10 percent depend-
ing on the route. For the past decade Iraqrs national income has grown at
nearly 8.5 percent anmnally.  The growth of road transport normallyr outstrips
the growth of national income during the years wjhen motor transport is becoming
established. Eventually this differential may narrow. This probability is
reflected in the arbitrary sharp reduction in each assumed annual growth rate
midway through the life of each road.
Individual Roads and Bridges (for details see Appendix)
74.       Shirgat-Mosul (146 kn):  This road links Iraqts second largest city,
the gathering poinlt of a grain-growing region, with the nation's capital.
Completion of the road will have seen the trucking time between Baghdad and
Mosul cut from aO-25 hours a few years ago to 6-8 hours after comp'le-tion of the
-final link,
75.  -    Kut-Nassiriya (176 lem):  This is the longest and most costly road
in the project.  It will replace the bad earth road that now crosses the
Gharraf region -.rith an all-weather asphalt road capable of carrying traffic
at approximately half the cost of the present road,  The road will run the
entire length of the most important grain-growing region in southern Iraq.
Major irrigation works have recently been completed in the region and large
drainage works are under s-tudy. The road will contribute to agricultural
development by reducing transport costs and providing much easier road access
for agricultural service personnel. Finally, the road will give Nassiriya
(c. 40,000) an all-wieather connection with Baghdad and key towns in the agri-
cultural region, for which it serves as a major collecting point.
76.       Zubair-Safwan (34 lkm): This short link between Iraq and Kuwiait will
provide a modern connection with the new international highway already com-
pleted on the Kuwait side of the border. The road will replace an old asphalt
road.
77,       Garmat-Ali access road (14 km):  This will provide a connection
betw.Jeen Basrah and the new bridge across the Shatt al-Arab at Garmat-Ali (the
bridge itself is being built under conditions that preclude Bank financing).
The new bridge will replace a ponton bridge that has been a major bottleneck
on the important Baghdad-Basrah route, Wirhen this bridge and the last remaining
unpaved section of the Baghdad-Basrah highway are completed, the truck journey
between Baghdad and Basrah will be reduccd from 2 days to 1; trucking rates
are expected to fall by 25-30 percent.



78.       Baghdad-iChalis (57 km): This road closes the finial link; in the
Baghdad-Kirkuk highlway now nearing completion.  It will shorten the distance
to ,'halis by 10 km and relieve serious congestion on the Baqouba road whicl
now carries The Baghdad-Xirkuk traffic.  In addi.tion, the road is expected
to generate production benefits by providing access to new supplies of buildinig
materials for the Baghdad market and to an agricultural region scheduled for
intensive development (the government's Lower Diyalla project).
79.       Fallujah bridge:  The present crossing of the Duphrates on the main
road between Baghdad, Ramadi, and points beyond in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon
is a 35-year old one-lane steel structure. The latter is becoming increasinb-ly
inconvenient, unsafe, and costly to maintain. The newi concrete bridge should
be regarded as part of the Baghdad-Ramnadi highway completed about )l years ago.
V. CONCLUSIONS ATT RECONiHU7-7'ATIONS
80.       The engineering of the project lhas already been satisfactorily
carried out either by consultants or by the Directorate General of Roads and
Bridges. The cost estimates are reliable and the project is economically
justified. Arrangements for procurement and project execution are satisfacto-y.V,
81.       During the loan negotiations, agreement has been obtained frorm the
Government on the following points:
a)  The hiri.ng of experts to advise the DRB on improving tce main-
tenarnce operation (paragraph 57), and appropriat-ion of adequate
annual allocations for road maintenance from the budget
(paragraph 26),
b)  The employment of consultants to help prepare a 5-10 year road
construction program based on economic priorities (paragraph 55).
c)  The organization of a systematic traffic counting system for the
country, with adequate report of the results to the interested
parties, (paragraph 72).
82.       The project provides a sui-table basis for a loan of US$23 million
equivalent to the Iraqi. Goverrunent,  A 20-year term including a 4-year period
of grace would be appropriate.

APPRNDLyX I
TExpanded Justification of Individual 2oads and Bridges
1. Shirgat-iosul (146 kim)?  This is the final link in the completion of a
modern all-w%eather highway between Baghdad and the country's second largest
city. Miosul is the center of a major dry-farming region in iwhich wheat is thie
principal crop. Barley, watermelons, rice, and freshl fruits are important
secondary crops.  Baghdad (six times the size of Niosul) provides the major
market for the region's exportable surplus. lost oif the iwatermelons and fresh
fruit, and a small part of the grain moves south by truck.  Completion of the
highway will reduce the truck driving time from about 20-25 hours l-5 years
ago to 6-8 hours. The saving in time and spoilage might contribute to lowering
produce prices in Baghdad and raising agricultural incomes in the groTjin  area
wqithin the road's roach.  The bulk of iliosulfs imports comne via Baghdad, not
from 1Mediterranean ports by rail through Syria. Baghdad and Mosul have been
linked for several years by a standard railway (which provides daily passenger
and freight service and twice weekly sends trains northward on the export route
into Syria and Turkey). Except for the project section the old highway has
been rebuilt to modern standards within the past 4-7 years, greatly reducing
trucking rates between the twvo cities. This section of the rmain north-south
highway will serve a considerable anount of purely regional traffic betw¢een
Shirgat and Mosul, as well as the Baghdad-iJosul vehicles. The saving in
transportation yields an esti;nated return of 18 percenlt.
2,  Kut-Nassiriya (176 kmn): This is the longest and most costly road in the
project. T1he terminal cities are the third and fourth largest in southern
Iraq, the former on the Tigris, tlhe latter on the Euphrates.  Kat is already
served by a modern highway to which the proposed road would he connected.
Nassiriya is unconnected to all-weather roads and would be stimulated as a
distribution center by the proposed conniection.  The area, once the heart of
Mesopotamia, is !moim today as the Gharraf region.  Its population numbers
between 200-250,000,
3. The C-harraf is traversed over its full length by an earth road whose
surface is in very bad condition, is punctuated by small but steep irrigation
bridges every few hundred meters, and which in wet weather becomes im2assable
for most types of vehicles,  Agriculturally  it is a flood plain of about
300,000 ha. of which an average of arolund 200,000 ha, is flood-irrigated in
the spring and early surmer. It has long been a major producer of winter
grains and a minor producer of summer crops, Slleep are an imnportant animal
product. A large canal provides water for both irrJgation and barge transport.
Four major regulators, with locks, have just been completed. The regulators
will help control excessive floods and irrigation flooding. The land is
usually overirrigated and the groundwater level is higlh causing accumulation
of salt at various spots. The ermbanlanents of the canal are at present being
raised in ordnr to ir;prove water control,

4. Production in 1961/62 in the Kut and 1Nassiriya plains is given as follows:
Crop                                   Output (metric tons)
1) Winter Crops
Wheat                                            112,000
Barley                                          232c000
2) Surmer Crops
Melons                                           42,C000
Rice                                              23,000
Cotton                                              O ,0',
Green gram                                         2,000
Millet                                             1,000
Sesame                                              400
Mlaize                                               100
Total:         416,500
It is assumed that three--quarters of this total is produced within the
influence of the road (i.e. 312,000 tolls) and that 100,000 tons are retained
for food and seed.  Thus the tonnage sent out of the region in 1961/62 approxi-
mated 200,000 tons. A significant amount of the grain crop 'and most of that
exported through Basrah) moves out by river barge.  Average annual tonnage for
1952-56 wras 1085000. In 1959 and 1960, tonnage fell to 40,000 and 18,000 tons,
reflecting in large part the short-run effects of agrarian reform.   1963 barge
tonnage out of the Gliarraf is be'lieved to have been Nell under 50,000 tons,
Consequently, over 150,000 tons can be assumed to move out by truck; this
volure would account for around 75 to 100 trucks per day ln one direction,
double these f-gures coming and going, Vehiicles directly involved in rno nng
agricultural crops thus account for about 30 percent of tihe estimated daily
traffic of 600 vehicles. A doub'ling of agricultural production (which would
not carry outDut mruchl above tile level of 10 years ago) would raise the amount
of product to be evacuated to approximately 5O,000 tons and the number of
trucks engaged in crop transport to an average of 200 trucks daily. After
doubling, the increased daily traffic for crop-transport vehicles is about
400 vehicles, which accounts for about one-third of the expected increase in
daily traffic.
5, The Gharraf region has suffercd from the effects of recent agrarian reform.
Production has probably fallen 30-50 percent from leve's normal before 1958;
however, it can be expected to recover when the shock of agrarian reform is
overcome. Agricultural services in the region are in an early stage of develop-
ment.  Ste-os a:-e nowx iJeinc talken to i.aprove the services in credit, extension
and cooperativres along wyitlh the improvements in irr-gation and drainage,  The
mnost important physical problem of the region is soil salinity and a high water
table; therefore, large investments in drainage will be required.

6. ,reruW -.svWK. -.tL (ito bha) have coinpleted a preliminary dralinage survey
for-the regiuio eastQ ti' i.±e canal: estimrated i.nvestmrent requirements are
ID 20 million for drainage.  lhe same consultant,s have also estimated -that
drainage, improved irrigati.on and relatively simple changes in cultural
practices can raise yields around 100 percent and add ID 3-4 million to net
agricultural incomes in the eastern Gharraf region0   The Government intends
to contract for a-.'-tailed project study as part of the revised Five-Vear Plan
to begin in 1965, -J. preliminary study of tle drainage requirements on the
west side of the canal may also be undertaken during the next Plan.   The net
road will reduce transport costs and time for agriaultural produce from the
area, especially important for melons. Tlhe road will also facilitate further
development of the agricultural services.  Tne effect of the road on agri.cu]-
tural product-ion T2. bo considerable, although the fu'l potential cainiot be
achieved wut:       i-;-  e l orks on drainage and irrigation,  In the jus.i fi-
cation, no va_ue-h-a's'becn put on the p'ossible increase in agricultural produc-
tion as a consequence of road construction, since the road will yield 10 percent
without it. The road's contribution to agricultural improvement provides
additional benefits to reinforce the justification.
7. Zubair-Safwan (34 Ian): This is a short, low-cost link in the international
connection between Basrah and Kuuait. The-lattor country has completed a
modern highway that extends 4 In inrside Iraq to the customs poilt at Safwan.
The present Safwan-Zubair road is an old asphalt pavenment in bad condition.
-There is a considerable traffic in foodstuffs and 'building materials from
southern Iraq to Kuiyrit, as well as a subst3ntial movezaent of people in buses,
taxis, and private cars, Average daily traffic is estimated at around 1,50O
vehicles. If traffic grows at the reasonable rate of 6 percent for 10 years,
and at 3 percent thereafter, the savings in transport costs would represent a
return of 18 percent.
8. Garmat-Ali c-nossing of the Shatt Al-Arab (lh 1mn):  This is an access road
betiZeeen the new Garviat-Ali briage (w. ic-hcthe Bank is not financing) and Basrah
and Ktuwjait..,  1 .z ugliting ponton bridge on the outskirts of Basrah is the most
serious, bottf7 - c jJ' tho "50 Im between Basrah and Baghdad. This one-way
bridge canno  eau-; 2oad-: of over h-5 tons.  The great majority of long-
distance trucit: rl...- 10 tons or more.  Consequently, all large trucks going
north via the Tigris route must stop at the Garmat-Ali bridge, hire labor gangs
to divide thei'r 'loads into two or more parts, engage pickup -rucks to transfer
the parts across the bridgc, then reload the big truck for the trip north, a
process which rcquires >-4 hours. It costs ID 3 in out-of-pocket expenses or
10 percent of the standard Basrah-Baghdad charge for a 10-ton load, Occasiornal
heavr loads that cannot be divided must travel alternate roundabout routes at
far greater cost, The rermoval of the bottleneck at the Garmat-Ali bridge,
plus the construction of the final Nut-Amarrah link in the Basrah-Baghdad
higlhway (a link now under construction) are together expected to reduce the
inter-city truck -z-zte by 25-30 percent.  The journey of 550 Im will become a
one-cay tru.ck t-ip .,nstead of the present two days, and the road will become
passable in wet ;1atlher.  The saving on truck traffic alone over the Garmat-
Ali bridge would-vK&td a 15 percent return over the combined cost of the bridge
and its l4 Ion ac(-ess road (the Bank project includes only the latter).  One
probable effect o-E the cost reductions produced by ellnination of this bottle-
necs and completion of the Kut-Arnarrah section will be increased diversion of

freight traffic frcrn the railway.
9. Baghdad-!Chalis (57 km):  This road represents construction of the final
link in the newTnTghway between Baghdad. ard Kirkuk. All other sections of this
major highway have been completed, or niearly so. Present traffic between
Baghdad and Kirkuk must go via an indirect route 13 percent longer than the
proposed link, over an old asphalt road that is already seriously overcrowded.
Traffic on the existing road is heavy, approximately 4,000 vehicles per day.
Estimated daily traffic on the proposed link is 1,500.  The proposed link is
expected to yield a 14 percent return fro^m vehicle savings alone,  In addition,
the road will open up new berritory to the north of Baghdad that may yield
important developmental effects in two important branches of production,
agriculture and building materials,  The road will traverse the low;er Diyalla
district, scheduled for a major project during the next five years, As for
building materials, the present highways leading north and west from Baghdad
are important arteries for the shipment of locally-found building materials and
have provided sites for factory locations, particularly brick kim ns 'The
Baghdad-Khalis road may be expected to open up similar opportunities.
10,  FalLujah Bridge: 'This bridge will provide a twuo-direction crossing of the
Euphrates on the main truck and tourist route betuyeen Baghdad and the W4est.
At present the only crossing is a one-lane. steel bridge built 30-35 years ago,
long before the recent upsurge in automotive transportL  Although the Fallujah
bridge does not yet constitute the same kind of costly bottleneck as the Ganaot-
Ali bridge at Basrah, it is becoming progressively inconvenient and dangerous
to the rising volume of users, and increasingly costly to maintain in safe
condition, There is a strong prospect that major improvements to the road
corinecting Iraq to Syria and the ilediterranean Coast will be undertaken wit,hin
the next 5 years.  The resulting cheapening of transport and travel will further
increase international traffic over the Fallujah bridge. Construction of the
new bridge at this time can be justified partly in anticipation of these
iLminent developments.
11. Designs for the new bridge were not ready when the Baghdad-Ramadi highoay
was reconstructed to modern standards,  If the cost of thc proposed bridge had
been included as part of that project the total project would have yielded a
return of 15 percent.
12.  The economic returns reported above are only notional.  they represent
the discounted internal rate of return for each road (and the Fallujah bridge)
based on the estimated costs and construction time for each segment and esti-
mated road-user savings. The, latter are based on the estimated economic costs
of vehicle operation (using Table i as a basis for application of a standard-
vehicle figure) and the estimated number of vehicles using the roads over their
assumed econcmic life of 25 years.  The traffic figures used as a base are
believed conservative, but they are not grounded in good statistics and cannot
be given high credence.  The annual traffic growth-rates are, of course,
assumed,
