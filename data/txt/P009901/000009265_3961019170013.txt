SECOND KARNATAKA POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2938-IN
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Karnataka Power
Project in India, for which the Bank approved a loan (Ln. 2938-IN) of US$ 260 million equivalent
on May 10, 1988. The loan, which was granted within a year of the approval of the first
Karnataka Power Project (Loan 2827-IN), became effective on October 27, 1988. The loan was
made to the Government of India (GOI) for on-lending through the Government of Karnataka
(GOK) to the Karnataka Electricity Board (KEB) and to the Karnataka Power Corporation
(KPC). The loan was scheduled to be closed on December 31,1996.
At GOI's request, US$40 million equivalent from the loan amount was canceled on
December 5, 1991, because of anticipated savings in project costs due to the devaluation of the
Rupee. Later on, because the construction of Sharavathi Tailrace Scheme (SRTS) had been at a
standstill for a considerable time on court orders while awaiting a new environmental clearance,
and also because of continued failure on the part of GOK, KPC and KEB to comply with a
number of the key covenants, the Bank suspended disbursements on April 8, 1993. No adequate
remedial actions were taken by GOK, KPC and KEB. The Bank therefore canceled on August 1,
1993 the remaining funds for the part of the project executed by KPC and on October 25, 1993
the balance of funds for the part of the project executed by KEB. (This was done concurrently
with the suspension and cancellation of the First Karnataka Power Project, Loan 2827-IN). The
total amount disbursed from the loan proceeds was about US$24 million equivalent. The loan
account was closed on December 16, 1993.
The ICR was prepared by the Energy and Infrastructure Operations Division, Country
Department II, South Asia Regional Office.
This ICR is based on the material in the project files, on discussions with the officials of GOI,
GOK, KEB and KPC, and on information obtained during the ICR mission to India in September
1994, including a visit to several project sites.

SECOND KARNATAKA POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2938-IN)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    The Bank loan for the Second Karnataka Power Project was made within one year of the
approval of the first Karnataka Power Project loan (Loan 2827-[N, see ICR Report No. 15184,
dated December 21, 1995. Most of the conclusions of the ICR of Ln. 2827-IN are applicable to
the second project as well. Originally the components of this second project were to be included
in the scope of the first project, but Bank management decided to split tne project. The objectives
of the two Karnataka Power Projects were virtually the same.
Project Objectives and Components
ii.    The principal project objectives were to alleviate power shortage in Karnataka and the
Southern Region by exploiting hydro-electric resources, and to provide efficient transmission and
distribution systems. The other objectives, though not explicitly stated, were to effect
institutional, operational and financial improvements in the two power utilities of the State. The
Bank loan of US$260 million equivalent was made to GOI for on-lending through the
Government of Karnataka (GOK) to the Karnataka Electricity Board (KEB) and the Karnataka
Power Corporation (KPC) and the two State-owned utilities responsible for power generation and
power transmission and distribution. The project comprised: (a) construction of 4x60MW
Sharawati Tailrace Hydro-electric Scheme (STRS) at Gersoppa, and measures for the associated
compensatory afforestation; (b) repair of Talakalale dam located upstream of STRS; (c)
construction of about 725 km of 400kV and 220kV transmission lines, and the associated
substations; (d) laying of about 6km of 66kV underground cables and construction of associated
substations; (e) reinforcement of the primary distribution grid in Bangalore; and (f) consulting
services for design and construction supervision of 400kV lines and substations.
Implementation Experience and Results
iii.   The rationale of Bank management for presenting the Second Karnataka Power Project to
the Board, so quickly after the first project was not clear. Supervision missions for the first
project had already reported delays in project implementation of the first project, but the SAR of
the second project did not contain a comprehensive analysis of the status of the various
components to be implemented under the first project. The SAR, however, did report the poor
financial performance of KPC and KEB. The implementation problems were compounded by the
withdrawal, in 1991 by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEF) of the environmental
clearance for the STRS originally provided to KPC in 1987, following a complaint to the High
Court of Karnataka by a public interest group in 1989.



- ii -
iv.    Although the SAR of the second project showed that both KPC and KEB were in default
of the financial covenants under the first loan and little progress had been made in resolving the
financial problems, the first Karnataka Power project was declared effective about a month before
the Board presentation of the second project in May 1988. The only action noted in the SAR was
that GOK had appointed a committee to make recommendations on the actions to be taken to
assist with KPC's and KEB's financial recovery. Most of the bidding documents for the various
project components were not ready to be issued. Approval of a second loan by the Bank was
therefore pre-mature and inappropriate given the weak financial position of the executing
agencies. Ultimately, the inability of GOK to ensure that KEB and KPC could achieve a
reasonable level of financial viability and the resulting inability to finance their share of the project,
was a major factor in the Bank's decision to first suspend and then cancei the loan
v.    From 1990 onwards, the Bank gave repeated warnings to the GCK and the agencies
concerned that it would suspend disbursement unless adequate remedial actions would be taken to
comply with the Bank's covenants and renew the environmental clearance for the STRS.
Eventually, on April 8, 1993, the Bank suspended disbursements, and in the absence of adequate
remedial measures, the loan was canceled on October 23, 1993. Only US$24 million equivalent
from the loan amount was disbursed. The overall outcome of the project was highly
unsatisfactory and virtually none of the project objectives was achieved, because only very few of
the project components were physically completed.
Key Lessons Learned
vi    Several important lessons can be drawn:
-  Project Design. For most of the project components engineering and preparation of bid
documents, part of which was to be financed under the first Karnataka Power Project loan had
not been completed and the necessary government clearances had not been obtained.
Submission of the project to the Board was therefore premature.
*  When determining the most suitable options for the repair of the Talakalale dam technical
as well as cost factors should have been given equal consideration. Too much time was and
money was lost in discussing a technically controversial and expensive solution, while other
technically acceptable, lower cost options were also being proposed.
*  The withdrawal of the environmental clearance for the STRS shows that changing public
attitudes on issues such as the environment could adversely affect the construction progress of
a project at any stage. A more rigorous risk analysis should have been carried out since not all
mitigatory studies had been completed by the time the project went to the Board.
*  Support from both GOI and GOK for the project was inadequate. Obtaining central
government clearances proved to be a cumbersome process. Successive changes in GOK and
in its leadership resulted in frequent changes in the top management of the utilities. Required
tariff revisions were not granted, electricity bills from government departments and
undertakings were seldom paid in time and budgetary support was inadequate. This situation



- 111 -
prevailed despite the fact that GOI and GOK were signatories to the legal agreements. The
failure of this project has helped to shape the Bank's current thinking that without introducing
fundamental changes such as the creation of an independent regulatory authority, tariff
reforms, incorporation of the power sector activities and privatization of distribution, it would
be difficult to insulate the state power sector from political interference, create creditworthy
entities and operate the sector on a commercial basis. This new approach is already reflected
in the design of Bank state power sector operations currently being prepared in India.
* Onlending arrangements were sub-optimal: the executing agencies had no direct access to
the Special Account and the arrangement provided few incentives for the implementing
agencies to accelerate project implementation. The effectiveness of the onlending
arrangements for executing agencies at the state level should be reviewed. Financial
covenants should have been more focused on providing the utilities with adequate cash
resources to conduct their operations and contribute to their investnLient program from their
own resources. No assessment was carried out to assess GOK's ability to provide the
required budgetary support.
* Financial performance. The loan was approved at a time that both executing agencies were
in default of essential financial covenants agreed with the Borrower less than a year before,
without a credible plan to comply with these covenants within a reasonable period of time.
Bank approval of the loan was therefore not appropriate. The Bank should have waited with
the Board presentation for the Second Karnataka Power Project, until GOK had demonstrated
through concrete action that the financial viability of KPC and KEB had been restored. That
could have laid the foundation for a long lasting working relationship between the
beneficiaries and the Bank to help develop the power sector in Karnataka in a sustainable
manner.






PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
1.    The Bank loan for the Second Karnataka Power Project was made within one year of the
approval of the first Karnataka Power Project loan (Loan 2827-IN, see ICR Report No. 15184,
dated December 21, 1995. Most of the conclusions of the ICR of Ln. 2827-1N are applicable to
the second project as well. Originally the components of this second project were to be included
in the scope of the first project, but Bank management decided to split the project. The objectives
of the two Karnataka Power Projects were virtually the same.
Objectives
2.    The principal objectives of the Second Karnataka Power Project were to:
(a) alleviate the acute power shortage of generating capacity in Karnataka and the
Southern Region by developing the Sharavathi Tailrace Scheme (STRS), a relatively low
cost hydro-electric resource, and the necessary transmission capacity to evacuate the
power;
(b) reduce energy losses and improve service quality by strengthening Karnataka's
transmission grid and the Bangalore distribution system; and
(c) reduce the distribution system capital and operating costs by introducing new
technologies and operation and maintenance procedures.
3.    The project was a part of the least cost expansion program for the Southern Region and
comprised: (a) construction of 4x60 MW STRS at Gersoppa, and measures for compensatory
afforestation; (b) repair of Talakalale dam located upstream of STRS; (c) construction of about
725 km of 400kV and 220kV transmission lines, and the associated substations; (d) laying of
about 6km of 66kV underground cables and construction of associated substations; (e)
reinforcement of the primary distribution grid in Bangalore; and (f) consulting services for design
and construction supervision of 400kV lines and substations.
4.    The total project cost was estimated at appraisal at US$570 million equivalent, and the
project was scheduled for completion by December 31, 1996. The Bank loan of US$260 million
was to be on-lent through the Government of Karnataka (GOK) to the Karnataka Electricity
Board (KEB) and to the Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC), the State-owned power
generation, and power transmission and distribution utilities.

Evaluation
5.    The physical and institutional objectives were fully justified at the time of appraisal. As
with the rest of the country, the electricity supply in Karnataka was incapable of meeting the
rapidly growing demand. The problems were aggravated by high system losses, arising from
inadequate investment in transmission and distribution systems commensurate with the growth in
generation facilities as well as poor operation and maintenance practices.
6.    The rationale of Bank management for presenting the Second Karnataka Power Project to
the Board, so quickly after the first project was not clear. Supervision missions for the first
project had already reported delays in project implementation of the first project, but the SAR of
the second project did not contain a comprehensive analysis of the status of the various
components to be implemented under the first project. Although the SAR of the second project
show that both KPC and KEB were in default of the financial covenants under the first loan and
little progress had been made in resolving the financial problems, the first Karnataka Power
project was declared effective about a month before the Board presentation of the second project
in May 1988. The only action noted was that GOK had appointed a committee to make
recommendations on the actions to be taken to assist with KPC's and KEB's financial recovery.
The lack of financial viability of both executing agencies was a major factor in their inability to
finance their share of the project cost. Most of the bidding documents for the project were not
ready to be issued. Approval of a second loan by the Bank was therefore premature and
inappropriate given the weak financial position of the executing agencies.
7.    The economic analysis in the SAR of the second project was identical to the analysis of
the first project. It stated that the project components formed part of the least cost investment
program for the southern Region and that the benefits of the components of the project could not
be separated from those of other investments in the power system. A cost-benefit analysis of the
least cost expansion program for the Southem Region was carried out. Using a standard
conversion factor of 0. 8, the internal economic rate of return (IERR) was estimated at 4%. It was
recognized that the low return was a reflection of the low level of tariffs in the Southern region
and below the opportunity cost of capital. However, taking into account an estimate of the
willingness to pay, related to the cost of autogeneration for industrial and agricultural consumers,
the IERR was calculated at 12%. The SAR did not include a comprehensive risk analysis nor had
any attempt been made to update the analysis, even though it must have been evident at that time
that quite a few of the anticipated investments were not going to be implemented as planned. As
the project was canceled before most components were completed and neither KPC or KEB was
able to provide an update of funding required to complete the various project components, the
EIRR could not be recalculated. At this point no economic benefits can be attributed to the
project.
Achievements of Obiectives
8.    Almost none of the project objectives were achieved, because only very few of the project
components were physically completed. The ICR of the first Karnataka Power Project already
highlighted that the first project had been presented to the Board too early, because the necessary



- 3 -
government clearances had not yet been obtained and most of the bid documents were not ready
to issued. The same mistake was repeated under the Second Karnataka Power Project. The only
exception was the STRS for which all necessary government clearances had been obtained, but as
explained below the environmental clearance was later withdrawn. By the time the loan was
canceled, more than five years after Board approval, most of the bid documents for the
transmission and distribution components had still not been issued, which explains why only less
than 10% of the loan had been disbursed five years after Board approval.
9.    As was the case in the first Karnataka Power Project, support from both GOI and GOK
for the project was inadequate. Administrative procedures from GOI agencies and departments to
obtain techno-economic clearance, approval of tender documents, import licenses and foreign
exchange were cumbersome, and the demands from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) were
often onerous. Changes in GOK and in its leadership resulted in frequent changes in the top
management of the utilities. Required tariff revisions were not granted, electricity bills from
government departments and undertakings were seldom paid in time and budgetary support
(mostly expected to be provided in the form of state government loans) was inadequate. The
situation was further aggravated by delays in the release of state government budgetary funds as
well as payment of rural electrification subsidies to KEB.
10.   The poor financial performance of KPC and KEB throughout the project
implementation period was described in detail in the ICR for the first Karnataka Project (ICR
Report No. 15184, dated December 21, 1995 and has not been repeated. Ultimately, the inability
of GOK to ensure that KEB and KPC could achieve a reasonable level of financial viability and
the resulting inability to finance their share of the project, was a major factor in the Bank's
decision to first suspend and then cancel the loan.
11.   There are two other major factors which affected the implementation of the second
Karnataka Project namely: (i) the withdrawal of the environmental clearance for the STRS; and
(ii) the technical discussions for finding the optimal technical solutions for the repair of the
Talakalale dam. These are discussed below.
Maior Factors Affectin2 the Project
Sharavathi Tailrace Scheme (STRS)
12.   Implementation of the STRS proceeded reasonably well through 1989. The contractors
had mobilized soon after the award of the contracts ( October 1989 for the power house, and
November 1989 for the 60-meter high Dam). Prior to the award of these contracts, KPC had
undertaken some initial works, such as the construction of a diversion channel, bridge
downstream of the dam, etc.
13.   The environmental clearance from GOI's Department of Environment and Forestry had
been obtained for the STRS prior to Board approval and the SAR stated that the Bank was
satisfied that the project component posed no serious environmental problems. In late 1989, a
public interest group obtained a court order prohibiting KPC from felling any further trees in the



- 4 -
area around Gersoppa dam. KPC tried to get the stay order lifted, but subsequently, the
Karnataka High Court issued an injunction to stop all work at Gersoppa, pending re-examination
of the environmental clearance by MOEF. The High Court ruled in December 1990, that GOI
had not fully examined all available information when it granted its environmental clearance for
the project in 1987.
14.   While awaiting MOEF review, which was to be completed in April 1991, KPC on appeal
to the Supreme Court of India was permitted to carry out construction activities, but only in the
area already cleared of the forest. Only limited works could be carried out. Court hearings on the
case were postponed several times, largely due to inordinate delays on the part of the MOEF
responsible for review of environmental clearance. In July, 1992, MOEF finally withdrew the
environmental clearance and the forest clearance given earlier, and asked for studies to cover
more details on the environment. The additional studies took a long time to complete and after
changing the consultants, were finally completed around mid- 1993. At the time the loan was
canceled, the environmental clearance for the STRS had not been renewed and the work had
come to a complete standstill.
15.   The Bank's review of the environmental aspects during project preparation could be
considered adequate, except that a more rigorous risk analysis should have been carried out since
not all mitigatory studies had been completed by Board presentation. The Bank was not in a
position to interfere in the legal process. KPC could possibly have been more effective in its
defense of the case in the courts and in monitoring the consultants engaged to carry out the
additional studies. It is understood that the environmental clearance was renewed in late 1993,
but it is not known whether KPC has been able to mobilize the funding to complete the project.
Repair of the Talakalale dam
16.   The Talakalale Dam, a masonry dam, holds a balancing reservoir between the
Linganamakki reservoir and the intake structure of the STRS. The reservoir had been losing large
quantities of water for some time due to heavy seepage through the deteriorated brick-mortar
joints. Under the first Karnataka Power project (Loan 2827-lN), KPC was required to engage
engineering consultants to determine the best technical option for the repairs: e.g. grouting of the
dam and foundation or placing an impermeable membrane on the upstream face of the dam.
17.   The engagement of consultants took a long time, partly because of the involvement and
interference of GOI agencies in the preparation of terms of reference. Bank supervision missions
expressed concern at the delay in engaging consultants because of the potential threat to the
safety of the dam structures and danger of collapse of the dam due to the seepage. In the
meantime, KPC started with plugging of suction holes in September 1987. The initial results were
encouraging. It was, however, realized that this was not a satisfactory long-term solution.
18.   In January 1990, the international consultants offered seven feasible engineering solutions
but they recommended the lining of the upstream dam surface with steel plates anchored to the
face of the dam. Such repair works had never been carried out in big dams up to 60 meters deep



- 5 -
as required for the Talakalale dam. It is unclear from the records why the consultants did not give
more consideration to a more conventional solution of sealing and grouting of open joints in the
upstream surface of the dam.
19.   KPC, its panel of experts and CEA were skeptical of the main recommendation for several
reasons including: (i) very high costs (nearly the same as the construction cost of a replacement
dam downstream); (ii) high probability of being unable to carry out effective welding and
anchoring underwater; and (iii) the fact that this had not been tried out in a dam of similar size.
KPC also obtained the opinion of an internationally known expert body on dams, who
recommended an alternative solution. No conclusions could be reached.
20.   While discussions on the possible courses of action for implementation of the
recommendations moved back and forth between KPC and the Bank, KPC went ahead with repair
of the dam by (underwater) grouting of the upstream dam surface in a more systematic manner.
The method used was a masonry technique of pointing and grouting of the dam, which was one of
the seven solutions of the consultants report. This involves removal of mortar between joints of
two adjacent bricks to a depth of about three inches, and filling the resultant wedge-shaped gap
with a mixture of cement, sand and a domestically produced quick setting compound. The results
so far, have been quite remarkable, and the total cost of pointing is expected to be about the same
as the cost of the consultants study, and a mere fraction of the cost of the recommended solution.
Pointing of the entire underwater surface of the dam was expected to be completed around mid-
1995. The seepage is expected to be reduced to less than 1.00 cusecs, which would be
acceptable. Regular monitoring is being carried out by KPC and it seems that there is no danger
of an immediate collapse.
21.   The main concern of the Bank supervision missions was the danger of a collapse of the
dam and the drawn out process to come to a decision to start repairing the dam. Expert opinions
differed with respect to the danger of collapse. In retrospect, one could conclude that a grouting
expert should have been engaged much earlier in the process and that the sealing and grouting
solution should have been evaluated more seriously. The solution recommended by the consultant
was so expensive that the sealing and grouting of the dam, even if it has to be repeated after
several years, was much less expensive. It also seems that the consultants were not familiar with
the latest underwater grouting techniques.
Sustainability
22.   As the Bank loan was canceled well before the majority of the physical components of the
project were completed and the financial viability of both KEB and KPC have not been restored,
it is doubtful that at this stage any sustainable improvements, in economic or financial terms, can
be attributed to the impact of the Bank loan. The power supply situation in the southern region
remains critical and is the worst of India's five power regions. Systems frequency is below 50
cycles over 90 percent of the year and the systems load cannot be met even during off peak
periods. The only exception is that a reasonable solution appears to have been found for the
repair of the Talakalale dam, but as described above the Bank should not be credited for that.

Bank Group Performance
23.   The performance of the Bank in respect of project preparation and appraisal cannot be
considered satisfactory. The executing agencies were in clear default of the financial covenants
agreed under the first Karnataka Power project loan when the project was submitted to the Board
and project preparation, particularly for the transmission line components had not sufficiently
advanced. The loan was approved and declared effective when both, KPC and KEB, were in
default with key financial covenants. Only by 1990, the Bank started to enforce the financial
covenants more seriously, but the political situation in Karnataka remained such, that GOK was
not in a position to approve and implement the necessary tariff increases. The deterioration in
state finances further contributed to GOK 's inability to deliver on promised financial support to
the state utilities. The absence of a thorough analysis of availability of state financial resources,
made the financial projections in the SAR look rather unrealistic. When it became apparent in the
early stages of project implementation that GOK was not in a position to deliver on the tariff
increases or on the projected budgetary support for the investment programs of both KEB and
KPC, the Bank should have taken immediate remedial actions. The Bank's sustained objection to
GOK's abolition of agricultural tariffs on the grounds that it was in contradiction of GOI policy
and sound public utility practices was fully justified.
24.   The withdrawal of the environmental clearance was beyond the control of the Bank. In
retrospect, one could conclude that the discussions regarding the repairs of the Talakalale dam
could have been handled better. It was a situation were "technical experts" disagreed.
Borrower Performance
25.   As highlighted in the ICR of the first Karnataka Power Project, the cumbersome
government clearance procedures have contributed to implementation delays. The lack of
effective autonomy and GOK support for tariff increases prevented KPC and KEB from achieving
a reasonable financial viability and ultimately in their inability to generate the resources to finance
their share of the project. GOK and KPC had no choice than to respect the court orders to
interrupt the construction of the STRS.
Key Lessons Learned
26.   Several important lessons can be drawn:
*  Project Design. For most of the project components engineering and preparation of bid
documents, part of which was to be financed under the first Karnataka Power Project loan had
not been completed and the necessary government clearances had not been obtained.
Submission of the project to the Board was therefore premature.
*  When determining the most suitable options for the repair of the Talakalale dam technical
as well as cost factors should have been given equal consideration. Too much time was and
money was lost in discussing a technically controversial and expensive solution, while other
technically acceptable, lower cost options were also being proposed.

The withdrawal of the environmental clearance for the STRS shows that changing public
attitudes on issues such as the environment could adversely affect the construction progress of
a project at any stage. A more rigorous risk analysis should have been carried out since not all
mitigatory studies had been completed by the time the project went to the Board.
* Support from both GOI and GOK for the project was inadequate. Obtaining central
government clearances proved to be a cumbersome process. Successive changes in GOK and
in its leadership resulted in frequent changes in the top management of the utilities. Required
tariff revisions were not granted, electricity bills from government departments and
undertakings were seldom paid in time and budgetary support was inadequate. This situation
prevailed despite the fact that GOI and GOK were signatories to the legal agreements. The
failure of this project has helped to shape the Bank's current thinking that without introducing
fundamental changes such as the creation of an independent regulatory authority, tariff
reforms, incorporation of the power sector activities and privatizatiol. of distribution, it would
be difficult to insulate the state power sector from political interference, create creditworthy
entities and operate the sector on a commercial basis. This new approach is already reflected
in the design of Bank state power sector operations currently being prepared in India.
Onlending arrangements were sub-optimal; the executing agencies had no direct access to
the Special Account and the arrangement provided few incentives for the implementing
agencies to accelerate project implementation. The effectiveness of the onlending
arrangements for executing agencies at the state level should be reviewed. Financial
covenants should have been more focused on providing the utilities with adequate cash
resources to conduct their operations and contribute to their investment program from their
own resources. No assessment was carried out to assess GOK' s ability to provide the
required budgetary support.
* Financial performance. The loan was approved at a time that both executing agencies were
in default of essential financial covenants agreed with the Borrower less than a year before,
without a credible plan to comply with these covenants within a reasonable period of time.
Bank approval of the loan was therefore not appropriate. The Bank should have waited with
the Board presentation for the Second Karnataka Power Project, until GOK had demonstrated
through concrete action that the financial viability of KPC and KEB had been restored. That
could have laid the foundation for a long lasting working relationship between the
beneficiaries and the Bank to help develop the power sector in Karnataka in a sustainable
manner.

Table- 9:. Project Economic Eval'atioix -
The project was an integral part of the least cost expansion program for the southern
region and a cost benefit analysis had been carried out on the program as a whole rather than on
the project in isolation. The estimated internal economic rate of return (EIRR). However, after
including additional benefits reflecting the consumers willingness to pay on the basis of alternative
cost of autogeneration by agricultural and industrial consumers, the EIRR increased to 12%.
As the project was canceled before most components were completed and neither KPC or
KEB was able to provide an update of funding -equired to complete the various project
components, the EIRR could not be recalculated. At this point, however, no economic benefits
have materialized from the project. The power demand/supply situation in the Southern region is
the worst of India's five power regions.
