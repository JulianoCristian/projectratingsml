The main features to be implemented by KEB include\n            the  construction of transmission lines and towers, the\n            laying of underground cable and construction of substations.\n            The project will further finance the reinforcement of the\n            primary distribution grid in Banglalore and the\n            implementation of a computerized distribution control\n            centre. Tools and equipment will be purchased and training\n            provided in their use for the construction of transmission\n            and distribution components. Consulting services will be\n            provided for the design and construction of substations and\n            a 400kV double circuit line."}, "docdt": "1988-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
