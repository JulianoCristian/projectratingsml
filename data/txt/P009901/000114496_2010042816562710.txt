            We refer to the Loan Agreement (Second Karnataka Power
Project) between India and the Bank dated July 27, 1988, as amended.  We
also refer to the letter dated October 20, 1992 from Mr. A.K. Khurana,
Director, Department of Economic Affairs, requesting that the erection
costs related to the project financed from the proceeds of the Loan.
            After due consideration, the Bank has agreed to this request
to disburse erection costs at 90%.  Accordingly, the description of
Category (1) in the table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the
Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:
      "(1) Civil Works and erections"
All other provisions of the Loan Agreement remain unchanged.
            Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by
signing the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and
returning it to us.
                             Very truly yours,
