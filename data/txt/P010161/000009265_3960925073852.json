The\n            main objectives were achieved, sustainability is likely, the\n            impact of the project has been substantial, and both the\n            Bank and the Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, the Bank needs to\n            provide additional manpower and financial resources to\n            achieve the goal of forming or strengthening FOs to ensure\n            sustained O&M rehabilitated schemes. Second, it must\n            include specific provisions for appropriate baseline\n            surveys, and when more than one agency is involved, provide\n            for adequate coordination in programs for the evaluation of\n            project impact and performance. Third, the formation of\n            farmer organizations should come before physical\n            rehabilitation. Fourth, farmer cooperation can be enhanced\n            by providing them the opportunity to participate in\n            rehabilitation activities as paid laborers. Fifth, land\n            consolidation should be combined with scheme rehabilitation\n            in tank command areas. Sixth, land tenure needs to\n            considered in scheme selection. Seventh, the quality of\n            physical works and the attention paid by project staff is\n            essential for the success of the rehabilitation effort.\n            Eighth, monitoring should be used as a management tool to\n            reduce implementation problems. Lastly, the initial scheme\n            preparation report should include a comprehensive survey of\n            agricultural production performance and socio-economic data\n            on potential beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1992-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
