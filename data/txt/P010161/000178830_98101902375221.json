repair.\n            The project consists of: (i) rehabilitation of about 12,000\n            village tanks and anicuts; (ii) strengthening of major\n            government institutions involved in village irrigation;\n            (iii) initiating a systematic water management program; and\n            (iv) establishing evaluation program designed to assist\n            project implementation

The project does not involve any unusual risk."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
