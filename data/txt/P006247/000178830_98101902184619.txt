INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
COMPANHIA SIDERURGICA PAULISTA - COSIPA
FOR A STEEL EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Companhia Siderurgica Paulista - COSIPA, with the guarantee of
the Federative Republic of Brazil, for the equivalent of $64.5 million
to help finance the expansion of COSIPA's steel mill from a capacity of
1.0 million to 2.3 million tons of raw steel per year. The loan would
have a final maturity of 151 years, including a i-year grace period,
and interest at 71¼ percent per annum. The COSIPA project together with
the Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) and Usinas Siderurgicas de
Minas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS) projects comprise Brazil's current program
for the expansion of its flat steel products capacity. Total World Bank
and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing of $320 million is
being sought by the Government of Brazil which has also negotiated
bilateral credit lines from nine major steel-equipment producing countries.
With the $64.5 million loan to CSN and the $63 million loan to USIMINAS
approved by the Executive Directors on February 1 and April 4, 1972,
respectively, the COSIPA loan would bring the World Bank's participation
to $192 million.  The IDB has already approved loans of $43 million and
$42 million, respectively, to CSN and USIMINAS and is considering a $43
million loan to COSIPA, which would bring its total to $128 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II. The Report describes Brazil's remarkable economic
growth over the past few years and the policies which the Government has
followed in achieving this performance. The Report also calls attention
to the large external capital inflow which was associated with rapid
growth. During 1968-70 the net inflow, after repayments on earlier debt-
rescheduling loans, amounted to $2.5 billion of which $1.7 billion con-
sisted of financial credits with maturities of one to four years. The
role of medium and long-term finance was important -- development agencies
contributed $690 million net (IDB -- $312 million; AID -- $278 million;
and IBRD -- $98 million), while suppliers' credits, including loans from
the U.S. Export-Import Bank, totalled about $200 million. Direct invest-
ments amounted to $270 million.



- 2 -
3.        The Report points out that continuation of rapid growth in
the 1970's requires substantial increases in external capital inflows.
There is a good prospect that this capital will be forthcoming on better
terms than in the recent past. The Government has placed controls on
short-term financial borrowing and has made considerable progress in
formulating investment projects suitable for external financing. These
steps will result in an expanded flow of suppliers' credits and project
loans. However, the gross external capital requirement cannot be met
if external assistance is tied entirely to the foreign exchange compo-
nent of project costs. Although the capital investment needed to support
Brazil's economic growth targets is substantial, the import needs of most
investment projects are relatively low, as Brazil's capital goods indus-
try is already highly developed and has proven its ability to compete
successfully under international competitive bidding.
4.        Brazil's total external disbursed debt amounted to $6.6 billion
at the end of 1971, of which more than two-fifths consisted of financial
credits. Because financial credits include a large component of direct
investment and commercial bank working capital credit lines, they are
probably not highly volatile despite the fact that an appreciable pro-
portion bore terms of one year or less. Moreover, much of the increase
in financial credits has been matched by an increase in foreign reserves,
which are now equivalent to some $2.0 billion, representing six months'
goods and nonfactor services imports. Brazil's debt service ratio on
long-term debt, excluding non-guaranteed private debt, amounted to 16.9
percent in 1970. Although external debt management is one of the more
critical issues confronting the Government at high rates of growth,
Brazil should be able to service the increasing debt needed to support
its growth targets if the present high quality of economic management
is sustained.
PART II - THE BANK'S ROLE IN BRAZIL
5.        Since 1949, Brazil has received 40 loans from the Bank amounting
to $1,308.1 million (net of cancellations), not including the $60 million
proposed loan for the Sao Simao hydroelectric project scheduled to be
considered by the Executive Directors on May 16. Annex I gives a summary
statement of loans and credits, as of April 30, 1972. Of the loans de-
clared effective, 22 have not been fully disbursed, and of those, disburse-
ment of 12 was behind schedule at the end of 1971. The pace of disbursements
has been accelerating, however. During FY65 to FY69 disbursements averaged
$10 million per year. They rose to $66 million in FY70, to $75 million in
FY71, and were $98 million in the first three quarters of FY72. I expect
that the disbursement rate will continue to accelerate during the next few
years. Comments on the implementation of projects and on disbursements
are in Annex I.



- 3 -
6.        Brazil is the country with the largest share of IFC's commit-
ments. Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in Brazil totalling
$62.3 million, of which $5.1 million has been repaid, $13.4 million
sold and $1.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of $42.5 million, $30.8
million represents loans and $11.7 million equity. A summary of IFC in-
vestments is given in Annex I.
7.        Bank lending to Brazil has been very active in this fiscal
year. Including the Sao Simao project, six loans totalling $372.5 mil-
lion have already been approved. The Bank is processing loans for a
land settlement project in the Northeast of Brazil and for a credit
program to assist the construction of grain storage facilities.
8.        In lending to Brazil, the Bank is responding to Brazil's
demonstrated ability to absorb increasing amounts of external capital
that enable it to sustain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting
sectors and projects for lending, the Bank seeks to fill important
development needs. In the first place, the Bank can help Brazil to
increase its foreign capital inflow by associating Bank loans with
sectors where sufficient bilateral financing is not available and where
the Bank's participation will help Brazil obtain such financing. The
Bank's recent and projected lending for both steel and electric energy
projects meets this criterion. In the hope that bilateral lenders will
be willing to finance some local currency expenditures, particularly in
highway construction, the Bank has encouraged the Brazilians to seek
bilateral finance for a part of the highway program which it assisted
with its $89 million loan of April 11, 1972.   In the second place, the
Bank is hoping to direct its lending towards areas in which it can
support the Government's efforts to strengthen institutions and pursue
sound economic policies. Such is the case with regard to investment
planning and finance in the power and water supply sectors. Thirdly,
the Bank is stressing the selection of projects which will help Brasil
overcome the most critical constraint on economic growth, namely, the
balance of payments. This means support of export-oriented investments
such as the MBR iron ore project or of import substituting industry
where, as in the case of steel, Brazil has a significant comparative
advantage. Fourthly, in selecting projects for financing, a concerted
effort is being made to identify projects that will foster the growth
of the less developed parts of Brazil, particularly the Northeast, and
reduce regional income disparities.
9.        The COSIPA project was appraised by joint missions of the Bank
and the IDB in May-June 1971 and February 1972. Negotiations took place
from April 24-28, 1972. COSIPA was represented by a delegation headed
by Mr. Pedro de Souza, General Superintendent of Expansion. The Govern-
ment of Brazil was represented by Mr. Antonio Miranda, Assistant to the
Executive Secretary of the Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica
(CONSIDER), Mr. Gabriel Costa Carvalho, Legal Adviser and Mr. Sebastiao
Martins Soares, Manager of the Department of Equity Investments of*Banco
Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico (ENDE).



- 4 -
PART III - THE BANKIS ROLE IN THE SAO PAULO REGION
10.       The COSIPA project is located in the state of Sao Paulo close
to the major steel consuming industries in Brazil. The Sao Paulo area
is the most dynamic in Brazil's economy. In the period 1960-68, the
state's GDP grew at 4.7 percent per annum, and since 1968 the state's
GDP has been growing faster than that of the rest of Brazil, averaging
over 10 percent per year and in 1971, according to preliminary estimates,
reaching 17 percent.
11.       Sao Paulo plays a vital role in providing employment for the
excess manpower from depressed areas such as the northeastern states,
in contributing resources through the Federal tax and fiscal incentive
systems to the less developed areas of the country, and in providing a
major market for the agricultural and mineral output of the non-indus-
trialized states. Employment by Sao Paulo's industries of unemployed
or underemployed rural populations represents one of the most effective
ways in which to raise their standard of living. It is estimated that
about 20 percent of Sao Paulo's population in 1970 had immigrated from
other parts of Brazil-. Half of these immigrants originated in the
northeastern states.  As a result, Sao Paulo's population has grown,
over the past two decades at a rate of 6 percent per annum, considerably
faster than that of the country as a whole -- although the natural demo-
graphic growth rate of the state is only 2.8 percent per annum.
12.       Sao Paulo's growth, heavily concentrated in the state capital,
has outstripped the state's ability to provide basic services and to
absorb further immigrants. For example, 50 percent of the urban popula-
tion lacks running water, 80 percent lacks sewerage, power capacity and
schools are overloaded and traffic is congested. But filling these needs
creates a serious financial problem.
13.       The tax burden in Sao Paulo, taking together the well-administered
Federal, state and municipal taxes, is estimated to approach 30 percent.
Except for those of the state railways, Sao Paulo's public enterprise
tariffs are reasonably in line with costs -- most recently the water supply
system's finances were put on a sound footing, following the 1971 Bank
water supply loan. Much of the tax burden consists of Federal taxes, a
large proportion of which is transferred out of the state to the less
developed regions of the country. In 1970, Sao Paulo contributed 53 per-
cent of the resources of the Federal Government's revenue sharing funds
but received only 7 percent of the allocations from those funds. In addi-
tion, about 50 percent of the resources transferred to the Northeast
through the investment tax incentive scheme originate in the state of
Sao Paulo. These fiscal considerations represent a serious constraint
on the ability of the Sao Paulo state and municipal governments to carry
forward programs designed to maintain the state's role as a key growth
pole. Such programs require massive investments which cannot be fully
financed from state resources.



-5-
14.       The above circumstances provide strong justification for the
Bank to support projects in the Sao Paulo area which contribute to a
high rate of economic growth and employment and in particular to a
rational planning of urban infrastructure. These were the objectives
of the Bank's past lending for water supply and pollution control, for
the port of Santos and for power projects in Sao Paulo.
15.       Additional opportunities will arise for continuing the Bank's
support. Further liending is contemplated for Sao Paulots power sector,
namely, a $20 million loan to Light, S.A. in FY73, designed to help that
company raise in external capital markets funds sufficient to finance
the very considerable requirements for expalsion of the electricity dis-
tribution network, and a loan in FY74 to Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo
(CESP) to help raise finance for the large Agua Vermelha hydroelectric
project. The Bank is also examining the possibility of a loan in FY74 to
help finance construction of part of the Sao Paulo beltway, a major highway.
PART IV - THE STEEL INDIUSTRY
16.       A revised report "Brazilian Steel Expansion Program - Part I"
(PI-16a), dated May 5, 1972, is being distributed separately. It contains
a description and evaluation of the Brazilian Government's expansion pro-
gram for flat steel products in the decade of the 1970's. This program
comprises the expansion of the basic iron and steel-making rolling and
finishing capacities of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA which together account
for the bulk of Brazil's output of flat rolled products.
History
17.       The establishment in Brazil of a modern steel industry dates
back to the 1920's with the creation by private foreign investors of an
integrated mill for the production of nonflat products. Since then, a
large number of nonflat product mills have been established, mostly
under private control. The Government's policy has been to preserve the
predominatly private ownership of the nonflat sector. IFC's Board is
scheduled to consider on May 23, 1972, a second investment in a company
which manufactures special steels. It is currently studying another
project in the nonflat steel sector.
18.       Mainly because of the large minimum economic size and the
resultant heavy investment requirements, Brazil's first integrated mill
for the production of flat products and heavy structurals, CSN's Volta
Redonda mill in the State of Rio de Janeiro, was founded only in 19k1,
at the initiative and under the control of the Government. The other
exclusively flat product plants, USIMINAS and COSIPA, were established
in the early 1960's in the States of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, respec-
tively. The Government also has a majority ownership in these companies,
although Japanese interests hold about 21 percent of USIMINAS' voting
shares.



-6-
19.       Based upon an abundant supply of high quality domestic iron
ore and a rapidly expanding internal market, Brazil's steel production
has grown rapidly since 1950 at an average annual rate of 9 percent.
Brazil is today Latin America's largest steel producer. Present capacity
is rated at 6.5 million raw steel tons divided about equally between flat
and nonflat rolled products.
Planned Expansion
20.       The Government plans to expand capacity to about 20 million
raw steel tons per year by 1980 or shortly thereafter, of which 11
million tons would be for flat products and 9 million tons for nonflat
products.
21.       Present flat product capacity of 3.1 million tons of raw steel
equivalent is currently being increased to 3.4 million tons in accordance
with Stage I of the Government's Steel Expansion Program. Stage II of
the Expansion Program for which the assistance of the Bank is sou4ght will
raise flat product capacity to 6.7 million tons of raw steel equivalent
by 1977. The total cost of the Stage II expansions of CSN, USIMINAS and
COSIPA is estimated at $1.3 billion, of which about $650 million relates
to equipment and machinery. Further expansion to the 1980 target would
be undertaken in Stage III.
The Bank's Role
22.       The Bank's association with the Brazilian steel industry began
in 1965 when it made a $420,000 technical assistance grant to the Govern-
ment for a study to assess the gap between the supply of and demand for
steel products in Brazil in the period 1966-72 and make recommendations
on the most economical way of expanding capacity. The study, which was
carried out by a U.S. consulting firm, Booz, Allen & Hamilton International,
Inc., concluded that Brazil's comparative advantage in producing steel and
the prospective growth of domestic demand justified a substantial expansion
of steel-making capacity. It also concluded that priority should be given
to bring CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA to balanced annual capacities of about
3.5-4.0 million raw steel tons each.
23.       Soon after completion of the study, the Government approached
the Bank to finance the expansions of COSIPA and USIMINAS to approximately
their presently envisaged capacities at the end of Stage I. The Bank at
that time suggested that the Government seek financing through bilateral
channels.
2h.       In fact, significant delays occurred in launching the Stage I
expansion programs. These delays and the rapid recovery of the economy
from the 1965-67 recession and with it the recovery of steel consumption,
led the Government to give highest priority to the coordination of the
steel sector and the implementation of an expansion program for the
seventies to forestall the need for massive importation of steel products.
The Government's resolve crystalized in the establishment in June 1970



-7-
of the Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica (CONSIDER) as a steel
coordinating agency with executive powers.
25.       CONSIDER has coordinated the preparation by the steel companies
of their expansion projects, made these projects compatible with one
another and with the findings of a comprehensive market study commissioned
by CONSIDER, coordinated arrangements with potential lenders such as the
Bank, IDB, bilateral credit agencies and the ENDE. In an advisory capacity,
CONSIDER plays a leading role in setting the Government's price control
policy with respect to steel products.
26.       When the Brazilian Government again requested the Bank in
September 1970 to consider financing the steel expansion program, it
could point, therefore, to substantial achievements, as well as to mas-
sive investment requirements. The Government felt that the Bank's
participation would enable Brazil to secure external financing on the
most favorable terms and to reduce investment costs significantly
through procurement of equipment on the basis of international competition.
27.       Originally, the Government proposed that the Bank organize a
consortium for the joint financing of the steel expansion program. Such
a consortium would have included the Bank, the IDB and the export credit
agencies of major steel-mill equipment producing countries. Since it
proved impossible to enlist the participation of the export credit agencies
of all major supplying countries, the Bank, the mDB and the Government
subsequently agreed on an alternative mixed joint-parallel financing scheme.
Financing Plan
28.       Under this scheme the equipment component of the three projects
has been divided into two separate lists. One, containing equipment and
engineering items whose value is estimated at $320 million, would be
entirely financed by the Bank and IDB in a 60:40 proportion. This list
includes the items which the Brazilian capital goods industry is thought
to be capable of manufacturing efficiently as well as a substantial num-
ber of items which are likely to be imported. Procurement will be on
the basis of full international competitive bidding with a 15 percent
margin of preference for Brazilian bidders.
29.       The other list, containing the balance of the equipment, will
be financed by bilateral credit agencies with competitive bidding restricted
to suppliers in countries which offer the steel companies credits on terms
acceptable to the Brazilians.  For this list, differing financial terms
offered will be taken into account for bid comparison purposes. The
Brazilian Government has received financing offers from Austria, Belgium,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S.A.,
which indicate that credits will be available on 15-year terms to cover
90 percent of the cost of orders placed in those countries for equipment
to be contained in the bilateral list.



-8-
30.       Financing for the 10 percent down-payments on bilaterally
financed equipment, and for civil works, incremental working capital
requirements and interest during construction will be provided from
internal cash generation of the steel companies and long-term loans
and equity investments primarily from the BNDE. The Government will
provide a guarantee of full performance of all the obligations of the
three companies, including a guarantee of provision of funds necessary
to complete and bring the projects into operation.
The Market
31.       In 1970, CONSIDER hired consultants to carry out a detailed
market study for the period 1972-80. This study, which involved a
sector-by-sector analysis of the 10 major steel consuming industries
in Brazil was reviewed in the Bank and checked against macro-economic
and sectoral projections made independently by the consultants and by
Bank staff. The following table compares the results of these projections
for flat products:
Forecast of Demand for Flat Rolled Products: 1972-80
(in million tons of flat products)
Sector Analysis       Macro-economic Analysis
Year                 Consultants    Bank       Consultants    Bank
1971 (Actual)                             2.7
1972                     2.5         2.5           2.9         2.4
1975                     3.5         3.3           3.9         3.3
1980                     5.8         5.1           6.2         5.4
32.       It appears realistic to assume that domestic demand for flat
products will rise to somewhere between 3.3 and 3.5 million tons in 1975
and to a level of 5.1 to 5.4 million tons by 1980. The Government intends
to undertake additional studies in 1972-73 to update the 1975-80 estimates
before embarking on Stage III of the Expansion Program.
33.       The estimated available flat product capacity of Brazilian steel
mills was 2.2 million tons in 1971. Assuming that Stage II of the Expan-
sion Program is completed as planned, capacity will rise to 3.5 million
tons in 1975 and to 4.7 million tons by 1980.
34.       The data indicate that, despite the completion of Stage I in
1973, domestic supply will fall short of demand up to the end of 1974
and that the flat product mills will, therefore, continue to be fully



-9-
utilized. Starting in 1975 with the completion of the first of the
Stage II expansion projects, available capacity is expected to exceed
domestic demand for three or four years. Should the more conservative
Bank projections, as distinguished from the consultants' forecasts,
prove closer to reality, and should, moreover, the Government's target
of maintaining the level of exports at 10 percent of capacity not be
met, utilization of capacity could fall to a low of about 84 percent
in 1976. Excess capacity would, however, be rapidly absorbed there-
after and should be entirely eliminated before the end of the decade.
35.       Underutilization of capacity, if it does occur, is expected
to be short-lived. Its possible implications for the financial situa-
tion of the steel companies have been taken into account and would not
impair the soundness of the projects. Nevertheless, the question was
considered whether some elements of the expansion program should be
postponed by one or two years to obtain higher levels of capacity
utilization in the years immediately following completion of Stage II.
It was concluded that a deliberate delay would not be advisable in view
of the possibilities that market growth may be somewhat faster and the
technical buildup to full capacity somewhat slower than presently envisaged.
PART V - THE PROJECT
36.       A report "Appraisal of the COSIPA Expansion Project" (PI-18),
dated May 5, 1972, is being distributed separately. A summary of it is
in Annex III.
The Company
37.       COSIPA was established in 1953 as a privately owned corporation.
Because its private sponsors were unable to raise the equity resources
necessary to construct an integrated steel works, control of the Company
passed successively to the State Government of Sao Paulo and since 1957
to the BNDE. BNDE presently holds 97 percent of COSIPA's capital stock.
The remaining shares are held by the State Government and by private
shareholders.
38.       Construction of the plant began in 1960; the rolling section
started to operate in 1963 and integrated production began in 1965. In
1971 the steel-making facilities operated slightly above rated capacity
of 600,000 annual tons of raw steel. An expansion to 1.0 million tons
(Stage I) was initiated in the second half of 1969 and is expected to be
completed by early 1973. The plant is located in Cubatao on the water
near the port of Santos. It has a dock and is well served by ship, road
and railway. The site is about 70 km from the city of Sao Paulo, the
principal market for the plant's output. Production includes hot and
cold-rolled coil, sheet and plate.



- 10 _
39.       The Company has operated at a net 108s, but the position has
improved steadily in recent years and there was a small operating profit
in 1971. The main reasons for the losses have been (a) inadequate
capacity in iron-making and finishing in relation to rolling;(b) lack
of technical assistance from an experienced operating company; (c) high
expenses resulting from an unsound initial capital structure; and (d)
deficiencies in internal coordination and financial controls.
40.       The Company's performance is expected to continue to improve
with net profits projected from 1972 onwards. These estimates are based
on the balancing and expansion of plant resulting from the completion
of Stage I and Stage II, improvements in operating efficiency resulting
from the recommendations of U.S. and Japanese consultants hired by COSIPA,
and the conversion by BNDE in late 1971 of part of its outstanding loans
into preferred shares of the Company. Effective measures have been
taken to strengthen management and internal organization. The Board of
Directors was reinforced by outside Directors, including a representative
of CONSIDER. A U.S. management consultant firm was appointed to study
the Company's internal organization and information system. In addition,
COSIPA has agreed with the Bank, during negotiations, to expand the
scope of the consultant's studies to cover the entire organizational
structure and COSIPA will implement the resulting recommendations in
consultation with the Bank.
Description of Project
41.       The project is designed to increase iron and steel-making
capacity and related rolling and finishing capacity and to make altera-
tions to existing plant which would raise the plant's production capacity
from 1.0 to 2.3 million annual tons of raw steel.  Major items to be
installed comprise an extension of the existing dock, new primary ore
and coal yards, two coke oven batteries, a 4,000 ton per day blast furnace
designed for enlargement to enable it, together with the existing one,
to provide the hot metal requirements of future expansion to 3.5 million
annual tons of raw steel, a 100 ton B.O.F. converter, an oxygen plant,
additional soaking pits and revamping of the slabbing mill, a 160" wide
plate mill and finishing facilities and two cold-rolled coil inspection
lines.
42.       The cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent of $472
million, including incremental working capital and interest during
construction.  The original cost estimates, expressed in February 1971
dollars, have been readjusted to reflect the currency realignments of
the second half of 1971. Assuming that about 20 percent of equipment
orders will be won by Brazilian suppliers, local currency costs would
be $212 million and foreign exchange costs would amount to $260 million.

44.       The proposed Bank loan to COSIPA of $64.5 million would be on
the same terms as the loans approved for CSN and for USIMINAS, namely,
for 15½ years, including a grace period of 4½ years.  The Government of
Brazil would charge COSIPA a 1-3/4 percent per annum fee on the out-
standing amount of the Bank loan, thereby bringing the cost of the loan
to COSIPA to 9 percent. The amortization period of the IDB loan would
be identical to that of the Bank loan and the IDB's interest rate would
be 8 percent per annum.
45.       The Bank and IDB loans would be jointly disbursed in a 60:40
proportion for equipment items to be procured under full intermational
competitive bidding. Brazilian manufacturers would be given a 15 per-
cent margin of preference. Making certain assumptions on the extent to
which Brazilian bidders may win contract awards, and on the foreign
exchange costs of producing in Brazil the equipment in question, it is
estimated that up to 28 percent of Bank and IDB loan proceeds would be
used for local currency costs. The economic justification for external
financing of local expenditures on Brazilian development projects is
mentioned in paragraph 3, above.
46.       The bilateral credits will finance equipment items ordered
from suppliers in the participating countries after competitive bidding.
Credit terms will be 15 years after signing (12 years after commission-
ing of the equipment) with interest charged at the most favorable rates
provided by the bilateral credit agencies at the time contracts are
awarded.
47.       ENDE would undertake to provide COSIPA sufficient funds in
loans or equity investments to complete the project; the form of this
financing would be such as to allow the Company to maintain a debt to
equity ratio of no more than 1:1 throughout the construction period.
The Government of the State of Sao Paulo has indicated to COSIPA its



- 12 -
interest in purchasing some $40 million worth of shares of the Company
in 1972-75 and EBDE has indicated that it would welcome such an equity
investment by Sao Paulo. In addition to BNDE's commitment, the Govern-
ment would undertake to make available to COSIPA whatever funds are
required to complete the project.
Projected Results
48.       As indicated in paragraph 40O, above, the balancing and expan-
sion of COSIPA's plant resulting from the project, together with the
concomitant greater efficiency of operations, are expected to lead to
a substantial improvement in financial results. On an incremental basis,
i.e., in relation to presently substandard levels, the estimated 17 per-
cent financial rate of return of the COSIPA project is the highest of
the three projects comprising the Brazilian expansion program for flat
steel products. The major risks involved, namely, delay in the execution
of the project and possible shortfalls in production in the expanded B.O.F.
shop and revamped slabbing mill, will be reduced through the technical
assistance provided by the Nippon Steel Corporation.
49.       The financial projections covering the period 1972 to 1981 show
long-term debt service covered about 2 times on the average. However,
due to the maturing of a portion of the bilateral credits prior, to the
completion of the project, debt service coverage may temporarily fall to
1.2 times in 1975 after which it steadily rises to 2.3 times by 1981.
The COSIPA Loan Agreement contains provisions in respect of COSIPA's
liquidity, namely, restrictions on common dividends, borrowings and non-
project investments. Furthermore, COSIPA undertakes to maintain a
minimum current ratio of 1.3 times for the term of the Bank's loan.
50.       The project's estimated economic rate of return is about 15
percent. Major increases are planned in the'output of plate and cold-
rolled products with respect to which COSIPA's share of the domestic
market is expected to grow from about 32 percent in 1971 to about 50
percent in 1980. Although the expanded sales volume will entail in-
creased competition with USIMINAS, particularly with respect to ship
plate and autobody sheet, the overall growth of the market and CSN's
progressive shift from non-coated to coated products should ensure
full utilization of the additional capacity within two years of project
completion. Net foreign exchange savings resulting from the project
are estimated at about $95 million per year, offsetting the estimated
foreign exchange costs of the project in about three years of full
operation.
Commitments Applying to all Steel Loans
51.       Commitments of a general nature, negotiated in connection with
the CSN and USIMINAS loans, would be extended to the COSIPA project.
These commitments relate to the Government's steel pricing policies, the
Government's intention to give priority to the further expansion of the



- 13 -
CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA steel plants, progressive reduction in the
requirement to use high cost, low quality coking coal and the efficient
carrying out by the Companies of the civil works components of the three
projects.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Companhia
Siderurgica Paulista - COSIPA; the draft Guarantee Agreement between
the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Bank; the draft BNDE Share-
holder Agreement between the Bank and ENDE; and the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the draft Resolution approving the proposed loan, are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The major
features of these agreements have already been described in this report.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

President

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
There are now 22 effective Bank loans under disbursement and
these are proceeding without significant problems except for the following:
Loan No.
404        The Xavantes hydroelectric project was completed in early
1971, (after a delay of about eighteen months) except for
the installation of equipment for an associated transmission
line. Ordering of this equipment was very delayed, and the
loan is not now expected to be fully disbursed until Decem-
ber 31, 1973, four years after the initial closing date.
516        After initial delays due to marketing and organizational
difficulties, the livestock credit program has been proceeding
at a satisfactory rate. However, some problems have recently
arisen with respect to the calculation of interest on indexed
principal amounts during the grace period, which may result
in further delays in disbursement. The matter is under con-
sideration within the Government.
565        The Porto Colombia hydroelectric project suffered delays due
to changes in the project layout and designs. The dam axis
had to be shifted slightly downstream. The problems have
been resolved. The first power unit will be commissioned in
mid-1973 and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by
the closing date, March 31, 1975.
656        The Banco do Nordeste has committed this loan more slowly
than originally expected, mainly because of the availability
of subsidized capital from other sources to industrial com-
panies in the Northeast area of Brazil. Since the Government
has recently reallocated 50 percent of those funds to invest-
ments in infrastructure and agriculture, demand through ENB
for the Bank loan may increase as alternative sources of
finance become scarcer.
677        The Marimbondo hydroelectric project was delayed by
foundation difficulties which required deeper powerhouse
excavations than originally anticipated. The problem has
been solved, but the project is now slightly behind schedule.
755        Part of the school construction project is likely to be delayed
as a result of a review by the Government of the architectural
features of several planned schools and of delays in engaging
consulting architects.
786        Delays have occurred in awarding the contracts for constructing
the new railway link for the MBR iron ore mine.

1/  This definition of Brazil' Bnet external reserves differs from that
of the IMF in excluding liabilities of the monetary authorities arising
from debt rescheduling and from the contracting of external financial
credits by the Bank of Brazil. The Bank's Economic Report classifies
these liabilities as part of Brazil's external debt.
