The overall\n            Bank performance was satisfactory during the preparatory and\n            implementation stages of the project. The Bank's team\n            maintained a reasonable level of continuity of team\n            membership, and the Government appreciated the systematic\n            and well-structured approach for the project formulation,\n            design implementation, monitoring, supervision, and\n            evaluation. The Borrower's overall performance was\n            rated as satisfactory. Lessons learned are as follows: 1)\n            Strong central leadership and close supportive supervision\n            at the provincial level are critical to the success of the\n            project from a policy, technical, and resource mobilization\n            and allocation perspective. This could have been enhanced if\n            senior managers at central and provincial levels would have\n            had orientation sessions given the introduction of novel\n            approaches and/or methodologies. In the context of this\n            project this would have involved the clinical and\n            epidemiological aspects of the project and management\n            sciences applications in health systems and development. 2)\n            Identify and distinguish the interdependence of the project\n            components in terms of their timing of the implementation,\n            technical content, and the communications and collaboration\n            required for those involved in the planning, development,\n            and implementation of the different components. 3)\n            Procurement procedures should include an appropriately\n            multi-disciplinary and independent expert group, including\n            bioengineers to set the technical specifications,\n            contractual conditions, and vetting procedures for health\n            facility equipment appropriate to the level of care, skills\n            required, and anticipated caseload of the facility. 4) With\n            regard to training health workers, a portion of the training\n            infrastructure needs to be maintained, and additional\n            distance learning methods adapted to meeting on-going\n            training of new staff and updating of skills. 5) In\n            planning, implementing, and facilitating continuity in the\n            development of the newer, and somewhat unfamiliar components\n            of a project, a more strategic integrative approach should\n            be used. Project management could be further improved by\n            conducting management training in small, participatory\n            groups, multi-disciplinary in character and involve staff\n            working at the same and supervisory levels. There is also a\n            need for incorporating principles of translation and\n            retranslation when drawing from technical materials\n            originally prepared in other languages. 6) Financial\n            arrangements should be simplified and the burden imposed on\n            the most needy communities and families lessened in order to\n            overcome the social and economic obstacles to accessing\n            health care."}, "docdt": "2003-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
