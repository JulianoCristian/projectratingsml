MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUtLIC OF CHINA
FOR A COMPREHENSIVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH PROJECT
l.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development -!redit to the People's Repub.Lic of
China for SDR 61.9 million, the equivalent of $90 million, on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance the Comprehensive Maternal
and Child Health (MCH) Project. The Government of China (GOC) would allocate
$1.69 million equivalent of the proceeds of the Development Credit to its
Ministry of Public Health to carry out a national-level component and on-lend
$88.31 million equivalent to the project provinces for 20 years, including a
five-year grace period, at a fixed annual interest rate of 1.1 percent. The
provinces would re-lend the credit to the counties undar similar terms. The
provinces would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Back round.  Between 1949 and the early 1980s, China made
remarkable progress in improving the health of mothers and children by
providing widespread access to basic preventive and curative services.
Between the late 1940s and late 1980s, the overall infant mortality rate (IMR)
dropped from over 200 per 1,000 live births to below 40 and the maternal
mortality rate (MMR) dropped from about 1,500 per 100,000 births to below 90.
The current national figures compare very favorably with the averages for low-
income economies, which are about 71 for IMR and 308/100,000 MMR.
3.        Despite these impressive gains, China faces wide regional
differences in morbidity and mortality for mothers and children. Rural areas
have 2.4 times higher MMR compared to urban areas, and more than 260 counties
(11i of the total) have IMR of over 70 per 1,000, and some exceed 150. The
rates of readily preventable deaths, such as those from post-partum hemorrhage
and neonatal tetanus, are still unacceptably high, especially in poor areas.
The main -:oblems in the disadvantaged areas include: low access to services;
inadequate staff training, equipment and materials for prenatal care and
failure to identify and manage high-risk cases; inadequate treatment of under-
fives suffering from pneumonia and diarrhea; failure to immunize all pregnant
women with tetanus toxoid; inadequate health education leading to low
utilization of MCH services; and inadequate programs to ameliorate
malnutrition among children and women, including iron and iodine deficiencies.
Furthermore, the onset of a fee-for-service system has made the health
services too expensive for many poor families and has resulted in the decline
of emphasis on preventive services.
4.        The Government is committed to improve MCH services in the country,
including the regional disparity, and has initiated many special actions. In
1991, China signed the Declaration and the Plan of Action of the World Summit
for Children and in 1992 passed a National Program of Action (NPA). NPA
targets for the Year 2000, compared to 1990, aim at reducing infant and under-
five mortality rates by one-third and MMR by one-half. It also aims at:
reducing severe and moderate malnutrition by one-half; eliminating iodine
deficiency disorder and neonatal tetanus; eradicating polio; increasing



- 2 -
breast-feeding; and improving the management of diarrhea and acute respiratory
infections. To attain these goals, the Government has been increasing its own
efforts and implementing several projects and programs under the sponsorship
of several external agencies.  Most notable among these is the on-going 300-
County Project assisted by UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO. That project, which is
being implemented in 300 poor counties in 27 provinces, focuses on upgrading
the technical qualifications of village and township staff providing
outpatient services. The results of the 300-County Project have been very
positive.
5.        Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group has so
far supported five health sector projects in China. It has also completed two
sector studies (in 1984 and 1990) in health and one in poverty alleviation
(1992). The Rural Health and Medical Education Project (Cr. 1472-CHA),
approved in 1984, was completed in 1991 and a Project Completion Report (No.
SecM93-680) was prepared. The Rural Health and Preventive Medicine Project
(Cr. 1713/Lr.. 2723-CHA) approved by the Bank in June 1986 has been completed
except for the vaccine production component. These two projects included
activities to improve MCH care in limited areas in a total of 96 counties in 8
provinces and one autonomous region and they were very successful. The
Integrated Regional Health Development Project (Cr. 2009-CHA), started in
1990, also includes programs to improve MCH care in 30 counties of three
provinces. It provides essential inputs but emphasizes improved regional
planning and management. The project's progress has been satisfactory. In
1991, the Bank approved the Infectious and Endemic Disease Control Project
(Cr. 2317-CHA) to help control tuberculosis in twelve provinces and
schistosomiasis in eight provinces. The project is also progressing well. A
fifth project, the Rural Health Workers Development Project (Cr. 2539-CHA),
became effective in November 1993. In addition, two other projects, the
Medium-sized Cities Development Project (Ln. 3286-CHA/Cr. 2201-CHA) and the
Second Rural Water Supply Project (Cr. 2336-CHA), also include substantial
components to improve rural health. The design of the proposed project has
significantly benefitted from the previous projects, including precautions
specified in the Project Completion Report for the first health project, which
are still very pertinent. Firstly, it will have well-organized and staffed
project management offices at all operation levels. Secondly, because of its
innovative features, clear guidelines were developed for the preparation and
implementation of the project. Thirdly, the medical equipment were selected
after careful studies of their appropriateness.
6.        Rationale for IDA involvement.  The proposed project is consistent
with the Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board in August 1993.
The strategy being followed centers on: (a) alleviating the problems of the
poorest areas; (b) helping the vulnerable section of the population (mothers
and children); and (c) improving the management and finance of health services
in rural China. The project is also in line with the recommendations of the
recent sector studies on health and poverty'. The recent poverty alleviation
China: Long Term Issues and Options in the Health Transition
(No.7965-CHA), 1990; and China: Strategies for p4educinq Poverty
in the 1990o (No. 10409-CHA), 1992.



- 3 -
report makes a strong case for investment in maternal health. Also, the most
recent health sector report recommends the restoration of adequate public
funding for primary health services to the poor. The Association is in a
position to increase much needed financial resources for MCH care, through the
Credit as well as through the increased domestic allocation for counterpart
funding which the project would generate. Equally important is IDA's role in
directing the attention of the Government, at different levels, to essential
policy reforms. The main policy reforms under the project would include:
improved access to health services for the poorest sections of the population;
improved MC$ management through better functional coordination; and increased
commitment to preventive care.
7.        Objectives.  The proposed project would reduce maternal and child
morbidity and mortality in the poorest areas of China by: (a) improving the
quality and effectivenecs of MCH care, especially that provided by primary
health workers and referral levels; (b) increasing eccess, affordability, and
utilization of MCH care; and (c) improving the pl.2.nc  resource allocation,
coordination and management of maternal and chil.i -e  -ervices.
R.        Descrintion.  The project would comprise four components:  basic
health care delivery; health workers' training; management improvement; and a
national-level component.  Under the basic health care delivery component, the
project would finance essential equipment, limited rehabilitation of
facilities and program support critical to improve basic MCH care services at
the village and township levels, and the referral and management functions of
county and higher levels. Activities would include maternal care, including
primary, referral and emergency care; child care, including immunization and
nutrition, management of acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases;
immunization against neonatal tetanus; health education, including promotion
of breast-feeding and improved weaning practices; and other area-specific
programs.
9.        The health workers' trainina component would improve the competence
of health workers with MCH responsibilities at each level, covering clinical,
preventive, communications and management skills. The largest groups of
trainees will be village workers, and the MC1 staff of townships, central
townships, county and Traditional Chinese Medicine hospitals and MCH stations.
Short and long-term clinical courses as well as management training would be
provided. The manacrement imorovement component would improve: (a) the
mechanism and skills for better planning and coordination; 'b) the quantity
and quality of supervisory support between levels; and (c) use of the existing
management information and surveillance system. The national-level component
aims at strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) to
coordinate the implementation and replication of MCH programs, to provide
technical guidance and support to the provinces, to carry out research at the
national level and the preparation and appraisal of the second phase of this
project.
10.       Prolect Cost and Financina.  The project cost is estimated at $139
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $23.4 million
equivalent. These estimates are based on the detailed calculations of the
programs in the four first-batch provinces and tentative estimates of the



costs in the remaining four provinces (see paragraph 11). To permit a rapid
start-up of the project, retroactive financing of SDR 5.5 million is
recommended to cover eligible expenditures for consulting services, training
and recurrent costs incurred after March 1, 1994. The project costs and
financing plan are sl-wn in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of IDA operations in
China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 13025-CHA, dated September 22, 1994, is being distributed
separctely.
11.       implementation.  The project was designed to be prepared and
appraised in two batches of four provinces each, from among eight of the
poorest provinces of China. Bank staff were fully involved in the preparation
and appraisal of the progrars in the first batch covering 155 counties, with a
total population of 67 million, in Guangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan
provinces. The programs in the second-batch of provinces, covering 32 million
people in 127 counties of Gansu, Jiangxi, Nei Mongol and Qinghai, are being
prepared and appraised under MOPH's supervision, following the procedures and
guidelines developed in the first phase. IDA would review and approve the
proposals before they are eligible to participate in the project. This in
consistent with the objective of developing lecal capacity to prepare and
appraise good quality health projects.
12.       MOPH would be responsible for overall coordination, supervision and
reporting requirements of the project. A Leading Group has been established
at the Center under the chairmansnip of the Minister of Public Health, which
would be assisted by the Foreign Loan Office (FLO) of MOPH. FLO has long
experience with the Bank Group and is fully capable to carry out its project
responsibilities. A Project Coordinating Group has also been established,
chaired by the Director of FLO and comprising the key officials of other
directly concerned MOPH departments. The provincial components would be
implemented by the project provinces, using coordination and implementation
arrangement- similar to those of the Center. At each county level, overall
coordination would be provided by a project leading group chaired by the chief
or deputy chief of the county, technical coordination would be provided by a
technical leading group, and project implementation and supervision would be
overseen by a project office headed by a project manager and assisted by a
training officer.
13.       Sustainabilitv.  The proposed project would require an additional
allocation of approximately $0.18 million in each county as counterpart
financing, or only about $0.1 (0.8 yuan) per capita per year. Total project
base costs come to about 1.9 yuan per capita per year, including long-term
investment costs such as civil works and equipment. This compares to 36 yuan
per capita of total health expenditures in China in 1988. Although the
government health expenditures in 1989 totaled 6.4 yuan per capita or only 2.5
percent of total government expenditures, the government's primary health care
objectives for the Year 2000 would raise the health expenditures to 8% of the
government budgets. Therefore, while the recurrent costs of the project are
substantial compared to current public health expenditures, they are not large



in comparison to overall government expenditures, and are well within the
government's targets, evei4 for poor counties.
14.       Aareements Reached.  Agreement was reached with the Government that
it would: (a) make the credit proceeds available to the provinces at no more
than 1.1 percent per annum interest and repayable in not more than 20 years;
(b) maintain the Project Leading Group, the Project Coordination Group and the
Technical Unit throughout the project period, with membership and/or staffing,
terms of reference and resources acceptable to the Association; (c) select
participating provinces only after the Association had approved their
programs; (d) employ qualified consultants, by March 31, 1995, to carry out a
functional coordination study, and furnish IDA with a time-bound action plan,
by March 31, 1996, to implement the recommendations of the study; (e) carry
out other research studies on the basis of proposals and terms of reference
approved by the Association; (f) submit an annual report audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Associaticn, including an audit of the
Special Account and a separate opinion on the SORs, within six months of the
end of each fiscal year; (g) submit semi-annual progress reports, including
the activities at the national, provincial, and county levels, in accordance
with the performance indicators agreed with IDA; and (h) not later than June
30, 1997, submit to IDA a mid-term evaluation report of the project together
with any recommended measures to further the objectives of the project.
15.       Agreements were also reached that the Borrower would cause the
participating provinces to: (a) establish a poverty relief fund designed to
fully or partially subsidize essential obstetric and pediatric services to the
poorest families under arrangements and time 3chedule acceptable to the
Association; (b) carry out the operational research studies only on the basis
of proposals and terms of reference approved by the Association; (c) make the
proceeds of the Credit available to its counties on terms that would be at
least as concessionary as it receives from the Borrower; (d) mnaintain the
Leading Group, the Provincial Project Office and the Technical Advisory Group
throughout the project period with membership, staffing and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Association; and (e) cause each participating county to
maintain a Project Leading Group, a Technical Advisory Group, a Project Office
headed by a project management officer and a training officer throughout the
project period. Written commitment to the Project Implementation Provisions,
agreed at negotiations, would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
16.       Environmental Assessment.  The project would have no significant
impact on the environment. It would, however, train health workers to promote
health education, to improve sanitation, and to protect the health of tne
villagers from any local environmental effects and occupational hazards of
local significance. No resettlement will be involved in this project.
17.       Benefits.  the proposed project is expected to benefit about 100
million of the poorest people from among the economically most disadvantaged
counties of the project provinces. The most direct beneficiaries would be
about 7.5 million women during and after their pregnancy and about 7.5 million
newborns.  In addition, some 15 million women of child-bearing age would
benefit from health education, improved family planning advice and other care,
including the tetanus toxoid immunization. The project would also support



- 6 -
nutrition education, that should lead to imprcved nutritional status of women
and children, and special programs to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies.
Furthermore, the project would improve planning and management capacity at all
levels.
18.       Risks.  There are two main risks in this project.  First, there is
a risk that the provinces will not take special steps to ensure that the
poorest population benefits from the improved services. While the proposed
project is not expected to fully resolve the present health financing problems
in China, each project province will be required to institute a plan to fully
or partially subsidize the poorest segment in a manner satisfactory to the
Association. The first batch of four provinces have already prepared their
plans and expect to start implementation effective January 1, 1995.
Secondly, there is a risk that the central and provincial officials will not
be able to oversee the implementation of the project activities. The
institutional improvement measures already taken at each level and close
monitoring by IDA should minimize this riek.
l9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
