This will be achieved by: 1)\n            improving the quality and effectiveness of MCH care at the\n            primary and county levels; 2) increasing equitable access to\n            and utilization of the basic care; and 3) improving MCH\n            management. The project has four main components: basic\n            health care delivery; health worker's training;\n            management improvement; and a national-level component.\n            Under the basic health care delivery component the project\n            will improve services at the village, township, and county\n            referral levels. The health worker's training component\n            will support in-service training of all health workers\n            concerned with MCH care at the village, township, and county\n            levels in basic MCH, clinical care and management skills.\n            The management improvement component will improve management\n            of comprehensive MCH programs at different levels through\n            training, supervisory support and improved management\n            information. The national level component will oversee the\n            overall management and monitoring of the project, carry out\n            interdepartmental and interprovincial coordination, provide\n            technical support to the provinces, prepare and appraise the\n            second phase of this project and disseminate the project\n            experiences to nonproject areas."}, "docdt": "1994-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
