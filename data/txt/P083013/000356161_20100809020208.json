for the Second Health\n            Surveillance and Control (VIGISUS II) Project for Brazil\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: from\n            inception in 1999, the Disease Surveillance and Control\n            Project (VIGISUS) posed challenges to Unified Health System\n            (SUS), triggering a culture change from a biomedical focus\n            to a focus on public health. This process has been gradual\n            and has been requiring constant innovation of skills and\n            instruments for monitoring surveillance. VIGISUS needs to\n            continue to adapt to respond to demographic mobilization to\n            urban centers, given that 83 percent of Brazilians live in\n            urban centers. Risk factors and determinants of disease are\n            different in urban centers, in the Amazonia, in Northern\n            regions, in the Southeast, and in isolated forest\n            communities. Thus, environmental health is a prominent field\n            with significant contributions to improve the well being of\n            the population. It is unquestionable that the project had a\n            major impact on the institutional framework and capacity for\n            health surveillance in Brazil. The limited capacity in\n            procurement within the Ministry of Health (MOH) agencies,\n            and states and municipalities, has affected project\n            implementation. The use of United Nation (UN) agencies as\n            procurement/payment agents has assisted with the contracting\n            of consultants, with procurement of large contracts, with\n            payment of miscellaneous items such as travel, and for\n            direct contracting in exceptional cases."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
