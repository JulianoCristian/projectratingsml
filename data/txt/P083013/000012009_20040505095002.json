The project components\n            will: 1) finance activities to reduce morbidity and\n            mortality, and exposure to risk factors associated with ill\n            health among Brazil's people, by strengthening the\n            public health surveillance, and disease control system at\n            the national, state and municipal levels. It will also\n            support improved vital statistics, a tool to monitor and\n            prevent maternal and infant mortality, and, collect and\n            analyze health information for the assessment of health\n            disparities; 2) improve the health outcomes of vulnerable\n            groups, including indigenous populations and Quilombo\n            communities, by financing inputs to foster institutional,\n            and financial reforms, extend coverage for basic services,\n            enhance the quality of care, address special and emerging\n            health needs, and support community-driven initiatives, to\n            improve the health status. To meet these objectives, the\n            project will finance laboratory and medical equipment for\n            primary care facilities, vehicles and boats to transport\n            patients, and health teams, computer and communication\n            equipment to gather surveillance data, consulting services,\n            community-driven subprojects, small works (e.g.,\n            construction and upgrading of health posts, basic\n            laboratories and indigenous residences), training,\n            workshops, seminars, and training materials, in addition to\n            water supply, sanitation and housing upgrading subprojects;\n            3) finance incremental costs related to project management\n            and supervision. These costs include the project unit staff,\n            Technical assistance, and administrative  expenditures."}, "docdt": "2004-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
