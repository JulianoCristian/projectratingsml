Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the Project are two-fold: (i) reduce mortality and morbidity from
communicable and non-communicable diseases and exposure to risk factors associated
with ill health, and (ii) improve the health outcomes of specially vulnerable groups
including indigenous populations and Quilombo (descendents of slaves) communities.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Brazil Disease Surveillance and Control Project (VIGISUS II) was the second of a three-
phase US$600.0 million Adaptable Program Loan (APL) that was designed to improve and
strengthen the national disease surveillance1 and control system to contribute to the reduction
of mortality and morbidity resulting from communicable and non-communicable diseases
and injuries. The VIGISUS Program consists of three projects that together seek to
contribute to the reduction of the burden of disease and decrease exposure to risk factors
associated with ill health through strengthening the national public health surveillance and
disease control system, and supporting disease prevention and control for indigenous
populations.
In 2001 and 2002, the Ministry of Health (MOH) had embarked on a third wave of reforms
which included: (i) strengthening the oversight and monitoring roles of states; (ii)
reorienting resource allocation towards more of an equity-enhancing, capitation-based
financing system; (iii) establishing instruments to improve and assess system performance
(setting state/municipal performance targets); and (iv) expanding the package of basic
services and defining a regionalization strategy that would optimize resource usage. In 2003,
the MOH prioritized disease surveillance and control because it recognized the strategic
importance of those activities for achieving its national health goals of reducing maternal and
infant mortality, reducing communicable diseases and preventing and controlling non-
communicable diseases. Previous investments in Brazil's surveillance system had already
contributed to and documented the reduction in the incidence of malaria, rabies, vaccine-
preventable diseases, leprosy and cholera. Given the country's epidemiologic transition and
urbanization, the Government continued to assign priority to the existence of a well-
functioning, public health surveillance system which would provide information on disease
outbreaks and patterns and on vital statistics so as to make better decisions about the efficient
and effective allocation of limited resources while reducing the burden of disease and
protecting against economic shocks. In response to this priority, in 2003 the MOH created
the Secretariat for Health Surveillance (SVS), integrating surveillance and health information
systems with the programs necessary to control diseases in one Secretariat.
Following the overall decentralization of the Unified Health System (SUS), the MOH also
continued to decentralize many public health functions to states and municipalities, providing
finance for those functions while at the same time developing systems to monitor the states'
and municipalities' performance. At the same time, following the approval of the National
Indigenous Health Policy and the creation of the Indigenous Health Subsystem (SIS) earlier
in the decade, the new government continued to prioritize creating surveillance systems,
expanding access to preventive, promotional and curative care, and establishing an

 Surveillance is defined as the "ongoing systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data;
and the dissemination of information to those who need to know in order that action be taken" (WHO). A
national surveillance system: (i) collects basic information necessary at the municipal and state levels for the
control of diseases, epidemics and environmental health hazards; and (ii) proposes measures to prevent and
control the development of epidemics.


                                                               1 
                                                                
                                                                
 

organizational and governance framework for addressing indigenous health care. As a next
step, the government sought to address the following indigenous health care issues through
the National Health Foundation (FUNASA): (i) elevated rates of child malnutrition, infant
and maternal mortality; (ii) increasing incidence of alcoholism and suicide; and (iii) high and
persistent disease burden from infectious and transmissible diseases.
When VIGISUS II was appraised in January of 2004, VIGISUS I was in its final stages of
implementation. When VIGISUS I closed on June 30, 2004, it left in place a functional
national health surveillance system, and a system for providing basic health care for
indigenous populations (project triggers and results for phases 1 and 2 are included in Annex
2b). VIGISUS I had focused on strengthening the public health laboratory network,
improving the data management information system, establishing an Environmental Health
Surveillance Unit, strengthening disease control activities in the Amazon Region and
improving capacity to investigate and control disease outbreaks. Support for indigenous
health included implementing the essential features of a public health surveillance system in
indigenous areas, upgrading and expanding the service delivery system, and creating the
institutional framework for the management and oversight of this system. VIGISUS I that
was implemented by FUNASA, culminated with the establishment of the SVS. The ICR for
VIGISUS I rated its Outcome as Satisfactory, its Sustainability as Highly Likely, and its
Institutional Development Impact as Substantial. Project implementation was overall
Satisfactory, and implementation of the Indigenous Health Component exceeded
expectations and was rated Highly Satisfactory2.
VIGISUS II was closely aligned with the priorities related to Brazil's achievement of the
following Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): (i) reducing infant mortality; (ii)
combating communicable diseases; (iii) improving maternal health; and (iv) empowering
women. The Project was to finance a small share of two large Government programs:
Epidemiology and Disease Control, and Indigenous Health.
By addressing the health needs of vulnerable populations and improving the capacity and
effectiveness of the health system, VIGISUS II was fully aligned with the Country
Assistance Strategy's (CAS)3 broad goal of enhancing social equity and the sector specific
goal of promoting longer, healthier lives for Brazil's population. VIGISUS II was also in
line with the CAS' main dimensions that promoted using Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAp)
as an approach to investment lending, of promoting an increased focus on results in the
design of Government programs and of prioritizing regions and social groups with
comparatively higher levels of poverty. Support for strengthening the institutional capacity
of states and municipalities under the Project Component I, Subcomponent D was structured
as a SWAp. The Bank's value-added was justified in greater part on the contributions that it
brought to the technical design of the disease surveillance and control systems, on the
experience to supporting the delivery of services to indigenous and poor populations by Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGO), and its previous experience in supporting pooled
funding arrangements through the Family Health Extension Project.

    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

    The objectives of VIGISUS II were to: (i) reduce mortality and morbidity from
    communicable and non-communicable disease and exposure to risk factors associated with ill
    health; and (ii) improve the health outcomes of especially vulnerable groups including
    indigenous populations and Quilombo (descendents of slaves) communities. This was to be
    achieved by:
        (i)    Continuing to strengthen the national public health surveillance and disease control
               system for communicable diseases and environmental health, particularly in states
               and municipalities;
        (ii)   Improving and broadening the scope of public health surveillance and disease
               control, to include non-communicable diseases, injuries and maternal/child health,
               and the surveillance and prevention of risk factors;
        (iii) Expanding access to and utilization of health services to indigenous populations;
        (iv) Improving the effectiveness of indigenous health care through institutional
             development, quality enhancement and cultural appropriateness; and
        (v)    Extending water and sanitation services to rural, Quilombo communities.

    1.3 Main Beneficiaries

    The VIGISUS II Project's main beneficiaries were expected to be the:

               Population of the country as a whole--in 27 federal units--that would benefit from a
               disease surveillance and control system;
               Poor population that depend on the public health system;
               Indigenous population (estimated at 530,000 people of 225 different ethnic groups in
               34 Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts-DSEIs) that would benefit from Indigenous
               health activities; and
               Approximately 3,750 Quilombo families residing in 150 localities in 52
               municipalities that would be provided with water supply and sanitation facilities.
    1.4 Original Components (as approved)

    VIGISUS II comprised three main components: (i) Component I, Public Health Surveillance
    and Disease Control; (ii) Component II, Indigenous Health; and (iii) Component III, Project
    Management. These are described below:
 



                                                  3 
                                                   
                                              
 

Component I: Public Health Surveillance and Disease Control (US$144.8 million total
project cost):
The activities included in this component sought to reduce morbidity and mortality and
exposure to risk factors associated will ill health among Brazil's population by strengthening
the public health surveillance and disease control system at the national, state and municipal
levels. This was to be done by supporting the then newly-created SVS. Subcomponent A ­
Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (US$43.2 million total project cost).
This Subcomponent aimed to continue strengthening the National Public Health Surveillance
System by: (i) expanding and improving the public health laboratory network; (ii) improving
the quality and utilization of information from the mandatory disease notification system
(SINAN) to control disease; (iii) improving capacity in communicable disease surveillance
and control through training and research; (iv) expanding and strengthening hospital-based
surveillance with a focus on emerging and reemerging infections; (v) guaranteeing the cold
chain to ensure the quality of vaccines; (vi) guaranteeing and expanding activities to control
vector-borne disease; (vii) improving management capacity of SUS institutions responsible
for surveillance including response to emergencies; (viii) improving dissemination of
communicable disease surveillance information and capacity in social communication; and
(ix) improving social participation in disease prevention and control.
Subcomponent B ­ Environmental Health Surveillance (US$5.6 million total project cost).
This Subcomponent aimed to:         (i) strengthening and fully implementing National
Environmental Health Surveillance subsystems for water, air and soil quality; (ii) structuring
national subsystems related to hazardous substances, biological and physical factors,
chemical accidents and natural disasters; (iii) creating a national environmental health
laboratory network; (iv) developing an information system for environmental health
surveillance and indicators to evaluate control activities; (v) increasing scientific and
technological capacity; (vi) supporting national policy development for environmental
health; (vii) developing activities within primary care that helped to create healthy
environments; (viii) promoting social mobilization and community education in high risk
areas, and (ix) improving mechanisms that promoted intra- and inter-sectoral activities.
Subcomponent C ­ Health Situation Analysis (US$10.7 million total project cost). This
Subcomponent aimed to strengthen operational and technical capacity to carry out health
situation analysis, and monitoring and control of non-communicable diseases by: (i)
improving coverage, quality and utilization of vital statistics with a focus on maternal and
infant mortality; (ii) improving capacity to carry out health situation analyses; (iii)
strengthening the nascent non-communicable disease and risk factor surveillance system; (iv)
developing an injury surveillance system, and (v) improving dissemination and social
communication related to health promotion and risk factor prevention.
Subcomponent D ­ Strengthening Institutional Capacity in States and Municipalities
(US$85.4 million total project cost). This Subcomponent was designed to finance
subprojects to strengthen: (i) state capacity to lead, organize, manage and monitor
surveillance and disease control systems, and provide systematic support to small
municipalities, and (ii) municipal capacity to perform the essential functions of surveillance
including detection and notification, investigation, data collection, data analysis and
interpretation, feedback and dissemination. To support the decentralization of technical and
                                            4 
                                             
                                              
 

managerial know-how, this Subcomponent was to provide states and municipalities both the
opportunity and financing to develop and implement complementary but innovative activities
related to the following five technical areas:            (i) institutional development; (ii)
epidemiological surveillance and disease control; (iii) environmental surveillance; (iv)
situation analysis; and (v) upgrading technical skills. Beneficiaries were to be approximately
200 sub-national entities: 27 states, 26 capital cities and 147 "satellite cities" within the
capitals' metropolitan areas. Financing to states and municipalities was to be transferred on
the basis of Surveillance Development Plans (PLANVIGI) prepared and submitted by them,
through a scheme in which Government and Bank funds are pooled. The Government would
supervise and strengthen state and municipal fiduciary processes through risk assessments,
fiduciary improvement action plans and audits. The PLANVIGI were to be divided into two
phases, where the level of financing for the second phase was to be determined based on a
state or municipalities' performance during the first phase, thereby introducing an element of
results orientation into the system of Government financing.
Component II: Indigenous Health (US$47.9 million total project cost)
By financing inputs to foster institutional and financial reforms, extending coverage for basic
services, enhancing the quality of care, addressing special and emerging health needs, and
supporting community-driven initiatives that could contribute to improved health status, the
activities under this component sought to improve the health outcomes of specially
vulnerable groups including indigenous populations and Quilombo communities. The
activities under Component II were to be implemented by FUNASA.
Subcomponent A ­ Institutional Capacity Strengthening (US$33.3 million total project
cost). This Subcomponent aimed to: (i) extend basic care coverage to un-served indigenous
communities; (ii) improve the technical quality of public and private providers serving
indigenous communities; (iii) develop and implement a performance-based management
system; (iv) decentralize decision-making authority to and strengthen governance
mechanisms at the sub-regional level, and (v) strengthen health surveillance systems while
introducing monitoring and evaluation methodologies to systematically assess the structure,
processes and impact of the Indigenous Health System.
Subcomponent B ­ Special Health Needs of Indigenous Populations (US$4.5 million total
project cost). This Subcomponent aimed to support targeted interventions and research
activities to document and comprehend the causes of malnutrition, alcoholism and suicide
among indigenous populations while reducing the incidence of these problems among the
targeted groups. It aimed to do this through the development of strategies and
implementation of small-scale projects implemented by NGOs and other organizations,
financed directly by FUNASA. This Subcomponent also aimed to support research on
options regarding the integration of traditional and modern medical practices.
Subcomponent C ­ Fund for Indigenous Community Initiatives (US$3.6 million total
project cost). This Subcomponent supported the Fund for Indigenous Community Initiatives
(FUNCOMIN) by promoting community-driven local development in health through grants
provided to indigenous communities. It aimed to support about 150 small subprojects, which
were expected to cost less than US$12,000 and which would finance community kitchens,
medicinal remedies processing, promotion of traditional healing practices, training and

equipping of midwives, fruit tree groves, vegetable gardens, breastfeeding promotion,
women's support and mutual help groups and other activities expected to contribute directly
to improving health. FUNCOMIN aimed to prioritize subprojects that sought to strengthen
participation and capacity of women in promotional, preventive and curative health activities.
Subcomponent D ­ Water and Sanitation for Quilombo Communities (US$6.4 million total
project cost). This Subcomponent was designed to finance the installation, expansion and
upgrading of water supply and sanitation systems for dispersed rural hamlets and individual
residences so as to ensure basic access to technologically appropriate and sustainable water
supplies and sanitation facilities for approximately 3,750 Quilombo families residing in 150
localities in 52 municipalities.4
Component III: Project Management (US$6.4 million total project cost, of which
US$4.2 million to UGP/SVS and US$2.1 million to UGP/FUNASA)
VIGISUS II was to finance the incremental costs related to management and supervision of
project activities, including the costs of Project Unit staff, technical assistance to ensure
adequate implementation and supervision of the project, administrative expenditures for the
two Project Units (excluding civil servants), office equipment (and its maintenance), travel
expenses for supervision in the field and miscellaneous expenses. This component was also
to finance, on a pilot basis, the construction of a database of actual costs for a subset of
activities implemented in low risk states and municipalities, in order to calculate standardized
costs for those activities.
1.5 Revised Components

The components were not revised during implementation of the project.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

On June 6, 2008, the original December 31, 2008 loan Closing Date was extended by one
year to December 31, 2009. Two reallocations of loan proceeds were approved; the first on
October 31, 2007 and the second on June 23, 2009 (Annex 1). Both of these reallocations
were processed to reflect progress in implementation of the Project, especially the rapid
implementation of training activities. Due to the challenges the Project faced during
implementation described in detail in Section 2.2, as of June 22, 2010, US$84,728,892.08
had been disbursed from the loan, and the remaining balance was US$14,771,107.92.
However, a total amount of US$1,087,034.81 will have to be refunded to the Bank before the
loan account can be closed. This amount refers to expenses incurred by municipalities under
PLANVIGIs that were found to be ineligible. Thus, it is expected that the total disbursed
amount will be US$83,641,857.27, and the remaining balance, to be cancelled,
US$15,858,142.73.

 The PAD for this Project also mentioned that in areas where Chagas Disease was also endemic, this
Subcomponent would finance housing improvements including wall plastering and cementing of floors,
oriented toward eliminating the reservoir of reduviid bugs and other vectors that thrive in houses constructed
with mud, adobe and thatch materials. This was contested from the start of implementation, since FUNASA is
not responsible for carrying out this type of activity.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis. At the time the Project was prepared the Bank had
become a long-term strategic partner in support of the Government's reforms in Brazil's
health sector. Project preparation, design and quality at entry counted on the lessons learned
from this vast experience, including those from implementation of the first phase of the
Disease Surveillance and Control Project APL. These lessons included, inter alia: (i) the
need to promote better integration of operational and technical staff at the state and municipal
levels, and provide specific technical support to states; (ii) the desirability of pooling
Government and Bank funding in support of state and municipal health surveillance
subprojects, and building a feature linking sub-national financing to performance to promote
results-oriented accountability; and (iii) the need to strengthen the organizational and
technical capacity in the Department of Indigenous Health (DESAI) of FUNASA to
implement expansion of financing under the Project.
The rationale for the Bank's involvement was clear. This was the second phase, follow-up to
a successful earlier project. The Bank had considerable experience and technical expertise in
both strengthening disease surveillance and control systems both at the regional and central
levels and in indigenous health (including through supporting NGO delivery of services to
the indigenous). The application of pooled funding arrangements, first introduced in Brazil
operations under the Family Health Extension Project, uniquely positioned the Bank to work
within the federal financing system to support health surveillance capacity building in states
and municipalities.
Assessment of the Project Design. The Project's design was very complex but appropriate.
With two implementing agencies, and several subcomponents under the responsibility of
each, and project activities implemented at all government levels across Brazil, the Project's
design was undoubtedly complex. However, experience under the first phase had been
successful, and there was no reason to believe that a sophisticated middle-income country
like Brazil would not be able to implement such a project. Its design scaled up and expanded
the focus on indigenous health care issues, and incorporated appropriate consultative
mechanisms during preparation and throughout implementation to ensure the quality of its
focus. The pooled funding arrangement had been applied with success in earlier projects,
and responded to the MOH's increased emphasis on linking financing to results. At the time,
the SWAp approach allowed for use of government procurement methods, as referred to in
the Loan Agreement, which was an important factor in facilitating the implementation of the
decentralized component.
Adequacy of the Government's Commitment. The Government's commitment to the
Project's objectives were, and continue to be, very strong. It assigns high importance to
health surveillance and indigenous health, within the overall framework of preventing and
controlling the most important causes of burden of disease, improving health governance at
the federal and sub-national levels, and strengthening the overall performance and results of
the country's health system.

Assessment of Risks. The Project's risk assessment was comprehensive, and identified the
main risks that affected its implementation, but perhaps underestimated those risks. The
risks included insufficient institutional capacity to implement Indigenous Health Policy, the
fact that disease control and environmental health was dependent on other government
sectors, and insufficient state and municipal capacity to implement surveillance and disease
control activities. While the PAD's Procurement Annex rated overall procurement risk as
high, this was not included as a critical risk in the Project's risk framework. Yet, this turned
out to be one of the main risks that the Project faced in its day-to-day implementation.

2.2 Implementation

The US$100 million loan for the Project was approved on an absence of objection basis (as
the second phase of the APL) on May 18, 2004. It was signed on November 3, 2004, and
became effective on December 16, 2004. Implementation proceeded smoothly, with
implementation progress rated consistently Satisfactory over the years, and despite minor
issues described below, the loan closed on December 31, 2009, and one year after its
originally scheduled Closing Date. The factors that influenced the Project's implementation
included the following.
    (i)    Epidemics and Outbreaks. During the Project's implementation, Brazil faced two
           epidemics. First, Brazil had a significant and lethal dengue epidemic in 2008. In
           early 2009, the country faced the threat of the AH1N1 Influenza epidemic. The
           Project allowed for timely availability of information about both epidemics, and
           prompt control measures to be taken.
    (ii)   Institutional Coordination. There were initially some concerns that SVS and
           FUNASA were implementing their respective components without much interaction.
           Early Bank missions repeatedly recommended that both agencies organize joint
           meetings to ensure better integration of project components, suggesting that closer
           cooperation between SVS and FUNASA leadership would benefit indigenous health
           programs and facilitate project implementation. Preparatory work for establishment
           of the new Indigenous Health Secretariat. The new Secretariat is being prepared
           with assistance from work carried out during the second phase of the Project. This
           work focused on development of new models of care, financing, organization,
           management and monitoring and evaluation for Indigenous Health. However, this
           preparatory work also had a destabilizing effect on project managers and staff
           implementing the Indigenous Health Component, as it brought much uncertainty
           regarding the future work and their jobs.
    (iii) Implementation in a Decentralized Framework. As in other projects implemented in
          a decentralized framework, the Project faced the challenges of promoting and
          supervising implementation across Brazil's 27 states and capital cities, and several
          municipalities. The implementation capacity, experience and ability to plan, execute,
          and monitor subprojects under their respective PLANVIGIs varied greatly. FUNASA
          also worked through a decentralized framework, through the Regional Coordinations
          (COREs) that have widely varying institutional capacity, each with staffing problems
          of their own. This often presented problems and delays in receiving information,
          which required follow-up and provision of technical assistance by FUNASA.

                                              8 
                                               
                                                
 

    (iv) Reporting Arrangements in FUNASA. FUNASA's operating departments had
         difficulties in absorbing the experience acquired through the Project's implementation
         and at the same time assume responsibility for the agreements made by the group of
         technical staff coordinating the Project as being those of FUNASA as an institution.
    (v)   Staffing Continuity. Issues of continuity in staffing, at all levels, had an impact on
          implementation, although not to the point of impacting the Project's progress towards
          its development objectives. In both the public health system in general and for
          indigenous health, especially in the Amazon region, distribution and retention of
          human resources has presented an ongoing challenge, especially since a large share of
          these are not government employees.
    (vi) Difficulties with Procurement. Both SVS and FUNASA, and to some extent the
         states and municipalities implementing subprojects, encountered difficulties and
         especially delays with following Bank procurement guidelines and processes. This
         affected the procurement of several activities under the Project, which in the end were
         financed with counterpart resources following local procurement legislation. The
         contracting of UN agencies as procurement agents to accelerate the process only
         complicated matters in many cases, as SVS and FUNASA found that they had to
         comply not only with Bank requirements, but with those of the UN agencies, as well.
         Civil works. Project activities related to civil works posed particular challenges, and
         represented the activities for which it was least successful. This included the planned
         construction of the National Reference Laboratory and one of the 4 NB3 laboratories,
         in the state of Rondonia, that were included under Component I.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. Monitoring and evaluation was a central feature of the Project's design.
Funding to states and municipalities for surveillance activities were to be agreed yearly,
upfront, under agreements (pactos) that included expected targets and funding levels, and
requirements for monitoring progress. The Project's outcome and intermediate outcome
indicators as designed were identical to the indicators used by the Government in its pactos.
Other indicators, not part of pactos, were designed to monitor national/state/municipal
performance in mostly institutional and/or training type activities. Baseline data for most
indicators was not available at the time implementation began, as SVS had been recently
established.
The Project included several evaluations, at the state and municipal levels, of their respective
surveillance systems and of their institutional capacity to manage it. The first set of these
was carried out before putting in place the performance-based disbursement mechanism for
subprojects under Component 1D.
The Project's Indigenous Health Component was to support the establishment of a results-
based monitoring system and building capacity at the regional and sub-regional levels for
using this system.
M&E Implementation and Utilization. With project assistance, SVS has been investing in
the establishment of an evidence-based culture ­ a virtuous circle of surveillance, planning,

                                              9 
                                               
                                              
 

implementation and M&E - for the last several years with significant results. Several routine
information systems have been established which provide data on births, mortality and
morbidity, risk factors and health knowledge, attitudes and practices, and environmental
health (Annex 2c). SVS has strengthened operational and technical capacity to carry out
health situation analysis, and make informed public health decisions.
SVS manages a national health surveillance system tracking most of Brazil's health
indicators. The system was designed to provide relevant information on Brazil's health
status, and on program implementation. The overall health surveillance system collects,
verifies, analyzes and disseminates data on communicable and non-communicable diseases,
injuries, public health emergencies, environmental and workplace health, among others. In
addition, SVS developed a subsystem to monitor the results-based Action Plans implemented
by states and municipalities ­ the PLANVIGI -, which have been co-financed by the Project.
The monitoring system tracks state and municipal technical and financial performance
against the agreed plans and targets. With assistance under the Project, FUNASA has also
been developing a health surveillance subsystem to track indigenous health indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary. The Project, both at the national and sub-national levels faced issues with
procurement, especially delays in implementation due to administrative and other problems.
As described in Section 2.2, the contracting of procurement agents to facilitate the process
helped for some types of procurement, especially those involving many small contracts and
payments, but not for the procurement of larger packages.
The MOH has been improving its fiduciary functions and the Project provided significant
contributions to make processes more efficient and effective, and free the MOH from heavy
reliance on external agencies for procurement, among other measures. The ongoing in-depth
procurement and financial review of the APL's second phase will provide recommendations
that will be taken into account during the implementation of the APL's third phase.
Safeguards. The Project triggered both the Bank's Environmental Assessment and
Indigenous Peoples safeguard policies. In fact, an entire and major component was designed
to address health and institutional issues regarding indigenous health that had been identified
through consultations during preparation. Consultations with indigenous groups were built
into the Project's design. The Project's environmental management plan addressed potential
impacts from application of environmental licensing regulations for the construction of
laboratories and health centers, training on risks related to waste management in laboratories
and on preparation of a waste management plan, and development and implementation of a
waste management plan in all laboratories constructed or expanded with financing under the
Project. Project implementation did not involve any issues with regard to compliance with
either of the Bank's safeguard policies, and the corresponding provisions in the Operations
Manual.
The MOH has the in-house capacity to supervise safeguard compliance. It has the
institutional capacity to apply safeguard policies and has set aside appropriate human and
financial resources to this end. The Brazilian Government is experienced in managing large
projects and has access to experienced professionals with applied knowledge in

environmental assessment and environmental evaluation procedures, as well as in Indigenous
Health.  

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

As the second phase of a three phase APL Program, VIGISUS II included triggers for
moving towards processing of the Program's third and final phase. VIGISUS II has
exceeded six of the seven triggers, and fully achieved the other trigger (Table 1).

The third phase of the APL will seek to solidify progress in the health sector by strengthening
the national public health surveillance and disease control system, and continuing to support
the prevention and control of diseases, including among indigenous populations. The
proposed VIGISUS III project will continue to contribute to the reduction of the burden of
disease caused by communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as injuries,
through management of health risks and strengthening governance of the public health and
indigenous health subsystems. Specifically, the proposed project will strengthen the Unified
Health System (SUS) and the Indigenous Health Subsystem's capacity to manage health risks
by: (i) increasing the sensitivity, timeliness and reliability of the national surveillance
system; (ii) increasing decentralized management capacity of the surveillance system and
indigenous health subsystem; and (iii) improving the quality of indigenous primary health
care and integration into SUS.

VIGISUS III will build on many activities implemented under VIGISUS II, expanding their
application especially in states and municipalities. The proposed final phase will continue to
build capacity at the federal, state and municipal levels to implement results-based
agreements (Surveillance, Prevention and Disease Control Plans and Indigenous Health
Action Plans) and to improve governance and accountability; further strengthen the national
public health surveillance and disease control system for vital statistics, non-communicable
diseases, communicable diseases and environmental health, particularly in states and
municipalities; further expand access to and utilization of health services by indigenous
populations; and improve the effectiveness of indigenous health care through institutional
development, quality enhancement and cultural appropriateness incorporating the models,
surveys, information-gathering and research developed in the second phase, and relying on
the extensive capacity-building and training carried out under VIGISUS II.
VIGISUS III will continue to be implemented nation-wide, covering Brazil's 27 states and 34
DSEI. Although this phase will not use a SWAp approach, this will be a results-based
project. The proposed loan's disbursements, and disbursements from the federal to the
decentralized level, will be triggered by the achievement of pre-defined results targets.
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The country's goals to conquer childhood diseases, minimize preventable non-communicable
diseases, lower inequality in outcomes, reduce disparity in risk exposure and deliver high
quality services efficiently, accountably and affordably by 2020, have been directly
addressed by the first two phases of this APL, and will continue to be a mainstay of the third
phase.
The VIGISUS II Project's objectives and design reflect a development priority that is still
very relevant to Brazil and consequently to the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy5. The
Bank has maintained a long partnership with Brazil in the health sector. With coverage
issues no longer at the forefront, the country's development priorities focus on improving
performance and affordability of the health system. As such, Brazil's current challenges
towards improving the health of its population are focusing increasingly on programs that
improve quality, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability in the sector. The Bank's
strategy for engagement in the health sector has progressively shifted away from expanding
coverage towards the challenges of promoting improved system performance in four areas:
(i) increasing effectiveness of the delivery system and readiness for non-communicable
diseases (an emerging issue in Brazil's health transition) by promoting better coordination
and integrating health care through regional health networks; (ii) increasing efficiency and
quality of public spending; (iii) rationalizing service supply and financing; and (iv)
promoting system accountability and performance links in public financing.               The
Government remains committed to institutionalizing further the results-based monitoring and
financing that was supported by the Project.

The Government also remains fully committed to improving the health (and other) conditions
and prospects of its indigenous and other minority populations, as evidenced by its recent
issuance of a Federal Decree granting autonomy to the DSEI and a Presidential Provisional
Measure which opens the way for the establishment of the new Special Secretariat of
Indigenous Health. The information system and other institutional capacity strengthening
supported by the Project are extremely relevant for the new challenges that FUNASA will
face in the future.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The VIGISUS II Project built upon the accomplishments of the first phase of the APL
Program while supporting the decentralization of health surveillance activities, and
institutional reforms in the indigenous health system. The project contributed to reduce
mortality and morbidity from communicable and non-communicable disease and exposure to
risk factors associated with ill health; and to improve the health outcomes of especially
vulnerable groups, including indigenous populations and Quilombo (descendents of slaves)
communities. This was achieved, as initially planned, by (i) continuing to strengthen the
national public health surveillance and disease control system for communicable diseases and
environmental health, particularly in states and municipality; (ii) improving and broadening
the scope of public health surveillance and disease control, to include non-communicable
diseases, injuries and maternal/child health, and the surveillance and prevention of risk
factors; (iii) expanding access to and utilization of health services to indigenous populations;
(iv) improving the effectiveness of indigenous health care through institutional development,
quality enhancement and cultural appropriateness; and (v) extending water and sanitation
services to rural, Quilombo communities.
The Project was very much an institutional development project that had several notable
achievements. VIGISUS II continued to support the structuring of SVS, which had only
been established towards the end of the first phase of the APL; and it expanded significantly
assistance for indigenous health through the development of new models of indigenous
health care, financing, organization, management and monitoring and evaluation. These new
models will be implemented under the third phase of the VIGISUS APL Program, currently
being prepared (Section 2.5). Yet, its development objectives, and the outcome indicators by
which its progress towards those objectives was to be measured were framed in the context
of its eventual impact on final health outcomes. These final outcomes depended not only on
the Project and the activities that it supported, but also on several other factors, not the least
of which was the overall functioning of Brazil's health delivery system at the national and,
especially, sub-national levels. Still, the Project had some noticeable impacts on the
expected final outcomes, as described below.
Objective 1: To reduce mortality and morbidity from communicable and non-
communicable disease and exposure to risk factors associated with ill health
In recent years, Brazil has attained substantial health gains, marked by notable declines in
infant and childhood deaths; mortality by malaria decreased significantly; there are good
prospects for eradication of neonatal tetanus and human rabies transmitted by domestic
animals; vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease was controlled; rates of immunization

are high; and the prevalence of cigarette smoking decreased considerably in the country.
Infectious and childhood diseases now account for less than 25% of the health burden.
Under the Project, Brazil has had major achievements in public health performance,
including among indigenous populations. Brazil today has in place a fully functioning health
surveillance system. The project contributed to structuring SVS with further improvement in
information systems; strengthening the laboratory network, including the development of
three safety level 3 laboratories (NB3); organizing a network of rapid response to
emergencies in public health; and training of public health staff. In partnership with states
and municipalities, SVS consolidated registries on vital statistics, gathers and monitors
epidemiological data on communicable and non-communicable diseases, and injuries,
monitors environmental and worker health, implements the National Health Promotion
policy, monitors and responds to public emergencies, analyzes the health situation and
disseminates this information to relevant stakeholders, and contributes to the prevention and
control of priority communicable diseases. However, progress towards diseases such as
tuberculosis, malaria and dengue continue to present challenges. Infant and Child Mortality.
Infant mortality decreased from 22.6 per 1,000 live births in 2004 to 18.3 in 2008; it declined
in all regions of Brazil, particularly in the North and Northeast. In general, infant mortality
due to malnutrition and anemia, gastrointestinal diseases and vaccine-preventable causes
showed the largest drop. Similarly, the child mortality rate (under five) dropped from 26 per
1,000 in 2005 to 22 per 1,000 in 2008.
Tuberculosis. Brazil has made progress in addressing TB. The number of tuberculosis
deaths has been dropping in recent years to approximately 4,500. There has been a 32%
decline in TB mortality from 1990 to 2005 (2 percent per year). As a result, Brazil expects to
meet the MDG target by 2015. For the general population, the TB prevalence rate decreased
from 58.4/100,000 to 38.2 in 2007. However, the country still reports close to 90,000 TB
cases annually, of which 75,000 are new, and only about 65 percent of new cases are cured.

            New TB Cases Cured. The number of new TB cases cured does not reflect this
    continued improvement. The 38.8 percent of new cases of TB that are apparently not
    cured include both those new cases that have not completed treatment and those new
    cases that may have completed treatment, but for which information has not been closed
    in the SINAN data base.
Malaria. Almost all (99.7 percent) of malaria cases are concentrated in the Amazon Region.
Brazil has made dramatic gains in reducing malaria mortality, which has been more than

halved from a high of 243 in 2000 to 93 in 2007. The National Program for Control of
Malaria has succeeded in reducing the overall number of cases, especially in large- and
medium-sized cities. A total of 306,204 cases of malaria were registered in 2008,
representing a reduction of almost 50 percent in relation to 2005, and the lowest level in the
past 26 years.

               Fifty percent reduction of municipalities in Amazonia Legal considered at high
       risk for malaria. This indicator was substantially met. In 2002, 76 municipalities in the
       Amazonia Legal were considered at high risk for malaria. In 2005, there was a large
       increase in malaria in the Amazon Region, with 109 municipalities considered at high
       risk for malaria since there are many small municipalities with some incidence of
       malaria, using the number of municipalities at high risk as the base made it difficult for
       this indicator to reflect the actual progress in reducing malaria, especially in view of the
       2002 baseline that did not reflect the actual situation at the time implementation began in
       2005.

Vaccination. SVS sets standards and technical procedures, and strategic actions for
systematic vaccination based on epidemiological surveillance, and have maintained high
rates of vaccination among the general population - 70% municipalities have vaccination
coverage over 95%. As a result, infectious and childhood diseases now account for less than
25 percent of Brazil's health burden.

              Percent of municipalities that have at least 95 percent coverage for DPT+HiB
       for children under one year of age. This indicator was met with 62.5 percent of
       municipalities having achieved 95 percent coverage of the DPT+HiB vaccination.
       However, in the aggregate, there was considerable variation in performance across the
       country in 2008, with 90.76 percent of municipalities in Ceará, but only 26.7 percent of
       municipalities in Roraima having achieved the 95 percent target.

Smoking. One of the most successful prevention policies for NCDs in Brazil has been the
Tobacco Control Program 6 . Supported in part by the Project, the program developed

            Increase in the prevalence of ex-smokers in capital cities. Smoking prevalence
    decreased in Brazil from 35 percent to 18 percent in the period 1989-2003, and further
    declined to 16 percent in 2006, according to the results of the VIGITEL Survey. This
    telephone survey, conducted in 27 capital cities, revealed that 21.8 percent were ex-
    smokers, roughly divided among gender lines, and concentrated among those with higher
    levels of education.

Continuing to strengthen the national public health surveillance and disease control
system for communicable diseases and environmental health, particularly in states and
municipalities. The structuring of the SVS, and its strengthening and consolidation as the
institution responsible for public health surveillance represented a fundamental political,
technical and administrative change in the Brazilian health system. Through activities
supported by the Project, public health has become more of a priority at the sub-national
level following the decentralization of health surveillance financial resources to state and
municipal health secretariats. Each year, the Ministry of Health sets out a series of targets
and actions for prevention and disease control to be implemented by all Federal Units (UF),
Targets and indicators agreed between the federal level and states and municipalities are part
of the Health Agreement (Pacto da Saude) and Health Surveillance Plans that incorporate
performance-based incentives. Municipalities carry out most health surveillance activities.
States coordinate health surveillance and supervise municipal surveillance activities. The
federal level develops national policy, and ensures standardization of procedures and
instruments. Decentralization has given flexibility to identify diseases and conditions that
need more attention in a specific area, and consequently define early measures to prevent and
reduce health risks according to local needs. The establishment of a network of educational
institutions qualified to provide education at the post-graduate level to professionals in the
field of health surveillance ensures the availability of qualified human resources at all levels
in the future. The continued expansion, equipping and integration of the public health
laboratory network will result in quicker diagnosis of tuberculosis, malaria and dengue,
among others.

SVS has also structured and consolidated environmental health surveillance within its
national system of health surveillance. Systems for the surveillance of water, air and soil
quality have been developed, and are under implementation. SVS' role in emergencies and
disasters, implemented through the three levels of government, has been institutionalized
through the implementation of a program, VIGIDESASTRES that focuses on risk reduction,
disaster management and recovery.

The Center for Strategic Information in Health Surveillance (CIEVS) investigates and
responds rapidly to epidemiological outbreaks and public health emergencies that may
endanger public health. Brazil is one of the five countries in the world to have a room
specially equipped with the latest technological resources to receive information about
epidemiological outbreaks and public health emergencies. CIEVS opened in 2006, and has a
specialized team on duty 24 hours a day, every day of the week, to receive referrals and
inform the authorities in case of emergency. The H1N1 epidemic allowed the MOH to test

this emergency surveillance and response system. The system was also used to provide
support to Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake.
Improving and broadening the scope of public health surveillance and disease control, to
include non-communicable diseases, injuries and maternal/child health, and the
surveillance and prevention of risk factors. Non-communicable diseases now account for a
larger and growing share of Brazil's burden of disease, as a consequence of urbanization,
improvements in health care, changing lifestyles, and globalization. Several routine
information systems have been developed and are fully functional providing real-time data
on births, mortality and morbidity, risk factors and health knowledge, attitudes and practices,
environmental health, decentralized surveillance and other aspects, including among
indigenous populations (Annex 2c). SVS has strengthened operational and technical capacity
to carry out health situation analysis by: (i) improving coverage, quality and utilization of
vital statistics with a focus on maternal and infant mortality; (ii) strengthening the nascent
non-communicable disease and risk factor surveillance system; (iii) developing an injury
surveillance system, and (iv) improving dissemination and social communication related to
health promotion and risk factor prevention. Saúde Brasil has been regularly published, a
web-based atlas for health situation analysis has been developed, and an application using
GIS technology is under preparation.
Objective 2: To improve the health outcomes of especially vulnerable groups including
indigenous populations and Quilombo (descendents of slaves) communities.
Significant progress has been made in the past decade in improving health among indigenous
people. After a long period of population loss, the Brazilian Indian population is growing at
an estimated 3.5% rate per year, contrary to what is happening with other indigenous people
in the world. However, there are still important challenges with respect to indigenous health
issues, which the Project has helped to address.
Indigenous Infant Mortality. Mortality disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous
people in Brazil is lower than in other developing countries. Indigenous infant mortality fell
from 74.6 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 44.4 per 1,000 live births in 2008, a 40 percent
reduction in eight years. The work of indigenous health teams was largely responsible for the
improvement in indigenous communities through visits to households to monitor hygiene and
environmental health, particularly in children under 5 years old.

            Percent of mothers with children under two years of age and identified with
    inadequate weight gain receive nutrition education/counseling on feeding practices
    that are culturally appropriate. Performance towards this indicator actually exceeded
    original expectations as a result of the implementation of the nutritional surveillance
    system by FUNASA. At present, 100 percent of mothers with children under five years
    of age, and identified with inadequate weight gain, are receiving nutrition
    education/counseling.

           Percent of cases of diarrhea in children less than six years of age treated with

    were treated with ORT, practically meeting the original target of 80 percent.

Indigenous Maternal Mortality. Progress in reducing maternal mortality has not been as
promising. Maternal mortality is still an important issue in Brazil among indigenous and non-
indigenous populations. Indigenous women have a risk of death due to maternal causes more
than twice as high as other women: in 2007, 155/100,000 indigenous women died due to
maternal causes. The instability over the years in this indicator is related to both the
population size and data quality.

             Percent of indigenous pregnant women in targeted districts receive at least 3
    prenatal consultations. The Project was successful in increasing coverage of prenatal
    visits to pregnant women across indigenous districts. In 2004, only about 30 percent of
    pregnant women in 21 DSEIs received 3.37 prenatal visits. By 2009, 50 percent of
    pregnant women in 33 DSEIs (against the Project's target of 10 DESI) received 2.9
    prenatal visits, expanding significantly the absolute numbers of women that benefited
    from increased consultations. This reflects the policy of providing health care coverage in
    all DSEI rather than in just targeted districts.

Tuberculosis. Among the indigenous population, TB decreased from 252/100,000 in 2002 to
101/100,000 in 2007. While the incidence rate for the general population has been gradually
decreasing, it has decreased more markedly among the indigenous population.

                Increase of TB cases under DOTS among indigenous people. In 2009, 95.5
        percent of 245 persons reported with TB, or 234 persons, were being treated with DOTS.
        This compares with 74 percent of 617 persons, or 456 persons, who were treated with
        DOTS, as measured by the Project's 2004 baseline. This represents a 60 percent decrease
        in the absolute number of TB cases identified among indigenous people, and 29.2 percent
        increase in the number of persons being treated under DOTS, as a proportion of persons
        reported with TB.

    Malaria in Indigenous territories. Almost all (99.7 percent) of malaria cases are
    concentrated in the Amazon Region, where about 60 percent of the country's indigenous
    reside. Malaria incidence among the indigenous is high but has been declining recently. The
    number of cases among indigenous people decreased from 33,000 in 2006-2007 to 29,200 in
    2008.

    Vaccination among Indigenous people. Since 2003, the Department of Indigenous Health
    (DESAI) promotes an annual Month of Vaccination of Indigenous People (MVPI). In 2008,
    DESAI and Indigenous Health Districts (DSEI) vaccinated 40,000 indigenous children of 68
    ethnic groups, in 1,161 villages, in 15 DSEI, including the Yanomami, the most remote
    indigenous population.  
 
     Percent of indigenous population covered with complete vaccination regime. In 2009,
    almost 74 percent of the indigenous population has been covered with a complete vaccination
    regime, exceeding the 60 percent target that had been established during project preparation.

    Expanding access to and utilization of health services to indigenous populations. The
    efforts that Brazil has been making to reverse inequalities, and to rescue the historic debt
    with indigenous people through the adoption of a national policy, are remarkable. As a
    whole, the legislation passed since 1999 attests to the enormous effort made over the last
    decade to build a legal and institutional framework for the Indigenous Health Subsystem.
    The national policies, based on the principles of universality, comprehensive healthcare, and
    equity, which seek to reduce the differences in health conditions, are reflected in the
    Indigenous Health Subsystem. From 2003 to 2007 there was an increase of 154% in nominal
    terms, and 100% in real terms, in the share of the Ministry of Health's budget represented by
    indigenous health funding. The annual allocation of funds for Indigenous Health is of about

R$ 500 million, equivalent to per capita spending of more than R$987 (significantly higher
than for the general population).
During Project implementation, indigenous health policy focused on increasing coverage in
all DSEI rather than focusing on targeted DSEI only. Under the Project, 547 indigenous
health teams were trained on benchmark service plan, prevention and control of priority
diseases, public health surveillance and integrated service delivery. These health teams
comprise 275 doctors, 547 nurses, 514 dentists, 206 dental office assistants, 2,076 technical
assistants, s and 1,251 Indigenous Health Agents. Of the total 3,906 Indigenous Health
Agents, 29 percent are women. Significant investment was also made in infrastructure.
Construction of 102 health posts, 8 Pólos and 6 CASAIs were completed. Vehicles, boats
and communication equipment necessary for the health teams to function in remote areas
have been procured.
Improving the effectiveness of indigenous health care through institutional development,
quality enhancement and cultural appropriateness.             The Project made important
contributions to this objective. First, there were important achievements in establishing the
information system of the Indigenous Health Subsystem (SIASI) that is being developed in
the context of the SINAN; four modules have been developed and are under implementation
in all DSEI---demographic, morbidity, immunization, and health surveillance modules.
Modules on nutritional surveillance and maternal health were developed and under
implementation in some DSEI.
Proposals for new models of Indigenous Health (health care delivery, financing,
organization, management, and monitoring and evaluation) and an Implementation Plan were
completed, and reviewed by several regional and national workshops in 2008 and 2009, with
participation of the 34 DSEI. In 2009, a Presidential Decree provided that the DSEI should
become autonomous by December 2010, at which time the DSEI will be empowered to
coordinate, supervise and implement the activities of the Indigenous Health Subsystem in the
context of the SUS. District Health Plans for indigenous districts have been institutionalized
as an instrument of management and coordination of the many actors involved in indigenous
health services. Performance-based contracts with NGOs and public providers and between
FUNASA and DSEIs have been developed. In an effort to develop social accountability
mechanisms to guide the use of funds, mechanisms for disclosing provider and DSEI
performance to communities have been developed, but implementation has not yet begun.
There have been increased efforts at disclosure of information and consultation.
Information on the nutritional status of the indigenous population was virtually non-existent a
couple of years ago. Through the Project, FUNASA conducted a macro regional survey of
the nutritional status of the indigenous population for children under five and women aged 14
to 50. This was the first time that this information was made available and it has been
disclosed on FUNASA's website.              FUNASA developed the Indigenous Nutritional
Surveillance System (SISVAN), trained technicians responsible for nutrition in the DSEIs,
and provided the DSEI with the specialized equipment needed for growth monitoring. The
Project also supported the structuring of the nutritional area within the DESAI.
Several important activities aimed at addressing alcoholism and suicide among the
indigenous populations was implemented under the project. FUNASA carried out a baseline
study on incidence of these factors with the support of indigenous communities to understand
                                            20 
                                              
                                               
 

the extent of the problem and develop a plan of action including focused projects aimed at
prevention. Information on mental health issues has been included in the SIASI, and is seen
as an integral component of health statistics since alcohol and drug abuse are contributing
factors to other health problems. Portaria 2759 issued in 2007 regulated the general
directives and national policy for integrated mental health services for the indigenous,
assigned specific responsibilities for addressing the problem. Twenty specialists responsible
for mental health in different DSEI received specialized training on the subject, and 23 of the
34 DSEI now include mental health activities in their District Plans. A further 15 DSEI have
prepared District Plans specifically relating to mental health plans.
The Project carried out important activities aimed at increasing the body of knowledge in the
area of traditional medicine, more specifically in health care maintenance, the organization
and practices of traditional specialists and traditional remedies used to treat illnesses
(medicinal plants, animals and minerals). They also investigated differences in traditional
delivery practices. The results of these studies and workshops generated a large body of
material that now is stored in a virtual library of indigenous health issues, and provides input
on how to make service delivery more responsive to cultural issues.
Indigenous health community grants for activities that focused on health promotion, aimed at
improving the health status of the respective community, was an innovation under the
Project. Several projects show very promising results, such as communities that have
overcome infant malnutrition, and address environmental issues to improve health outcomes,
and issues such as sexually-transmitted diseases, AIDS, abortion and alcoholism. Extending
water and sanitation services to rural, Quilombo communities. The Project was successful
in developing a model for investing in water supply and sanitation in these communities with
the inputs from the local population for developing sustainable models that will be assured
adequate maintenance. In all 67 Quilombo communities in three states were targeted for
activities related to promotion of knowledge relating to hygiene, and provision of input on
the design of community-responsive technical solutions for the supply of water and
sanitation. Promotion activities and diagnostic studies were conducted in communities
comprising an additional 3,745 families (exceeding the number of families that were
targeted). Works were initiated and concluded in eight communities, comprising almost 900
families, but because of delays related to the innovative aspect of the stakeholder
involvement in designing the most appropriate technological solution, works were delayed.
Because of these delays, the planned impact evaluation of a completed sample of water and
sanitation subprojects was not to be carried out under the Project.
3.3 Efficiency

The Project's economic and financial analysis prepared during preparation projected that it
was expected to produce substantial savings for the health sector, primarily through
reductions in hospitalization costs due to the reduced morbidity burden from better control of
infectious diseases. Specifically, the Project's most important direct benefits were expected
to be savings in hospitalization, through a lower dengue and malaria incidence rate, and an
expected reduction in child and maternal mortality. An ex-post economic analysis has not
been prepared. Still, public health programs are usually very efficient as they are generally
based on evidence about cost-effective interventions and benefit from economies of scale,

                                            21 
                                              
                                                   
     

    which results in significant benefits in terms of lives and resources saved. The economic
    analysis prepared in the course of preparation of Phase 3 of the APL for the Program,
    revealed that the project is expected to yield a net present value of benefits, after investment
    and recurrent costs, of about US$1.3 billion, and produce an internal rate of return above 74
    percent over a ten-year period. The actions proposed in Phase 3 are expected to produce
    substantial savings over the medium- to long-term, accruing primarily through reductions in
    morbidity and mortality rates due to communicable and non-communicable diseases and
    exposure to risk factors associated with ill health, as well as the corresponding savings in
    hospital costs, outpatient costs, and treatment costs.
    Similarly, there are several indicators that show that, despite exogenous events, the Project
    increased overall efficiency in the health system, both through due to improved management
    practices, by reducing morbidity and by shifting the provision of care away from costly
    hospital-based care. It is important to consider what would have occurred in a "without
    project" scenario. As it was, SVS is in a much better position to respond to epidemic
    outbreaks. SVS was able to follow up on 63 percent of the notified cases in 2007, and a
    survey showed good knowledge about dengue among the population. Similarly, the
    institutional strengthening of SVS under the Project put it in a strong position to respond
    immediately to the threat of the AH1N1 Influenza outbreak in 2009. Finally, by introducing
    performance-based mechanisms into the transfer of federal resources to state and
    municipalities, and into FUNASA's contracting process, the Project promoted efficiency
    improvements in the allocation of resources for surveillance and indigenous health programs.

    3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
        Rating: Satisfactory
     
    3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously
    covered or to amplify discussion above)
     
    The Project's Overall Outcome Rating is considered Satisfactory, based on its continued
    extremely high relevance, its substantial achievement of its development objectives with only
    minor shortfalls, and the expected efficiency that should result in the performance of the
    health system in general, in addition to those specifically for the indigenous health system.
    The ICR's ratings are well evidenced by the high degree of achievement of PDO and
    intermediate outcome indicators ­ about 80% of each set of the impact and outcome
    indicators have been fully achieved or exceeded.
 
    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

    In general, public health interventions such as surveillance have a very strong poverty focus
    since they provide what are essentially public goods such as surveillance, immunizations,
    health education and promotion, etc. In addition, by specifically promoting improved health
    outcomes among the indigenous and quilombolas, and strengthening the institutional
    capacity to deliver services to these groups, the Project had a very strong poverty focus, as

    access to quality services, including health, water and sanitation. Activities focused on the

indigenous represented a large share of the Project and their impacts are described
throughout this report.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project is associated to two remarkable institutional changes: (i) the establishment of the
Secretariat of Health Surveillance, and its full development under the second phase as a
national public health agency comparable to similar agencies from developed countries; and
(ii) the proposed establishment of the Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health, and the
establishment of autonomous Special Indigenous Health Districts, based on models of care,
financing, organization, management and monitoring and evaluation developed under the
second phase of the Project.

(b) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

In part as a result of the various strengthening activities supported by the Project, Bank
supervision found that the MOH's emergency response to the AH1NI epidemic was prompt
and decisive, and that the epidemic has allowed for testing the effectiveness of the then
recently established National Network of Alert and Response to Public Health Emergencies
(REDECIEVS) that had been developed under the Project. With the objective of providing
support to the Government for responding to the epidemic, the Bank agreed to finance
needed equipment for control of the influenza. Similarly, FUNASA through its health
system monitoring, through the DSEI, was able to avoid that the indigenous were
disproportionately affected---medicines were distributed and the indigenous were among the
first priority group to receive vaccinations. REDECIEVS was also used to assist in recovery
efforts during the Haiti earthquake in January 2010.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Permanent consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries of the health care system are
built into Brazil's health care monitoring system and carried out periodically. The "social
control" councils are the key venues utilized by civil society and users of public services to
discuss issues related to quality of services. In addition, the project carried out consultations
with indigenous populations during the second phase and the preparation of the third phase.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Negligible or Low

The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Negligible. The Government remains fully
committed to the Project's objectives, which are their own, reflected in its programs and
policies. SVS has been consolidated as an institution, has established a fully functioning
health surveillance system, that relies on an extensive data base accessible at all levels of
government, and continues to make progress towards a next level in performance through
evidence-based program planning and financing. The Government remains fully committed
to improving the health (and other) conditions and prospects of its indigenous and other
minority populations, as evidenced by its recent issuance of a Federal Decree granting

                                             23 
                                               
                                              
 

autonomy to the DSEI and a Presidential Provisional Measure which opens the way for the
establishment of the new Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health. Carrying this out will be
a challenge, but new models of indigenous health care, financing, organization, management
and monitoring and evaluation (through the development of a health surveillance subsystem
to track indigenous health indicators), will continue to be supported by the third phase of the
project, together with training and further capacity building for DSEI autonomy. The
Government also remains committed to institutionalizing further the results-based monitoring
and financing that was supported by the Project. Given Brazil's sound macroeconomic
management, continued financing of the Project should not be a problem. The Government's
commitment to adopting new management models that focus on use of analysis of the health
situation as a tool for decision making, management of health risks, integration of health
surveillance into health care networks, and institutionalization of monitoring and evaluation
throughout the three levels of the system will be supported under the proposed third phase of
the Disease Surveillance and Control Project, to be submitted for Board approval in 2010.

There are two items on the horizon that could conceivably affect the Project, but neither of
them could be considered to have a negative impact. The first is the forthcoming change in
federal administration in early 2011, following elections scheduled for late 2010. It is not
conceivable that any new Administration will withdraw support for health surveillance, of
both the population at large and the indigenous in particular. The second relates to an
institutional reshuffling of institutional responsibility for coordination of indigenous health
programs to a new secretariat within the MOH. This has been approved by the executive and
is pending only Congressional approval, but would in any event not be expected to impact
adversely Indigenous Health achievements to date, and may well provide for even greater
coordination of indigenous health within the framework of the country's health system and
the SUS.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Satisfactory

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is considered Satisfactory. Bank assistance
was timely, immediately following the completion of the first phase of the APL and the
creation of SVS. The Project fits well in a broad strategic context within the Bank's overall
program of assistance to Brazil's health sector and the CAS. The Project's was well-
designed, its preparation thorough, and lessons from the earlier first phase of the APL were
analyzed and incorporated in its design, most notably the incorporation of a pooled funding
or SWAp approach to Subcomponent D of Component 1 where Bank financing was mingled
with federal grant transfers. The Bank worked with the client to design the performance-
based financing feature that was introduced under this Subcomponent to introduce results-
oriented accountability into what was a hierarchical, input-oriented system. The Project was
ambitious in terms of the many inter-related activities that it was to finance, but a very
detailed--perhaps almost too detailed---results framework was designed through which
progress could be monitored. Risks were appropriately identified, especially the risk of

insufficient institutional capacity to implement the Indigenous Health Policy given the large
scale-up of activities for which FUNASA was to be responsible as compared to the first
phase of the APL, and mitigation measures proposed.
(b) Quality of Supervision (including fiduciary and safeguard policies)
    Rating: Satisfactory

Bank Performance in Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. Although the Bank
financing of VIGISUS is only a small portion of total financing of important national health
programs, interviews corroborated that the value-added of technical assistance by the Bank is
widely recognized at the federal, district and municipal level. Project supervision was
assisted by an Epidemiologist from the U.S. Center for Diseases Control; PAHO also assisted
project preparation and supervision in the early stages of implementation. Supervision was
timely, proactive and involved routinely working with two separate implementing agencies,
each of which was responsible for carrying out a multitude of interrelated tasks to keep the
Project on schedule. Either of the components in itself would have represented a rather
complex project in other countries, yet supervision needed to not only work with both
agencies independently but then ensure that the required coordination among them in support
of the Project's objectives was sustained. In part because of the Project's design, with
development of monitoring and evaluation as a central feature, and in part mostly because of
the Bank team's sheer commitment to results orientation, supervision was very results
oriented. With this, supervision worked with the implementing agencies not only addressing
specific project issues that emerged, such as delays and problems with procurement and
staffing, but also in putting the Project within a broader sectoral context and working with the
Government to develop responses to emerging health issues such as the dengue outbreak in
2008 and beyond, and the AH1N1 Influenza outbreak in 2009.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory based on similar ratings for both Ensuring
Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision.
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Government Performance is rated Satisfactory. Perhaps the most important factor behind the
Project's accomplishments was the Government's unfaltering commitment to its objectives
from early preparation through completion. This had been signaled, even before preparation
had begun, by the establishment of SVS, and continued throughout implementation with the
approval of several decrees and resolutions, culminating with the Provisional Measure
opening the way for the MOH to establish the Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health
(SESAI) and the decree granting autonomy to the DSEI. Extensive consultations were built
into the preparation process, and mechanisms for social feedback and participation are built
into the system through social councils. Early on, there were some instances in which budget

                                            25 
                                              
                                              
 

allocations were delayed, but these reflected delays in approval of the federal budget and not
a lack of commitment or priority to the Project and its objectives. The main factor within the
Government's control that affected the Project was its policy on staffing, and hiring staff for
its federal ministries and agencies that resulted in extensive reliance on contracted staff, as
opposed to civil servants. While this offered advantages such as flexibility and the
possibility for innovation from new personnel, it on occasion resulted in discontinuity in
staffing, including periods of understaffing due to delays in bringing on board new contracted
staff.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
Overall, the Implementing Agencies' performance is considered Satisfactory. Implementing
agencies included SVS and FUNASA, and their respective Project Units, and the states and
municipalities. There was commitment to the Project's objectives throughout, although the
capacity of the implementing agencies varied. SVS, although newly created when the
Project started, had stronger implementation and coordination capacity. With a somewhat
more complex institutional framework within which to operate, FUNASA performed well
but its capacity to coordinate the multiple actors responsible for carrying out its activities,
COREs, DSEIs, NGOs was challenged at times, especially given staffing constraints that
affected it more than SVS (Section 2.2). In reality, the responsibilities that both SVS and
FUNASA assumed were challenging, especially within Brazil's federal structure, with
responsibilities shared among the three levels of Government, and with FUNASA's
decentralized structure through which it carried out the Project. This implied that SVS and
FUNASA had not only their own agenda and activities to implement, but also to provide
structure, normative role and direction and supervisory and assistance support to states and
municipalities and to the DSEIs, whose capacity not only varied greatly for implementation
of surveillance and disease control activities and complying with fiduciary requirement, but
who also faced their own challenges. States and municipalities also suffered from staffing
continuity, especially following periods of electoral transition. This, in turn, placed an
additional follow-up and supervisory burden on the federal agencies. Also, procurement
arrangements placed a heavy burden on all of the Project's implementing agencies given
their limited experience in and capacity for handling procurement of especially large
contracts such as laboratories. SVS fell short of expected targets with respect to the
construction of laboratories, including the establishment of a national reference laboratory.
However, under the SWAp modality, the decentralized component carried out procurement
according to national rules for small works, goods and non-consulting services, which
facilitated project implementation. FUNASA also fell short of expected targets in the
construction of water and sanitation systems for the quilombola communities under
Component II, D. Despite these issues, the Project's implementing agencies with supervisory
support from the Bank were able to move forward with most of the scheduled activities,
produce and present project monitoring information within a framework of results, and make
important progress towards the Project's objectives with minor delays.

    6. Lessons Learned
     Paradigmatic change. From inception in 1999, the VIGISUS Project posed challenges to
    SUS, triggering a culture change from a biomedical focus to a focus on public health. This
    process has been gradual and has been requiring constant innovation of skills and instruments
    for monitoring surveillance.

     Urbanization. VIGISUS needs to continue to adapt to respond to demographic
    mobilization to urban centers, given that 83% of Brazilians live in urban centers (94% of Rio
    de Janeiro, 90% of Belo Horizonte; 30% of Amazonas). Risk factors and determinants of
    disease are different in urban centers, in the Amazonia, in Northern regions, in the Southeast,
    and in isolated forest communities. Thus, environmental health is a prominent field with
    significant contributions to improve the well being of the population.

     Framing of Project Development Objectives and the Project's Results Framework.
    There were many advantages to the Project's Results Framework, most importantly that it
    was compatible in most (but not all) aspects with the very same framework that the
    Government was using to monitor performance under its health surveillance program
    (Section 2.3), that included health outcome indicators to measure progress. It is
    unquestionable that the Project had a major impact on the institutional framework and
    capacity for health surveillance in Brazil. There are some points to make with respect to
    using indicators such as reduction in incidence of malaria and cases of TB cured in a Bank-
    finance project with a rather short implementation period (as opposed to an entire
    Government Program), that has implementation responsibilities shared across three levels of
    Government, and that is nation-wide in scope in a large country such as Brazil. These
    include the following: (i) this was basically an institutional development project (with some
    exceptions) that relied on other important aspects of health system performance to make a
    marked impact on outcomes (and on agencies outside of the health sector, at all levels, such
    as municipalities and environmental control agencies, for control of malaria and dengue); (ii)
    taking the implementation schedule for those activities into consideration, it is not clear that
    even if performance towards outcomes depended exclusively on the Project's activities, that
    its results would be noticeable in such a short time frame; and (iii) also, as for most projects
    that finance the entirety of a government program--especially those that are implemented at
    three levels of Government, there is a question of attribution. These points suggest caution
    about how extensively the Project should alone be accountable for continued challenges in
    impacting important health outcomes such as cure rates for TB, and reduction in the
    incidence of malaria. Yet, it undoubtedly strengthened the federal surveillance framework to
    guide the priorities of all agencies involved in pursuing improvement in those outcomes.
 
     Monitoring Indicators. When establishing new systems, indicators should be kept
    simple. It is probably best to avoid composite indicators, since it can become difficult to
    establish realistic targets when the denominator increases dramatically for reasons that
    cannot be controlled by the Project. In general, it is probably best to adopt indicators that are
    identical to those the Government uses for its own internal monitoring purposes, since that

                                                 27 
                                                   
                                                 
 

avoids an unnecessary additional burden on borrowers, who otherwise need to establish
separate monitoring systems to track progress with the Project, and track progress for official
government reporting. This was the case of the indicator "at least 80 percent of children in
targeted districts less than two years of age weighed according to timeline specified in Health
Ministry norms". While it is important to have indicators and targets established up front, it
would also be desirable to have a flexible mechanism to adjust targets and indicators based
on implementation experience, epidemiological factors, and improvements in technology,
especially for projects with rather long implementation periods.

 Varying levels of state and municipal institutional capacity to implement sub-projects.
Institutional capacity to implement sub-projects and follow Bank requirements varies greatly
across Brazil's many states and municipalities. Weaker states and municipalities have
problems not only in the implementation of surveillance and disease control activities, but
also in complying with the program's many fiduciary requirements. As previously
mentioned, under the SWAp modality, the decentralized component carried out procurement
according to national rules for small works, goods and non-consulting services, and Bank
procurement guidelines for consultancy services. In addition to linking financing to
performance, increased monitoring and supervision, training and technical assistance need to
be in place to support weaker states and municipalities in improving their capacity to deliver
results.

 Introducing performance-based criteria into the Federal funding of sub-projects
implemented by states and municipalities. VIGISUS APL II introduced a new performance
element into the transfer of MOH funds to states and municipalities, with financing
determined in part upon the achievement of pre-defined benchmarks. The changes
introduced new funding rules for which many states and municipalities were not prepared.
Because of this, the program needs to establish and disseminate clear criteria and targets
upon which funding levels will be based. Furthermore, there should be clear linkages
between the activities funded and indicator targets, and the latter should be established taking
into consideration the lag between implementation and achievement of results. However, the
mere fact that pre-defined benchmarks were established ex-ante contributed to the
accomplishment of expected targets. By having a pre-defined benchmark, supervision and
technical inputs at the three levels of government focused on progress, and, in the event that
progress was less than expected, on identifying actions needed to get activities back on track.

     Social Control. Social control and health councils continue to be the main mechanism of
    governance of all health programs within SUS, including the VIGISUS project. A technical
    adjustment is needed at federal, state, and district level and Local Health Councils to align
    social control processes with new results-based strategy for VIGISUS III. As VIGISUS
    further develops results-based financing mechanisms, it will be important that Councils at
    all levels initiate their meetings with the presentation of the health situation of the
    communities, tendencies and risks, so that decisions and plans are based on technical
    grounds. Training of stakeholders/beneficiaries to manage health results at all levels will be
    included in VIGISUS III.




                                               28 
                                                 
                                                 
     

    Reporting and staffing arrangements affect performance. SVS, FUNASA, and states and
    municipalities, have been affected by staffing constraints, including, at all levels, staff
    turnover during transition periods. SVS was not able to internalize the administrative and
    operational processes under the Project, and future assistance will need to be designed to
    ensure the strengthening and internalizing of these managerial processes through
    implementation. However, the staffing and reporting arrangement affected FUNASA
    especially. At the federal level, there has been a need to hire an increasing number of
    personnel on a contracted basis. While bringing outsiders on board has shown benefits such
    as introducing new approaches to addressing implementation, it has also had drawbacks in
    terms of providing continuity and institutional memory, and periodic understaffing resulting
    from delays in bringing newly contracted staff on board due to the need to follow appropriate
    procurement and contracting procedures. Often, the contracted staff did not possess the
    qualifications needed for specific functions, and training, which could have addressed this
    lack of qualifications, was not held regularly. This is a country wide issue, but one which
    impacted the implementation of VIGISUS APL II.
 
     Procurement arrangements and capacity have an important impact on project
    implementation. The limited capacity in procurement within the MOH agencies, and states
    and municipalities, has affected project implementation. The use of UN agencies as
    procurement/payment agents has assisted with the contracting of consultants, with
    procurement of large contracts, with payment of miscellaneous items such as travel and per
    diem, and for direct contracting in exceptional cases. However, while an agent may in
    certain instances provide support, it introduces an additional layer in the
    procurement/contracting process, especially for large contracts, which adds to delays in
    implementation.

Annex 2: Outputs (and Intermediate Outcomes) by Component

Closing the equity gap, while addressing the increased burden of chronic diseases was - and
continues to be - the principal challenge facing the Brazilian health system. The government
that took office in January 2003 placed poverty reduction at the top of its agenda, committing
itself to reduce inequities in the access to and quality of social services. Besides introducing
new initiatives on the social front, the government remained strongly committed to continue
support for and expansion of ongoing health programs and reforms with an increased
emphasis on improving the efficiency and quality of public spending and service delivery.
The new government pledged its support to continue with those reforms, and specified four
policy areas that would be prioritized over its years in power: (i) coverage extension and
service expansion with emphasis on underserved and hard-to-reach populations; (ii) disease
surveillance and control; (iii) human resource professional and career development; and (iv)
governance and management of the publicly-financed delivery system.
VIGISUS II financed a small share of two large Government programs: Epidemiology and
Disease Control, and Indigenous Health. The Bank's value-added was justified in greater
part on the contributions that it brought to the technical design of the disease surveillance and
control systems, on the experience that it brought to supporting the delivery of services to
indigenous and poor populations by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), and its
previous experience in supporting pooled funding arrangements through the Family Health
Extension Project.
The Project's main, immediately noticeable, impact was on strengthening of SVS that had
only been created in 2003 shortly before implementation began, on decentralizing health
surveillance activities to states and municipalities, and on supporting institutional reforms in
the indigenous health system.

Project results, including those implicit in compliance with triggers for moving forward with
the proposed third phase, VIGISUS III, were achieved through the implementation of the
Project's three components and the achievement of its intermediate outcomes as described in
this Annex 2, Outputs and Intermediate Outcomes by Component, and 2b, Project Results
Framework. Factors or decisions that affected either not completing activities or exceeding
expectations are also described.

Component I: Public Health Surveillance

This Component supported SVS in its efforts to improve communicable disease surveillance
and control, strengthen the environmental health surveillance, and expand its scope of
activities to include non-communicable diseases, injuries and their risk factors. It also aimed
to support improved vital statistics, to monitor and prevent maternal and infant mortality, and
collect and analyze health information for the assessment of health disparities. Finally,
activities in this component were to support strengthening of the weak but critical role of the
states and municipalities in surveillance and disease control efforts at the local level. The
MOH was committed from the beginning to monitoring and improving the performance of
all of its activities, including public health surveillance and disease control.

VIGISUS II was instrumental in the establishment of the Secretariat of Health Surveillance
(SVS). To respond to outstanding public health challenges, the Ministry of Health
established in 2003 the Secretariat of Health Surveillance (SVS). In partnership with state
and municipal managers, SVS gathers epidemiological data on communicable and non-
communicable diseases, and injuries, monitors environmental and worker health, monitors
and responds to public health emergencies, analyses the health situation and disseminates this
information to relevant stakeholders, and implements the National Health Promotion policy
and prevention and control strategies for communicable and non-communicable diseases and
injuries.

The Component was monitored and evaluated according to indicators that were integrally
related to the Government's own process of monitoring and evaluation of the performance of
the public health surveillance system at the three levels of government that was strengthened
under the Project.
Activities under Subcomponents A were implemented directly by SVS. The activities under
Subcomponent D were implemented by states and municipalities with financial and technical
assistance from SVS.
Subcomponent A: Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases

This Subcomponent continued to support the strengthening of the National Public Health
Surveillance System. Progress towards the intermediate outcome indicators for this
component is presented in the box below, and the activities that resulted in the progress
towards compliance with these indicators follows.

                           INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME INDICATORS

               Exceeded: 40% of cases of bacterial meningitis confirmed by laboratory
               analysis

                             Baseline: 22.5% (2002)

                             Actual: 48% (2009)

               Not Achieved: 85% of municipalities at high risk for dengue have fewer
               than 10% of households with a health visit pending

                             Baseline: 40% (2002)

Surveillance systems developed. The Project produced excellent results in terms of
developing and strengthening surveillance systems. The upgrading of SINAN from a
Windows-based system to a web-based system, that provides timely data in all states and
capital cities, and about 4,600 municipalities is a major accomplishment of VIGISUS II.
With this, these areas are providing surveillance information (disease occurrence,
investigation, confirmation and control activities) in real time. Despite some difficulties that
SVS is addressing such as retro feeding notifications from municipalities that still do not
have access, this web-based system has already been used to notify occurrences of Influenza
A in real time by the State Health Secretariats (SES). A laboratory results reporting system
that is linked to SINAN for all pertinent notifiable diseases is implemented to date in seven
states, with two more states under implementation. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, the
Fundação Osvaldo Cruz is linked to SINAN to report new cases of Influenza A. The
shortage of specialized information technology staff has constrained the implementation of a
laboratory results reporting system in the remaining states. An information system for
monitoring DOTS treatment was integrated with SINAN-based reporting on TB. Eighty six
percent of TB priority municipalities have at least one health center that provides DOTS, not
only to local residents but also to residents from outside municipalities. Therefore, a priority
for SINAN, mentioned above, will be to allow retro feeding of notifications from outside a
person's municipality of residence in order to reflect accurate information on the monitoring
of DOTS.
Accomplishments towards improving capacity in communicable disease surveillance and
control through training and research included: (a) establishing the Programa de
Treinamento em Epidemiologia de Campo (EPISUS) that has trained 47 professional, and
has a further 21 currently in training; (b) monitoring and notifying 579 possible health
emergencies since March 2006, and an additional 14 health events, including Influenza A, in
the first semester of 2009; (c) formalizing a cooperation with the Instituto de Saúde Coletiva,
of the Federal University of Bahia, for activities related to public health surveillance; (d)
carrying out 38 studies and research on varied subjects related to public health surveillance;
and (e) formalizing a contract with CDC to provide, inter alia, specialized advice on
incorporating non-communicable diseases in EPISUS, providing high-complexity laboratory
services not available in Brazil.
Public Health Laboratory Network developed. Brazil's public health laboratory network
continued to be modernized with satisfactory results under the Project, which will result in
quicker turnaround in the diagnosis of dengue, malaria and yellow fever, among other
diseases. In 2005 SVS established standards for national laboratories, regional laboratories
and collaborating centers. Seventeen laboratories have been certified as reference
laboratories after a first audit in 2007. Three laboratories are in final phases of upgrading,
equipping and upgrading to NB3. A study tour to the UK together with the Bank took place
in 2009, to visit a NB4 lab among other sites, and there are currently plans for installing an
NB4 lab. A total of 27 laboratories were equipped for molecular biology diagnostics, and
five of the planned 30 laboratories for serologic diagnosis of dengue were built, one in each
region of the country. The National Reference Laboratory was not installed due to lack of
consensus on the characteristics of the laboratory and its location; and upgrading of a fourth
laboratory to NB3 level in the state of Rondonia was not carried out due to difficulties in the
bidding process whereby two separate biddings for construction of this fourth laboratory had

to be cancelled because of a shortage of companies with the specialized experience needed
for a complex task.
Hospital Based Surveillance developed. Notable progress was made in strengthening the
surveillance capacity in hospitals. VIGISUS II financed information technology equipment,
training of 317 technicians and works for the establishment of 193 sentinel sites for hospital-
based public health surveillance.
Epidemiological Emergencies Network established. VIGISUS II supported a strong effort
towards improving management capacity of SUS institutions responsible for surveillance,
including their response to emergencies. The Center for Strategic Information in Health
Surveillance (CIEVS), established with support under the Project in 2006, is responsible for
investigating and responding rapidly to epidemiological outbreaks and public health
emergencies. CIEVS was tested during the AH1N1 Influenza outbreak in 2009, and
provided support to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. More than 300 professionals completed
a model of strategic planning for public health surveillance that was developed and included
in their graduate studies. Several norms and guidelines for the three levels of government
were updated, including those that: (i) establish the Center for Strategic Information and
Responses in Health Surveillance (CIEVS), with a view to expanding its network; and (ii)
mandate the notification of diseases. Monitor CIEVS, a software program for performance
monitoring and technical assistance to be provided to states has been developed and extended
to 25 state and municipal units. Rapid Response Units, centers for public health
emergencies, were established as part of the network of CIEVS in 25 states and
municipalities.

Cold chain for vaccines guaranteed. To reduce or eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases,
SVS, has maintained the National Immunization Program (PNI) since 1973, which has
contributed to the significant reduction in infant and childhood deaths and disease. The
Project supported successfully the objectives of improving immunization coverage rates and
diminishing inequities in coverage of vaccinations, and more specifically improving the
capacity to store vaccines, by financing the acquisition of equipment like solar refrigerators,
the development of manuals for cold chain and maintenance manuals for equipment.
Control of vector-borne diseases developed. In 2008, Brazil had a significant and lethal
dengue epidemic. The fatality rate increased from 4.3 percent in 2001 to 10.3 percent in
2007. The reasons for the dramatic global emergence of dengue as a major public health
problem are complex and not well understood. In Brazil, it is likely that the period between
large epidemics will decrease. Increased rainfall and temperature, and their influence on the
transmission cycle are the main triggers for a marked seasonal pattern. Several activities were
carried out to reduce the incidence of dengue, yet despite the efforts under the Project,
dengue still poses important challenges. Because of the nature of the spread of dengue, a
multi-sector and inter-governmental approach, involving also state and municipal levels of
government, was promoted. A National Directive for the Prevention and Control of Dengue
Epidemics was prepared to define strategies for state, regional and local governments to
follow in controlling the spread of the disease. Emphasis was also placed on developing
systems to monitor efforts to control dengue and the occurrence of the disease, inter alia
through information provided by SINAN, disseminate results and provide support to priority

municipalities for the National Program to Control Dengue. Further efforts were made to
provide training focused on diagnosing and treating dengue.        More than six million
households were visited in 2009 alone to implement measures to control dengue.

Improved, social communication and social participation. An important effort was carried
out by SVS to increase the number of public information publications, newspaper articles and
other media information on health issues, on varied subjects such as malaria, dengue (17,641
news publications), TB (1,937 publications), and hepatitis (2,036 publications), among other
diseases.

Subcomponent B: Environmental Health Surveillance


                             INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME INDICATORS

            Achieved: National environmental health surveillance system is fully developed for
            water, air and soil at the national level

                          Baseline: NA
                          Target: 3 systems developed and functional
                          Actual: 3 systems developed and functional (2009)


Progress in the implementation of this Subcomponent was highly satisfactory. VIGISUS II
played a strategic role in the structuring and consolidation of environmental health
surveillance within a national system of health surveillance at the federal, state and municipal
levels. A Department of Environmental and Worker's Health (DSAST) was created in the
MOH, within the SVS.

Water, air and soil quality surveillance systems implemented. Subsystems for the
surveillance of water (VIGIAGUA), air (VIGIAR) and soil (VIGISOLO) were fully
developed and are in advanced, but varying, stages of implementation. By far the most
advanced is VIGIAGUA that is currently being implemented by all SES and SMS of capital
cities. Seventy five percent of all SES and SMS of capital cities have departments
responsible for environmental surveillance in place. Reporting of water surveillance
increased through improvements in the information monitoring system, SISAGUA; in 2007
94.3 percent of SES and SMS of capital cities were presenting bi-annual reports on water
quality. VIGISOLO is currently functioning in 93 percent of capital city SMS, while
VIGIAR is functioning in 89 percent of SES and 54 percent of capital city SMS.
Implementation of these subsystems in states in municipalities was made possible through an
intensive program of training (more than 1,200 technicians from SES and SMS) and
technical assistance provided under the Project. Twenty-one research projects are being
carried out on several topics related to environmental surveillance in coordination with
universities and research institutions.

Hazardous substances, biological and physical factors and natural disasters surveillance
systems developed. The project financed several activities (seminars, workshops, training of
trainers, and development of action plans for accidents with hazardous substances) aimed at
institutionalizing the SVS' role in emergencies and disasters, including the implementation of
a program, VIGIDESASTRES, to support this role among the federal, state and municipal
levels of government. VIGIDESASTRES is currently under implementation in 16 SES. A
multi-sector approach is being followed to addressing emergencies and disasters, whereby
health sector authorities coordinate responses with both those of environmental and civil
defense. VIGIDESASTRE plans focus on risk reduction (prevention, mitigation and
preparation), disaster management (alert and response) and recovery (rehabilitation and
reconstruction). While promoting plans to protect the health of persons exposed to disasters,
hazardous substances and pollution, and monitor water quality, SVS recognized the
importance of climate change on health and created a permanent Working Group on Climate
and Health to develop a National Plan for Climate Change for the SUS and strengthened its
cooperation with the Ministry of Environment to address these issues. Finally, SVS
developed an integrated action plan related to risks posed by and actions to address pesticide
exposure among farm workers.
National environmental health laboratory network established. DSAST is creating a
network of environmental health laboratories with reference centers responsible for the
development of training, research and technology on environmental health. To date seven
laboratories have been remodeled and equipped, and one has already been established as a
reference laboratory. Guidelines for specimen handling and laboratory standards have been
issued for all public health laboratories.

Performance under this Subcomponent was highly satisfactory. Multiple information
systems, with data input and accessible at all levels of Government have been put in place to
provide information needed for health surveillance: births, mortality and morbidity, risk
factors and health knowledge, attitude and practices, environmental health, etc. SVS has
strengthened operational and technical capacity to carry out health situation analysis and
monitoring and control of non-communicable diseases and injuries at the federal, state and
municipal levels by: (i) improving coverage, quality and utilization of vital statistics; (ii)
strengthening non-communicable disease and risk factor surveillance; (iii) developing a
system of injury surveillance; and (iv) improving dissemination and social communication
related to health promotion and risk factor prevention. An important effort was placed on
further developing and improving the quality of information in the Sistema de Informações
sobre Mortalidade (SIM, or Information System on Mortality) and the Sistema de
Informações de Nascidos Vivos (SINASC, or Information System on Live Births).

Vital Statistics systems established. Currently, 88 percent of states are utilizing the SIM to
record information on mortality, and this is expected to reach 100 percent by project
completion. Eleven out of 27 state capitals currently have plans developed to establish
mortality verification services (Serviço de Verificação de Óbitos, SVO). SVS carried out
five training programs for about 250 professionals and produced updates to the SIM and
SINASC (inter alia to investigate and report on maternal mortality and other causes of
female mortality) to provide on-line data. SVS has also intensified efforts to improve the
quality of data accessible through SIM by among other activities: (i) increasing the resources
for monitoring information on mortality at the municipal level; (ii) requiring permanent
notification of mortality in hospitals; (iii) including information on mortality outside of
hospitals; (iv) providing feedback to physicians to ensure that death certificates are prepared
correctly and (v) coordinating data in SIM with that in other vital statistics information
systems, such as that maintained by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografía e Estatística
(IBGE). These actions have already produced results on reducing the number of deaths that
are poorly classified by approximately 60 percent in the states of the northeast region and by
approximately 30 percent for the country as a whole.         The Government is utilizing the
information from SIM and SINASC to guide its priorities: in order to meet the MDG on
infant mortality, the Government has established a goal of reducing infant mortality in the
states of the Northeast Region and Amazonia Legal by five percent in 2009-2010, with
priority assigned to those municipalities that concentrated more than 50% of infant mortality
and hospitalizations in 2006.

Non-communicable disease, injury and risk factor surveillance established.               In
coordination with institutions of higher education, SVS developed several extended courses,
including the development of their content and curriculum and selection of bibliographic
materials, several for delivery via distance education, and workshops on NCD surveillance,
epidemiology and data analysis for: (i) Surveillance of NCDs; (ii) Health Promotion; (iii)
Impact of Violence on Health; and (iv) Project Evaluation in Health Promotion. The latter
two courses have been delivered for 500 and 200 students/representatives of states and
municipalities. The Plano Nacional para Prevenção e Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e
DCNT, a national plan for NCD risk factor surveillance and prevention, was finalized in

    2005. Since then, implementation has started in states and their capital cities, with regular
    monitoring of results.

    SVS also implemented several activities aimed at identifying risk factors for NCDs,
    promoting health and evaluating the program's impact, as follows:

        A system for monitoring the frequency and distribution of risk factors for NCDs was
        rolled out to all states and capital cities. VIGITEL (Vigilância de Fatores de Risco par
        Doenças Crônicas Não Transmissíveis por Entrevistas Telefônicas or Surveillance of
        Risk Factors for Non-Transmissible Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey) utilizes
        telephone interviews, assisted by computers, to obtain samples of the resident adult
        population. Surveys covering 54,000 persons were carried out in 2006, 2007 and 2008,
        and results were published on the web.

        A Global Adult Tobacco Survey carried out in 2008 aimed to monitor tobacco use and
        evaluate efforts to reduce its use. Results of the study are being analyzed and the final
        study was published in November 2009. There is currently a proposal to pass a federal
        law regulating smoking in public spaces.
 
        A study on the danger of exposure to tobacco leaves, Folha Verde do Tabaco, with
        research in two tobacco-producing areas of Brazil, revealed the existence of the disease.
        As a result, SVS has promoted several activities, on a cross-sector basis with other
        involved ministries at the federal level, including defining clinical protocols, monitoring
        residues from tobacco leaves, developing educational materials on the disease, training
        administrators and technicians on the implications to the health of tobacco workers, and
        promoting efforts to diversify agricultural production away from tobacco with a view to
        lower health risks within a sustainable development framework.
 
        A system to monitor violence and accidents, Vigilância de Violências e Acidentes
        (VIVA) was developed and established to understand the magnitude and extent of
        violence and accidents and their impact on mortality. VIVA functions at the federal, state
        and municipal level (in 900 municipalities). VIVA has in part been incorporated in
        SINAN, with the result that real-time information on different forms of violence is
        available in those municipalities that are linked to the system. Several training programs
        and workshops on different aspects of violence have been promoted, in coordination with
        other federal, state and municipal institutions responsible for addressing violence.
 
        The expansion and consolidation of a National Network for Health Promotion (PNPS,
        Política Nacional de Promoção da Saude) of the SES e SMS, and associated financing of
        525 federal entities through the Health Cities Network.
 
        At the same time, the MOH created a network to prevent violence and promote health
        (Rede Nacional de Núcleos de Prevenção das Violências e Promoção da Saúde, NPVPS).
        This network already counts on 254 units in existence in 21 SES, 215 SMS, 16 education
        and research institutions and two in NGOs. SVS has provided not only financial

        assistance but also technical support, local seminars, distribution of materials and training
        to support states and municipalities in participating in the NPVPS.
 
        SVS has also worked closely with SMS, municipalities and civil society to reduce
        mortality from traffic accidents. It is currently engaged with 16 municipalities in large
        urban areas (corresponding to about 18.74 percent of the country's population) to develop
        surveillance and prevention actions that reduce injury and deaths resulting from traffic
        accidents.
 
        The Programa Saúde na Escola (PSE) is a program shared by the MOH and the Ministry
        of Education aimed at strengthening health responses to students in the nation's public
        schools with a view to address the problems that threaten development of children and
        adolescents. The program includes five broad lines of action: (i) clinical and
        psychosocial evaluation; (ii) health promotion and disease prevention; (iii) continuous
        training for education and health specialists, and youth on the PSE; (iv) monitoring and
        evaluation of student health; and (v) monitoring and evaluation of the PSE. A total of
        608 out of 701 priority municipalities eligible to participate in the initial phase of the PSE
        in 2010 have already agreed to participate, received funding for this purpose from the
        MOH and kits containing materials and equipment needed for the program from the
        Ministry of Education. IBGE was contracted to carry out a survey on students' health in
        26 state capitals and the Federal District, which was completed in 2009. The survey will
        be carried out every other year for students in grade 9 of the country's public and private
        schools. Since 2006, SVS has also promoted several media campaigns related to health
        promotion and risk factor prevention promoting awareness of important topics and
        aiming to influence the adoption of behaviors that lead to healthier lives, such as:
        reduction of smoking, increasing physical activity, transit safety, and controlling
        hypertension and diabetes.

        Projeto GUIA in coordination with CDC, PAHO and several Brazilian and American
        universities, is an ongoing evaluation of physical activity programs in 286 municipalities,
        which has preliminary good results. The GUIA I project included: (i) a systematic
        assessment of the scientific and non-scientific literature in Latin America about
        effectiveness of public health interventions to increase physical activity; (ii) an evaluation
        of the effectiveness of two new programs: Academia da Cidade and Curitiba Ativa; (iii)
        development and testing of new tools for use in the evaluation of physical activity
        programs; (iv) identification of factors associated with both leisure time and transport
        physical activity in Brazil; and (v) capacity building and evaluation of physical activity
        programs of nearly 300 cities in Brazil. GUIA II will expand previous research to shed
        light on health promoting and preventive practices related to physical activity and chronic
        diseases in health care services of Brazil.

    Capacity built for health situation analyses. Several training programs were carried out for
    technical staff of the SES and the MOH responsible for using and administering data in the
    SIM and SINASC including programs on how to operate and maintain the systems and
    databases and how to analyze information on mortality and morbidity. Several articles were
    published in national and international magazines, and Saúde Brasil, a publication about

                                                 40 
                                                   
                                                     
 

health in Brazil has been published annually. A web-based atlas for health situation analysis
has been established and an application using GIS technology is under preparation.

Dissemination and social communication. SVS has routinely published magazines, articles
and other publication related to health issues, including NCDs, accidents, infant mortality as
well as results of its surveys and other initiatives such as VIGITEL, PNPS, and Projeto
GUIA.

Subcomponent D: Strengthening Institutional Capacity in States and Municipalities

Within Brazil's federal framework, states and municipalities have an important role to play in
health surveillance, prevention and control of communicable and non-communicable
diseases, and injuries. Under the policy direction and procedures and instruments developed
at the national level, states coordinate health surveillance and supervise the surveillance
activities carried out by municipalities. Targets and indicators agreed between the Federal
Government and states and municipalities are formalized in agreements, together with levels
of funding.

                             INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME INDICATORS

An important focus of the Project was to strengthen the capacity for public health
surveillance at the state and municipal level, within Brazil's decentralized framework. This
subcomponent co-financed federal grant transfers to support institutional development
subprojects proposed by participating states and municipalities in their PLANVIGI, and had
a very important impact on the decentralization of health surveillance to the states and
municipalities. The outcome of these institutional capacity building subprojects was
satisfactory: 75 percent of beneficiary states and municipalities attained at least 75 percent of
their technical and financial targets.

Subprojects consisted of activities requiring inputs such as: small works (remodeling of
offices and laboratories), goods (computer equipment and software, vehicles, laboratory
equipment), consultancy services, non-consultancy services (workshops and seminars,
materials and training), and operational costs, and consisted of activities in one or more of
the following areas:

      i. Institutional Development, including modifications in the human resource rules and
         state legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate the establishment and stability of a
         "critical mass" of public health professionals at the state level capable of performing
         key surveillance functions;
     ii. Epidemiological surveillance and disease control focusing on strengthening capacity
         to achieve full coverage of the mandatory disease notification system, monitor and
         respond to transmissible diseases and build capacity for surveillance of non-
         communicable diseases;
    iii. Environmental Surveillance, supporting the capacity building for air and soil quality
         surveillance while improving capacity for water quality surveillance;
    iv. Situation analysis, consisting of activities to support improvement of methodologies
         for collecting, analyzing and disseminating data with a special focus on non-
         transmissible diseases, and for developing interventions based on the data obtained;
         and
     v. Upgrading of technical skills, consisting of "mandatory" training courses in specific
         themes related to health surveillance.

In all, this Subcomponent supported 27 SES, 25 SMS of capital cities and 144 SMS of other
municipalities in carrying out PLANVIGIs that they had prepared based on their identified
needs which had been approved by the SVS. SVS worked with states and municipalities to

supervise and strengthen municipal and state fiduciary processes through risk assessments,
fiduciary improvement action plans and audits.

Results-based Financing established. Under the Project, SVS developed a results-based
mechanism, in conjunction with surveillance, planning, implementation and monitoring and
evaluation. To introduce a new results-oriented accountability into a hierarchical, input-
oriented public system, the federal grant transfer mechanism through which the federal
government finances health surveillance subprojects by states and municipalities incorporates
performance- and results-based financing mechanisms.           This scheme consisted of the
following features:

    Each PLANVIGI was divided into two phases of about 24 months each. The level of
    financing for the second phase was dependent on performance during the first phase.
    Indicators include a set of outputs and intermediate outcomes, the compliance of which is
    certified by SVS. For each set of activities proposed for "activity areas", outputs and
    intermediate outcomes were benchmarked for each phase. Two or three indicators were
    established for each activity. Targets were customized for each participating state or
    municipality drawing on available baseline data. A weighted three point grading system
    was used to determine the level of performance.
    Baseline data became available early on during implementation and, together with state
    and municipal level evaluations of health surveillance data and capabilities, and the
    PLANVIGI monitoring system, were used to build the performance-based system.
    Towards the second half of implementation, SVS introduced the performance system to
    differentiate between the performers. After the Mid-Term Review in 2007, the
    decentralized implementers were evaluated monthly according to two variables:
    achievement of agreed target indicators and level of financial execution.
    States and municipalities were classified according to performance in good, regular or
    unsatisfactory. Those with unsatisfactory performance only received a new transfer of
    funds after achieving a classification of regular or good performance.

Development of Human Resources for Health Surveillance. Building institutional capacity
requires the availability of qualified human resources in the areas of health surveillance that
will support better capacity in the future. The Project supported the creation of a network of
institutions to work together in providing educational curricula in this field. The Rede de
Formação de Recursos Humanos em Vigilância em Saúde (Health Surveillance Human
Resource Development Network, RFRH-VS), established by SVS under the Project, aims to
provide educational opportunities for professionals that work on surveillance and disease
control and prevention in the three levels of government. RFRH-VS is created by a network
of universities that offer graduate studies in areas related to health surveillance. In all, 34
universities, from all regions are now offering 17 specialized courses and 11 masters degrees.
A total of 386 technical specialists have participated in courses, and 68 attended masters'
programs. Over 90 percent of these programs are offered in universities in the North, Center-
west and Northeast regions, with a similar percentage of participants from these regions.

Component II: Indigenous Health

The disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous population health status is smaller in
Brazil than in other countries with indigenous populations, and some indicators such as infant
mortality show important improvement. However,           available data show that morbidity
and mortality rates among indigenous people continue to be significantly higher than among
the general population. In addition, low coverage and capacity of the health system to
respond to the particular challenges and vulnerability caused by isolation of indigenous
people result in sub-registration of deaths. In terms of morbidity, there is high incidence of
malnutrition, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, malaria, tuberculosis, STIs, and
vaccine-preventable diseases.
VIGISUS II promoted an important strengthening and capacity building of the Indigenous
Health Subsystem, and supported efforts to consolidate the delivery of health services to
Brazil's indigenous population through works, provision of equipment and training of the
units responsible for delivery of health services to this group. Proposals for new models of
Indigenous Health care, financing, organization, management and monitoring and evaluation,
and an Implementation Plan were completed, and reviewed by several regional workshops in
2008 and 2009, with the participation of the 34 DSEI. VIGISUS II supported an important
effort geared towards identifying the special needs of the indigenous, and made some initial
progress in addressing in a more appropriate and sustainable manner the water and sanitation
needs among Quilombo communities.

The Project also had an important, positive institutional impact on FUNASA that based on
the earlier highly satisfactory experience under the first phase of the APL, was responsible
for implementing a significantly larger program under this Project. FUNASA completed
new models of indigenous health care, financing, organization, management and monitoring
and evaluation, together with an Implementation Plan for their roll-out, and presented these
for review in Regional Workshops that counted on the participation of representatives from
34 DSEI, and a National Workshop with the highest level participation, including from
indigenous leadership and the Presidency. In 2009, a Presidential Decree provided that DSEI
are to become autonomous; increased capacity and autonomy will allow them to coordinate,
supervise and implement activities of the Indigenous Health Care Subsystem, under the new

models and within the context of Brazil's SUS. A Provisional measure opened the way for
the establishment of the Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health. This will be supported
under the third phase of the APL.


Activities under Subcomponent B were implemented directly by FUNASA, in partnership
with NGOs. The activities under Subcomponent C were implemented by indigenous
communities in partnership with NGOs and bona fide community organizations selected by
the communities. Subcomponent D was implemented by FUNASA through its regional units
(COREs).

SIASI. The information system of the Indigenous Health Subsystem is being developed in
the context of the SINAN; four subsystems have been developed and are under
implementation in all DSEI---demographic, morbidity, vaccination, and health surveillance
modules. Modules on nutritional surveillance and maternal health are developed and under
implementation in some DSEI. The Mortality Information System for the general population
provides data for the maternal mortality indicator, without disaggregation by residence,
ethnicity, and health care reference. The investigation of maternal deaths coupled with
adoption of the SIASI maternal health module will allow for improvement of the quality of
the information about maternal deaths. Analysis of the quality of information revealed some
problems arising from the absence of a phonetic routine in filling in the data collection fields
of the SIASI, and other problems related to inconsistency between the political division of
the country and the territorial organization of the DSEI, and the format for storing the
variables.

Models. In 2008, FUNASA began work on setting targets and designing new models of
indigenous health care delivery, financing, organization, management, and monitoring and
evaluation. This work aimed at identifying and discussing with the DSEI more realistic,
effective and efficient options for the Indigenous Health Subsystem, and levels of integration
into the SUS. Proposals for new models of Indigenous Health and an Implementation Plan
were completed, and reviewed by several regional and national workshops in 2008 and 2009,
with participation of the 34 DSEI. FUNASA expected to start implementation of these new
models in 2010, including training, further studies and capacity building for eventual DSEI
autonomy.

DSEI Autonomy. In 2009, a Presidential Decree provided that the DSEI should become
autonomous. Autonomy is expected by December 2010, at which time the DSEI will be
empowered to coordinate, supervise and implement the activities of the Indigenous Health
Subsystem in the context of the SUS. Phase III of the APL will support the implementation
of the new models of care, financing, organization, management and monitoring and
evaluation, including training, further studies and capacity building for DSEI autonomy.

District Plans. District Plans for indigenous health districts have been institutionalized as an
instrument of management and coordination of the many actors involved in indigenous health
services. Plans represent a forum for permanent consultations with stakeholders and
beneficiaries of health care, and therefore, are prepared following a bottom-up approach were
needs are identified and discussed at the Local Indigenous Health Councils, and reported to
the District Indigenous Health Councils which include representatives of the indigenous
groups, government agencies, NGOs and universities. The Presidents of the 34 DSEI then
meet quarterly to consult, and review plans, ensuring that the norms of the national policy of
indigenous health care are followed. The Plans set out the agreements among the various
actors: the District Indigenous Health Council, the State and Municipal Health Secretariats
and other public agencies, and NGOs. In an effort to strengthen the importance of the District
Plans as instruments of management of indigenous health plans, three training events on
governance and participatory practices were targeted to District Council.

NGOs. The multidisciplinary indigenous health teams that work in districts are similar to
Family Health Teams, and operate on a territorial basis. They are hired either by FUNASA,
through contracts with NGOs, or by the respective municipality, and provide services that are
specific to the respective DSEI. Performance-based contracts with NGOs and public
providers and between FUNASA and DSEIs have been developed, and financing on the basis
of performance is beginning. In an effort to develop social accountability mechanisms to
guide the use of funds, mechanisms for disclosing provider and DSEI performance to
communities have been developed, but implementation has not yet begun.

Disclosure. FUNASA has increased its efforts at disclosure of information and consultation.
Its indigenous health care models were posted on the institution's website for consultation.
Similarly the conformation of the Health Councils are regulated by law, as are their terms
and responsibilities are regulated by law. All municipal, district and state councils are
required to monitor the health of the persons in their jurisdictions, submit financial
statements and render accounts. Aide-memoires of the Council meetings are disclosed on
MOH's web page and on FUNASA's web page at the municipal and state levels.

Infrastructure. Significant investment was also made in infrastructure. Construction of 102
health posts, eight Pólos, and 6 CASAIs were completed, and works on a further four health
posts are under construction. Approximately 89 percent of planned civil works have been
concluded. Vehicles, boats and communication equipment necessary for the health teams to
function in remote areas have been procured. But challenges still remain, especially with
respect to transport (boats), communications equipment and other inputs.

Coverage Extended and Quality Enhanced. Under the VIGISUS II Project, 547 indigenous
health teams were trained on benchmark service plan, prevention and control of priority
diseases, public health surveillance and integrated service delivery. These health teams
comprise 275 doctors, 547 nurses, 514 dentists, 2,076 technical assistants, 206 dental office
assistants and 1,251 Indigenous Health Agents. Of the total 3,906 Indigenous Health
Agents, 1,135, or 29 percent, are women. Still, distribution and retention of qualified staff,
especially in the Amazon Region, continues to be a challenge.

Governance and Performance-based Management improved. Significant progress was
made in improving the governance of the Indigenous Health Subsystem that relies on a
complex network of institutional relationships in order to function. This included proposals
for the definition of roles and competencies of the federal and decentralized levels of
FUNASA, especially with respect to funding, planning and evaluation.

From 2003 to 2007 there was an increase of 154% in nominal terms, and 100% in real terms,
in the share of the Ministry of Health's budget represented by indigenous health funding. The
annual allocation of funds for Indigenous Health is of about R$500 million, equivalent to per
capita spending of more than R$987 (significantly higher than for the general population).
population).     The mechanism for allocating resources to states and municipalities for
indigenous health were regulated under Portaria 2656 dated October 17, 2007. Still, the
fragmentation of resources among sources of financing, and also among providers of service,
results in management and control being more difficult. Transfer of funds is based on

historical data, and does not adequately take into account costs or the health needs of
individual districts. 

Subcomponent B: Special Health Needs of Indigenous Populations

Implementation of this Subcomponent was Highly Satisfactory. Through the development of
strategies and implementation of pilot projects, targeted interventions and research, the
activities under this subcomponent aimed to document and comprehend the causes of
malnutrition, alcoholism and suicide among indigenous populations while reducing the
incidence of these problems among targeted groups. This subcomponent also supported
research on how to integrate traditional and modern medical practices appropriately.

         Exceeded: 50% of indigenous health districts provide evidence that district councils approve
         and access annual health pans

Alcoholism and Suicide. FUNASA implemented several important activities aimed at
addressing alcoholism and suicide among the indigenous. To better understand the causes of
high levels of alcoholism and suicide among the indigenous population, FUNASA carried
out a baseline study on incidence of these factors with the support of indigenous communities
in order to understand the extent of the problem and develop a plan of action including
focused projects aimed at prevention. The baseline study evaluated the extent of alcoholism
and suicide among all ethnic groups in six DSEI, and selected ethnic groups in an addition
six DSEI. This information on mental health issues has been included in the SIASI, and is
seen as an integral component of health statistics since alcohol and drug abuse are
contributing factors to other health problems. Portaria 2759 issued in 2007 regulated the
general directives and national policy for integrated mental health services for the
indigenous, assigned specific responsibilities for addressing the problem. Twenty specialists
responsible for mental health in different DSEI received specialized training on the subject,
and 23 of the 34 DSEI now include mental health activities in their District Plans. A further
15 DSEI have prepared District Plans specifically relating to mental health plans. FUNASA
also carried out eight studies about alcoholism and suicide among specific indigenous groups
with high incidence, and disseminated the results, through NGOs, consultants and the DSEIs'
mental health specialists. At the same time, FUNASA has been working with indigenous
representing 34 different ethnic groups to plan, develop and implement actions aimed at
preventing alcoholism and suicide.

Nutrition. Information on the nutritional status of the indigenous population was virtually
non-existent a couple of years ago. Through the Project, FUNASA made several very
significant accomplishments that will allow this subject to be addressed as a matter of
priority. First, it conducted a macro regional baseline assessment on the nutritional status of
the indigenous population for children under five and women aged 14 to 50 years in the
North, Northeast, CenterWest, and South/Southeast Regions. This was the first time that this
information was made available and it has been disclosed on FUNASA's website. Under the
Project, FUNASA developed the Indigenous Nutritional Surveillance System (Sistema de
Vigilancia Alimentar e Nutricional Indígena, SISVAN). Implementation of SISVAN
required an extensive effort of training technicians responsible for nutrition in the DSEIs,
which was put in place by FUNASA in coordination with FIOCRUZ, and providing the
DSEI with the specialized equipment needed for growth monitoring. FUNASA worked with
FIOCRUZ also to standardize the procedures for nutritional surveillance, which resulted in
the issuance of a technical note on the subject that was issued to all DSEIs. By project
completion, 28 DSEIs had staff trained on growth monitoring, nutritional guidance and
community involvement on the subject, and were providing monthly reports on the
nutritional status of their under five population, representing information on a total of 36,246
children under five years of age and 14,660 children under two years of age. The Project
also supported the structuring of the nutritional area within the DESAI. This area within
DESAI has already adapted existing programs, such as the programs on vitamin A and iron
supplementation to make them culturally acceptable to the indigenous populations.

Traditional Medicine. Delivering quality health care services to the indigenous population
requires understanding the peculiarities of traditional indigenous medicine and its practices
and customs. The Project carried out important activities in 12 DSEIs throughout the country


                                            49 
                                              
                                                   
 

aimed at increasing the body of knowledge in the area of traditional medicine, more
specifically in health care maintenance, the organization and practices of traditional
specialists and traditional remedies used to treat illnesses (medicinal plants, animals and
minerals). They also investigated differences in traditional delivery practices. Reputable
indigenous organizations were contracted to carry out these activities, as they were seen to
have established trust among the indigenous groups and could use the opportunity to provide
training to the indigenous in the process of carrying out the studies. Several workshops,
including representatives of indigenous organizations, DSEIs and COREs were held on the
subject, as well as national seminars that included representatives of government ministries,
universities and other NGOs. The results of these studies and workshops generated a large
body of material that now is stored in a virtual library of indigenous health issues, and
provides input on how to make service delivery more responsive to appropriate cultural and
other issues.

Subcomponent C: Fund for Indigenous Community Initiatives

                                   INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME INDICATORS

      Exceeded: Beneficiaries in 80% of indigenous communities receiving grants have met stated objectives
      and 50% consider that the subprojects have contributed to the improvement of previously defined
      health problems

                Baseline: NA
                Target: 80% indigenous communities have met objectives and 50% consider subprojects
                contributed to improvement of health problems
                Actual: Beneficiaries in 85% of communities have met objectives and 100% consider that
                subprojects have contributed to improvement (2009)

The financing of indigenous health community grants was an innovation under the Project.
In all, 149 grants were financed, out of a total of 616 that were submitted. The grants were
for activities that focused on health promotion, aimed at improving the health status of the
respective community. FUNASA carried out 42 workshops to promote the initiative,
selected proposals that would receive funding from among the proposals submitted, carried
out 21 workshops on administration of community projects and financial and administrative
management, and supervised the implementation of the approved activities, providing
technical assistance to the communities in the process. Upon completion of the activities,
two workshops were held with wide representation from the COREs, DSEIs, and
communities themselves to exchange experiences and best practices. FUNASA has
developed a methodology to evaluate the impact of these projects, and pilot-tested the
methodology on one. Several projects show very promising results, such as communities
that have overcome infant malnutrition, that address environmental issues to improve health
outcomes, and that address issues such as sexually-transmitted diseases, AIDS, abortion and
alcoholism. In addition, several communities have on their own continued with these types
of health promotion activities, as they have seen that the mere implementation of these types
of activities improves the communities' self-esteem. In all, it was found that when
communities are empowered to identify and seek solutions, processes and activities to
improve health, this can become an important strategy to strengthen health promotion and
prevention.

    Subcomponent D: Water and Sanitation for Quilombo Communities

This Subcomponent aimed to install, expand or upgrade water supply and sanitation systems
for dispersed rural hamlets and individual residences occupied by Quilombos and lacking
access to basic water supply and sanitation. It targeted approximately 3,750 families residing
in 150 localities in 52 municipalities. Since health benefits were unlikely to result the
improvement of infrastructure alone, the Subcomponent aimed to support also sanitary and
hygiene activities aimed at behavioral change.

                                  INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME INDICATORS

           Exceeded: 75% of targeted beneficiaries have knowledge of the importance of personal hygiene

                       Baseline: NA
                       Target: 75%
                       Actual: 123.5% (2009)

           Not Achieved: 75% of targeted beneficiaries have access to technologically appropriate water
           supply and sanitation

                       Target: 75%
                       Actual: 23.6% (2009)
     

This was the VIGISUS II Project's least successful Subcomponent, although some progress
was achieved in working directly with Quilombo communities. The Project was successful
in developing a model for investing in water supply and sanitation in these communities with
the inputs from the local population for developing sustainable models that will be assured
adequate maintenance. In all 67 Quilombo communities in three states were targeted for
activities related to promotion of knowledge relating to hygiene, and provision of input on
the design of community-responsive technical solutions for the supply of water and
sanitation. After conducting socio-environmental diagnostic studies that were needed to
obtain information that was not available in the local sanitation plans, works were initiated
and concluded in eight communities, comprising almost 900 families. Further promotion
activities and diagnostic studies were conducted in communities comprising an additional
3,745 families (exceeding the number of families that were targeted in the PAD) in early
2009, but because of delays due to issues with the contractor (related to the innovative aspect
of the stakeholder involvement in designing the most appropriate technological solution),
works were delayed. The engineering plans for the works in the remaining 67 communities
are ready, count on stakeholder input in their design, but construction is expected to begin in
2010. A workshop to define methodologies for sanitary and hygiene educational activities
targeted at Quilombos was carried out, and further workshops will be carried out in different
states to train representatives from the Quilombo communities to act as trainers in their
communities. Workshops to train the trainers have already been conducted in three states.
Because of the delays in implementation of this Subcomponent, the planned impact
evaluation of a completed sample of water and sanitation subprojects was not be carried out
under the Project.

    Component III: Project Management

    The project was managed by the Ministry of Health (MOH). The MOH has six Secretariats,
    one of which is the Secretariat of Health Surveillance (SVS), and two public Foundations,
    one of which is the National Health Foundation (FUNASA).

    SVS has six departments, of which five were closely involved in project implementation ­
    the Departments of Epidemiological Surveillance (DEVEP), Health Situation Analysis
    (DASIS), Health Surveillance Management (DAGVS), Environmental Health and Workers'
    Health Surveillance (DSAST), Epidemiology (CGDEP), and Surveillance, Prevention and
    Control of STI and AIDS (DST/AIDS), which is the main implementing agency of the
    AIDS-SUS project. A team of management specialists, reporting to SVS, was contracted to
    coordinate the Project's administrative activities, in coordination with the five departments
    involved in project management and implementation.

    A team of technical specialists, reporting to FUNASA's executive management, was also
    contracted to coordinate the Project's technical and administrative activities, in coordination
    with DESAI, the Department of Engineering and Public Health, the Department of
    Administration, and others within FUNASA.

    In addition to a change in the Minister of Health in 2006, throughout the Project's
    implementation, SVS had two Secretaries, and several changes in Department Directors; and
    FUNASA had three Presidents, four Directors of the Department of Indigenous Health
    (DESAI), and four Project Directors. In addition to managerial and structural changes in
    FUNASA in 2007, the contracting of professional and technical staff in both SVS and
    FUNASA, and also as health care delivery personnel on a contracted basis (as opposed to as
    Government employees) also affected staffing continuity. While bringing outsiders has
    shown benefits such as introducing new implementation approaches, it also has drawbacks in
    terms of continuity and retaining an institutional memory. Also, it resulted in periodic
    understaffing due to delays in bringing newly contracted staff on board.

    Component C financed the costs of management, supervision and monitoring of the Project's
    implementation, including the monitoring of activities of the several implementing agencies
    at the state, municipal and local levels, and of two implementing units, one each in SVS and
    in FUNASA, that were responsible for coordinating procurement, in some cases in
    coordination with external procurement agencies, disbursement and preparation of financial
    management reports, monitoring of information, and reporting to comply with the Bank's
    technical and fiduciary requirements, and coordinating with the Bank for purposes of loan
    supervision.

Annex 2 (c): National Health Surveillance Databases established under the VIGISUS
Project

The following national databases are generated by DATASUS in cooperation with the National
Epidemiology Center (CENEPI):
          SINASC: Birth Information System. Provides a significant contribution to data on
          births, including gender, place of birth, type of delivery and birth weight. Data is
          collected from Birth Certificates in all states since 1992.
          SIM: Mortality Information System. Provides information on cause, date, place and
          municipality of occurrence of death, as well as demographic and other information on
          the deceased. Data is collected from Death Certificates in all states and municipalities.
          The system allows for analysis of determinants of maternal, infant and fetal mortality
          and ill-defined causes of death, and for proposing measures of prevention and control.
          SINAN: Disease Notification Information System. SINAN provides information on all
          diseases of mandatory notification in Brazil.
          SIVEP: Health Surveillance Information System.
          SILAB: Laboratory Information System linked to SINAN was developed for acute
          flaccid paralysis (suspected case of polio) and yellow fever, and implemented in 20
          state labs.
          VIGITEL: Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. VIGITEL monitors the frequency and
          distribution of risk factors for NCDs in all capitals of the 26 Brazilian states and in the
          Federal District, through telephone interviews conducted in random samples of adults
          living in households served by fixed phone lines in each city.
          VIVA: A system to monitor violence and accidents was developed and established to
          understand the magnitude and extent of violence and accidents and their impact on
          mortality.
          PENSE: School-based Health Survey.
          SISAGUA: Water Surveillance Information System. Controls water quality in states
          and municipalities.
          VIGISOLO: Health Surveillance of populations exposed to contaminated soil.
          VIGIQUIM: Environmental health surveillance related to chemicals.
          WATCH: Environmental health surveillance, air quality.
          VIGIPEQ: Sentinel Surveillance of people exposed to chemical contaminants responds
          to the growing global concern regarding the potential risk raised by chemical
          contaminants.
          VIGIDESASTRES: Surveillance of natural disasters.

    Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

    The Project's economic and financial analysis prepared during preparation projected that it
    was expected to produce substantial savings for the health sector, primarily through
    reductions in hospitalization costs due to the reduced morbidity burden from better control of
    infectious diseases. Specifically, the Project's most important direct benefits were expected
    to be savings in hospitalization, through a lower dengue and malaria incidence rate, and an
    expected reduction in child and maternal mortality.

    An ex-post economic analysis has not been prepared. Still, public health programs are
    usually very efficient as they are generally based on evidence about cost-effective
    interventions and benefit from economies of scale, which results in significant benefits in
    terms of lives and resources saved. The economic analysis prepared in the course of
    preparation of Phase 3 of the APL for the Program, revealed that the project is expected to
    yield a net present value of benefits, after investment and recurrent costs, of about US$1.3
    billion, and produce an internal rate of return above 74 percent over a ten-year period. The
    actions proposed in Phase 3 are expected to produce substantial savings over the medium- to
    long-term, accruing primarily through reductions in morbidity and mortality rates due to
    communicable and non-communicable diseases and exposure to risk factors associated with
    ill health, as well as the corresponding savings in hospital costs, outpatient costs, and
    treatment costs.

    Similarly, there are several indicators that show that, despite exogenous events, the Project
    increased overall efficiency in the health system, through improved management practices,
    by reducing morbidity and by shifting the provision of care away from costly hospital-based
    care. Despite a previous increase in the number of malaria cases registered, as mentioned
    previously that number fell from a total of 603,532 cases in 2005 to 306,204 in 2008,
    representing a reduction of almost 48 percent in the number of registered cases and the
    lowest level in the past 26 years. Although maternal mortality rates have remained rather
    stable over the years, infant mortality rates have fallen steadily from about 22.6 per 1,000
    live births in 2004 to 20.0 per 1,000 live births in 2007. At the same time, the child mortality
    rate (under five) dropped from 26 per 1,000 in 2005 to 22 per 1,000 in 2008. Although
    expected efficiency improvements with respect to dengue, for example, did not materialize
    due to the unexpected outbreak, it is important to consider what would have occurred in a
    "without project" scenario. As it was, SVS is in a much better position to respond to such
    outbreaks. SVS was able to follow up on 63 percent of the notified cases of dengue in 2007,
    and a survey showed good knowledge about dengue among the population. Similarly, the
    institutional strengthening of SVS under the Project put it in a strong position to respond
    immediately to the threat of the AH1N1 Influenza outbreak in 2009.

    Finally, by introducing performance-based mechanisms into the transfer of federal resources
    to state and municipalities, and into FUNASA's contracting process, the Project promoted
    efficiency improvements in the allocation of resources for surveillance and indigenous health
    programs.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Permanent consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries of the health care system are
built into Brazil's health care monitoring system and carried out periodically. The "social
control" councils are the key venues utilized by civil society and users of public services to
discuss issues related to quality of services.

In the health sector, Health Councils include representatives of managers, users, health
professionals, service providers. Health Councils exist at the local, municipal, state and
national levels. There is also Bipartite (State level) and Tripartite Commissions (National
level), with participation of managers only.

For Indigenous Health, the mechanism is the same, but the institutional arrangement is
different. Demands discussed at the Local Indigenous Health Councils (CLSI) are reported
to the District Indigenous Health Councils (CONDISI). Four times a year, the Presidents of
the 34 DSEI meet in the Permanent Forum of Presidents of CONDISI. The forum is
consultative, propositional and analytical. The main aim of the forum is to enforce the norms
of SUS, particularly those specific to the national policy of Indigenous Health. Finally, the
highest forum is the Inter-sectoral Commission of Indigenous Health (CISI).

Indigenous Health Plans represent a forum for permanent consultations with stakeholders and
beneficiaries of health care, and therefore, are prepared following a bottom-up approach were
needs are identified and discussed at the Local Indigenous Health Councils, and reported to
the District Indigenous Health Councils which include representatives of the indigenous
groups, government agencies, NGOs and universities.

A technical document summarizing Permanent Forums of the Presidents of the Councils of
Indigenous Health Districts (CONDISI) between 2005 and 2009 was prepared by FUNASA.
It includes technical as well as political and social issues discussed in the Fourth National
Conference of Indigenous Health and 13th National Health Conference of October 2009. The
main issues discussed were: (a) the establishment of the Special Secretariat of Indigenous
Health (SESAI) and the National Council of Indigenous Peoples (CNPI); (b) autonomy of the
DSEIs, and creation of special account for Indigenous health care; (c) governance and social
control strategies and the need to warrant participation of indigenous representatives in the
Municipal and State Councils; (d) the need to recognize professional services of indigenous
health care workers; and (d) contracting of human resources at the DSEI level.

As part of an effort to develop the Indigenous Health Models that respond to the needs of
indigenous people, a series of consultations have been carried out by FUNASA in recent
years in the context of the implementation of the VIGISUS II Project and of the preparation
of the VIGISUS III Project. The topics of these consultations included issues related to
health management systems, institutional assessment, consultations with DSEI boards,
workshops on Health Care Models, etc. FUNASA systematized results to propose guidelines
for management and provision of health care to different ethnic groups.

    The challenges of the healthcare model for indigenous continue to be to provide: (i) access to
    a health care provider (ex.: to an AIS or health team, even by radio, involving less than 4
    hours walking distance or transport), (ii) comprehensive healthcare, (iii) ethical and cultural
    acceptance and adaptation of services, (iv) permanent education of the AISs and (v)
    responses to the need for investments in infrastructure, means of transport and
    communication. Some of the new challenges identified by DSEI staff are: (i) implementation
    of health policy for rural indigenous and forest peoples; (ii) training of human resources to
    accept new challenges; (iii) distribution and retention of qualified staff in the Amazon region;
    and (iv) maintenance of water quality levels to sustain healthy populations.

    A CONDISI Conference discussed the proposed design of VIGISUS III in December 2009.
    Some suggestions were to: (i) discuss project implementation regionally during the
    implementation period; (ii) create a mechanism of dissemination of Project data to the
    CONDISI and Forums; (iii) ensure the new project includes a publication of project
    developments; (iv) ensure civil works respond to technical criteria instead of political criteria
    in support of the poorest areas; (v) maintain the indigenous community-based subprojects,
    allow the DSEI to participate in project selection, and publish the evaluation and selection
    criteria of community-based subprojects; and (vi) ensure VIGISUS III invests in training of
    indigenous people; train social control council members on legislation and functioning of the
    Brazilian Government; and disseminate information on recipients of training.

    Additionally, in March 2010 FUNASA carried out a workshop with Indigenous Women's
    Organizations, at the Casa do Indio, and at the World Bank office in Brasilia. Those present
    represented several DSEIs, women's organizations, FUNASA's DESAI, and other women
    leaders from Manaus, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Acre, among others. Indigenous women want
    to be represented in the CONDISI, and made several recommendations for primary and
    secondary health care to be culturally adapted. Maternal and child health care needs a boost
    and development of protocols based on scientific evidence and culturally appropriate
    mechanisms. Recognition of traditional nutritional and therapeutic practices will be
    important for VIGISUS III, as certain traditional practices (ex. vertical birth, prenatal and
    postnatal practices, as well as feeding habits for children <1 year old, <5 year old) are still
    being used at local levels.

    Indigenous health care models were posted on FUNASA's website for consultation. All
    municipal, district and state councils are required to monitor the health of the persons in their
    jurisdictions, submit financial statements and render accounts. Aide-memoires of the
    Council meetings are disclosed on MOH's and on FUNASA's webpages.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Secretaria do Vigilância em Saúde - SVS

O presente Resumo Executivo refere-se ao Componente I do projeto VIGISUS II ­
Modernização do Sistema Nacional de Vigilância em Saúde - cujo objetivo central foi o de
"fortalecer o Sistema de Vigilância em Saúde para reduzir a mortalidade e a morbidade de
doenças transmissíveis e não transmissíveis, bem como a exposição a fatores de risco associados
com a saúde". Sua concepção, que ocorreu de 2003 a 2005, se deu no contexto do processo de
descentralização das ações de Vigilância em Saúde, que passaram a ser compartilhadas entre as
três esferas de governo, de forma coerente com os princípios e diretrizes do Sistema Único de
Saúde (SUS). Processo esse que enfrentou grandes desafios à sua consolidação, decorrentes,
principalmente: da dificuldade de se estabelecer, com precisão, as atribuições e responsabilidades
de cada esfera de governo; da estruturação adequada do sistema de vigilância; e da dotação de
pessoal capaz de responder com qualidade e oportunamente às demandas.

Além da descentralização, a área de vigilância enfrentava, naquela ocasião, outro desafio:
ampliar seu escopo de intervenção da vigilância das doenças transmissíveis, tradicionalmente
referida como Vigilância Epidemiológica e Controle de Doenças, com a adoção da Vigilância em
Saúde (VS), que passa a simbolizar uma nova abordagem, ao incluir a vigilância de doenças
transmissíveis, a vigilância das doenças e agravos não transmissíveis e seus fatores de risco, a
vigilância ambiental em saúde e a vigilância da situação de saúde.

Esses dois fatores foram fortalecidos pela reestruturação organizacional do órgão federal
responsável pela gestão das ações de vigilância em saúde. Em 2003, foi criada, no âmbito do
Ministério da Saúde, a Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde (SVS), originada do Centro Nacional
de Epidemiologia (Cenepi), que integrava a Fundação Nacional de Saúde (Funasa).

Consequentemente, todas essas mudanças organizacionais e conceituais passaram a demandar a
revisão do modelo de gestão e de financiamento da VS e das práticas adotadas pelos serviços de
saúde, exigindo a capacitação e reestruturação dos três níveis de governo ­ federal, estadual e
municipal ­ para a nova forma de atuação.

A Fase II do Projeto VIGISUS passou a desempenhar uma função estratégica nesse contexto,
apoiando diferentes aspectos, tanto no nível central, como em estados e municípios, desde a
estruturação de área física (construções, reformas e aquisição de equipamentos); a capacitação de
recursos humanos, com a implantação e implementação da Rede de Formação de Recursos
Humanos em Vigilância em Saúde, envolvendo cursos de Mestrado e Especialização; a
realização de treinamentos; a contratação de consultorias (pessoas físicas e jurídicas) qualificadas
nas várias áreas da Vigilância em Saúde, em especial voltadas para a formulação de protocolos
de atuação, de sistemáticas e mecanismos de gestão, com ênfase no monitoramento e avaliação
das ações; a implantação de estruturação da Rede de Emergência em Saúde Públicas. A Saúde
Ambiental, a vigilância das doenças não transmissíveis, as atividades de promoção da saúde e a
implantação de novas metodologias e instrumentos de análise da situação de saúde foram
estruturadas no âmbito do Projeto.



                                                64 
                                                  
                                                 
    

É importante registrar que desde o ano de 2003, início das negociações e da concepção da Fase
II, até o final do Projeto, em dezembro de 2009, muitas mudanças de caráter político, normativo,
organizacional, além de avanços técnicos e científicos, ocorreram no âmbito do Sistema Único
de Saúde (SUS), incluindo a Vigilância em Saúde. Em decorrência, a formatação original do
Projeto foi impactada, provocando modificações em alguns compromissos firmados.

Como exemplo, cita-se o Programa "Mais Saúde: Direito de Todos", também conhecido como
Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento para a Saúde ­ PAC-Saúde, foi lançado em dezembro
de 2007, pelo Governo Federal, contemplando 74 medidas e 171 ações. O objetivo do programa
é aprofundar e atualizar os grandes objetivos da criação do SUS, agregando novos desafios e
dimensões para que os objetivos de universalidade, equidade e integralidade possam se
concretizar.

Por meio desse Programa, o Governo Federal visa vincular os recursos da saúde a metas
definidas com estados e municípios, na concepção de um modelo de gestão para resultados. Com
metas ambiciosas e desafiadoras, o Programa inova na maneira de pensar a gestão em saúde,
visando o aprimoramento da qualidade dos serviços oferecidos à população e o atendimento de
necessidade, com a ampliação da rede de assistência, qualificação da atenção básica, expansão
das estratégias de atenção às urgências e emergências, redução do gasto da população com
medicamentos, aumento da lista de vacinas oferecidas pelo SUS, entre outros resultados
esperados. E, nesse sentido, o Projeto VIGISUS II compartilhou e reforçou as iniciativas
empreendidas pelo Programa.

Implementação

O Componente I possuia 4 subcomponentes, cuja implementação será detalhada a seguir.

Subcomponente A ­ Vigilância Epidemiológica e Controle de Doenças Transmissíveis. Este
subcomponente apoiou a estruturação de um sistema de vigilância epidemiológica e controle de
doenças e agravos descentralizado, qualificado a lidar com os problemas de saúde com base na
realidade epidemiológica de cada área geográfica, priorizando os grupos populacionais mais
vulneráveis, tendo como suporte um sistema de notificação compulsória sensível, funcionando de
forma hierárquica e com capacidade de comunicação horizontal e vertical.

As principais áreas estratégicas trabalhadas por este subcomponente foram: Sistema de
Laboratórios de Saúde Pública; Sistema de telecomunicação de manejo de dados; Informações
sobre a vigilância e controle de doenças transmissíveis; Vigilância hospitalar; Controle das
doenças transmitidas por vetores; Capacidade de manejo e habilidade em responder às
emergências. Dentre os resultados alcançados, no âmbito do projeto, é importante ressaltar:

       a ampliação da rede laboratorial NB3, com a aquisição de equipamento e construção e
       reformas de áreas físicas; ampliação da capacidade diagnóstica com a implantação de
       laboratórios de biologia molecular; qualificação da rede de laboratórios de saúde pública,
       com o desenvolvimento de normas e padrões laboratoriais, com a criação de sistemas de
       credenciamento e certificação dos laboratórios e com a implantação de modelo regular de
       financiamento;


                                               65 
                                                 
                                                 
    

       o aperfeiçoamento do Sistema de Informações de Agravos de Notificação (SINAN), com
       o desenvolvimento e implantação do SinanNet, revisão das rotinas de operação e do fluxo
       de alimentação de dados, análise e limpeza do banco de dados, ampliação dos registros
       do sistema, como, por exemplo, a introdução no Sinan de uma variável para o registro da
       entrada do paciente na estratégia DOTS, pelo serviço de saúde, para monitorar os
       pacientes com tuberculose;
       a consolidação do Programa de Treinamento em Epidemiologia de Campo (Episus) e a
       estruturação do Centro de Informações Estratégicas e Respostas em Vigilância em Saúde
       (CIEVS), responsável pelo monitoramento e investigação de eventos classificados como
       emergência em saúde pública;
       a ampliação da cobertura vacinal e a redução da desigualdade de cobertura entre os
       municípios brasileiros.

Subcomponente B ­ Vigilância Ambiental em Saúde. O Projeto VIGISUS possibilitou, ao
Departamento de Vigilância em Saúde Ambiental e Saúde do Trabalhador (DSAST), estruturar e
consolidar o Subsistema Nacional de Vigilância em Saúde Ambiental, de forma descentralizada.
Nos últimos cinco anos, foram inúmeros os avanços relacionados aos programas coordenados
pelo DSAST, com a ampliação da atuação dos diversos subsistemas (água para consumo
humano; qualidade do ar; solo contaminado; substâncias químicas; desastres
naturais/antropogênicos; acidentes com produtos perigosos; fatores físicos; e ambiente de
trabalho).

Durante a vigência do Projeto, a Vigilância em Saúde Ambiental ­ VSA se desenvolveu de forma
progressiva nos três níveis de gestão do SUS, com estágios de estruturação diferenciados, de
acordo com as diversidades loco regionais. Os estados se encontram em um estágio de estruturação
mais avançado que as capitais, desenvolvendo principalmente ações do VIGIAGUA, VIGISOLO e
VIGIAR. Recentemente, as ações de vigilância relacionadas a desastres ­ VIGIDESASTRES - têm
apresentado inúmeros avanços.

As principais atividades desenvolvidas, que criaram condições para o sucesso alcançado, foram:
realização de capacitações, assessorias técnicas, apoio à pesquisa, estruturação de laboratórios de
baixa complexidade e laboratórios de referência para saúde ambiental e reuniões técnicas. Outro
importante fator de indução para o avanço progressivo da implantação das atividades de VSA nas
secretarias de saúde dos estados, Distrito Federal e municípios, foi a incorporação de indicadores
relacionados aos subsistemas água, solo e ar, nos processos de pactuação da Vigilância em Saúde.

Subcomponente C ­ Análise de Situação de Saúde e vigilância de doenças e agravos não
transmissíveis. Este subcomponente foi gerenciado pelo Departamento de Análise da Situação
de Saúde (DASIS), da Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde. Ele esteve voltado para o
desenvolvimento e aprimoramento dos sistemas de informação de mortalidade e nascidos vivos e
a produção de análise de situação de saúde; para a implementação da Política Nacional de
Promoção da Saúde e de ações de vigilância e prevenção de doenças e agravos não
transmissíveis.

Dentre as atividades implementadas no âmbito do VIGISUS II, destacaram-se:



                                               66 
                                                 
                                                 
    

       desenvolvimento de módulo de investigação de óbitos maternos e de mulheres em idade
       fértil independente da causa, totalmente integrado com os módulos tradicionais de
       informação da ocorrência dos óbitos do SIM;
       capacitação de cerca de 1.500 profissionais em metodologia e instrumentos de análise de
       dados, epidemiologia e organização de serviço;
       desenvolvimento uma ferramenta voltada para o geoprocessamento, com vistas a análises
       espaciais, com módulos de cálculo de dados, inserção de novos indicadores e
       gerenciamento da base cartográfica;
       realização de inquéritos e pesquisas e publicação regular de informações em saúde.
       realização de cursos a distância voltados para a vigilância das doenças não transmissíveis
       e para o impacto da violência na saúde, capacitando mais de 1.500 profissionais;
       promoção de atividades voltadas para a promoção da saúde, com ênfase nas atividades
       físicas, incluindo o estudo sobre impacto das iniciativas desse campo;
       implementação de ações voltadas para a redução da violência no trânsito e
       desenvolvimento e implementação do sistema VIVA para melhor conhecimento da
       dimensão dos acidentes em geral, seja de trânsito, de trabalho, doméstico, quedas,
       queimaduras, afogamentos, intoxicações, e para identificar a violência doméstica e
       sexual, que ainda permanece "oculta" na esfera do privado, principalmente os maus tratos
       contra crianças, adolescentes, mulheres e pessoas idosas;
       monitoramento contínuo da frequência e distribuição de fatores de risco para doenças
       crônicas em todas as capitais dos 26 estados brasileiros e no Distrito Federal, por meio de
       entrevistas telefônicas - VIGITEL

Subcomponente D ­ Fortalecimento Institucional da Capacidade de Gestão em Vigilância
em Saúde nos Estados e Municípios Elegíveis. O Subcomponente contribuiu para o
fortalecimento da gestão de estados e municípios, na perspectiva do avanço do processo de
descentralização do Sistema Nacional em Vigilância em Saúde (SNVS), mediante apoio técnico
e financiamento de ações definidas a partir de prioridades identificadas por aqueles entes
federados.

Participaram desse subcomponente 27 Secretarias Estaduais de Saúde, incluindo o Distrito
Federal, 25 capitais e 144 municípios, para os quais foram transferidos R$ 91.754.027,06, no
período de 2005 a novembro de 2009, sendo 76,46% provenientes do Banco Mundial e 23,54%
da União. Do valor total repassado, o Sistema de Planejamento e Informação do VIGISUS
(SPIV) registrou 89,84% como recurso financeiro executado. Em relação à execução dos
recursos do BIRD, 94,65% foram informados como gastos.

Por meio desse subcomponente foi possível apoiar as estruturas de vigilância em saúde das
secretarias estaduais com vistas ao aprimoramento da capacidade de coordenação do SNVS em
cada Unidade Federada; ampliar a capacidade técnico-operacional de estados e municípios com o
propósito de fortalecer o processo de decisão-ação e de desenvolvimento das atividades de rotina
e especiais, de vigilância epidemiológica e controle de doenças transmissíveis; melhorar a
qualidade e ampliar o escopo das atividades de vigilância ambiental desenvolvidas nos níveis
estadual e local; implementar sistemas estaduais e locais de monitoramento de doenças crônicas
não transmissíveis e ampliar a capacidade de realização de análise de situação de saúde com
vistas a aprimorar a programação e a escolha das intervenções prioritárias, de acordo com os

problemas de saúde regionais e locais; e implementar o uso de sistemas de informação no âmbito
dos estados e municípios.

Rede de Formação de Recursos Humanos em Vigilância em Saúde ­ RFRH-VS. A Rede de
Formação de Recursos Humanos em Vigilância em Saúde ­ RFRH-VS foi uma das estratégias
adotadas pela Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde, do Ministério da Saúde, para a estruturação do
Sistema Nacional de Vigilância em Saúde no que concerne ao desenvolvimento de recursos
humanos. Seu objetivo foi a formação de profissionais que atuam nos serviços de vigilância,
prevenção e controle de doenças, nas três esferas de governo, sendo resultado de um amplo
processo de pactuação com as instituições de ensino superior do país, quando foram
estabelecidas parcerias entre as instituições acadêmicas. Por meio dessa estratégia buscou-se o
aprimoramento da produção de conhecimentos em epidemiologia nos serviços de saúde,
mediante o oferecimento de cursos de pós-graduação - lato e stricto sensu ­ especializações e
mestrados profissionais - com prioridade para as regiões Norte, Nordeste e Centro-oeste.

Fizeram adesão a RFRH-VS 66 instituições de ensino superior de todas as regiões do Brasil,
encontrando-se envolvidas 34 instituições para o oferecimento de 17 cursos de especialização e
11 mestrados profissionais (6 com recursos do Tesouro Nacional). Foram capacitados, em cursos
de especialização - 381 técnicos (17 cursos) e em cursos de mestrado profissional ­ 114 (5
cursos). Noventa e três por cento dos cursos foram sediados em unidades federadas das regiões
Norte, Centro-oeste e Nordeste e 94% da clientela têm origem nessas regiões. Apenas 2 cursos
(7%), uma especialização e um mestrado, estavam sediados nas regiões Sudeste e Sul,
respectivamente.

Indicadores

Para o Projeto VIGISUS II, foram definidos 5 indicadores de gatilho e 17 indicadores de
desempenho, todos com metas estabelecidas para cada ano do Projeto. Considerando o último
ano do Projeto (2009), o cumprimento das metas ocorreu em 100%, no primeiro caso, e em
64,70%, no segundo, conforme quadro a seguir.

Finalmente, diante da importância e do volume das atividades realizadas, dos percentuais de
indicadores de gatilho e de desempenho que atingiram as metas estabelecidas e do percentual do
valor total do empréstimo utilizado, que foi de 85%, a Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde
considera que os objetivos do Projeto VIGISUS II foram plenamente alcançados, o que reforça a
pertinência da implementação da Fase III, de forma a consolidar as ações implementadas.

Fundação Nacional de Saúde - FUNASA

Nos 5 anos de desenvolvimento da segunda fase do Projeto VIGISUS sob a responsabilidade da
Fundação Nacional de Saúde, foram alcançadas diversas mudanças institucionais. O
Componente II do VIGISUS foi concebido para estruturar o Subsistema de Saúde Indígena em
quase todas as suas demandas e especificidades. Já a partir da sua primeira fase (1999-2004), o
Projeto estava voltado para dar suporte e produzir o conhecimento necessário para o
funcionamento da atenção básica de saúde dos povos indígenas do país.

Esta segunda fase, iniciada no final de 2004, foi marcada pela ampliação dos objetivos do
Projeto, que se tornaram mais ousados a partir da boa execução da primeira etapa. Os três
subcomponentes dedicados à Saúde Indígena refletem o aumento da complexidade no tipo de
conhecimento necessário para lidar com um sistema de saúde dedicado a populações tão
específicas e sob diversas situações sociais, em todas as regiões do país. Para alcançar os
resultados que serão descritos a seguir, o orçamento previsto foi ampliado de US$ 8,000,000.00
da primeira fase do Projeto, para US$ 50,000,000.00, nesta segunda fase. Por fim, no processo de
ampliação da complexidade do VIGISUS na fase II, foi incluído um subcomponente dedicado à
inovação tecnológica e sustentável do saneamento em comunidades remanescentes de
quilombos, que é uma das missões da Funasa.

O VIGISUS Funasa manteve a direção, iniciada na primeira etapa, de estruturação física do
Subsistema de Saúde Indígena, com atividades de construção de postos de saúde em aldeias,
pólos-base administrativos para organizar os serviços e Casas de Saúde Indígena, que dão o
suporte aos pacientes atendidos na rede de referencia dos municípios. No total foram 116
unidades construídas e equipadas. O Projeto também atuou na compra de equipamentos para os
Agentes Indígenas de Saúde, barcos e motores para transportede equipes e pacientes, e
equipamentos para vigilância nutricional.

Dada a pouca idade do Subsistema de Saúde Indígena, a sua estruturação física é uma atividade
extremamente necessária para a execução da atenção básica. Os desafios deste tipo de ação em
geral estão relacionados com as diferentes condições dos Distritos Sanitários Especiais
Indígenas, muitos deles com aldeias de difícil acesso, por meio de estradas mal conservadas, de
rios extensos, ou de pistas de pouso precárias no meio da selva amazônica. O atendimento à
saúde indígena necessita, portanto, de infra-estrutura adequada e diferenciada.

Da mesma maneira, o Projeto atuou na formação de recursos humanos adequados para o
atendimento básico de saúde nos Distritos Sanitários. Foram capacitadas um total de 540 equipes
básicas de saúde, incluindo médicos, enfermeiros, auxiliares de enfermagem, odontólogos e
agentes indígenas de saúde. A capacitação de mão-de-obra é uma necessidade constante do
Subsistema de Saúde Indígena, devido à dificuldade de atuação e de contratação dos
profissionais de saúde. O Projeto contribuiu, com capacitações nos mais diversos temas, para
minimizar os efeitos da grande rotatividade de mão-de-obra que caracteriza a atenção básica aos
índios.

Um outro resultado importante foi a estruturação, por meio das atividades realizadas do
VIGISUS, do controle social do Subsistema de Saúde Indígena, previsto na legislação do


                                              69 
                                                
                                                                     
     

Sistema Único de Saúde (do qual faz parte o SSI) e parte fundamental para o aprimoramento da
extensão e da qualidade dos serviços. Os membros dos conselhos Distritais de Saúde receberam
treinamentos e foi estruturado o Fórum de Presidentes dos Conselhos Distritais de Saúde
Indígena (Condisi), composto por indígenas escolhidos por representantes das comunidades para
dialogar com a direção da Funasa sobre os desafios do Subsistema. O aumento de participação
dos presidentes dos Condisi em reuniões com diretores e com o presidente da Funasa nestes
cinco últimos anos é um reflexo direto da atividade de fomento do Projeto.

O conjunto de atividades de capacitação e estruturação física do Subsistema de Saúde Indígena
refletiu-se na melhoria de indicadores de saúde, alguns deles indicadores do próprio Projeto. A
meta de extensão da cobertura do esquema completo de vacinas para 60% da população
indígena, por exemplo, foi extrapolada obtendo-se uma cobertura de 73,9% ao final do Projeto.
No mesmo sentido, não somente a meta de aumento em 30% dos casos de tuberculose tratados
sob terapia assistida (DOTS) foi atingida como o número de novos casos de TB manteve
tendência de queda baixando de 617 em 2004 para 245 em 2009.

No entanto, os resultados do Projeto VIGISUS ­ Funasa alcançaram também outro objetivo geral
diferente da estruturação física e da capacidade da mão-de-obra para a saúde indígena: todos os
subcomponentes do Projeto tiveram como meta a produção de conhecimento específico
adequado para o cumprimento da diretriz do Subsistema de Saúde Indígena: a execução de um
serviço de atenção básica diferenciada de saúde para as populações indígenas. No termo
"diferenciada" reside o maior desafio do trabalho da Funasa. Isso significa tornar o serviço de
saúde capaz de ser eficiente sob a diversidade de condições geográficas, sociais, culturais e
epidemiológicas. O Projeto possuiu a característica de promover a geração de conhecimento
específico para o aprimoramento do Subsistema de Saúde Indígena, nas suas mais diversas áreas,
ajudando a Funasa, absorvida nas atividades permanentes e demandas emergenciais de atuação, a
poder criar soluções necessárias para a melhoria das condições e da qualidade de sua ação.

Tratou-se, fundamentalmente, de refletir, propor, e atuar de forma inovadora para criar na
instituição o conhecimento necessário para atender à complexidade do desafio da Funasa. Isto foi
realizado em todas as áreas do projeto:

Os modelos de Atenção, Gestão, Organização, Financiamento e Monitoramento da Saúde
Indígena foram analisados e foram propostos aperfeiçoamentos para superar desafios já bastante
conhecidos dos trabalhadores e beneficiários do Subsistema de Saúde Indígena. Após 10 anos de
funcionamento do Subsistema, o Projeto VIGISUS propiciou a oportunidade de realização de um
diagnóstico e de propostas de melhoria dos modelos existentes.

O Projeto estruturou a área de Nutrição e Alimentação Indígena da Funasa, que não existia
antes de 2004. A meta de construção de um Sistema de Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional
Indígena foi extrapolada, com o treinamento de equipes em todos os 34 Distritos, formação
profissional 7 , compra de equipamentos e realização do Primeiro Inquérito Alimentar e
Nutricional dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil, que forneceu um quadro da situação nutricional dos

  - Os cursos de especialização e aperfeiçoamento em Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional Indígena formaram um
total de 451 alunos.


                                                                   70 
                                                                     
                                                 
    

indígenas do país. Atualmente, a Funasa responde por diversas ações ligadas à nutrição indígena,
como organização de distribuição de cestas de alimentos, programas de suplementação de
vitaminas e ferro, e expansão da cobertura do Sistema de Vigilância Alimentar e Nutricional
Indígena (SISVAN). Após 5 anos do VIGISUS, a Saúde Indígena conta com uma rede
estruturada de profissionais treinados para recolher informação nutricional, sistematizar e
planejar respostas locais para atender às necessidades, junto a outros órgãos do governo. Após 5
anos de atuação, o processo de construção do SISVAN Indígena saiu da inexistência do serviço
para 28 Distritos Sanitários e 5 Coordenações Regionais enviando regularmente dados do estado
nutricional de crianças menores que 5 anos, perfazendo um total de 36.246 crianças indígenas
acompanhadas.

No mesmo sentido, a segunda fase do VIGISUS inovou ao produzir as de Atenção Integral à
Saúde Mental Indígena (Portaria 2759/2007 do Ministério da Saúde) e ao formar uma rede de
profissionais capacitados para elaboração de estratégias que consideram a especificidade cultural
para o enfrentamento de desafios como altas taxas de suicídios e de abuso de álcool e outras
drogas. A partir de uma série de estudos e pesquisas com intervenções locais, iniciadas já na
primeira fase do VIGISUS e expandidas na segunda fase, o Projeto produziu um corpo de
conhecimentos e um enfoque institucional para atuação neste complexo campo da atenção
básica. Atualmente, 34 etnias contam com trabalho continuado em prevenção e redução de danos
do abuso de álcool e outra drogas.

Outra necessidade específica do Subsistema é a elaboração de possibilidades de diálogo entre os
saberes médicos do serviço oficial de saúde com os saberes e as medicinas próprias dos povos
indígenas. O desafio de realizar atenção integral e diferenciada em populações culturalmente
distintas está relacionado à certeza de que a simples extensão dos serviços médicos oferecidos à
população brasileira para os grupos indígenas significa perda de eficiência e pode significar um
aumento dos problemas gerados pelo contraste de valores, hábitos, e de diferentes interpretações
dos fenômenos ligados à saúde e às doenças. Portanto, um dos desafios do Subsistema é
fomentar o diálogo intercultural para valorizar os saberes indígenas e aprimorar o serviço de
atenção básica, melhorando sua eficiência. A partir de uma série de pesquisas combinadas com
intervenções locais, foi possível avançar no conhecimento sobre a especificidade cultural que o
Subsistema de Saúde Indígena deve ter para nortear sua atividade. O trabalho realizado de
produção de conhecimento sobre as possibilidades de articulação entre os sistemas médicos
tradicionais e os sistema oficial envolveu 12 DSEIs ao longo dos 5 anos de Projeto.

No caso da elaboração de estratégias culturalmente adequadas de promoção à saúde para o
Subsistema, o Projeto trabalhou com uma ação inovadora que consistiu no financiamento de
projetos comunitários na área da saúde propostos e executados por comunidades indígenas. Os
149 projetos comunitários realizados abarcaram 32 dos 34 Distritos Sanitários. Os projetos
trataram de diversos temas, como saúde mental, melhoria nas condições nutricionais, valorização
dos saberes indígenas de saúde, proteção à saúde (doenças sexualmente transmissíveis, por
exemplo) e valorização das organizações de mulheres indígenas. Os resultados foram muito
amplos: além do empoderamento das comunidades indígenas envolvidas na atividades de
promoção a sua saúde e da capacitação dos beneficiários e executores na administração dos
projetos, muitos projetos de sucesso se demonstraram estratégias efetivas de promoção à saúde
nas aldeias envolvendo as equipes dos Distritos Sanitários e índios. Neste sentido, os projetos

comunitários indígenas geraram um aprendizado institucional importante em sua inovação nas
estratégias de promoção à saúde.

O Componente II, como já foi mencionado, contou com um tema distinto da saúde indígena, mas
alinhado com as atividades da Funasa, qual seja o da elaboração de estratégias de intervenção
em saneamento ambiental em comunidades quilombolas com alta participação comunitária
gerando maior sustentabilidade dos sistemas instalados. Embora não tenha sido possível a
realização de todas as obras planejadas, o Projeto logrou a produção de uma metodologia que
reúne de forma inédita a elaboração dos projetos de engenharia com a participação das
comunidades no planejamento das soluções adequadas para os sistemas. Esta metodologia
permitirá à Funasa atuar de forma mais efetiva em relação ao saneamento das comunidades
quilombolas.

Os cinco anos da segunda fase do VIGISUS ­ Funasa produziram, portanto, grande parte dos
resultados esperados no desenho original do Projeto. O seu conteúdo serviu também para testar
as capacidades institucionais de atuar com inovações, absorvendo idéias novas e transformando-
as em sistemas e procedimentos. Como projeto inovador, o VIGISUS também testou os limites
de institucionalização do conhecimento produzido e de execução de atividades fora da rotina.
Neste sentido, a segunda fase do Projeto consistiu em uma importante oportunidade de
aprendizado institucional, percorrendo desde as equipes locais de saúde e os indígenas até a
administração da Funasa em Brasília. O Projeto produziu uma ação no subsistema de Saúde
Indígena que se traduziu na ampliação e aperfeiçoamento da atenção básica.
A terceira fase do VIGISUS deverá trabalhar com um Subsistema de Saúde Indígena diferente
do que o encontrado pela segunda fase. Mais complexo, devido à ampliação dos serviços
executados, com um controle social mais intenso e organizado, e, finalmente, com maior
conhecimento acumulado. Sem dúvida, para os próximos anos existem muito desafios a serem
superados pelo Subsistema de Saúde Indígena. No entanto, a melhoria das taxas dos indicadores
de saúde indígena e os aperfeiçoamentos dos serviços prestados apontam que o caminho seguido
pela Funasa nestes 10 anos de Subsistema e de VIGISUS está no caminho correto.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


The VIGISUS II project was critical for development of infrastructure, expertise and actions
of many aspects of disease prevention and control in Brazil, especially environmental health
and chronic disease prevention. In 2003, we implemented an assessment of surveillance
activities in Brazil using survey data from representative states: Sao Paulo, Pernambuco,
Parana and Goias. We used a sample of 47 key interviewees to evaluate proper surveillance
functioning using scores for many domains (3), sub-domains (12) and capacities (17).
Results clearly showed acceptable levels of surveillance infrastructure (>= 80% of expected),
prevention and control activities for all infectious diseases domains despite need for some
improvements. It also showed unacceptably low levels of infrastructure and activities
(<=50%) in all domains of public health surveillance, disease prevention and control of
environmentally related and non-infectious diseases.
Fast forward to 2009, a similar assessment would have provided contrasting findings and
highlighted importance of project funding. Amongst the many features of Brazil surveillance
and disease control programs mostly funded by the project, I would highlight a: (i) fully
fledged surveillance of chronic disease risk factors for adults (VIGITEL since 2007) and
adolescents (PENSE since 2009) in all capitals; (ii) fully fledged surveillance of
environmental determinants of health in the water, air, soil and man-made disasters
(VIGIAGUA, VIGIAR, VIGISOLO, VIGIDISASTRE) all available in the internet; (iii) fully
fledged injury and violence surveillance system as well as injury-violence prevention
programs in most states; (iv) fully fledged health promotion program with funded
interventions to increase population levels of physical activities in over 800 municipalities;
(v) implemented first evaluations of physical activity health promotion programs in Latin
America (e.g. Curitiba Ativa e Academia da Cidade-Recife) and can now make clear
recommendations for program investments; (vi)) built organizational and physical
infrastructure of DSEIS in Brazil, while increasing its functionality with prevention and
control activities now between 50% (pre-natal care) and 100% (children with malnutrition
receiving are) of indigenous population ; (vii) palpable and measurable improvements in the
completion and quality of public health surveillance based on mortality data (88% SIM
coverage; >=90% of deaths notified); and (viii) ability to coordinate across all Brazilian
capitals population protection response to health threats due to emerging infectious and
environmental agents through the CIEVs and hospital-based infectious disease detection
units.
These structural, functional and at times attitudinal changes are having and will continue to
have a tremendous impact on the health of the Brazilian population for many years.
However, disease based indicators will not capture the full impact of these investments and
changes. Though the development of health promotion and prevention strategies will exert its
main effects on Brazilian's health, it will do so only after a long induction period, as is
typical of non-infectious diseases and conditions.              A truly performance-based
implementation of VIGISUS II, with output indicators linked to infrastructure and
functionality of a basic public health networks in infectious and non-infectious disease
prevention and control would have better captured the real impact of investments. I strongly
