1.  Country and Sector Background 
Brazil has made great strides in improving health outcomes over the last decade, reducing infant 
mortality from 48 per thousand births in 1990 to 30 in 2000. Despite achievements Brazil under-
performs other countries at similar income levels. This situation results in part to large and 
persistent health status disparities among regions and racial groups. With an infant mortality 
rates of 34 and 44 per 1000 births, the North and Northeast significantly trail the South and 
Southeast regions; the latter registering rates 17 and 21 respectively. Infant mortality rates for 
indigenous and Afro-descendent populations, particularly those residing in rural and isolated 
areas, are  three-to- five times the national average. In addition to long-standing public health 
problems related to infectious and communicable diseases, especially diarrhea, malaria, 
tuberculosis and other endemic diseases, which disproportionately affect the poor, non-
communicable diseases have become the leading cause of death with cardiovascular diseases, 
injuries and cancer accounting for nearly two-thirds of all deaths. Closing the equity gap while 
addressing the increased burden of degenerative diseases is the principal challenge facing the 
Brazilian health system. 
 
The new government has placed poverty reduction at the top of the policy agenda, committing 
itself to reduce inequities in the access to and quality of social services, as specified in the its 
four-year plan (
Plano Brasil de Todos
,
2003).  High priority social initiatives include programs 
to eradicate hunger (
Fome Zero
), unify existing cash transfer programs (
Bolsa Familia
)
and 
generate employment opportunities for youth (
Primeiro Emprego
). Nonetheless, the government 
is strongly committed to continue support for and expansion of on-going health programs (e.g. 
Family Health) and reforms (e.g., decentralization and resource allocation), but with an increased 
emphasis on improving the efficiency and quality of public spending and service delivery.  
 
2. Objectives 
Page  2
The objectives are two-fold: (i) reduce mortality and morbidity from communicable and non-
communicable diseases as well as exposure to risk factors associated with ill health, and (ii) 
improve the health outcomes of specially vulnerable groups including indigenous populations 
and Quilombo (descendents of slaves) communities. 
 
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
The proposed project is closely aligned with corporate priorities related to the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals in Brazil. It will directly contribute to the achievement of goals 
for reducing infant mortality, combating communicable diseases,  improving maternal health and 
empowering women. These priorities have been endorsed by other multilateral and bilateral 
agencies active in Brazil (IDB, PAHO, UNDP, DFID). The  Indigenous health component has 
received the support of NGOs and indigenous organizations (See Annex 10). 
 
Drawing on the experience accumulated in VIGISUS I and the application of pooled funding 
arrangements (introduced in the Family Health Extension Project), the Bank is well-positioned to 
support government policies and strategies related to health surveillance and coverage extension 
to vulnerable populations. The Bank and others have identified public health surveillance and 
disease control as essential public health functions and public goods that can only be provided by 
governments. It  has acquired considerable technical expertise in strengthening disease 
surveillance and control systems at both regional and central levels.  
 
4. Description 
In 1998 the Bank approved an eight-year $600 million VIGISUS Program (APL) consisting of 
three-phases of $200 million each. The Program seeks to contribute to the reduction of mortality 
and morbidity and decrease exposure to risk factors associated with ill health through 
strengthening the national public health surveillance and disease control system, and supporting 
disease prevention and control for indigenous populations. The first phase will be completed by 
June 30, 2004 and the second phase is expected to become effective on July 1, 2004 while the 
third is expected to commence in 2007.  
 
The first phase focused on strengthening the public health laboratory network, improving the 
data management telecommunication system, establishing an Environmental Health Surveillance 
Unit, strengthening disease control activities in the Amazon Region and improving capacity to 
investigate and control disease outbreaks.  Support for  Indigenous health included upgrading 
and expanding the service delivery system, creating the institutional framework for the 
management and oversight of this system and implementing the essential features of a  public 
health surveillance system in indigenous areas.  
 
The Second-phase will build upon the accomplishments of the first phase while supporting the 
decentralization of health surveillance activities and institutional reforms related to the 
indigenous health system. At the request of the Borrower, the proposed project will support the 
decentralization of health surveillance activities to states and municipalities, raise the level of 
financing directed to the indigenous health system and support government efforts to extend 
basic services to impoverished Quilombo communities. Triggers for the third phase are as 
follows:

·
Formal evaluation of every state surveillance system and institutional capacity completed and

·
60%

The final two-year phase will support the consolidation of the national health surveillance and 
Indigenous health systems.

5. Implementation 
Due to the creation in July, 2003, of the Secretariat of Health Surveillance (SVS) in the Ministry 
of Health, and the transfer of what were the duties of CENEPI from FUNASA to this newly 
created Secretariat, the project will have two distinct implementing units - PIUs. The first and 
larger unit will be located in SVS/MOH and will be responsible for the implementation of 
Component 1 (Health Surveillance) and will respond directly to the Secretary of Health 
Surveillance. The second unit will be located in FUNASA and will be responsible for the 
implementation of Component  2 (Indigenous Health) and will respond to the President of 
FUNASA. These units will work closely with the existing organizational structure (management, 
technical, human resources and evaluation) both in SVS and in FUNASA. 
 
6. Sustainability:  
The policy, institutional and financial framework underbracing health surveillance and 
indigenous health suggests a high level of sustainability for project-supported interventions. This 
is complemented by the endorsement of  the project by state and municipal chief epidemiologists 
as well as by indigenous organizations and NGOs active in indigenous communities. The recent 
(2000) approval of an indigenous health policy and legal framework also demonstrates long-term 
government commitment to address the health needs of indigenous communities.  
 
Page  4
A
recent constitutional amendment (No. 29) has contributed to stability of health financing, 
resulting in an estimated 26 percent increase in financing between 2001 and 2004. Also, the 
MOH has demonstrated strong budgetary commitment to health surveillance and indigenous 
health, registering real increases of 27 and 24 percent respectively between 2000 and 2003. 
While bank financial participation represents a small slice of both programs, the joining of Loan 
Proceeds with federal transfers will ensure will ensure sustainability of the National Health 
Surveillance Program.
