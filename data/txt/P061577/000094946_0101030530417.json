   objectives and sector strategies; c) strengthen the\n            government's administrative capacity to manage public\n            expenditures efficiently; and d) establish a fiduciary\n            framework enabling the provision of external financial\n            assistance. The credit is based on a set of institutional\n            reforms and capacity building essential to reach these\n            objectives. These include reform of the budget preparation\n            system through the use of performance budgeting;\n            strengthening of the administrative/institutional capacity\n            for more efficient and timely budget execution and\n            reporting; establishment of a fiduciary framework; and\n            greater use of monitoring and evaluation techniques for\n            public expenditures."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
