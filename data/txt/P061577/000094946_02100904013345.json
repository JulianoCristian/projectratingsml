The absence of this\n            supplemental financing would jeopardize the\n            Government's ability to keep macroeconomic, and public\n            expenditure reform program on track, jeopardizing as well\n            the delivery of basic social services. Despite slower\n            progress on the structural reform agenda, significant\n            progress was registered in critical areas of the cotton\n            sector, and budget management reform. The supplemental\n            financing would enhance the impact of the PERAC project,\n            contributing not only to maintaining the increase in\n            allocations to education and health services, but in\n            protecting cotton producers' incomes, allowing poverty\n            alleviation efforts, through the provision of a subsidy to\n            all cotton farmers."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
