institutional development impact was modes,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that budget\n            reform is a long-term process that will take decades to\n            succeed in most member countries. The main issue, at the\n            design stage, is to select a few strategic kick-off\n            activities and operational targets that can be\n            completed/achieved in one or two years. The success of a\n            long-term budget reform will obviously depend on the\n            long-term commitment of both the government and its\n            financiers. A multi-sector budget reform program needs to\n            mobilize considerable support from the Bank and possibly\n            other donors, particularly at the supervision stage.\n            Introducing entirely new budget preparation and evaluation\n            techniques may require a significant input of technical\n            assistance to be financed by donors. Both the Budget\n            Directorate and most of the other departments in the\n            Ministry of Finance and Economy tend to give priority to\n            what they see as their main operational and administrative\n            functions and do not have the staff, the time and the\n            capacity to guide other ministries in the design, execution\n            and monitoring of program-budgets. For the short-term\n            future, the Bank may also wish to consider the following\n            recommendations: the next phase of Bank programs in support\n            of budget reforms should first aim at consolidating initial\n            results; the fact that new ministries want to join the\n            program-budget process shows the vitality of the reform but\n            also creates a major absorptive capacity constraint."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
