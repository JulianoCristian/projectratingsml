                         The Palestinian NGO Project Phase III (PNGOIII) aimed to provide social services to those who are poor, vulnerable or affected by the deteriorating socio-economic conditions by
                         establishing an effective mechanism to improve the quality and sustainability of NGO social service delivery. The Grant Agreement was between the Bank and the Welfare
                         Association, who designated project implementation to the NGO Development Center (NDC).

                         The Bank and NDC, in close collaboration with the Welfare Association, organized two showcasing events for PNGO III and PNGO III AF on June 22 in Ramallah, and on October 4,

                         2011 in Gaza City. The purpose of these events was for beneficiary NGOs to directly share their views of, and lessons from the project, and to contribute to a dialogue among sector
                         stakeholders. Both closing ceremonies were very well received, and had a large attendance by NGOs, rich discussions and media coverage, with the June event also having been
                         attended by the Prime Minister. Overall, NGOs were very satisfied with both, the project and NDC, and identified the major achievements as the strategic development and
                         empowerment of Palestinian civil society, and unbiased support to NGOs.
