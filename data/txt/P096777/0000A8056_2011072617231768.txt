                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Palestinian NGO Project Phase III (PNGOIII) aims to provide social services to those who are poor, vulnerable or affected by the deteriorating socio-economic conditions by
                         establishing an effective mechanism to improve the quality and sustainability of NGO social service delivery. The Grant Agreement is between the Bank and the Welfare Association,
                         who designated project implementation to the NGO Development Center (NDC). The project, supported by two trust funds, is expected to close on September 30, 2011.
                         At the closing of the trust fund for PNGO III on March 31, 2011, total disbursement amounted to USD 9.71 million which represents around 97.08% of the overall project budget of
                         USD 10 million. Current disbursement is at 99 %. All activities have been completed, having met, or in some cases exceeded their outcome indicator targets.
