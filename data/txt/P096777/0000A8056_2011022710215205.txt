                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation of PNGOIII continues to progress smoothly and is expected to close on schedule in March 2011. The Additional Financing (AF) in Gaza is expected to close in
                         September 2011. For PNGOIII, implementation is progressing very well and disbursements have reached 97%. Implementation progress is slower for the AF in Gaza with
                         disbursements currently at 62%, but all funds are fully committed by NDC. The PNGOIII and the AF in Gaza are on target to meet their development objectives.
