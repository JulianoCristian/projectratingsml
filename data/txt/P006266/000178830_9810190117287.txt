BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Since 1961t, the Benk ha.s had a continuing exchange of views with
the Government of Brazil regarding the improvement and extension of the trans-
port system.  Following the Bankn's recommendation, a Na.tional Transport Survey
was launched in 1965, with financial assistance from UNDM, USAID and the Bank.
Ba.sed on its findings and recommendations, the Bank financed four highway con-
struction projects (Loan 567-BR in October 1968, US$26 million; 676-BR in May
1970, US$100 million; 813-BR in April 1972, US$89 million; and 85L-BR in
August 1972, US$51 million), a railway project (786-BR in Lugust 1971, uS$L6
million) and a. port project (756-RR in June 1971, US$L5 mi)lion). The First
Highway Construction Project has now been completed, and progress on the three
following highway construction projects is satisfactory.  Progress on the
railway and ports projects, although slow, is also satisfactory.
ii.       Confronted with an enormous increase in demand. for transport of bulk
products (agricultural and steel-related products), and in line with a policy
of fuel conservation, the Brazilian Government is presently giving first pri-
ority to railway investmernts.  Nevertheless, road transport is still very
important (more than 150 billion ton-km, or 70M of total ton-km was carried
by road in 1972)o  In five years, even assuming a considerable increase in
rail traffic, road transport would have to carry an additional 50 billion ton-
km as a result of general development of the Brazilian economy, assuming a
growth rate in GNP of 8/t per year.  Therefore, the Government will contime
its road construction program.  In addition, the new management of the National
Highway Department (DN:E), concerned at the relatively poor quality of highway
maintenance, has decided to strengthen such maintenance both by improving the
capabilitv of the State Highway Departm.ents (DER's) and by reinforcing its own
capability.
iii.      The Second. Highway Construction Project included feasibility studies
for about 3,800 km of roads, selected on the basis of the National Transport
Surve-. Ilost of these, having been found to have a setisfactory economic re-
turn, were included for detailed engineering in the Third Highway Cornstruction
Project.  From this list of roads, about 610 km of federa1 highways with high
economic returns were selected to form the basis for the road construction
program included in the proposed project, In addition, to assist DNER in its
effort to strengthen road maintenance, the proposed project will finance a
comprehensive maintenance program in two states and technical assistance to
improve LNER's own maintenance capability.
iv.       The proposed project consists of:  (a) construction and uDg_ading
of about 610 km of federal highways; (b) supervision of the proposed road
works; (c) a highway maintenance program in the states of tio Grande do Sul
ane' Minas Gerais; (d) assistance to DNER, including technical assistance and
the provision and installation of weigh bridges; and (e) consulting services
for feasibility studies and detailed engineering for construction and
rehabilitation of roads.



- ii -
V.        The cost of the project, for which a Bank loan of US$110 million is
proposed, is estimated at about US$276 million equivalent, and the loan will
finance 40% of all items.  The foreign exchange cost of the project is esti-
mated at US$39 million equivalent (about 1L4 of the project cost or 355 of the
loan amount). The loan will therefore finance US$71 million of local
expenditures.
vi.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of DNIRT, except
for the maintenance programs in the States of Rio Grande do Sul and Minas
Gerais, where DNER will have joint responsioility with the respective DER's.
Subsidiary agreements will be entered into between DNER and the DER's for this
purpose, and project agreements will be signed between the Bank and the two
states. The loan will be made to the Federal Government, and DNER., as exec-
uting agency, will administer a Government-replenished revolving fund for pay-
ment to contractors, suppliers and consultants, and for payments to the DER's
of Rio Grande do Sul and 1Minas Gerais.
vii.      Contracts for construction and the purchase of equipment will be let
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines, except that contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent for construc-
tion of buildings and other minor civil works, and contracts less than US$50,000
equivalent for items or groups of items of equipment, will, if the Government
so requests, be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
and in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank -
the total amounts of works and equipment so contracted will not, however,
exceed US$2 million equivalent and US$1 million eauivalent, respectively.
viii.     The economic returns for the road construction and upgrading program
range from 17% to 39%. The economic return for the maintenance program is
about 28%.  As a whole, the economic return of the project is 28A.
ix.       The project provides a suitable basis for Bank lending of US$110
million eouivalent. On the basis of the average useful life of road con-
struction works and length of construction period and ma.intenance programs,
the appropriate tern would be 20 years, including a five-year period of grace.



BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Federal Republic of Brazil has requested a loan
of US$110 million to help finance a project consisting of:  (a) construction
and upgrading of about 610 km of federal highways; (b) supervision of the pro-
posed road works; (c) highway maintenance programs in the states of Rio Grande
do Sul and Minas Gerais; (d) assistance to DNER, including technical assistance
and the provision and installation of weigh bridges; and (e) consulting ser-
vices for feasibility studies and detailed engineering for construction and
reconstruction of federal roads. The total cost of the project is estimated
at about US$276 million equivalent, including price and quantity contingencies.
1.02      Excluding a small maintenance project in 1953, this will be the fifth
Bank-financed highway project in Brazil. A National Transport Survey was
carried out during 1965-1970, and all four previous highway projects were based
on its findings and recommendations. The First Highway Construction Project
(Loan 567-BR, October 1968, US$26.0 million), comprising engineering, construc-
tion and paving of about 430 km of highways, has now been satisfactorily
completed, with a saving of about US$3.15 million in the loan amount. The
Second (Loan 676-BR, May 1970, US$100 million), Third (Loan 813-BR, April 1972,
US$89 million) and Fourth (Loan 854-BR, August 1972, US$51 million) Highway
Construction Projects comprise about h,670 km of construction ard paving,
about L,800 km of detailed engineering, and about 5,600 km of feasibility
studies. All of these projects are slightly delayed, but execution is other-
wise satisfactory; as of April 30, 1974, they were, in financial terms, about
92X, 73% and 49% complete, respectively.
1.03      The Bark's highway projects in Brazil have been, overall, highly
successful, and have contributed substantially in improving transportation and
highway planning, in building up the local contracting and consulting indus-
tries, in securing adherence to acceptable standards for project design and
specifications, and in fostering contractual discipline.  Also, in the field
of highway maintenance, the Bank's emphasis on improvements and its assistance
in the definition and execution of pilot maintenance regions (for transfer of
maintenance from DINER to DER's) are now yielding results.
loOLi     Appraisal of the project was based-on:  (a) technical studies and
detailed engineering carzied out by Brazilian consultant firms under DNER's
supervision and financed under the Third Highway Construction Project; (b)
information provided by the Government; and (c) findings of two Bank missions,
both comprising Messrs. Per Fossberg (Engineer), Bernard Chatelin (Economist)
and Eric Schaefer (Consultant, Engineer), who undertook the appraisal in
January-February 197LT and the post-appraisal in May-June 197T!. The report
has been edited by Miss Virginia foster.

2. BACKGROUND
2.01      Background information on the transport sector is dealt with in
"The Transport Sector of Brazil" (TSB), Report No. 571a, dated December 20,1974.
To avoid duplication with the TSB, the sector information usually included
in this background chapter is omitted from this report.
2.02      While the TSB contains general comments on high priority measures
that need to be taken in the various transport modes, such measures will be
spelt out in more detail in the appraisal reports being prepared for pro-
posed loans in the transport sector.
3. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
3.01      General information on the highway subsector is given in TSB (paras
33 to 55). This chapter gives more detailed information on the subsector,
particularly that pertaining to the proposed project.
A. Highway Administration
3.02      The National Highway Depsrtment (Departamento Nacional de Estradas
de Rodagem - DNER), under the Ministry of Transport, administers the national
highway network. DNER's organizational structure was changed in 1974. A
major result of the change was that the former Operations Directorate was split
into three separate directorates,. Maintenance, Safety and Police, and Road
Transport. This change should strengthen DNER's maintenance function consid-
erably, ard, at the same time, enhance the importance of the road transport
and safety functions. Furthermore, the Road Research Institute (Instituto de
Pesquisas Rodoviarias - IPR) has recently been taken over by DNER and now
forms a separate Department; the Institute is still in its infancy and needs
strengthening. DNER's current organizational structure is shown in Chart 1.
DNER exercises its responsibilities for the federal road network through 20
district offices (one in each state except Acre); federal roads in the four
federal territories are administered by DNER offices in neighboring states.
3.03      Each of the 21 states has a State Highway Department (Departamento
de Estradas de Rodagem - DER) responsible for the maintenance and the con-
struction of its state highway network. During the past four years, the DER's
of the main states have been reorganized, following the recommendations of the
National Transport Survey (para 102). The main purpose of the reorganization
of both DUiER and the DER's was to reduce the centralization of highway activ-
ities in DNER and to eliminate the duplication of services between DNER and
the DER's.  To accomplish this, a gradual transfer of federal highway con-
struction and maintenance functions from DNER to the DER's was foreseen, and
the DER's were reorganized to enable them to take over these functions. The
organizational charts for two states, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais, are
shown in Annex 1, Charts 1 and 20



-3-
3.04      The greater part (about 1 million km) of BrazilIs highway network
can be classified as secondary and feeder roads (TSB, para.33,). These, which
are mainly earth roads and tracks, are largely under the jurisdiction of
states and municipalities. During the last few years, semi-public road corp-
orations have been established in some states to sponsor feeder road projects--
these corporations receive budgetary appropriations from the state, and/or
state guarantees, to enable them to borrow to construct feeder roads. The
National Bank for Economic Development (BNDE), partly with the assistance of
DNER and USAID, has participated in the selection, financing, execution and
control of large-scale secondary and feeder road programs.
B. Highway Planning
3.05      Detailed information on highway planning is given in paragraphs
39-44 of TSB.  The National Transport Plan, which has been periodically up-
dated, has formed the basis for federal highway investments in recent years.
The latest updating of the Plan, applying to both federal and state roads,
was completed in 1972 for the three southern states, and an updating was com-
pleted in draft in July 1974 for the remaining part of the country. The
preparation of state road investments varies substantially from state to state,
and the planning capacity of many DER's is still very limited. The planning
is even weaker in the municipalities and road corporations.
3.06      In the previous four Bank-financed highway construction projects,
the emphasis was on construction and paving of trunk roads. Now, however,
since DNER's planning and execution of trunk road projects is relatively well
established, there is a clear case for the Bank putting more emphasis on
trunk road rehabilitation and on road maintenance, both fields in which DNER's
performance has been relatively poor; the proposed project seeks to do this
(paras L.06-h.11 and 4.15).  There is, further, a strong case for improving
planning at the state level. Finally, strengthening of planning for secondary
and feeder roads is required; this latter requirement will be addressed under
a proposed Bpnk-financed feeder road project, which is scheduled for appraisal
in 1975.
3.07      According to available information, the level of rmad user charges
is adequate, and does not distort the allocation of traffic between the trans-
port modes. However, there is a lack of data to ascertain whether the structure
of the existing road user charges pricesthe road network adequately and makes
the various users pay an equitable share. First, there is a need for a clear
breakdown of expenses between maintenance, rehabilitation, reconstruction and
new constraction of the highway network, and an estimation of such costs per
vehicle-km of use by the various types of vehicles.  Second, there is a need
for a breakdown ofL road user charges between the various users to determine.
inter alia. the fuel consumption by type of vehicle, type of trip, and geo-
graphical area (urban/rural)   Third, a more thorough development of freight
statistics, by type of vehicle, trip and road, is desirable. During negotia-
tions, Government gave assurance that it will undertake a comprehensive study
of road user charges, in accordance with terms of reference and timetables
acceptable to the Bank.



-4-
C. Highway Engineering and Construction
3.08      The design standards used for the engineering of the highway works
included in the project are shown in Table 1 These standards are identical
to those adopted in the Bank's four previous highway construction projects
and conform with general design standards in Brazil; they are satisfactory.
Moreover, the Government, with the possible financial assistance of UNDP, is
considering an empirical study of the optimal design standards for roads in
Brazil, directed at minimizing total road transport costs (construction,
maintenance and road user costs). This study, which was originally suggested
by the Bank, will continue studies undertaken in Kenya with Bank assistance
since 1971.
3.09      The Brazilian construction industry is highly competitive, and there
are a large number of well organized and experienced local contractors. Pre-
qualification for the Fourth Highwxay Construction Project in 1972 showed the
strength of the industry in that seven firms and joint ventures with free
capacity at the time to undertake works over Cr$ 100 million, six for Cr$ 50-
100 million, 14 for Cro 20-50 million, 12 for Cr$ 10-20 million and seven for
works less than Cr$ 10 million were prequalified. Competition for the con-
tracts was brisk - 46 contractors participated in the bidding, presenting 3143
valid bids for the 2L lots involved.
3.10      With recent cost increases, particularly for oil, fuel and asphalt,
steel, timber and cement, some contractors have come under severe financial
strain. While Brazil has had a well developed system for adjusting prices
with increasing inflation, the contractual price adjustment formulas could
not cope with the recent jumps. Hence, DNER has recently improved the price
adjustment system.
3.11      With the exception of the heaviest items (large tractors, scrapers
and shovels), construction equipment is manufactured in Brazil.  Equipment
suitable for most road building operations - except heavy earthwork - is
therefore readily available.
3.12      The quality of construction supervision is one of the most important
and most difficult problems in highways; however, it has improved considerably
over the last few years.  DNER has created a group, working with the Construc-
tion Directorate, for control and coordination of construction projects,
including those financed by the Bank. This group presently has a staff of ten
engineers. The group was reinforced and assisted by a foreign consultant
(Iii'GEYOUTE, rorance), which provided five engineers under the Second Highway
Construction Project.  The consultants' services were continued during the
Third and the Fourth Highway Construction Projects and proved to be very use-
ful.  Although the Directorate's control group has gained considerably in
strength and experience, its activities can still be improved, and the con-
tinued participation of a consultant is included in the proposed project
(para 1°)



-5-
D. Highway Maintenance
3.13      Progress has been slow in developing adequate programs for
preserving roadways and structures as nearly as possible in their
original condition as constructed or as subsequently improved. Never-
theless, considerable efforts have been made to produce better maintenance.
USAID helped several states to finance new equipment and has given a
great amount of technical assistance. Under the National Transport
Survey (para 1.02), consultants carried out maintenance studies in 18
states and made recommendations for improving maintenance methods and
operations, listed equipment needs, prepared maintenance programs and
advised on organization changes. Under the First and Second Plans
of Action (TSB, para. 5), the Government declared its intention of
gradually delegating maintenance of federal roads to the states. The
intention to delegate maintenance is also stated in loan agreements of
Bank highway projects, in addition to the general covenant by which
the Government undertook to maintain the entire national network properly.
3.14      While maintenance of federal and state roads has improved
much during trie last decade, it nas not kept pace with the requirements
of the rapidly increasing highway network. Progress in the program of
delegation of federal roads to the states for maintenance was satisfactory
until about 1971. Since then, it has fallen behind, mainly because
the rate of strengthening of state highway departments has not been
sufficient to justify large scale delegation of important federal
roads, thus forcing DNER increasingly to employ contractors for maintenance.
In addition, a large number of federal roads are delegated by DNER to
the states without the necessary funds for their proper maintenance,
an untenable situation since state highway departments are always
struggling to obtain adequate funds for the maintenance for their own
roads.
3.15      A program of pilot maintenance regions was started in 1971
and has proven to be successful inasmuch as it has given DNER and the
DER's concerned an opportunity to determine the best procedures for
delegation of federal roads and, for DNER, an incentive to provide
technical assistance for the improvement of maintenance divisions of
DER's. Unfortunately, DNER's maintenance division is understaffed,
and reinforcement is urgently required, including international experts
to assist DNER in the considerable task of delegation of maintenance
to the state highway departments and connected supervision of maintenance
operation. Pilot regions are now established in the states of Rio
Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana, Minas Gerais, Bahia and Pernambuco,
and new regions were established in September 1974. in the states of Rio
Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Maranhao and Mato Grosso.
3.16      A full-scale program for the strengthening of state highway depart-
ments should be started in.those states where pilot regions have proved
successful, where the DER's have demonstrated ability to maintain their own
networks when given appropriate assistance, and where the entire federal road
network in the state could be delegated in a relatively short period, say five



-6-
to six years. Such plans have been prepared for Rio Grande do Sul and Minas
Gerais to start in 1975, and the program could possibly be extended to Parana,
Bahia and Pernambuco in 1977. The Bank will assist in financing the programs
in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais under the proposed project (paras 4.06-
4.08) and will also provide appropriate assistance for DNER's maintenance
activities (paras 4.09-4.12).
3.17      Federal roads should preferably be delegated to the states for
maintenance only when in a maintainable condition, i.e., rehabilitation of
certain roads may be desirable prior to delegation. Since the task of re-
habilitation is getting bigger and more urgent every year as the highway
system ages, DNER should now start a planned and engineered rehabilitation
program. Studies for rehabilitation prior to delegation are included in the
proposed project (para 4.15).
3.18      The regulatory provisions for maximum motor vehicle weight and
dimensions are satisfactory. The maximum axle load is 10 tons for single
axles and 17 tons for tandem axles. However, enforcement of weight regula-
tions is not strict enough - on federal as well as on state roads - due in
large part to the lack of weighing stations. The DNER program for instal-
lation of scales has fallen seriously behind schedule; not a single scale
was installed in 1973. Only 26 stations had been installed by mid-197h, and
some of these are still not in operation.   Twelve additional stations - all
financed by IDB - are now being installed but are not yet operational. Con-
sequently, assistance to accelerate the provision and installation of weigh
bridges is included in the proposed project (para 4.12). During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that weight regulations will be en-
forced on all federal roads and on state roads in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas
Gerais.
4. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project will consist of:
(a)  Construction and upgrading of the following five federal highways,
comprising:
Road No.        Highway                     State                  Length (km)
BR-101  Feirade Santana-Esplanada  Bahia                              131
BR-040  Bingen - Juiz de Fora       Rio de Janeiro/Minas Gerais       141
BR-277  Campo Largo-Curitiba        Parana                             22
,E-496  Corinto - Pirapora          Minas Gerais                      141
BR-364  Jatai-Conal Sao Simao       Goias                             177
Total :      612

(b)  Consulting services for supervision of the works in (a) above;
(c) Highway maintenance programs in the States of Minas Gerais and
Rio Grande do Sul;
(d)  Strengthening of DNER's highway maintenance capability by
technical assistance and by the provision and installation
of weigh bridges on federal highways; and
(e)  Consulting services for feasibility studies and detailed
engineering for construction and rehabilitation of roads.
B. Highway Construction and Upgrading
4.02      A list of the highways proposed for construction and upgrading, to-
gether with their more important technical characteristics and their cost
estimates, is given in Table 2, and their location is shown in Maps lUos.
11010 R, 11013 R., 1101L R, 11015 R, 11016 and 11018 R. Further details are
given in Chapter 5 - Economic Evaluation, and in Annex 2.
L.03      The need for four of these road works was identified in the National
Transport Plan (para 3.05) and confirmed by the feasibility studies financed
under the Second Highway Construction Project. The fifth road (Campo Largo-
Curitiba) was identified as being of high priority by the updated Highway
Master Plan.  The detailed engineering for the five roads was prepared under
the Third Highway Construction Project by Brazilian consultants (Annex 3).
The engineering is complete and satisfactory. DNER's Planning Department
supervised the engineering with the aid of a Brazilian consultant, Consultores
de Engenharia e Desenvolvimento (CED).
C.  Consulting 9ervices for Supervision
L.OL      Consulting services for supervision will be at two levels.  At the
individual highlay contract level, DNEK has decided in principle that, in
order to maintain continuity of responsibility, the consultants who carried
out the detailed engineering will be retained for construction supervision.
4.05      At the national level, as explained in paragraph 3.12, DNER desires
the continued input of foreign expertise to assist in construction control and
coordination.  The project will therefore allow for continuation of such input,
specificallyr by the provision of four experts; this will represent a slight
reduction compared with the current input since the Second Highway Project is
aU.].ost co.p1lete, ani the Third and Fourth Projects will be rore than half com-
plete by the time that the proposed project is implemented.  This proposed in-
put will be furnished by the present consultant (INGEIDUTE, France).

D. Highway Maintenance Programs in the States of Rio Grande
do Sul and Minas Gerais
h4o6      To meet the shortcomings of the present situation (paras 3.13-3.16)
and to encourage a more rapid implementation of Government's declared policy
of delegation of maintenance of federal roads from DNER to DERI's, a compre-
hensive program for the strengthening of the state highway departments of Rio
Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais will be carried out under this project. These
two states were selected because they are now prepared for such a program,
because they contain nearly 30 of the total paved federal highway network,
and because, due to their relatively advarced stage in highway maintenance,
the program is most likely to succeed, and thus will have the maximum de-
monstrative effect.
L.07      The proposed programs in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais will,
inter alia, incorporate all federal roads into the respective state main-
tenance programs, and will consist of:
(a)  Restructuring of the maintenance divisions in each state's
highway department, including the establishment of fully
equipped and operationally independent "districts" between
the existing "sectors" ("residencias") and headquarters -
involving the installation of new, and enlargement of
existing, district and sector headquarters;
(b)  Purchase of maintenance, workshop and. office equipment;
(c)  Provision and installation of weigh bridges on state roads;
(d) Technical assistance by consultants in each state for the
planning, supervision and control of all maintenance
operations; and
(e) A training program which will basically consist of in-
service training of personnel who will gradually assume
full responsibility in their fields.
L.08      The present status of highway maintenance in the two states, as well
as the most important characteristics of the proposed programs, are given in
Annex 1, together with cost estimates, and in Maps Nos. 11024 and 11028.
E. Strengthening of DNER's Maintenance Capability
4.09      To meet the specific shortcomings in DNER's maintenance operations
mentioned in paragraphs 3.15 and 3f18, the project will include assistance
to DNER, consistirg of:
(a) Provision of two international experts for DNER's main-
tenance division; and
(b) Provision and installation of weigh bridges on federal roads.



-9-
4010      The expert assistance will comprise a highway maintenance engineer
and a cost accounting and budgeting expert, each for about four years. These
experts will assist DNER in: (a) contimnation of the pilot-region program;
(b) coordination with the states where the pilot-region programs are to be
carried out; (c) working out a coordinated program of rehabilitation and
delegation of maintenance; (d) establishment of a cost accounting, pro-
gramming and budgeting system for maintenance purposes; (e) supervision
of DNER's own maintenance operations; and (f) training of DNER staff.
411      In addition to this expert assistance, DNER's maintenance division
needs to be strengthened with Brazilian personnel. Assurances were received
during negotiations that DNER will reinforce this division with at least four
Brazilian professionals with knowledge and experience in the maintenance
field.
4.12      The project provides for the procurement and installation of 95
weigh bridges on federal roads. This includes all bridges that should have
been installed in 1973 as well as all those scheduled for 1974. The loca-
tion of the weighing stations, as given in Table 3, was confirmed during
negotiations.
F. Studies ard Engineering
4.13      Studies and engineering under the proposed project would consist of:
(a) Detailed engineering for construction and upgrading of about
830 km of roads;
(b)  Detailed engineering for rehabilitation of about 1,600 km of
paved roads; and
(c)  Feasibility studies for about 1,230 km of roads.
4.14      The Third Highway Project included feasibility studies for about
2,580 km of federal and state highways; 830 km of these, including only the
works of particularly high economic merit, were selected for detailed en-
gineering under the proposed project. This amount is far less than that
provided in previous Bark-financed highway projects and reflects the Govern-
ment's shift of emphasis from new highway construction to a more balanced
sectorial view. The roads are listed in Annex 3 and described in Annex 44,
and their position is shown in Maps Nos. 11010 R, 11011, 11012, 11013 R,
11018 R, 11019 and 11020.
4.15      The detailed engineering (of a relatively simple nature) for re-
habilitation will cover an estimated 1,600 km of paved roads.  Provision  of
this engineering in the project reflects the increasing importance of highway
rehabilitation work in Brazil. The selection of roads will be based on a
study, already under way by DNER, to determine priorities. Agreement was
reached during negotiations on (a) the type of road works that will be
classified as rehabilitation and (b) the criteria (such as condition of
pavement, traffic, etc.) which will form the basis for the selection of
the 1,600 km of roads.



- 10 -
4,.16     Three roads, totaling about 1,230 km, have been selected for feasi-
bility studies, on the basis of the Highway Master Plan (para 3.05). This
list of roads, shown in Annex 3, was agreed during negotiations. Provision
for feasibility studies, although far less than in previous Bank-financed
highway projects in Brazil, has been maintained since it is important that
the Bank continue to be involved in all phases of project planning and pre-
paration in order to continue its institution-building efforts, even though
it may not eventually finance these roads.
G. Cost Estimates and Financing
4.17      The cost of the project is estimated at about US$276 million equi-
valent, including contingencies. A summary of the project cost and the pro-
posed Bank participation is given on page 11 following.
h.18      The estimates of construction costs are based on May 1974 prices,
but increased to allow for inflation up to November 1974. Unit prices are
based on consulting engineers' estimates and checked against unit prices
from contracts recently awarded for similar works. Quantities were taken
from detailed engineering studies. A 10% contingency has been added to the
construction costs to allow for quantity increases; this is considered
adequate since detailed engineering has been completed for all the proposed
construction.
4.19      Price contingencies for civil works are based on an expected rate
of inflation of 18% for 1974, 15% for 1975, 13% for 1976, and 12% thereafter.
The actual provision for price contingencies assumed bids by about the end
of 1974, start of construction in early 1975, and a 36-month construction
period. On this basis, a 25% price contingency was estimated.
4.20      The foreign exchange component of construction was estimated on the
assumption that all work would be executed by local firms, in which case it
amounts to 13%, assuming also that a local contractor will use, primarily,
locally produced equipment (para 3.11)o
4.21      The cost of construction supervision is based on the arrangements
described in paragraphs 4.04 and 4.05.  The cost of Brazilian consultants is
estimated at 6% of the construction cost; out of this, about 10% is estimated
to be foreign cost (mainly for imported equipment), The cost of the coordina-
ting consultant is based on recent contracts for international experts; it is
estimated that about 70% of the cost is in foreign currency.  A 10% quantity
contingency and a provision for price increase have been added; the latter is
based on a time schedule corresponding approximately to the construction
schedule, resulting in a 20% price contingency, when allowing a somewhat lower
rate of inflation for consultant services than for civil works.
4.22      The cost of the highway maintenance program is based on February
1974 prices but increased to allow for inflation up to November 197)4   The
components of the program are as detailed in Annex 1. Since the major part

of the cost is for equipment, the amount of which is relatively well estab-
lished, the quantity contingency has been set relatively low, at 5%. The
price contingency has been based on the expected inflation of international
prices for equipment, namely 1L,1% for 1974, 11% for 1975 and 10% thereafter,
and assuming a project implemertation as described in Annex 1.  On this
basi.s, a 22% price contingency has been allowed.  The overall foreign ex-
change component of the maintennce program has been estimated at about 13%.
L,23      For assistance to DINER, the cost of weighing stations is based on
early 197)4 prices for weigh bridges, adding the estimated construction costs
for buildings and access roads. The total foreign exchange cost is about 13%.
Price contingencies have been estimated at 20%.
4.2L      The costs of consulting services for studies and engineering were
based on contracts recently awarded in Brazil for such services.  It is ex-
pected that the services will be provided essentially by Brazilian firms,
and the foreign exchange component of their cost is estimated at 20% (for
computers, aerial photograrm.etiy and other imported equipment).  Price con-
tingencies hcve been calculated, assuming that the services will be completed
in about two years, resultirg in 15%.
u.25      Bank participation in the project will be L0- of all project expen-
ditures. The total foreign exchange cost of the project is estimated at
US$39 million equivalent, which is about 14,. of the project cost, and about
35% of the loan amount; a loan of US$110.0 million will, therefore finance
local expenditures of US$71 million equivalent.
H. Execution of the Project
L.26      TJLiER will be responsible for execution of the project, with the
exception of the maintenance programs in Rio Grande do Sul and M1inas Gerais
(para 4030)0
L1.27     Contracts for highway construction ard upgrading works will be let
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bark's Guidelines.  The Goverrment completed prequalification procedures in
November 197L.  Construction is expected to commence during the first quarter
of 1.975 and to be completed in about 36 months.
Lo28      -or contract purposes, civil works of the project have been divided
irto 21 lots, of which 17 are for road corstruction and upgrading, and four
for bridge construction. The lots have been agreed with DIES? and confirmed
during negotiations.  The contracts for road works are expected to range from
US$2G 5i iOn to US$20.0 million, while those for bridge works will range
from US'-0.2 million to US$2.5 millio n0

ard construLction contracts will not be awarded prior to legal expropriation.
Durirg loan negotiations, the Governmernt gave assurance that right-of-way
will be acouired expeditiously0

4.30      For the maintenance programs in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais,
involving the delegation of mairtenance of federal roads from DNER to the
state DER's, project execution will be the joint responsibility of DNER and
the DER's concerned.  For these, subsidiary agreements between DNER and the
DER's are required in addition to the loan agreement with the Federal Govern-
ment and the project agreements with the two states. Satisfactory conclusion
of the subsidiary agreements will be a condition for disbursements under the
maintenance part of the project.
4.31      The execution of the maintenance programs will be in accordance
with documents presented by the State Highway Depertmert (DAER) of Rio Grande
do Sul (Estudo para Conservacao da Rede Rodoviaria Federal no Rio Grande do
Sul pelo DAER/RS) and by DER of IMinas Gereis (Estudo para Conservacao de Rede
Rodoviaria Federal em Minas Gerais pelo DER/NG).  Both these documents con-
tain cost estimates, quarterly expenditure schedules for the program components
(installations and buildings, equipments and spares, consultant services and
personnel training, etc.) and schedules for annual delegation of roads from
DIERB to the two DER's as shown in Anfnex 1, Charts 3 and 4. Since the studies
-or these reports were miade in 1973 and early 19T74, it will be necessary to
adjust the time schedule for the delegation of federal roads.  During loan
negotiations, it was agreed that amendments to the above reports will be
issued, showing up-to-date schedules for the delegation. In addition, to en-
sure the timely start and execution of the project, the signature of consultants'
contracts aid the registration of these contracts with the Central Bank of
Brazil will be a condition for disbursements under the maintenarce part of the
project. The programs are expected to commence early in 1975, and to be com-
pleted in 48 months in Rio Grande do Sul and in 54 months in Minas Gerais.
4.32      Most of the maintenance anJd shop eouipment required for the proposed
programs is fabricated in Brazil.  For items, or groups of similar items,
whose aggregate value does not exceed US$50,000 equivalent, contracts will, if
the Government so requests, be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are satis-
factory to the Bank; such purchases will not exceed Us$1,000,000 equivalent
in aggregate, Procurement of the remainder of the equipment would be on the
basis of international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bark's
'Guidelines". Furthermore, the contracts for construction of buildings for the
maintenance progran, for weighing stations and their access roads, and other
minor construction items for contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent, will
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in
accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank; however,
the totEl amount of work contracted under this procedure will not exceed US$2
mi] lion equivalent.
4. 33     The 95 weigh bridges for DNER will be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding and in accordence with the Bank's "Guidelines"
as eyx] aired in the previous paragraph0  The installation of the weigh bridges
will comnence in the middle of 1975 and will take some 12 months.

4034      As stated in paragraph L-05, DNER intends to continue using
INGEROUTE (France) to assist DNER's supervisory and coordinating agency.
Consultants for the maintenance programs in Rio Grande do Sul and
Minas Gerais, for assistance to DNER's maintenance department, and for
carrying out studies and engineering will be contracted according to the
guidelines for "Uses of Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers".
INGEROUTE will stay until the completion of construction works, the con-
sultants for the maintenance programs will stay for the duration of the
programs, the consultants for DNER's maintenance department will commence
their work in early 1975 and stay until early 1979 and the consultants for
studies and engineering will start in early 1975 and complete their work
in about 24 months.
4135      During the First and the Second Highway Projects, difficulties
were experienced by delays on the part of the Central Bank of Brazil in
registering foreign consultants' contracts. Since registration is legally
required before any payments in foreign currency can be made under a con-
tract, satisfactory conclusion of registration procedures for foreign
consultants and experts is a condition for disbursements under the main-
tenance part of the project.
I. Disbursements
4.36      The expected start and duration of the project components are
given in paragraphs L427 (construction), 4.31 (maintenance programs), 4.33
(procurement and installation of weigh bridges) and 4.34 (consultant ser-
vices), and the schedule of estimated disbursements (Tsble 4) was prepared
on this basis.
4037      The loan will be to the Federal Government, and DNER will admin-
ister a revolving fund for payments to contractors, suppliers and consult-
ants and to state DER's. The Federal Government will finance the cost of
all construction and consulting services, and the states will be reimbursed
such amounts as are expended on state highways0 The revolving fund will be
replenished with the Bank's reimbursement for payments made and with the
contribution of the Federal and State Governments0 During loan negotiat-
ions, assurances were obtained that DNER will establish a revolving fund
with an initial deposit by DNER of Cr$ 22.0 million in a special account
at a suitable Brazilian bank, and establishment of the revolving fund is a
condition for loan effectiveness. A further assurance was obtained that
DNER will make deposits in the revolving fund as required, so that, at the
beginning of each calender month, the amount in the revolving fund will be
at a level sufficient to cover one month of forward project cost, in ac-
cordance with work schedules. The experience with the revolving funds for
the earlier four projects has been satisfactory.
4038      Any surplus of funds remaining in the loan account on completion
of the project may be used to finance items related to the project, as
agreed between the Government and the Bank.

5. ECOu0'IGaC EVALUATION
A. General
-.Ol      Road transport, which in 1972 carried about 73% of Brazil's total
ton-kin and, about 95Sf of total passenger-kmn, is by far the most irnportant mode
of transport in Brazil.  Following a substaintial increase during the last few
years in the demand for bulk transport (mainly of agricultural products and
iron and steel-related products) and the impact of the world energy crisis,
priority has noi been given to the railway subsector. However, even though
rail trensport is going to be more attractive and efficient than before on
mediiu and. long hauls, one cannot expect, in the near term, a substantial
shift in the present rail/road traffic allocation because:
(a)  considering the size and characteristics of the road and
rail networks and operations, the share of the road traffic
that could be economically diverted to rail is likely to be
small; and
(b) the railroad has, in the short term, a limited capacity for
accommodatirg new traffic.
Considering that railway traffic (iron and steel excluded) is expected to
increase 7$,. over the next five years, as forecast in the RFFSA five-year
plan, the highway sector would still have to absorb more than 55% (about 50
billion ton-km) of the increased transport demand resulting from the economic
growth of the country, assuming a growth rate of the GNP of 8% per year. The
preliminary results of the updated Highway Master Plan (para. 3.05) indicate
that highway investments would still continue to be relatively hi Th in the
future, including new road construction and upgrading of existing roads.
5.02      Considering the need for highway investments to cope with the ex-
pected road transport demand and for the strengthening of road maintenance,
DIER has programmed a total five-year budget for 1975-1979 (Table 5).  Total
expenditures would increase from US$1.8 billion in 1975 to US$2.8 billion in
1979.  The major items of expenditure are for construction, maintenance and
depreciation coverage for the federal highway network and also DNER's part-
icipation in the DER's investment and maintenance expenditures.  The major
resources are the fuel taxes and the road taxes, while external and local
financing, albeit Cr$ 2.0 billion (approximately US$270 million) over the
five years, accounts for merely 2.5$ of the total resources.  The highway
construction included in the proposed project would represent about 11% of
Federal Government investments in construction on federal roads in 1975-1977.
B. Highway Construction and Upgrading
5.03      The economic analysis of the proposed road works was carried out by
Brazilian firms following a methodology reviewed and agreed with the Bank and



- 16 -
using vehicle operating costs computed by DNER (Table 6). In the preparation
of the proposed project, particular attention was given to the justification
for highway improvement or construction parallel to already existing trans-
port facilities and to highway widening from two to four or more lanes0
Traffic forecasts prepared by the Brazilian firms for the proposed works
have been reviewed, and some of them. have been substantially reduced (Table 7).
Except for a few cases, only savings in vehicle operating costs have been
auantified as a benefit in the economic evaluation of the construction or
upgrading of the proposed roads. For each road, the economic return has been
computed over a period of 20 years, the normal lifetime of the proposed pro-
ject. Nevertheless, some proposed investments might be obsolete in 12 or 15
years, due to the fact that demand for transport may shift over time from
mode to mode or as a result of unforeseen changes in the pattern of economic
developrrent.  To be sure that, under such circumstances, the proposed projects
would still be immediately needed, the benefit/cost ratio, based on a 10%
interest rate, was also computed over a 12-year period. Economic return,
bene-fit/cost ratio and first year benefits are given for each proposed road in
Table 8.
5.04      Itoad freight prices and profits are at competitive levels, and,
consequently, a large share of the benefits of road improvements are expected
to accrue to non-users (producers and consumers) through reduction in road
transport prices.  During the past years, tariffs in relation to other costs
have been lowered following reduction in road transport costs, due to the
rapid expansion and improvement of the road network.  For example, between
1967 and 1972, the average tariff per ton-km for road transport over distances
longer then 1,200 kIm has been reduced by about 20M  in real terms.
5.05      Detailed information for each project road is given in Annex 2 arfi
in Tables 7 and 8. All of the proposed roads are economically justified with
econonic returns ranging from about 17% to 39%O.  The benefit/cost ratio, com-
puted over 12 years, ranges from 1.16 to 2.61, and the first year return
ranges from 13% to 40% of the cost, indicating that all the proposed roads
should be built immediately, even assuming that they could be obsolete in a
12-year period. These data also indicate that all roads proposed for con-
struction will still be feasible for a 12-year life, with construction cost
increase or benefit decrease of up to 16% for the Jatai-Canal do Sao Simao
road and up to 45% or more for the other roads.
C.  Highwa.y Maintenance Program
5. 06     The proposed maintenance programs will yield the following benefits:
(a)   eduction of the total maintenance costs due to the reduction
of the dual maintenance organizations of DIER and DER's;
(b) Avoiding increase in future vehicle operating costs if the
roads were not adequately maintained, and savings in operating'
costs because of the improvements carried out; and



- 17 -
(c) Saving of costs since the lengthening of the useful life
of the roads would mean a postponement of future rehabili-
tation works.
5.07      The economic evaluation of the maintenance program was done only
for Minas Gerais, a state in which a great amount of reliable data on
maintenance cost, traffic density, etc., was available. The following
benefits have been computed in the economic analysis (Annex 1):
(a)  Savings in total maintenance cost computed b  comparing
the maintenance cost with and without the project; and
(b)  Savings in vehicle operating cost due to road improve-
ment on about 40% of the network, presently very poorly
maintained.
The economic return of the maintenance program in Minas Gerais, calculated
on this basis, is about 28%.
5.08      Since climate and materials are adverse to highway maintenance,
the actual condition of the highway network in Rio Grande do Sul is worse
than that in Minas Gerais; therefore, the impact of the proposed maintenance
program will be greater in Rio Grande do Sul.  Although, for lack of avail-
able information, it has not been possible to compute the benefits resulting
from the proposed maintenance program in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, it
can be expected that they will be greater in this state than in the state
of Minas Gerais.
D. Technical Assistance to DNER and Installation of Weigh Bridges
5.09      The technical assistance to DNER for highway maintenance is ex-
pected to help the DNER Maintenance Directorate to prepare the delegation
of road maintenance to the states and also to take the necessary steps to
ensure a satisfactory maintenance of federal highways located in the states
presently not ready for receiving delegation of federal highway maintenance.
The installation of weigh bridges, by reducing the overloading of trucks, may
reduce the road maintenance expenditures, ceteris paribus, by about 4.2%,
resulting in a first-year benefit of near 1006 of cost (details in Annex 5).
5.10      As an average, the economic return for the proposed project is
about 28%, with all the items suitable for Bank financing.



6. AGREENENTS REACHED AND RECONMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment on:
(a) the location of 95 weigh bridges to be installed on federal
roads (para. 4.12);
(b) the type of roadworks that will be classified as rehabilitation
and the criteria for selection of such roads (para. 4.15);
(c) the selection of roads for feasibility studies (para. 4.16);
(d) the division of civil works into lots for bid purposes (para.
4.28); and
(e)  cost estimates and expenditure  schedales for the maintenance
programs in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais, and amendment
of the schedules for annual delegation of roads from DNER to
the DER's (para. 4.31).
6.02      During loan negotiations, the Government's assurances were
obtained on:
(a) a study of road user charges to be undertaken by the Govern-
ment (para. 3.07);
(b) the enforcement of axle load regulations on all federal roads
and on state roads in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais (para.
3.18);
(c) strengthening of DNER's maintenance department with at least
four experienced Brazilian professionals to work with the
international experts (para. 4.11);
(d) timely acquisition of right-of-way for construction works
(para. 4.29); and
(e) establishment and replenishment of the revolving fund (para. 4.37).
6.03      Condition for loan effectiveness is the establishment of a revolving
fund (para. 4.37).
6.04      Disbursements under the maintenance part of the project are con-
ditional on:
(a) satisfactory conclusion of subsidiary agreements between INER
and the States of Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais (para. 4.30);



- 19 -
(b)  signature of contracts with two experts for DNER
(para 4.10), and registration of these contracts
with the Central Bank of Brazil (para 4.35); and
(c) signature of contracts with consulting firms for
the maintenance programs in the two states (para
4.31), and registration of these consultant's
contracts with the Central Bank of Brazil (para
4.35).
6.05      Disbursements under the highway construction part of the loan
will be conditional on signature of the contract with the coordinating
consultant (para 4.05), and registration of the contract with the Central
Bank of Brasil (para 4.35).
6.06      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$110
million equivalent. On the basis of the duration of the project, and the
life of the facilities to be provided under the loan, the appropriate term
would be 20 years, including a grace period of five years.

ANNEX 1

BRAZIL
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Highway Maintenance Programs in the States of
Rio Grande Do Sul and Minas Gerais
A. Federal Network
1.        As of June 1974, the federal highway network under maintenance
comprised about 34,200 km of paved roads and 22,300 km of earth and
gravel roads. In addition, about 7,100 km of roads were under improvement
or reconstruction. DNER, using its own forces, was directly responsible
for maintenance of about 15,300 km, or 45%, of the paved highway network
and was using contractors for maintenance of about 5,600 km, or 16% of
the paved network. Maintenance of the remaining 13,300 km (39%) had been
delegated to the states, but about 7,300 km of these were without provision
of funds by DNER (about 4,100 km were located in Sao Paulo State; see
details in Attachment 1 to this Annex).
2.        For many years, it has been the policy of DNER to delegate most
of the federal highway maintenance to the state DER's and to gradually
reduce its own maintenance organization. Nevertheless, between 1971 and
1974, delegation of federal road maintenance did not keep pace with the
development of the paved federal highway network (Attachment 2). During
that period, the paved federal highway network increased by about 8,000 km,
but delegation of road maintenance to the states was increased by only
about 2,200 km, of which about 1,500 km were delegated without funds.
DNER's own maintenance organization took care of maintaining an additional
4,050 km, and maintenance of the remaining 1,750 km of tne increase was
given to contractors. This gap between the increase in the length of
the federal highway network and the delegation of road maintenance to
the state DER's resulted primarily from the inability of the state DER's
to maintain the delegated roads adequately and the subsequent and under-
standable reluctancy of DNER to delegate further.
3.        A program of pilot maintenance regions, encouraged by the Bank
and started in 1971, is resently in progress in six states (Rio Grande
do Sul, Santa Catarina, -/ Parana, Minas Gerais, Bahia and Pernambuco),
covering more than 6,600 km (Attachment 3). The analysis of the results
obtained in these pilot regions helped to define the weaknesses of the
state DER's and led to the conclusion that a full delegation of federal
1/ The pilot program has not yet actually started in Santa Catarina,
because the stretches involved -- which were originally constructed
by the Army -- are now being improved and paved.

road maintenance would not be possible without strengthening of the
state DER's maintenance divisions. While, therefore, the pilot regions
have been very useful in preparing the states for receiving federal
roads for maintenance, DNER agreed to conduct a strengthening program
for two state highway departments where pilot regions have proven to
be successful and where the DER's have been reorganized -- but not
necessarily sufficiently strengthened -- had have demonstrated ability
to maintain their own network when given appropriate assistance. It
is proposed to start this program in Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais
in 1975 and, two years later, in Parana, Bahia and Pernambuco. At the
same time, DNER will continue with the pilot regions and, in 1974, new
regions were established in the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba,
Maranhao and Mato Grosso involving about 1,800 Ian of earth and gravel
roads and 250 Ian of paved roads. (Attachment 4).
B. The Present Road Maintenance Situation in the States of Rio Grande
do Sul and Minas Gerais
4.        Rio Grande do Sul has a total road network of about 11,700 km,
of which about 3,000 km are federal roads. About 600 km of federal
roads have been delegated to the state for maintenance in the pilot
regions (Attachment 3) and about 400 km to the Army.  The State Highway
Department (DAER/RS) is maintaining about 9,400 km, or 80% of the
entire network of the state. DAER/RS has recently been restructured;
in particular, upon the Bank's insistance, maintenance and force account
construction have been separated (Chart 1). Road maintenance is carried
out through 15 sectors belonging to DAER/RS (residencias), which report
directly to DAER/RS' headquarters in Porto Alegre, and through 11 sectors
under the responsibility of DNER. DAER/RS has about 7,000 employees, of
whom 5,560, until the recent reorganization, were in the maintenance
division, but also engaged in force account construction. DNER has
about 4,600 employees, of whom about 3,500 are engaged in road maintenance.
5.        Minas Gerais has a total road network of about 20,400 km; about
7,200 km are federal roads. At present, about 3,700 km of federal roads
are delegated to the state for maintenance, of which about 1,400 km
without funds, a fact which has been a point of contention in Minas
Gerais for several years. The State Highway Department (DER/MG) is now
maintaining about 16,900 km, or about 83%, of the entire road network
in the state. DER/MG has been restructured following GEIPOT's recom-
mendations (Chart 2). Road maintenance is carried out through 30
sectors (residencias) which are supervised by five inspectors from
MER/MG's head office in Belo Horizonte and through 19 sectors under
the responsibility of DNER. DER/MG has 13,200 employees, of whom
10,000 are engaged in maintenance, and DNER about 4,000 employees, of
whom about 3,500 are engaged in road maintenance.
6.          Although these two states are more advanced in highway maintenance
than most of the others, the maintenance of their highway networks is far
from satisfactory. This is mainly due to inadequate maintenance-organization,
lack of appropriate equipment and lack of adequately trained staff in both
the DER's and DNER. This is aggravated by a wasteful parallelism between
the DER's and DNER, resulting in an uneconomic use of equipment and personnel.



ANNEX 1

7.        Maintenance Organization:  In both states, efficiency of opera-
tions and supervision are hindered by the lack of an intermediate
level between the sectors and the headquarters in the ca'ital. In Rio
Grande do Sul, 15 sectors, and in Minas Gerais, 30 sectors, report
directly to the chief of the maintenance division of the state highway
department.  Districts (com-rrising four or five sectors) should be
introduced, and then boundaries and location of headquarters should
take into consideration the disappearance of DNER's maintenance operations.
8.        Eq2ioment:  Despite assistance from USAID and IDB (details
in Attachment 5), both DER's lack equipment, and what they have is largely
obsolete. The equipment used by DNER in these two states is also
predominantly obsolete. A program of purchase of equipment in accordance
with the needs of both DAER/RS and DER/MD, within the framework of the
proposed strengthening orogram, is urgently required.
9.        Personnel:  Despite technical assistance included in the
various loans financed by USAID and IDB, there is a serious lack of
trained people to carry out proper road maintenance. In DAER/RS, the
average age of employees is about 45 years, and there is an urgent
need for training young people to replace aging employees and for the
supply of additional manpower and know-how required for road maintenance.
In DER/MG, the problem is aggravated by an acute shortage of skilled
labor (operators and mechanics) in spite of efforts made by the management
to train people in the State's Training Center.
C.  1Maintenance Programs
10.       The maintenance programs have been structured so that they
will enable both DER's to improve the maintenance of their own road
networks and to receive the delegation of maintenance for all federal
roads within a period of six years in Rio Grande do Sul and five years
in Minas Gerais.
11.       With the new proposed structure, road maintenance in Rio
Grande do Sul will be carried out through 24 sectors and six districts
(intermediate level) instead of the present 15 sectors operated by
DAER and 11 by DNER. In Minas Gerais, maintenance will be executed
through 40 sectors and 10 districts instead of the present 30 sectors
operated by DER and 19 by DNER. With the proposed organization, each
sector will be responsible for maintaining about 550 km of roads, and
each district would cover about 2,250 km of roads. The district head-
quarters will be provided with expanded facilities, both for administration
and equipment (major equipment repairs will be made, and certain heavy,
specialized equipment will be located only in district headquarters).
The programs include financing for the building of new, and enlargement
of existing, sector and district headquarters.
12.       The program will also include the purchase of maintenance,
shop and office equipment. Both DER's have prepared lists of equipment
to be purchased, comprising the equipment needed over and above



ANNEX 1
Page 4
existing serviceable equipment. All of DNER's maintenance equipment in
these two states is considered obsolete. Trucks (including ordinary
trucks, tankers, etc.), motor graders, asphalt plants, crushing plants,
and rollers represent the main items in these lists. Part of the equip-
ment to be purchased in Rio Grande do Sul will be financed through an
IDB loan (Attachment 5) and has not been included in the project.
The programs will include provision and installation of about 26 weigh
bridges (of which about 15 mobile) in Minas Gerais and 11 weigh bridges
(of which eight mobile) in Rio Grande do Sul.
13.       Technical assistance for the planning, supervision and control
of maintenance operations, coupled with a training program which would
basically consist of on-the-spot training of personnel who will gradually
assume full responsibility in their field, is also contemplated in the
proposed program. Total technical assistance requested has been estimated
at about 650 man-months for Minas Gerais and at about 480 man-months
for Rio Grande do Sul.
14.       In summary, the pregrams consist of: (a) the building of
new and enlargement of existing sector and district headquarters (inter-
mediate level); (b) tne purchase of maintenance, shop and office equipment;
(c) the installation of weighing stations; and (d) technical assistance.
15.       Schedules for planned delegation of federal roads for maintenance
by the two states are shown in- Charts 3 and 4. However, during loan
negotiation, it was agreed that those schedules need to be updated and
that tne corrected schedules will be issued as amendments to the two
studies referred to in para. 4.31.
16.       The cost of the proposed maintenance progran, based on November
1974 prices, amounts to about US$14.1 million in Rio Grande do Sul and
about US$38.9 million in Minas Gerais (not including contingencies), as
shown below:

17.       The quite substantial cost of these projects results from the
size of the programs, e.g., the total equipment (US$27.35 million)
needed to be purchased for Minas Gerais over the next four years represents
about US$335 of equipment cost per km per year for maintenance, which
would appear to be a reasonable figure.

D. Economic Evaluation of the Maintenance Program in Minas Gerais
18.       For lack of information, tne economic evaluation has been
computed taking into account only the following benefits:
(a) savings in total maintenance cost due to the new structure
and the avoidance of the present dual maintenance organization
of DNER and DER; and
(b) savings in vehicle operating costs due to improvement
of the quality of the road network.
(i) Savings in Total Maintenance Cost
19.       DNER's and DER/MG's present accounting system does not indicate
the road maintenance expenditures separately. DNER and DER/MG estimated
them at about Cr$ 317 million in 1973 for a total network of about
20,400 km; expenditures for personnel, materials, fuel and contract
works were computed directly from the accounting figures while the depre-
ciation cost for equipment was estimated by considering the depreciation
cost of theoretically needed equipment for the quality of maintenance
carried out in 1973.
20.       The future maintenance cost for the proposed network has
been computed for 1979, when the new maintenance structure will be
fully implemented. The total need for personnel was computed by using
DER's unit cost per man-month, increased by 10% to take into account
more overhead personnel. Expenses for materials were based on actual
material expenses per kilometer of paved and gravel roads in the pilot
maintenance region. Expenses for fuel were assumed to be independent
of the maintenance structure and proportional to the length of the
road network. Depreciation of equipment was computed by assuming an
average seven years' life time for the necessary equipment. Maintenance
by contract was assumed to disappear.
21.       Total maintenance cost has been computed without the project
from 1975 to 1986 assuming that (a) the complete new organizational
structure would be set up by 1979 and that the equipment bought in
1979 with seven years' life will be used until 1986; (b) the maintenance
cost under the present structure would increase each year proportionately
with the extension of the network if tne maintenance program were not
carried out; and (c) the reduced maintenance cost resulting from the
new structure would be fully reached by 1979, and, from 1974 to 1978,
the maintenance cost would be reduced proportionately to the investment
carried out each previous year (see Attachment 6).
(ii)  Savings in vehicle Operating Cost
22.       A complete analysis of the existing network carried out
jointly by DER/14G and the Bank shows that about 40% of the paved and
gravel roads are presently poorly maintained, resulting in abnormally



ANNEX 1
Page 7
high vehicle operating costs.  It is always difficult in the absence
of comprehensive studies, to ascertain the saving in vehicle operating
costs due to high standards of maintenance. Recent studies carried
out by DNER and Transplan (Brazil) on vehicle operating costs compute
the savings resulting from improvements of a paved road or gravel road
from poor to regular to good (Attachment 7). The appraisal mission
agreed with DER/1G that, as a conservative hypothesis, improving maintenance
would reduce vehicle operating costs by about 5% on paved roads, and
10% on gravel roads. Average traffic density has been estimated at
.1,485 vehicles per day on paved roads and 200 vehicles per day on gravel
-ioads. For analytical purposes, the traffic density has been maintained
-constant over the 13 years of the project.
23.       As for total maintenance cost, benefits resulting from better
maintenance would be fully reached by 1979. From 1974 to 1978, benefits
are assumed to be proportional to previous year's investments, in relation
to the total investment program.
B. Investment Cost
24.       The investment program will be carried out over about five
years, and will be completed by the end of 1979. Nevertneless, since
about 50% of the life of the needed equipment (mainly trucks) will be
about four years, some additional investments were included over the
complete life of the project to replace this portion of equipment when
obsolete (these costs are not included in the proposed project).
F. Economic Return
25.       Even by considering only the above benefits, the economic
return is about 28%, and the project is suitable for Bank financing.

Technical Assistance Alreadr Received by
DAER/RS and DER/MG
A. Rio Grande do Sul
1.        DAER/RS is presently receiving financial assistance from USAID
under Loan Agreement No. 512-L-069, amounting to US$5.o million. US$3.9
million of this loan are to be used for maintenance equipment, and US$1.1
million for technical assistance and training. The consultants for this
project - a Brazilian-foreign joint venture (Montor-Montreal, Brazil and
Frederick R. Harris, USA) - started to work in March 1971. Their contracts
expired at the end of April 1974,but have been extended to March 1975.
2.        In addition to the USAID Loan, the Interamerican Development
Bank has agreed to finance US$5.0 million worth of maintenance equipment
under a loan agreement which DWER signed in September 1971 for the
construction of three federal roads in the state (IDB Loan Agreement 301/SF-BR).
This loan expires in March 1976. It is clearly specified in this loan agreement
that the equipment should be used for the maintenance of federal and state roads
in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
3.        In discussions with USAID and IDB it has been ascertained that
the proposed project will not conflict with their programs, but will rather
be supplementary to these programs, and will help towards achieving the
goals set forth.
B. Minas Gerais
4.        The DNER of Minas Gerais has received assistance from USAID in
form of a US$20 million loan. Consultants (Brown and Root, US) were
employed until the end of 1970 and the last disbursements for equipment
purchases under this loan are expected to be made by the end of 1974.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Highways For Construction and Upgrading
Road BR-101, Feira de Santana-Esplanada (131 km)
lo        This road section, located in the state of Bahia, is the last link
to complete the litoral connection between Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza. The
through traffic between the South and the Northeast of the country travelling
this section was about 750 vehicles per day in 1973. The present route is
about 170 km., most of it on poor gravel roads. The proposed new road will
offer a good paved connection, reducing the transit distance by about 40 km.
The road will cross a relatively unpopulated area, but with very good condi-
tions for cattle raising, especially in the area near Esplanada. In the
opening year (1977), total traffic is expected to reach about 940 vehicles
per day on the southern half of the road and about 1,280 on the northern
half. By 1997, total traffic is expected to increase to about 3,h00 and
over 5,200 vehicles per day, respectively.
2.        The proposed road will be in mountainous, rolling and flat terrain
over about 20 km, 45 km and 66 km, respectively.  In line with the character-
istics of the recently completed parts of BR-101, the platform width will be
12.2 m, with an asphalt-concrete width of 7.2 m.
3.        Considering the benefits resulting from savings in vehicle operat-
ing cost, construction of both parts of the road is economically feasible.
The economic return., computed over 20 years, is about 24% and the first year
benefit about 16% of cost (Table 8 of the report). The benefit/cost ratio
computed over only 12 years is about 1.6.
BR-040, Bingen-Juiz de Fora (141 km)
4.        Road BR-040 starts at the junction of Avenida Brasil, main access
road to Rio de Janeiro, and ends up in Brasilia, passing very important in-
dustrial centers such as Juiz de Fora and Belo Horizonte. On the first 22 km
of BR-040 out of Rio, traffic on the already existing four-lane divided high-
way reaches about 35,000 vehicles per day, decreasing to about 11,000 vehicles
per day on the 20 km up to Bingen, where traffic is split between a new two-
lane road descending the plateau and the old two-lane road ascending, From
Bingen to Juiz de Fora, the existing two-lane road, running in very hilly
terrain, supports a traffic ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day,
according to section. All traffic presently passes through the center of
Juiz de Fora, creating serious congestion problems.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        A railway line, which has recently been improved with Bank financ-
ing (Railways I, Loan 786-BR), runs practically parallel to the highway, but
it is highly specialized for iron ore traffic and not well suited for general
cargo. Even assuming that part of the road freight traffic would be diverted
to the railway, road traffic is still expected to increase rapidly, due to
the development of Rio and of Belo Horizonte. Thus, by 1997, the traffic
should reach about 140,000 vehicles per day on the first 22 km near Rio,
about 62,000 vehicles per day on the following 20 km up to Bingen and between
30,000 and h4,000 vehicles per day on the sections thereafter.  Presently,
the road is highly congested, and the existing facilities will not be able
to absorb this forecast traffic.
6.        The proposed project includes 103 km of widening from two to four
lanes of the existing road between Bingen and Mlatias Barbosa (near Juiz de
Fora) and 38 km of construction of a two-lane highway as bypass around Juiz
de Fora. (The widening from four to six lanes of the first 22 km from
Avenida Brasil and the provision of a new three-lane road for traffic climb-
ing the escarpment for the next 20 km, up to Bingen, will be financed by
Government from other sources.) Between Bingen arnd Matias Barbosa, the pro-
posed highway will follow the alignment of the existing one, except for a
few shortcuts (in particular, near Tres Rios) and the road will be mostly
in rolling terrain.  The platforn width will be 25.5 m with two asphalt
concrete carriageways, each 7.2 m wide. The bypass of Juiz de Fora, which
is also mostly in rolling terrain, will have a platform width of 12.2 m with
an asphalt concrete carriageway of 7.2 m width.
7.        The benefits of the proposed project have been conputed by consider-
ing savings in vehicle operating costs for the various sections of the road.
Traffic on each section is different, but all sections are economically justi-
fied, with economic return, computed over 20 years, ranging from about 20% to
about 35%. The economic return for the total project is about 32% and the
first year benefit about 21% of cost. The benefit/cost ratio, computed over
12 years, is about 2.1.
Road BR-277, Curitiba-Campo Largo (22 km)
8.        All highway traffic originating in the west and central part of
Parana, one of the most important agricultural areas of Brazil, feeding
through Roads BR-376 and BR-277 to Curitiba and the Port of Paranagua, must
pass this 22-km road section. The present traffic density (between 5,000
and 6,000 ADT) is very high, trucks represent between 30% and 40% of the
total traffic, and the existing two-lane highway is congested. With improve-
ment of the railway lines in Parana, part of the freight traffic will be
diverted to the railway.  Even assuming, however, that 50% of the freight
traffic will be so diverted, road traffic will increase substantially in
the future, following the important agricultural products export program
and the development of Curitiba, and is expected to reach more than 40,,000
vehicles per day by 1997.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
9.        The widening of the existing facility from two to four lanes is
urgently needed to avoid creating a bottleneck for the export of agricultural
products. The proposed highway will mainly follow the alignment of the exist-
ing road and will connect with the Curitiba-Paranagua highway through the
southern bypass of Curitiba, presently under construction. The platform
width will be 22.5 m with two asphalt concrete carriageways of 7.2 m width
each.
10.       By considering only the benefits resulting from savings in vehicle
operating costs, the economic return, computed over 20 years, is about 39%
and the first year benefit is about 20% of cost. The benefit/cost ratio com-
puted over 12 years is about 2.6.
Road BR-496, Corinto-Pirapora (141 km)
11.       The growing industrial center of Pirapora, located on the Sao
Francisco river, needs effective connection with the main trunk highway net-
work. Present traffic (about 350 ADT) is quite low, but the poor condition
of the existing gravel road hampers the development of the industrial center,
which is presently suffering from the high C08t of transport. Road traffic
is expected to reach more than 1,600 vehicles per day by 1997.
12.       An existing railway line runs practically parallel to the proposed
road.  The present traffic density (about 90,000 ton-km per year) is very low,
and substantial track improvement would be needed to upgrade the line to an
acceptable standard. The industrial production in Pirapora is highly diver-
sified and not really suitable for rail transport.  In any event, even by
assuming that all freight traffic would use rail transport, the total traffic
density would not allow for an economic operation of the line. Therefore the
project includes upgrading the existing gravel road. The Government has
agreed to undertake a study to determine whether the railway operation should
either be reduced substantially or phased out.
13.       The proposed road will mainly follow a new alignment in rolling
terrain with better and shorter alignment than the existing gravel road. The
platform width will be 12.2 m with a 7.2 m wide carriageway with double sur-
face treatment.
14.       Considering only savings in vehicle operating costs, the oerc_irac
return computed over 20 years is about 21%, and the first year benef't is
about 15%.  The benefit/cost ratio computed over 12 years is ab-out 1,
Road BR-364, Jatai-Canal do S§o Simao (177 km)
15.       This road section is the last link to complete the paving of the
Sao Paulo-Cuiaba (capital city of M1to Grosso state) connection, paving of
which was partly financed under a previous Bank project.  Present transit
traffic between Jatai and Canal do Sao Simao (about 300 vehicles per day)
is running on a bad gravel road which is deteriorating rapidly. The area



ANNEX 2
page 4
crossed by the proposed road is highly suitable for cattle production (total
number of heads estimated at about 2 million in 1973). Presently, about half
of the cattle production is transported on hoof, resulting in substantial
loss of weight. In order to enhance the agricultural development of the
region, which has started only recently, the paving of the road is urgently
needed. Also, construction of the hydroelectric plant at Canal do S30 Simlo
by Centrais Electricas de Ninas Gerais (CEMIG), assisted by Bank financing,
will be of great importance in the development of the area under study and,
hence, will generate traffic.  Total traffic is expected to reach about 1,900
vehicles per day by 1997, about half of which would be trucks carrying mainly
cattle.
16.       The proposed road will go around the future artificial lake, re-
sulting from the construction of the electric plant, and will then follow
the aligrment of the existing road up to Jatai with about 20% of the road
in flat, and 80% in rolling terrain. The platform width will be 12.2 m
with a 7.2 m wide carriageway with double surface treatment.
17.       The economic return computed over 20 years is about 17% and the
first year benefit about 13% of cost. Benefit/cost ratio, computed over 12
years, is about 1.16.

BRAZIL
FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Detailed Engineering for New Construction
1. Road BR-226 - Porto Franco-Gra.iau (156-BR). This road, located in the
state of Maranhro, will help develop the western part of the state.  The present
traffic ranges between 240 and 270 vehicles per day and is increasing at about
8% per year. The updated Highway Masterplan recommends improvement and
paving of the road by 1975. The internal economic return on the proposed
investment is estimated at about 32%.
2. Road BR-llO - Petrolandia-Ribeira do Pombal (224-hm).  This road, located
in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco, forms part of an important regional
network, serving both local and long-distance traffic in the Northeast and
providing the most direct link between Salvador and Fortaleza. The present
traffic ranges between 270 and 500 vehicles per day and is increasing at about
10% per year. The updated Masterplan recommends improvement and paving of the
existing low-quality gravel road by 1977. The internal economic return of
the proposed investment is estimated at about 20%.
3.  Road BR-277/376 - Campo Largo-Ponta Grossa (102 km).  This road section,
located in Parana, is part of a road that will provide an alternative export
route through the port of Paranagua fIr products from the central part of Brazil,
thus relieving the pressure on the Port of Santos. The present traffic, about
4,850 vehicles per day (45% trucks) is expected to reach about 40,000 vehicles
per day by 1996. The road needs widening from two to four lanes; the estimated
internal economic return is about 19%.
4.  Road BR-163/467 - Toledo-Guaira (101 km).  This route will link the regional
centers of Toledo and Guaira in western Parani, in which large increase in
agricultural production (soy beans, wheat and dairy products) are taking place,
and will facilitate the region's access to the main highway network, via Parana's
east-west spine road BR-277. The present traffic ranges between 1,100 and
2,200 vehicles per day and is expected to reach 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles per
day by 1996. The internal economic return of the proposed investment is about
35%.
5.  Road BR-369 - Jandaia do Sul-Fenix (61 kn).  The M4asterplan indicates that
this road, located in the State of Parana, is not adequate for its present
traffic (about 800 vehicles per day) and needs urgently to be improved. The
internal economic return of the proposed investment is about 35%.
6. Road BR-158 - Col.Vivida-Jct. BR-282 (143 km). This route links southeastern
Parana with Santa Catarina. The region has active colonizatVon where agricultural
production as well as pig raising is increasing rapidly.  The present traffic,
about 680 vehicles per day, is expected to reach about 5,000 vehicles per day by
1996. The internal economic return of the proposed investment is about 16%.
7.  Road BR-471 - Fncruzilhada do Sul-Jet. BR-290 (45 km).  7his low-quality  ravel
road, located in Rio Grande do Sul, is not adequate for the existing traffic (about
1,500 vehicles per day). The Masterplan emphasizes the urge-icy of its improvement,
and the internal economic return of the proposed investment is about 40%.

FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Economic Evaluation of Installation of Weigh bridges
1.        The proposed project includes financing of weigh bridges, to
be installed on federal highways (Table ). Origin-destination surveys,
carried out during feasibility studies financed under the Third Highway
Project, indicated that at least 20% of the trucks were overloaded by
20% or more, resulting in considerable damage to the roads and in higher
highway maintenance expenses. This economic evaluation assumes that,
with the installation of weih bridges and enforcemebt  of highway regula-
tions by the police, the incidence of overloaded trucks would be halved.
2.        The economic feasibility of the installation of weigh bridges
was calculated assuming that the deterioration of a road and, hence,
the variable cost of highway maintenance per km, is directly proportional
to the number of equivalent axle load repetitions. There is substantial
evidence that the cumulative damage to a road increases with about the
fourth power of the ratio of the actual axle load to the standard axle
load; hence, the number of standard axle load repetitions, n of a
given axle loan A may be expressed by the formula n = (A/A)4 where A.
is the standard axle loan, here arbitrarily chosen as 9 tons.
3.        To compute the variable maintenance cost, it was roughly
estimated that total highway maintenance by DNER on its federal highway
network (approximately 59,000 km) was about US$170 million in 1973,
and that the fixed cost per km was about US$1,500 per km, resulting
in a variable cost of about US$1,380 per kilometer, or 47% of total
maintenance cost.
4.        Since specific information regarding the number of vehicles
per category on federal roads is not available, it was assumed that
the number of vehicles in the different categories plying the federal
highway network is proportional to the number in each category of
vehicles registered in the country, multiplied by their average hauling
distance per year (20,000 kmfor cars and 60,000 Iam for trucks and
buses). This hypothesis is conservative since a large part of the car
fleet is used on city streets.
5.        The total number of equivalent axle loads was computed (a)
with installation of the weigh bridges, assuming then that 40% of the
trucks would be empty, 50% fully loaded at their authorized capacity
and 10% overloaded by 20%; and (b) without installation of the meigh
bridges, assuming that 20% of the trucks would be overloaded by 20%,
40% fully loaded at their authorized capacity, and 40% empty. In the
"without" case, the yearly total truck-km wre reduced proportionately
with the percentage of overloaded trucks, assuming a 20% overload.
The above computation, done by using the breakdown of the vehicle
fleet by categories as given in Table 7 of the TSB, indicates that
in the "without" case, total equivalent axle road repetitions are
about 9% higher than in the "with" case.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.        The above calculation represents the total number of equivalent
axle loads plying all Brazilian roads (state and federal). However, it
may be assumed that the reduction of equivalent axle loads on the federal
highway network by the installation of weigh bridges will be in the same
percentage, 9%, resulting in a corresponding saving in variable maintenance
costs of 9%.
7.        Considering that the variable maintenance cost represents
about 47% of the total maintenance cost, a saving of 9% in variable
maintenance cost would amount to about US$7.2 million in 1973. The
first year benefits of the installation of the weigh bridges at a
total cost of US$6 million would thus exceed 100%. Even assuming that
the variable maintenance cost is only 20% of the total cost, the first
year benefit of the proposed project would still be very high (about
5%).
