The Project's objectives were to: (a) expand\n            production, especially of exportable products and increase\n            farmers' profitability; (b) improve NationalDevelopment\n            Bank's (BNF) operating efficiency and enhance its\n            resource mobilization capacity; and (c) stimulate the\n            participation of private banks (PB) in agricultural lending.\n            Overall the project outcome was rated marginally\n            satisfactory. Overall Bank performance was rated marginally\n            satisfactory. Project preparation and supervision were\n            satisfactory, but appraisal was considered deficient.\n            Overall the borrower's performance is rated\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned from the\n            implementation of the Project were: (a) it is difficult to\n            enforce a loan covenant which requires compliance from a\n            party which has no role in the Project; (b) a financial\n            intermediary such as BNF must be financially viable to\n            achieve its TA objectives; (c) A more realistic assessment\n            of risks and external contributing factors is required at\n            project appraisal; and (d) the project should include\n            measurable indicators of success, so that performance can be\n            more accurately assessed during implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T11:22:03Z"}
