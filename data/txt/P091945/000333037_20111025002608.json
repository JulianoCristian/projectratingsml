The main reasons for need\n            for extension are: a) during the political crisis all\n            experts left Tebbin site for at least two months and when\n            they came back the working hours were too short due to the\n            safety. It was difficult to arrange with the contractors to\n            prepare the final spare parts lists so the schedule of\n            delivery of spare parts was delayed; b) many spare parts\n            were delivered but not paid for because it is still under\n            inspection; and c) due to closing of the contracts the last\n            amendment normally takes more time to settle pending items."}, "docdt": "2011-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
