satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            project design had emphasized the need for further reforms\n            in the power sector, but proposed that the reforms and the\n            pace of reform were government owned. In addition, the\n            placement of conditions or rigid covenants was considered\n            inappropriate. With the benefit of hind sight, such\n            strategic project design indeed had helped restore\n            confidence between the government and the Bank, and\n            facilitated other policy dialogue. The experience of this\n            Project has shown that it would not be practical to halt\n            power project implementation when difficult power sector\n            reforms were placed on hold. There were clear benefits of\n            having parallel tracks for project implementation and close\n            dialogue on resuming sector reforms. This approach has led\n            to successful project implementation and meaningful\n            consultation with the authorities on sector reforms.<BR><BR>"}, "docdt": "2012-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
