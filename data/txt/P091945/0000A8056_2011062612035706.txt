                         The project development objectives are to: (i) assist the GOE in enhancing the provision of energy supply in a sustainable manner, through investment in new
                         generation capacity, and (ii) help the GOE strengthen sector performance by engaging in policy dialogue and supporting measures aimed at improving financial
                         performance, the functions of the regulator and energy efficiency. Input would also be provided to the development of the legal framework for the sector.
