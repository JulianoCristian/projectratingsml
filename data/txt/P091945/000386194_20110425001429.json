Construction and\n            commissioning of El-Tebbin power plant has been completed.\n            The plant, which consists of two identical units of 350 MW,\n            has been put into commercial operation and has passed the\n            reliability test. Performance tests for both units were\n            successfully concluded in December 2010. Of the total\n            US$259.60 million amount of loan, US$220.22 million has been\n            disbursed to date. A delay by the contractor responsible for\n            the mechanical equipment and pipe installation and the delay\n            in preparing the final list of required spare parts caused a\n            delay in the delivery of spare parts under a related\n            contract for supply and installation of the steam turbine\n            generator, financed by the World Bank loan. In addition\n            further delays in supply and installation of steam generator\n            and auxiliaries including start up and commissioning\n            resulted in disbursement during January, February 2011 as a\n            result of Egypt's political crisis. Because of the\n            delay, an amount of Euro14.8 million (equivalent to about\n            US$ 20.1 million or 7.8 percent of the loan) is expected to\n            be withdrawn after the original closing date of April 30,\n            2011 to cover spare parts that are to be delivered also\n            after the original closing date."}, "docdt": "2011-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
