                                   Restructuring Paper


1.     The project was approved of February 16, 2006, with the objective to assist the
Borrower in enhancing energy supply in a sustainable manner and strengthening the
power sector performance.

2.     Construction and commissioning of El-Tebbin power plant has been completed.
The plant, which consists of two identical units of 350 MW, has been put into
commercial operation and has passed the reliability test. Unit #1 was commissioned on
August 28, 2010 and unit #2 on September 17, 2010. Performance tests for both units
were successfully concluded in December 2010. Of the total US$259.60 million amount
of Loan, US$220.22 million has been disbursed to date.

3.     Procurement under the project has been completed. The project continues to
maintain sound financial management arrangements, including stability of staff,
consistent application of internal controls and smooth process of flow of funds. All
previous FMRs and audit reports were timely received, reviewed and found acceptable by
the Bank. Therefore, the project’s FM arrangements are “Satisfactory".

4.      A delay by the contractor responsible for the Mechanical Equipment/Pipe
Installation (package CP-118, not financed by the World Bank loan) and the delay in
preparing the final list of required spare parts caused a delay in the delivery of spare parts
under a related contract for supply and installation of the Steam Turbine Generator (CP-
106), financed by the World Bank loan. In addition further delays in Supply and
Installation (including final design) of steam generator and auxiliaries including start up
and commissioning (CP-105) resulted in disbursement during January/February 2011 as a
result of Egypt’s political crisis. Because of the delay, an amount of Euro14.8 million
(equivalent to about US$ 20.1 million or 7.8 percent of the loan) is expected to be
withdrawn after the original Closing Date of April 30, 2011 to cover spare parts that are
to be delivered also after the original Closing Date. Annex 2 details the disbursement
plan for the remaining activities under the contract. The Borrower has therefore requested
that the Closing Date for the El- Tebbin Power Project (Loan number 7359-EGT) be
extended from April 30, 2011 to October 30, 2011.

5.     This will be the first extension of the Project.

Main Reasons for the delay of payments


     1        Delay of Mechanical Equipment / Pipe Installation - by CP-118 contractor.
     2        Delay of submission of final spare parts list by contractors.
     3        Delay due to slow disbursement during time of revolution
     4        Delay of closing the punch list items
