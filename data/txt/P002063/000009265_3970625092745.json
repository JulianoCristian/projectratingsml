Development Project\n            will use some of the successful technologies developed under\n            the First Livestock Project and more recent research\n            findings. On a nationwide but selective basis, the project\n            will support the development of cattle and goats and to a\n            small extent, sheep and poultry, emphasizing the small-scale\n            private producer.  The main objective will be to increase\n            livestock production through improved nutrition and animal\n            health and thereby increase farmers' incomes.  The\n            project will include:  (i) credit for the purchase of farm\n            inputs, including imported trypano-tolerant N'Dama\n            cattle; (ii) equipment for participating institutions; and\n            (iii) settling of pastoralists on grazing reserves.  It will\n            also provide for (iv) livestock systems research; (v) a\n            manpower development and training program; (vi) technical\n            assistance; and (vii) greater involvement of the private\n            sector in supporting services.  Furthermore, funds will be\n            allocated for the (viii) establishment of a livestock\n            sectoral planning capacity for the Federal Government; and\n            (ix) for special studies of veterinary services, livestock\n            census, and project monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
