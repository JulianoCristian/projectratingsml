In addition, new textbooks\n            and educational materials are being printed. Teachers and\n            principals receive additional training and qualifications,\n            while school management and financing has been reformed. Per\n            capita financing has been introduced nationwide along with\n            an education management information system. Education is one\n            of the most vital tools for development, prosperity and\n            growth. Thus, through investing in education, Tajikistan is\n            investing in one of its most valuable assets, its human\n            capital. As Tajikistan contributes to the development of its\n            young and growing population, it is also investing in its\n            future growth and the well-being of its society at large."}, "docdt": "2012-07-30T05:02:02Z"}
