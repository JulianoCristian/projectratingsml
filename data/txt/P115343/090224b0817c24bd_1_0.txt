                         introduced nationwide; and the National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) has been completed and adopted by the Government. However, due to the severe 2011/2012
                         winter conditions the civil works on the majority of sites were suspended and resumed only in the spring of 2012, causing delays in their estimated completion date. Therefore, Bank
                         management agreed to extend the Project from September 2012 till June 2013 to complete school construction as well as the rehabilitation of the premises of the Republican Institute
                         for In-service Teacher Training (RIITT). With EPDF funds the Bank hired a local NGO to conduct a Third Party Verification of the FTI grant series in Tajikistan. The findings were
                         presented and discussed with key stakeholders in early November. On the basis of the inputs collected, the Report is being finalized.
