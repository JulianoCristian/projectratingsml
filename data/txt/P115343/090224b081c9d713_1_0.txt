                         EMIS modules were developed and introduced nationwide; and new NSED for 2012-2020 has been completed and adopted by the Government. Due to savings during
                         implementation, 6 additional schools are being rehabilitated and 3 packages for school furniture are at different stages of procurement. These activities are expected to be completed
                         by the Closing Date. Due to a late start, completion of three surveys by the project Closing Date is a concern: (i) Textbooks Revolving System operational and financial audit, (ii)
                         Review of the In-service Training Programs (INSET) and; and (iii) school transportation study. However, field worsk for all surveys have been completed and the Ministry of
                         Education is confident that these surveys will be completed by the Closing Date too.
