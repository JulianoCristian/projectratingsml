This project paper seeks your approval\n            for the extension to the closing date for the Fast Track\n            (FTI) Initiative Catalytic Fund Grant by nine months, from\n            September 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. This will be the second\n            extension for this Grant bringing the total number of\n            extended months to 24. The paper also seeks your approval\n            for the revision of the grant agreement to include the\n            rehabilitation and provision of furniture to the dormitory\n            of the Republican Institute for In-service Teacher Training\n            (RIITT) in the grant's scope of activities. The\n            extension is necessary in order to enable the recipient to\n            complete activities that have already started being\n            implemented, achieve the Project Development Objective\n            (PDO). This will be the second extension for the project,\n            amounting to a total of 24 months. Since effectiveness, the\n            project has disbursed USD 5.74 million (35.4 percent) and\n            has commitments for another USD5.4 million. Additionally,\n            there are also several important surveys planned under the\n            project that will need more time for completion.  Those\n            include: 'operational and financial audit of the\n            textbooks revolving system,' 'review of the\n            in-service training programs,' and 'school\n            transportation.'  The design of the surveys also took\n            more time than expected due to their complexity and lack of\n            adequate expertise on the client's side. An extension\n            will allow for the completion of these surveys."}, "docdt": "2012-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
