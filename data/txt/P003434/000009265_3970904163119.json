element in\n            the Government's policy to double coal output to 1,200\n            million tonnes per year (mtpy) by the year 2000. The project\n            is the first of a series of large-scale, fully mechanized\n            coal mining operations in the country. It will contribute\n            to: (a) increasing coal production by about 4.5 mtpy by the\n            early 1990s; (b) transferring technology in mine design,\n            engineering and construction (especially the highly\n            productive, mechanized longwall exploitation technology);\n            (c) introducing modern coal washing technology; and (d)\n            fostering improved management techniques for project\n            scheduling, monitoring and cost control. The project will\n            finance: (a) construction of the Changcun mine, including\n            vertical shafts, underground roadways, and longwall faces;\n            (b) construction of a coal preparation plant; (c) equipment\n            for coal extraction, washery and loadout operations; and (d)\n            surface infrastructure including a railway spur line, an\n            electrical substation, water supply lines, workshops, and warehouses."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
