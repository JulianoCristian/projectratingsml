Project Performance Assessment\n            Report (PPAR) on three projects for Cambodia: the Technical\n            Assistance (TA) Project, the Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SAC), and the Demobilization and Reintegration Project\n            (D&R). These projects are reviewed together because all\n            three dealt with aspects of public sector financial\n            management (PFM). However, the TA project and the SAC also\n            addressed many other policy and institutional issues. All\n            three projects suffered from flaws in project design and\n            supervision, and weak government commitment to certain\n            project objectives. The TA project and the D&R project\n            outcomes were rated unsatisfactory in Implementation\n            Completion Report (ICRs) and ICR reviews, and the SAC\n            outcome was rated unsatisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower was also rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory for TA and SAC, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for D&R is rated moderately\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the projects are: (i)\n            a substantial share of donor aid to Cambodia has been\n            allocated to TA, but results have been generally\n            disappointing. Too much TA has been donor-driven without\n            adequate Government involvement. This is changing in the\n            Bank-led support for the Public Financial Management Reform\n            Program (PFMRP); (ii) all three projects suffered from flaws\n            in project design. The TA project and the SAC were overly\n            broad in attempting to resolve too many problems through a\n            single operation. The SAC had an excessive number of\n            conditions which delayed effectiveness and tranche releases.\n            The D&R project failed to heed the public complaints\n            about falsification of the number of military personnel and\n            corruption in handling the military payroll; (iii) the Bank\n            was unrealistic in its assessment of the Government's\n            commitment to many of the reforms in public administration\n            and governance supported by these projects; (iv) the Bank\n            should have carried out more intensive supervision of\n            fiduciary issues in the International Development\n            Association (IDA) portfolio. However, after the findings\n            that led the Bank to declare misprocurement in the D&R\n            project, the subsequent fiduciary review and the ensuing\n            World Bank Department of Institutional Integrity (INT)\n            investigations, the Bank has now taken appropriate steps to\n            address these problems; and (v) the Bank delayed for almost\n            ten years before building up an adequate field office\n            presence, contrary to the lessons of experience in\n            post-conflict countries. This had an adverse effect on the\n            Bank's ability to supervise complex projects, to\n            maintain regular contact with government officials, and to\n            work effectively with other donors. This deficiency has been\n            corrected since 2003."}, "docdt": "2008-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
