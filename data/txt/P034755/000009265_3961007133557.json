reform program.  This will be\n            done, first, by strengthening the economic mamangement team\n            and, second, by helping put in place the foundations for an\n            environment conducive to private sector development.  To\n            achieve those objectives, IDA Credit financing will be made\n            available to mobilize consultants' services, prepare\n            and implement training programs, and provide equipment and\n            works in support of the Government's policies to be\n            carried out in the following areas: 1) public expenditure\n            control; 2) public investment management; 3) foreign debt\n            management; 4) public sector personnel management; and 5)\n            private sector development."}, "docdt": "1994-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
