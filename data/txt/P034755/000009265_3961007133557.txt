MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDED?
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO T KINEIGDOM OF CAMBODIA
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recounendation on a
proposed development credit to Cambodia for SDR 11.6 million, the equivalent of US$17 million, on
standard IDA tenns, with maturity of 40 years, to help fnance a technical assistance project.
2.         Background. After numerous years of war and internal conflict, the Government has
undertaken the task of rebuilding Cambodia. This requires implementing a series of reforms to effect
the transition from a command economy to a market-based system and provide the proper
macroeconomic framework for economic recovery and growth, as well as the development of private
sector activity. From 1989 onwards, the Government carried out a series of initial reforms in the
following areas: (i) economic liberalization (restoration of private property and liberalization of
prices); (ii) public enterprise reform, privatization, and private sector development; and (iii) trade
reform and exchange rate adjustment. Although the results of the initial market-oriented reforms
were globally positive, these reforms have yet to yield their full benefits, mainly because of the
country's extremely weak institutional setting, human resource base and overall implementation
capacity.
3.        In late 1992, the Government called on the World Bank and the IMF to help develop a
program of economic reforms and correct the flaws of the initial train of reforms. The IMF
responded by providing technical supervision to the Government program anJ the World Bank
provided technical assistance through an Institutional Development Fund ("IDF") grant. In October
1993, once the newly elected Government was in place, the Fund approved a Systemic
Transformation Facility ("STP") in support of the program. All quantitative benchmarks under the
STF-supported program were met by wide margins and structural benchmarks were also satisfied.
Encouraged by the success under the STF, in May 1994 the IMF moved from the SDR 6.25 million
STF arrangement to a three (3)-year ESAF arrangement of SDR 84 million.
4.         Although the deficiencies of the Government's initial program have been corrected, most
institutional weaknesses persist. As a result, implementation of the measures remains shallow.
IrNcremental measures are beginning to yield diminishing returns and the supply response in the
p, xductive sectors remains marginal. To correct this situation, the institutional weaknesses must be
addressed. At the same time, there is a need to deepen the adjustment process by preparing and
carrying out more fundamental reforms. This second generation of measures would necessitate a
stronger administrative and institutional capacity.
5.         Given that the reduction of the budget deficit is at the center of the Government's
efforts, the Govermment intends to first reorganize and strengthen the fiscal administration to raise
revenue substantialy over time. Second, appropriate institutional and organizational measures will be
implemented to control current expenditures. Third, the Government plans to restructure the civil
service to improve the efficiency of public administration and to reduce the burden on the budget.
Also, steps will be taken to reduce subsidies from the budget through public enterprise reform and



-2 -
privatization. Fourth, to ensure that external funds are directed to areas of high priority and
economic return and with due attention to problems of the absorptive capacity of the economy, the
Government will develop capacity to manage the substantial increase in public investtnent spending
(resulting from a surge in foreign aid) efficiently. Fifth, the Government intends to develop capacity
to manage its foreign debt. Finally, an environment conducive to private sector development will be
put in place.
6.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. This project is consistent with the limited Country
Assistance Strategy that was presented to the Board of Directors on October 26, 1993. The World
Bank supports the Government's recovery needs and priorities, as reflected in the economic report on
Cambodial prepared by the Bank at the request of the donor community. This report serves as the
basis for Government and donor coordination in Cambodia. The World Bank is expected to continue
to play a major role, providing further economic analysis and policy advice. The delivery of the
World Bank's assistance will be enhanced by the combination of an Economic Recovery Credit
operation (currently under preparation) and the present Technical Assistance Project ("Project"), both
in support of the reform process. This type of assistance will complement the support that Cambodia
is receiving from other donors. In particular, the Project will focus the Government's attention on the
set of fundamental reforms needed to effect the transition from a command economy to a market-
based system.
7.         Project Objectives. The overall objective of the Project is to assist Cambodia's
transition to a market economy by helping to implement the Government's economic reform program
(summarized above in para. 5). The Project will assist Cambodia's transition to a market economy
by helping to implement the Government's economic reform program. This will be done, first, by
strengthening the economic management team ("EMT") and, second, by helping put in place the
foundations for an environment conducive to private sector development. Strengthening the EMT will
involve: (i) reinforcing the EMT units which have already been set up under the initial phase of the
Government's reform program (e.g., the Budget Department in the Ministry of Economy and Finance
("MEF")); (ii) assisting those units which have been established only very recently (e.g., the
Cambodian Development Council, ("CDC")); (iii) setting up those units which have yet to be
established (e.g., the Debt Unit in MEF); and (iv) reorganizing and strengthening those units which
were not considered a priority so far but will play a critical role in the implementation of the
economic recovery program (e.g., budget and project monitoring units in key line ministries.) In
turn, assisting in building the foundations of an enabling environment for private sector development
will involve: (i) establishing a legal reform unit and providing legal advisory services for key
Government institutions; (ii) putting in place an Official Journal for regular publications of laws and
regulations; and (iii) establishing a system for publishing judicial decisions.
8.         Project Description. To achieve those objectives, IDA Credit fmancing will be made
available to mobilize consultants' services, prepare and implement training programs, and provide
equipment and works in support of the Government's policies to be carried out in the following areas:
(i) public expenditure control; (ii) public investment management; (iii) foreign debt management; (iv)
public sector personnel management; and (v) private sector development. The proceeds of the Credit
will also finance sector studies to improve policy design in other sectors. More specifically, the
following activities will be carried out:
' Cambodia: From Rehabilitation To Reconstruction, February 1994.



-3 -
i.   Public Expenditure Control. While the IDF operation -- to be closed by the end of
1994 -- provided support for the conception and delivery of new systems of budget
management and Treasury management, the Project will provide support for the
implementation of these new systems. Project activities will aim at: (i) strengthening
the budget preparation capacity of MEF, technical ministries, and provinces; (ii)
strengthening budget monitoring and control mechanisms; (iii) strengthening Treasury
cash management functions, including cash forecast capacity; and (iv) training
administrators of technical ministries and provinces to understand and apply the new
procedures, and training treasurers to understand the new expenditure and accounting
system.
ii.   Public Investment Management. The Project will address the following needs in the
areas directly related to public investment (i.e., planning, programming, budgeting, and
monitoring): (i) development and delivery of a computerized public investment
management system in MEF, CDC, and selected lines ministries; (ii) establishmnent of
the Public Investment Budget unit in MEF; (iii) strengthening of project monitoring units
in selected line ministries; (iv) development of strategic planning and aid coordination
capacity in CDC; and (v) strengthening of macroeconomic analysis capacity in MEF.
iii.  Foreign Debt Management. The Project will assist in: (i) developing the institutional
and legal framework for the management of Cambodia's public external debt, and (ii)
establishing the new debt office in MEF. This program will include building capacity
for debt reporting to the World Bank.
iv. Public Sector Personnel Management. The Government and the World Bank have
worked closely with UNDP and other donors in defining an agenda for comprehensive
administrative reform. Through this Project, the World Bank will participate in the
reform program by defining a series of options for the reduction of public sector
employment via various departure schemes. The studies will cover military
demobilization as well as reduction of personnel in the civil service and the SOE sector.
v.   Private Sector Development. The Project will focus on assisting in re-establishing and
strengthening certain key legal institutional capacities and procedures required fnr
developing the economic and financial legal framework necessary for private sector
development in Cambodia. It will provide the Government (particularly the Council of
Jurists and the ITC) with the assistance of qualified legal advisers, training, and related
equipment for implementing the following activities: (i) preparing a diagnostic study to
determine the process and status of development to date of Cambodia's economic and
financial laws; (ii) carrying out a comprehensive legal training needs assessment; (iii)
formulating a time-based master plan that sets out the specific economic and financial
legal priority drafting and training measures *.o be implemented under the Project; (iv)
re-enforcing the Government's institutional capacities and official procedures for
publishing, on a regular basis, the Official Journal in the Khmer, French, and English
languages; and (v) establishing an automated system for the systematic reporting,
codification, and publication of the decisions of Cambodia's higher.courts, and for the
development of a system of jurisprudence and doctrinal writings.

vi.   Trainng. The Government is determined to move from central planning to a market-
based economy and to create suitable institutions and instruments for macroeconomic
management. However, some of the related tasks are unfamiliar to those in the
administration who have to execute them. There is therefore a need to mount a major
effort to help build capacity, which requires a large and sustained investment of
resources in technical assistance and training. The Government intends to recruit high
caliber expertise with a commitmeni to training nationals and the ability to transfer
economic management skills. The Project will help the Government implement this
strategy (see paras. 11-14 on Stiategy for Training and Sustainability.)
vii.  Other Sectors. In addition, the Project will also finance studies deemed to be of
primary importance to the Government's rehabilitation program and intended to improve
policy design in sectors other than those falling directly within the scope of the Project.
These studies will include studies in Agriculture, Education, Energy, Environment,
Health, Transport, Statistics, and the feasibility of electronic cash transfers to provinces.
Further details are provided in the Technical Annex.
9.         Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements. The total cost of the Project is estimated
at US$18.7 million equivalent, net of taxes and di-ties. IDA would provide a Credit in the amount of
US$17 million equivalent which would cover 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of
total cost. The Government will finance salaries and local incremental operating costs amounting to
US$1.7 million equivalent. (Schedules A and B).
10.        Cofinancin2. During Project preparation, very close coordination has taken place
between the World Bank and UNDP, the IMF, France, USAID, and other donors. As a result, the
Project will complement - or be complemented by - activities already underway or planned by other
donors. In particular, it will complement: an IMF-executed, UNDP-funded Technical Assistance
Project that became effective in October 1994 and focuses on tax administration and monetary
management; and a UNDP project that focuses on administrative reform.
11.        Strategy for Training and Sustainability. An important constraint on capacity building is
the basic weakness of govenunent staff. Staff weaknesses originate from a collapse of higher
education in the mid-1970s and the low staff salary levels, among other factors. Thus, the challenge
is to achieve a quantum jump in staff capacity to match the requirements of the new economic
management system. For this reason, the Project supports a major training effort to strengthen basic
staff capacity as well as to provide focused knowledge transfer to enable local staff to absorb quickly
the specific features of the new management system.
12.        The strategy for upgrading local skills and capacity consists of four complementary
programs: (i) basic preparatory training in essential generic skills; (ii) specialized short or medium
courses in topics relevant to public finance management; (iii) on-the-job training of counterpart staff
and of other staff employed in units which are being created or strengthened with the assistance of the
Project; and (iv) in exceptional cases, training abroad. In the category of on-the-job training, two
types of programs are envisaged: (a) training of counterparts who will be assigned to the Project-
financed experts before their arrval in their duty stations and (b) an on-site outreach program in the
financial complex through a training and visit (T&V) scheme. Both programs will focus on the
specific financial management systems being introduced through the Project. The experts will prepare
an annual training program concerning counterpart and T&V activities as part of their annual
performance programs.



- 5 -
13.        The Project will help the Government implement this strategy through measures which
guarantee the best possible quality control of the training being carried out by international experts.
All training will be conditioned upon preparatory steps that are crucial to ensuring that the various
functional units supported under the Project are ready to receive and profit from the training
activities: (a) potential candidates for the various positions will have been identified and several
counterparts selected for each external advisor; (b) the units will have been reorganized, staffing plans
prepared and, when required, the necessary facilities and equipment installed; and (c) a training plan,
based on a thorough assessment of the needs of the local staff, will have been prepared.
14.        To provide an adequate infrastructure in support of the massive upgrading of public
finance management staff, the Project will help finance the construction and equipping of a small
training facility (the School of Finance). A Training Coordinator will be attached to the School of
Finance and will ensure that an effective training program is carried out throughout the f...ancial
complex during the life of the Project. As the Project evolves and exteral advisors are withdrawn,
the School of Finance will become the main instrument available to address continued training needs
and ensure sustainability.
15.        Actions Agreed. During Project negotiations, agreement has been reached with the
Government on the following principal actions: (i) the PMU will be established and staffed
satisfactorily as a condition for presenting the Project to the Board of Executive Directors; (il) a
satisfactory annual work program for the first year of the Project will be adopted; (iii) all the
necessary counterpart personnel responsible for implementing the Public Sector Management
component will be officially appointed; (iv) a Legal Advisory Unit, attached to the Council of Jurists,
will be officially established; (v) throughout Project implementation, the PMU will be maintained with
satisfactory staff, resources and terms of reference; (vi) the Project will be implemented on the basis
of a Project Inplementation Plan and annual work programs to be reviewed and updated annually;
(vii) not later than June 30, 1997, a mid-term review of the progress achieved in implemnenting the
Project will be carried out, and thereafter the necessary remedial actions will be taken by the
Government; (viii) under the Public Sector Management component, separate action plans, prepared
on the basis of terms of reference specified in the corresponding Project annual work program, will
be carried out, not later than June 30, 1995, for expenditure control, investment management, debt
management and personnel management, and these plans will be reviewed and updated annually; (ix)
the Private Sector Development component of the Project will be implemented on the basis of an
action plan to be reviewed and updated annually; (x) the Legal Advisory Unit will be maintained
throughout Project implementation with satisfactory membership and resources; (xi) not later than
December 31, 1995, a medium-term agenda for the enactment of priority economic and financial laws
and regulations will be officially adopted by the Government; and (xii) all studies and training
activities financed by the Credit will be subject to satisfactory eligibility, selection and supervision
criteria.
16.        Environmental Aspects. The Project is expected to have no direct effect on the
environment (Category C).
17.        Benefits. The main benefits expected to result from the operation are to: (i) assist in
lifting the institutional constraints which inhibit the Kingdom's economic recovery; (ii) help provide a
common agenda for reform to the key government agencies, thereby promoting the program
coordination that was lacking in the initial phase of Cambodia's reforms; and (iii) help establish the
capacity needed to fully internalize and implement the government reform program and prepare for
more fundamental changes in the future.



-6-
18.        Risks. The principal risk involves Cambodia's limited absorptive capacity and scarce
counterpart staff possessing the required minimal skills. Several steps have been taken to minimize
this risk. First, the Project has been designed to deliver activities gradually and in a sequential
manner, and to finance incremental actions conditional upon the implementation of key preceding
activities. The Project Implementation Plan, and accompanying work programs to be reviewed
annually, will provide the appropriate framework for this approach. Second, the Project will make a
special effort to identify and recruit suitable expatriate Khmers as consultants/teachers. Expatriate
Khmers have often had successful careers in the U.S., France, Australia, and other countries since
they left Cambodia in the mid-seventies. Many became accomplished professionals in accounting,
computer services, and other skills in high demand under the Project. In increasing numbers, they
are now willing to return to Cambodia and contribute to rebuilding the country, either as consultants
on term contracts, or with a view to relocating there permanently. Non-profit Khmer associations
such as the Cambodian Network Council in the U.S., as well as leading universities, will help reach
potential candidates for consultancy positions to be filled under the Projecs.
19.        Another risk is the Government's relative unfamiliarity with World Bank disbursement
and procurement procedures. The Project Management Unit ("PMU") will therefore be strengthened
accordingly. Towards that goal, a Project Adviidr will be recruited and a seminar in relevant World
Bank procedures and practices will be organized in Phnom Penh as part of Project start-up activities.
The seminar will address the needs of the PMU staff (especially the Project Administrator and Project
Accountant) and Project component directors. It will focus, among other things, on Project
management objectives and techniques and on agreed methods for recruitment and periodic evaluation
of technical assistance.
20.        A third risk stems from uncertainties surrounding the political situation. Although the
situation has markedly improved since the UN-sponsored elections in May 1993, tensions remain as a
result of the continuing, but yet subsiding, armed conflict in the northwestern part of the country
between the Khmer Rouge dissidents and the Royal Anned Forces. Also, the Government comprises
a fragile coalition between the royalist party (FUNCINPEC), the former communist party (CPP), and
a smaller religious party. However, although there have been periodic tensions and complications,
cooperation between the coalition partners remains workable and in fact is gradually improving.
Furthermore, commitment to the reform program seems strong among all members of the coalition
Government. A case in point is the recent cabinet reshuffle which led to the replacement of the
FUNCINPEC Finance Minister ny a CPP Minister less than a week before negotiations of this
Project, without in any way affecting negotiations.
21.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of IDA and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
