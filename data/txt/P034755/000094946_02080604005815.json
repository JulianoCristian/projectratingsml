outcome is rated as unsatisfactory,\n            sustainability as unlikely, institutional development impact\n            as modest, Bank performance as unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance as unsatisfactory. The project was implemented\n            during a period of political uncertainty and instability in\n            Cambodia. Lessons learned from the project include: The\n            coverage on technical assistance is too broad, making the\n            project unwieldy for the Bank in performing effective\n            supervision and implementation and for the government to\n            manage and monitor. Careful assessment of the capacity of\n            new borrowers in the preparation and implementation of\n            projects is much needed. Ownership of the project resided\n            with the senior officials but was not transparent among the\n            officials who were to implement the project. For a technical\n            assistance, the emphasis should be appropriate in short\n            term, medium, and long terms. The borrower's\n            unfamiliarity with the Bank's processes and procedures\n            was underestimated. Lengthy period of implementation brings\n            about the question of project sustainability. Effective\n            communication, dialogue, and consensus building with the\n            borrower is needed. The Bank needs to implement strictly its\n            policy of non-payments of allowances. Salaries for\n            consultants need to be uniform and consistent with their\n            skills and knowledge. The Bank needs to tighten supervision\n            and monitoring of the foreign consultants."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
