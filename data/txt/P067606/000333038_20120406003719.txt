1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1. The project was approved at a time when UP‘s economy, and India‘s
economy were growing at a 6-7 percent per year and the demand for road
transportation was growing rapidly (10 percent average annual traffic growth with
vehicle kilometers for cars, buses, trucks and motor cycles growing at 14, 10, 9 and
15 percent annually respectively). Unfortunately, the supply of infrastructure was not
keeping pace with the demand and as a consequence the backlog of roads was
increasing significantly. At the time of appraisal, the Government of Uttar Pradesh
(GoUP) launched an ambitious reform program and invited the Bank to collaborate
and provide financial and technical assistance to promote its development agenda.

1.1.2. Capacity of the State Road Network: With a total of 190,000 km of roads in
an area of 294,411 square km and a population of over 160 million people, UP state
had the lowest road density in India in relation to population (121 km per 100,000
people, compared to country average of about 250) and in relation to area (33 km of
PWD surfaced roads per100 sq. km). Only about 7 percent of the Public Works
Department (PWD) road network met double-lane standards, while 85 percent of the
total network was single-lane roads at the time of appraisal. The rapid growth of
traffic (10 percent annually), the poor quality and capacity of the roads, and the
inadequate funding for maintenance would only result in the deteriorating congestion
in the future. Moreover, the lack of attention to road safety and inefficient operation
of traffic management further aggravated the conditions as reflected in rising road
crashes and death rate (22 deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles annually).

1.1.3. Rational for Bank assistance: The Bank‘s involvement in UP State Roads
Project is consistent with the Country Strategy (CAS) for India, i.e. providing high
quality infrastructure and promoting private sector led growth. The Bank‘s ability to
use its extensive international expertise, as well as expertise gained from previous
and ongoing lending operations in transport sector in India were the supporting
factors for the UP‘s ambitious reform and investment program. At appraisal stage,
the Bank planned to assist GoUP by: (a) improving the critical long-term capital
needed to support infrastructure development for accelerated economic growth; (b)
supporting the institutional and policy reform process while improving the
institutional efficiency of the main road agency; and (c) supporting the development
and implementation of the Road Safety Action Plan.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and key indicators (as approved).

1.2.1 The project development objective (PDO) was to improve the performance of
the core road system in Uttar Pradesh. The objective included: (i) improving the
capacity and quality of the core state highway network and major district roads; (ii)
enhancing road maintenance planning and execution, and reducing the backlog of
deferred periodic maintenance; (iii) reducing accidents; (iv) easing traffic movement
at selected inter-state crossings; and (v) strengthening the capacities of the Public
Works Department. The Key performance Indicators are:


                                          1
      Increase in the share of percent of the core network in good or better
       condition from 17 percent to 70 percent;
      Reduction in mean travel time by average 20 percent on about 1,000 km of
       core road network;
      Decrease in the number of road deaths/10,000 vehicles from 22 to 15;
      Share of project roads with V:C ratio>1 reduced from 20 percent to 5
       percent;
      Ex post EIRRs for upgrading are on average greater than 15 percent, and all
       rehabilitation works have a positive NPV at a 12 percent discount rate; and
      Completion of all actions in the Institutional Development Strengthening
       Action Plan.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), key indicators, and
reasons/justification.

1.3.1 The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised, although the physical targets
(for roads upgrading, rehabilitation including bridges) were scaled down due to the
reasons such as: (i) delays in the project implementation (pavement design changes,
approval of contract variations, shifting of utilities, payment for relocation &
resettlements of APs, procurement decision making, etc.); (ii) appreciation of Indian
Rupee against US Dollars; (iii) unexpected high price escalation of construction
materials, fuel and manpower in Indian market; and (iv) improved engineering
designs resulting in higher cost; and. Hence, the performance is to be measured
against the original targets. The curtailment of the civil works scope was
acknowledged by the Bank‘s supervision mission (re: Aide-Memoire, Nov 6-11,
2006), but no action for formal restructuring of the project was undertaken.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries.
1.4.1 The primary beneficiaries of the project were the road users, both direct and
indirect such as: agriculture producers, urban consumers, and transport operators in
the State. About 85 percent of the trips made on the Project roads are internal to the
state. The purpose of the trips is to travel to/from work with travel on business and
access to social services being the most direct reasons for road use. The benefits
from road users were accounted in the economic analysis including saving on vehicle
operating cost (VOC) and travel time, and reduction on accident cost. Communities
adjacent to the roads were also expected to directly benefit as a result of their
improved access to services, markets and information, however, their benefits were
not quantified in the economic analysis due to lack of reliable data. The road
selection criteria included a weighting for poverty profile of the adjacent regions.

1.4.2 The secondary beneficiaries were the PWD headquarters and field staff,
consulting firms, construction material manufacturers and professionals and the road
construction industry nation-wide.

1.5 Original Components (as approved).

Component I: Upgrading and widening of State Highways (total cost including
contingenciesUS$355.94 million).

1.5.1. This component aimed to increase the capacity and structural strength of part
of the core State road network through the upgrading and widening of about 1,000
km of priority State Highways (SHs). This included the construction of four new
bypasses of about 20 km in length and five major bridges. This component is divided
into: (a) civil works; (b) supervision of civil works; and (c) implementation of the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
for road widening.

a)     Civil Works (US$315.9 million): Contracts for the upgrading and widening
       of SHs were to be procured in two phases. Four civil works contracts (all
       ICB) was procured in the first phase and 13 contracts (7 ICB plus 6 NCB) in
       the second. The estimated implementation period for this component was
       about 60 months and the contracts ranged from about US$3 million to US$37
       million (base cost).
b)     Supervision of Civil Works and Project Management Support (US$18.1
       million): Several supervision consultancy contracts (about US$15.8 million)
       was procured under the project. Supervision consultants had full
       responsibility as the "Engineer" of the contract as per International
       Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) requirements. Eighty percent of
       this component (including taxes) was funded by the Bank. This component
       includes the PCC services which were engaged for project preparation and
       detailed engineering designs and continued to support the PWD for project
       management throughout project implementation (total cost was US$2.3
       million).
c)     Land Acquisition, Resettlement, EMP Implementation and Utility Relocation
       (US$21.9 million): Land acquisition costs and cash compensation under the
       project (about US$2.3 million) was funded entirely by GoUP. Other costs
       associated with the Resettlement & Rehabilitation (R&R) component
       (totaling about US$14.5 million) were eligible for Bank financing. R&R
       compensation was to be paid to beneficiaries for each package through a
       consultative process. Payments were made from the project director's office,
       and the Bank's share (US$10.7 million) was reimbursed by the Bank (100
       percent net of taxes for services, 80 percent for goods and 90 percent for
       works) on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) supported by proof
       of usage of the funds by the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and certified by
       the NGOs or the Government. The Bank did not finance any costs incurred
       towards purchasing or acquiring land. The procurement was usually
       undertaken by the respective beneficiaries, in accordance with established
       local private sector and commercial practices acceptable to the Bank.
       Resettlement implementation support, training, and monitoring (US$0.60
       million), provided by NGOs and consultants, was reimbursed through SOE.
       The costs associated with EMP implementation (about US$3.1 million)
       includes financing for training, monitoring, and evaluation which will be 80
       percent funded by the Bank. Relocation of Public Utilities (US$2.1 million)
                                         3
       was implemented by direct contract or Force Account and 80 percent was
       financed by the Bank.

Component 2: Rehabilitation of SHs & MDRs (US$227.40 million).

1.5.2. This component helped reduced the periodic maintenance backlog of the state
by funding the overlaying, resealing, and minor rehabilitation of about 2,500 km of
SHs and major district roads (MDRs). This component was divided into: (a) civil
works; and (b) technical review.

(a)    Civil Works (US$225.2 million): The civil works of rehabilitation component
       includes 48 contract packages (ranging from about US$2.5 to US$8 million)
       and were procured and implemented in two phases, each spanning over three
       years. The total implementation period for the rehabilitation component was
       about four years. Sixteen contracts were procured in the first phase and 32 in
       the second phase and procured using NCB procedures. The above costs
       include implementation of the mitigation activities identified in the
       Environment and Social Management Plan for rehabilitation roads. Two
       performance based maintenance contracts at an estimated cost of US$5.2
       million were also executed on a pilot basis under this component.
(b)    Technical Review (US$2.2 million): All rehabilitation contracts and the pilot
       performance based maintenance contracts were supervised by PWD with
       assistance from technical review consultants. About nine to ten technical
       review consultants was procured (each costing about US$0.2 million for
       rehabilitation works and US$0.2 million for performance based maintenance
       contracts) and assisted PWD in the supervision of works, overseeing project
       progress and quality control of all contracts supervised by PWD.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening, Advisory Technical Assistance,
Training, Equipment, and Pre-investment Studies (total cost including
contingencies, US$ 13.5 million).

1.5.3. This component financed consultant services and technical assistance and
training programs (about US$8.6 million) to facilitate the implementation of the
institutional development strategy (IDS) action plan. This component also funded
short- and medium-term training activities of PWD managers and staff. The
component had a provision for funding techno-economic feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for future road investment projects (US$3.0 million). GoUP
funded miscellaneous activities such as incremental operating costs and applicable
taxes for consultancy and goods (total about US$1.9 million).

Component 4: Pilot Highway Safety Program and Traffic Transport
Operations (total cost including contingencies, US$13.2 million).

1.5.4. This component financed civil works for the implementation of engineering
and traffic management measures to enhance road safety and mitigate traffic
accidents at selected high priority black spot locations throughout the state (US$2.0
million), road safety training (US$0.5 million), studies for black spot identification
(US$0.2 million), procurement of hardware and software for accident analysis and
                                          4
accident management system (US$0.7 million). The component also financed civil
works to improve road transport operations by constructing offside trade assistant
centers at selected border crossings, 10-12 in number with commercial vehicle traffic
of 500 vpd or more, (US$4.6 million), services for design and supervision of the
centers (US$0.2 million) and goods such as weigh bridges, scanners and computers
(US$3.2 million). The land cost for the facilities was entirely borne by GoUP.

1.6 Revised Components.
1.6.1. The original components were not formally restructured. However, the work
scope had to be curtailed: upgrading from 1,000 km to about 685 km; rehabilitation
from 2,500 km to about 1910 km; two bridges were dropped; and three upgrading
packages downgraded to rehabilitation level. This action was necessitated among
others to cope up with the funding shortfall and implementation delays as described
in Para. 1.3.1.

1.6.2. It was mutually agreed to delete the Study on Trade Assistance Centers at
State border crossing. GoUP advised that other Government departments would
undertake the subject Study.

1.7 Other significant changes.
No significant changes were made to design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations.

1.7.1. Project closing: The project closing date was extended by two years. The
first extension was from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009 and subsequent
extension was from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010.

1.7.2. Project Funding Allocation: At the request of the Borrower, US$40 million
was cancelled from US$488 million, the original loan proceeds to curtail civil works
(para. 1.6.1) from the Project. US$28 million was cancelled through a restructuring
approved on October 25, 2010. Additionally, US$12 million was cancelled through a
letter of January 4, 2011. The undisbursed balance amount of US$2.44 was also
cancelled after the grace period for submitting withdrawal applications elapsed on
April 30, 2011. Hence the final loan disbursement amount (as of June 01, 2011)
remains US$445.6 million.

2.1.1. Soundness of the background analysis and design: The project design
incorporated lessons learned from previous Bank road sector operations in India and
other countries in the region, such as:

(i)    engaged internationally experienced consultants for the civil works design
       during project preparation to ensure quality at entry;
(ii)   carried out Institutional Development Strategy (IDS) study prior to appraisal,
       to identify the key institutional changes to improve the effectiveness and
       efficiency of the road agency;
                                           5
(iii)   assessed procurement capacity of PWD before the project appraisal and
        agreeing to a procurement plan to overcome deficiencies;
(iv)    up-front preparation of the RAP was carried out for planned mitigation of
        adverse impacts, and advanced initiation of land acquisition; and
(v)     adapted pre-qualification criteria to stimulate joint ventures between
        international and Indian contractors to help modernize the local construction
        industry.

2.1.2 However, the detailed engineering carried out for about 50 percent of civil
works contracts before appraisal (as stated in the PAD), was not fully examined and
needed further checking and required design changes. Also about 35- 40 percent of
the contracts expected for award prior to loan effectiveness were not ready (re: PAD).
Hence the readiness level of the Project was lower than anticipated.

2.1.3. Participatory Processes: GoUP and PWD demonstrated a high level of
commitment to the project and reforms in the road sector through a series of actions:

(i)     The Government actively participated in the identification and preparation of
        the proposed intervention in the road transport sector. PWD undertook a
        detailed feasibility study of 2,655 km of roads out of a core network of 8,000
        km. Of this, 1,000 km were prioritized for upgrading and 2,500 km were
        selected for rehabilitation;
(ii)    An IT/computerization' strategy was initiated to enhance core applications
        training and support services. ;
(iii)   A comprehensive Institutional Development Study for the UP roads sector
        was undertaken during 2000-2001. The study identified institutional
        constraints, needs and priorities; and
(iv)    In early 2002, a high level IDS Implementation Steering Committee and an
        inter-agency working group to consider how best to reclassify the road
        network and deal with excess gang labor in PWD were appointed by GoUP.

2.1.3. Risks and Mitigation Measures: Although the risks, from components to
output and outputs to objectives, were identified, and mitigation measures developed
including: (i) GoUP fiscal situation does not deteriorate and timely funds flow (from
GoI to GoUP to PWD); (ii) timely and effective procurement with adequate
competition of works; (iii) significant training of PWD staff in the Bank‘s
procurement guidelines; (iv) timely clearance of construction sites, relocations and
resettlement actions; (v) traffic growth forecast materializes; and (vi) upgraded roads
are maintained, yet many of the mitigation measures were not sufficiently mitigated
such as, procurement training following the Bank‘s guidelines, management of
resettlement actions, capacity of the implementing agency to administer the project,
etc. All this contributed to the implementation delays of contracts in both phases I
and II.

2.1.4. Quality at Entry: No quality at entry assessment of the project was carried
out by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG).




                                          6
2.2 Implementation

2.2.1. The implementation of this Project proved a huge challenge for the
implementing agency for this large Project, all the way from designs to construction
completion. About 30-40 contracts were underway at a time during implementation,
especially in the initial phase. The procurement of civil works and mobilization of
consultancies was significantly delayed while, staffing of executing agency,
supervision and contracts management was below the required level. The
implementation progress ratings given by the respective supervision review missions
(in ISRs) varied between satisfactory to unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory and
then became satisfactory in the last phase. The Project experienced delays (for the
reasons mention in 1.3.1 above and explained below), and the closing date was
extended by two years in total. The cost overrun (resulting from the delays) forced
curtailment of the Project scope substantially (re: section 1.6 above), but no formal
restructuring was undertaken. Hence, the performance monitoring targets could not
be revised. The main factors that affected implementation of the project are:

(a)    Technically Deficient Road Design. The Engineering designs prepared by
       the international consultant for the phase - I road improvements were
       assessed as deficient by the Bank and PIU/PWD which was not pointed out
       early enough before commencement of implementation. One reason cited
       was that the designs were partly based on visual observations and not on
       actual measurements based on the field conditions. Therefore, remedial
       measures to improve the designs and specifications were taken for the phase-
       I (for some packages) and all of phase-II road sections. The Consultants
       (PCC) demanded additional time and compensation to revise the design and
       drawings. The Implementing Agency PIU/ PWD did not agree and thus the
       consultants contracts were terminated which resulted in implementation
       delays and cost implications. Major discrepancies between the bill of
       quantities in the bid documents and the subsequent actual field measurements
       thus resulted in variations to the Contractors scope of works and variation
       orders. PIU/PWD worked with its limited in-house workforce and resources
       and completed the required design changes and procurement processes. PIU/
       PWD designs were also deficient and resulted in further substantial variations
       during implementation.

(b)    Implementation Issues Causing Delays: Lack of effective collaboration
       among GoUP/PWD and other concerned departments such as Forest,
       Revenue, Power, utilities, etc., resulted in (i) extremely slow progress of
       relocations of utilities and land acquisition; (ii) poor consultation and delays
       in disbursement of rehabilitation & resettlement assistances to the project
       affected persons; (iii) delays in tree cutting to clear the right-of-way; (iv)
       delays in obtaining excise and custom duty waiver for construction material,
       equipment. Other issues involved: (i) delay in hiring and mobilizing
       supervision consultants for both phase-I and phase-II; (ii) lack of quality
       control of the road improvement works; and (iii) lack of due attention by
       contractors to implement EMPs.


                                          7
(c)    Project Management Issues: Lack of availability of qualified professional
       personnel (in the local market) to staff the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
       and a lack of coordination within PWD resulted in inadequate project
       management by PWD/ PIU, more specifically the weakness were: (i)
       inadequate monitoring of the contractors progress and consultants
       supervision; (ii) inadequate administration of consultants contracts; (iii)
       inability to take timely actions with respect to poorly performing works
       contracts; and (iv) lack of adequate control over site works resulting in
       frequent variations, changes. However, the limited PIU staff did their best
       efforts to run and complete the Project.

(d)    Contract Management: (i) unfamiliarity of the PWD staff with the works
       contract requirements, Bank‘s procedures caused delays in overall planning
       and management of contracts and maintaining control; (ii) inadequate
       contractor capacity, insufficient plant, equipment and manpower at the sites;
       (iii) inability of the supervision consultants to mobilize the required staff thus
       inadequate supervision, quality control; (iv) repeated variation order requests,
       and extension of time for civil works.

(e)    Quality Of Works. Generally, the quality of works is satisfactory, however,
       there was observed unsatisfactory quality of works at a few road sections. For
       example, UPG/3 (damaged wet mix macadam), UPG/2 (bleeding of dense
       bituminous concrete. Similarly, RMC/30, unsatisfactory quality of the wet
       mix macadam and large segregations were observed. The Bank supervision
       missions advised the PWD engineers to ensure that such conditions were
       rectified before approving the works. The ICR mission also observed cracks
       in UPG road sections, while PWD was undertaking repair work.

2.2.2. At the mid-term review (MTR), three years after the project effectiveness, all
phase I upgrading works contracts (with the exception of one contract) were running
behind schedule. Actions, such as land acquisition, tree cutting and removal of
encumbrances, were either slow or not initiated. Significant contract variations (in
phase I rehabilitation contracts) were introduced. Furthermore, the quality of
completed work was not satisfactory at a few locations that the supervision mission
noted, extensive cracks appeared in some completed pavements. The supervision of
the works by the PIU/ PWD by skilled professionals remained a problem. This was
acknowledged by PWD in their letter of June 21, 2011 (see annex 7).The loan
disbursement rate was also slow (only about 25 percent loan disbursed).

2.2.3. Scheduled implementation actions for phase II (upgrading and rehabilitation),
for three long bridges such as, completion of designs (bridges and remaining roads),
land acquisition and resettlements, recruitment actions had not been initiated. The
supervision consultants for Phase-II were not recruited by the MTR. The delay in the
start of Phase-II mainly led to the extension of the loan closing date. The cost
overrun at mid-term review (April 2006) was about 16 percent (US$90 million).

2.2.4 The Project‘s Governing Board (under the Chairmanship of the Chief
Secretary of (GoUP) rejected the concept of recruiting independent supervisory
consultants (re: Aide-Memoire April 3-15, 2003) as was planned (see Annex 2 of
                                           8
PAD) for the major maintenance/ rehabilitation contracts. It was then proposed that
out of 32 contract of phase-II, first 8 will be supervised by the PWD staff with the
assistance of an independent consultant. And the remaining 24 contracts would
subsequently be supervised by these PWD Engineers.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) design, implementation and
utilization.

2.3.1. M&E Design: The overall monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility
of UP PWD. The project included performance indicators to monitor the progress
and achievement of development objectives during implementation, and an
institutional development (ID) component was included in the project to ensure
sustainability of the investments. Furthermore, ID component aimed to support the
GoUP‘s efforts in modernizing the sector and enhancing the performance of the
PWD to maintain the road assets. An Institutional Development and Strengthening
Action Plan (IDSAP) was developed for implementation over the life of the project.

2.3.2. M&E Implementation: The performance indicators (PI) were monitored and
evaluated periodically by the review missions of the Bank in collaboration with the
PWD/ PIU. Three of the PDO indicators were not monitored and updated since
March 2006 consistently, due perhaps to PWD/PIU‘s lack of capacity. The targets
were specified to be measured at the MTR and then at EOP.

2.3.3. M&E Utilization: The monitoring of the performance indicators for
outcomes and outputs was initiated by establishing baseline data at appraisal. The
project monitoring reports were prepared and submitted on quarterly basis and also
included in the mission Aide-Memoirs and implementation status reports (ISRs).
PWD was assisted by consultants for data collection for: road safety, quality control,
construction supervision and project management, environmental and social
safeguard management. However, the progress remained Moderately Unsatisfactory
in the Bank‘s implementation status reports (between November 15, 2007 and May
28, 2010), due mainly to continued delays in setting up the institutional cells related
to the policy and planning and quality management.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental and Social Safeguard compliance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory as described below:

2.4.1. Environment Safeguards: The performance varied during preparation and
implementation of the Project but overall rated as moderately satisfactory. During
the preparation, sufficient attention was given to environmental issues and therefore,
Environmental Management Plans (EMP) was developed. The environmental
impacts included: (i) removal of approximately 5,800 roadside trees in two phases;
(ii) local pollution during construction; (iii) locations and management of contractors‘
campsites; (iv) management of material quarries; and (v) disposal of hazardous
pavement material; However, insufficient environmental management procedures
were adopted during the project implementation at different contracts. For example,
safety at construction sites and traffic management at some sites was inadequate.
                                          9
The contractors‘ camp sites, plant sites, and stack yards did not fully comply with the
requirements of EMPs at some locations. Hence suspension of works was advised
for such sites until the contractors implemented adequate plans. Under institutional
development component, UP PWD prepared an environmental manual to be used for
all major works, even outside the project.

2.4.2. Social Safeguards: Overall, land acquisition and resettlement (LA&R)
process went through relatively smoothly considering spread and size of the project.
But it experienced delays and interruptions especially where shifting of utilities,
power lines etc. were involved, thus slowing down the process. At some contracts
civil works started prior to the completion of the LA process (e.g. Yamuna bridge
area). Also, the policies and procedures on LA&R were not explained to the affected
communities at the outset. Either negotiations with landowners were prolonged or at
some locations, the Government refused to acquire lands (e.g. land between two
guide bunds). The slow disbursements of relocation and resettlement (R&R)
assistances and training for income restoration means to the affected families
contributed to the overall delays.

2.4.3 The project involved total 4,681 affected families of which 3,144 were
titleholders displaced 222 titleholders and 340 non-titleholder families. A total of
144 common property resources (CPRs) were relocated under the project. Majority
of those displaced were commercial non-titleholder (encroachers, squatters, kiosks
and tenants). The total land required beyond right of way for the project was 310.860
ha of which 266.172 ha was private land. The majority of private land losers were
cultivators. Around 60 percent of the land owners lost more than five bigha (about
10,000 sft) of land.

2.4.4. The implementation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) largely
followed the broad principles laid down i.e. to minimize the impacts by avoiding
displacement wherever possible. Furthermore, PAPs reported that R&R assistance
provided as per the entitlements was adequate. The assistance package not only
fulfilled the objective to maintain the pre-project living standards, a majority of them
benefited by way of improvements in their housing conditions and other living
standards.

2.4.5. The independent end term evaluation of the RAP implementation reported
that 85 percent of the total PAPs surveyed was found to be satisfied with the land
acquisition process adopted for the project works. 76 percent appreciated the land
valuation method and compensation paid for the land loss, 97 percent of total PAPs
surveyed did not face any difficulty in receiving their compensation and assistance
amount, 78 percent of the titleholders reported that the compensation and assistance
money paid was adequate. The non-titleholders expressed satisfaction as they were
not evicted, (they moved out of corridor of impact) even after paying them necessary
assistances.

2.4.6. The decision of the PWD to adopt a Corridor of Impact (CoI) of 13 m for
upgrading works was a major shortcoming in project preparation. PWD had initiated
the process of making only 13 m to be encumbrance-free (tree cutting, removal of
utilities and other obstructions), which is inadequate for road upgrading. It would
                                          10
have been relevant for the Bank team to identify this inadequacy at the project
preparation stage.

Fiduciary compliance is considered Moderately Satisfactory as explained below:

2.4.6. Financial Management: Is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project
mainly used the country systems in terms of approvals/ authorization, accounting &
record keeping, payments and for auditing, this resulted in stronger internal controls.
The audit reports were generally received on time except in a few cases where the
delays were not significant. The main concerns related to: (i) inadequate supervision
– oversight of divisions by Project FM staff (based in Lucknow) was inadequate for
a part of the project period as there was no practice of visiting the implementing
divisions. This was rectified in the later years, starting 2009), of the project; (ii) the
project faced a lot of difficulties in obtaining Utilization Certificates (UCs) from the
concerned departments. Again after 2009, the situation substantially improved (due
partly to the fact that the Bank began deducting outstanding amounts from
disbursements where UCs were not provided); and (iii) the project did not have a
system of internal audit, as part of their management oversight, which would have
provided more assurance regarding adherence with contractual conditions, adequacy
of internal controls and a basic review of payment transactions.

2.4.7. Procurement: Is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Procurement of works,
goods and consulting services was carried out generally in accordance with the Bank
guidelines. The required Bank‘s reviews and Independent Procurement Review did
not find many substantial deviations from the agreed procedures and guidelines. The
capacity of PIU, even with consultants‘ assistance, was limited to carry out large
volume (in value, quantity, and complexity) of contracts with poor contract
management and poor supervision skills. There have been extensive delays in the
award of contracts and consultancies. Moreover, during implementation, repeated
number of variations had emerged in works and consultancies, which had been
tedious for PIU and the Bank team to analyze and process. Many of the variations
were processed after their implementation without Bank‘s no objections. Almost all
contracts suffered from delays during execution. Moreover, the implementing
agency reported that on occasion the procurement clearances from the Bank took
longer time than required.

2.4.8. Disbursement: Total amount disbursed as of June 1, 2011 was USD445.6 M.
This is after cancellation of US$40.00 million (due to the reduction in scope of civil
works), and cancellation of surplus balance of $2.44 million after the grace period
for submitting withdrawal applications elapsed on April 30, 2011.

2.5 Post-completion operation/next phase.

2.5.1. Two contracts are still underway (UPG/13 for Construction of a Bridge
across River Ghaghra at Chelariaghat, and UPG/13A for Construction of Approaches
and Guidebunds etc for the Bridge at Chelariaghat) which will be completed by the
PWD. GoUP/ PWD has committed to allocate adequate funds to ensure completion.
The bridge over railway track (ROB) near Chaudagra will be completed by the
railways but the approach roads have been completed under the Project. The
                                           11
remaining implementation of the Institutional Development and Strengthening
Action Plan, RMMS, road safety measures, along with staffing of the established
cells would be undertaken by the PWD. Similarly, GoUP and PWD have allocated
sufficient funding for the road maintenance of the State road network including the
Project roads to ensure sustainability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of objectives, design and implementation: It is rated Satisfactory
as described below.

3.1.1 The PDOs remain highly relevant to the current national priorities and Bank
Strategy (CAS) for India for 2009-2012 which focuses on improving much-needed
infrastructure to help sustain rapid economic growth to achieve poverty reduction
objectives. The strategy is, thus, closely aligned with the Government of India‘s
development priorities expressed in the Eleventh Five Year Plan. UP is among the
five poorest states to be given priority. Implementation procedures need to be further
strengthened, more specifically, for the social safeguards, land acquisition and
resettlement. The sustainability of the institutional development, environmental and
social safeguards, road safety, road maintenance and management system is
extremely vital for preservation of road assets and to improve implementation of the
future roads development operations.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives. Overall, it is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory as described below.

3.2.1, The main PDO was to ―improve the performance of the core road system in
Uttar Pradesh‖ which is substantially achieved through: (i) improved capacity and
quality of the core state highway network and major district roads; (ii) enhanced road
maintenance planning and execution; (iii) reduced number of road accidents; (iv)
eased traffic movement at selected inter-state crossings; and (v) strengthened
capacity of the Public Works Department. However, the originally envisaged
physical scope of work was curtailed to about 74 percent (2,600 km combined
upgrading and rehabilitation road works completed vs. 3,500 km original scope). The
project was delayed by two years and overall average cost overrun of about 30
percent.

3.2.3, As evaluated, mixed results have been achieved (re: F. Results Framework
Analysis). The targeted kilometers of road to be improved was reduced by 26 percent
(2,600 km accomplished vs. 3,500 km target), i.e. 68 percent of the upgrading
component and 76 percent or the rehabilitation component, thus cutting down the
overall benefits to the users. However, the targets for, the travel time and vehicle
operating cost savings, decrease in the number of deaths from road accidents on the
improved road network have been fully achieved:

1.     About 60 percent core network is assessed in good or better condition,
       representing 85 percent of target as achieved;
2.     The travel time has been reduced by 40 percent against 20 percent target on
       the 40 percent core roads network surveyed, target fully achieved;
                                         12
3.     Road deaths decreased to 13 against the target of 15 per 10,000 vehicles
       annually, which is exceeding the 100 percent target, achieved;
4.     Share of project roads with VC ratio greater than 1 although reduced from 20
       percent to 10 percent but did not achieve the target of 5 percent, i.e. 50
       percent of target achieved;
5.     Economic analysis indicates economically viable investment on the improved
       roads despite time delays and cost overrun; and
6.     The implementation status of the PWD-centered institutional strengthening
       strategies and action plan is about 65 percent achieved and is expected to be
       fully achieved during the post completion period.

3.3 Efficiency.

Efficiency in achieving the PDOs in terms of economic rate of return over the
reduced network is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3.1. While the economic analysis, at appraisal stage, used HDM-3 software to
carry out the economic analysis, the economic analysis at ICR stage used the basis of
Indian Road Congress special publication (IRC: SP: 30-2009). Although different
methods have been used, the results presented below demonstrate the efficiency of
the project in achieving the objectives in terms of economic rate of return. More
details on the economic analyses are given in Annex 3; and a summary is given in
the table below.

Table 1: Main Results on the Economic Returns comparing Appraisal and ICR stages.

Maintenance Component (*)                       34.9                5.1 (**)           39.5
(*) At appraisal and ICR stage only a sample of roads was considered in the EA
(**) Few of the roads considered in the sample at appraisal were actually completed. The EA at
appraisal did not consider the linkage benefits that have justified some of the roads.

3.3.2. The overall weighted average EIRR for the reduced upgrading component
(685 km) is 25.4 percent at ICR stage. When compared to the original estimated
EIRR (for 1000 km) at appraisal (35.3 percent), this represents approximately a ten
percent points decrease, or even more since two out of the seven packages have
negative EIRR that are incalculable and that, for the purpose of the analysis, were
assumed zero. However, with a positive NPV of INR 40,967 million, it is certain that
the EIRR is above the threshold of 12 percent. On average, the cost of the
component has increase by 8 percent and the time overrun was of approximately 9
months, which represents a 25 percent increased. The time and cost overruns have
impacted negatively in the EIRR; however, the increase in the volume of traffic in
                                          13
the project roads (an average annual traffic growth rate of 11 percent) has
counteracted favorably, keeping EIRR above twelve percent. However, in some road
sections, the congestion cost is the main factor that has contributed to negative
EIRRs.

3.3.3. The overall weighted average EIRR for the sample of roads completed under
the rehabilitation component is 39.5 percent at ICR stage. EIRR at ICR stage is
higher than the estimated EIRR at appraisal, for the sample of roads of the original
component (34.9 percent). This represents, approximately, a five percent points
increase. However, since two out of nine packages for maintenance have negative
EIRR that are incalculable (and were assumed zero for the purpose of the analysis),
the increase is likely to be less significant. With a positive NPV of INRs. 27,053
million, it is certain that the average EIRR at ICR stage is above the 12 percent
threshold. On average, the cost of the component has increased by 58 percent and the
time overrun was of approximately six months, which represents a 25 percent
increase. These factors have impacted negatively on the economic rate of return;
however, the increase in the volume of traffic in the project roads (an average annual
traffic growth rate of eight percent) has counteracted favorably, except for the cases
where congestion cost resulted in negative EIRRs.

3.4 Justification of overall outcome rating.
Based on the ratings of these three factors, the overall rating is assessed as
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.4.1. The interventions undertaken through the investments remain relevant to the
economy, national priorities and the Bank‘s Country Strategy (CAS). The Project
remains highly relevant. The PDO of improving the performance of the core road
system in Uttar Pradesh were measured against the original targets hence were
assessed as moderately satisfactory, although achieved successfully on the smaller
network than envisaged. This recognizes that the intended benefits would not be
fully realized on the 26 percent reduced scope of road improvement works and
accrual of delayed benefits on the other 76 percent completed. However, the EIRRs
for both upgrading and rehabilitation components remained above the threshold of
12 percent, except four road contracts (out of about 50 contracts), therefore rated
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development, rated Moderately
Satisfactory

3.5.1. Resettlement Actions implemented were generally smooth without a major
adverse impact on the overall progress of the Project. It rather had a number of
positive impacts on the project-affected persons and they are summarized below:

(i)    Reinstatement of livelihoods of the project affected people: The end term
       evaluation survey conducted at EOP reveals that the money will not only help
       them to regain their lost livelihood but also help them to take up new avenues
       and create new business opportunities. 85 percent of the titleholder affected
                                         14
        families have used their compensation for purchasing new land parcels in the
        same village or a nearby village. The assistance money was used for purposes
        such as setting up of new business or invested in existing business,
        construction or repair of houses and a considerable number of them used for
        household expenditure. This indicates proper utilization of the compensation
        and assistance money. Many titleholder families (68 percent) reported
        improvement in their social status. The affected squatters and encroachers
        including displaced persons used their assistance money for the construction
        of a new structure or repairing existing. PAP‘s especially the non-titleholders
        expressed that the project authorities gave them an identity and supported
        them adequately. The end term evaluation survey did not find any major shift
        in occupation of both titleholders and non-titleholders.

(ii)    HIV/ AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. The Project conducted
        detailed HIV/ AIDS study during the preparation stage which recognized that
        roads are largest carriers of HIV/ AIDS and sexually transmitted deceases.
        Effective preventive plans for raising awareness both at the public and
        government level were included in the RAP. As a result condom vending
        machines were installed on targeted locations. Furthermore, a series of
        awareness campaigns were held through large public gatherings and road
        shows, door to door consultations and wall paintings installed during the
        implementation stage. All of these activities were widely publicized through
        the local newspapers.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening.

3.5.2. This component supported the implementation of a wide range of roads
sector reform measures, introduction of modern technology, upgraded training
programs and capacity building actions under the PWD-centered Institutional
Development Strengthening Action Plan. The separate cells were created such as: (i)
Human Resources Development and Training; (ii) Environmental and Social
Development; (iii) Quality Management; (iv) Road Safety Planning and
Engineering; and (v) Information Technology Management and Planning Cell. The
government‘s commitment to fully implement the Institutional strengthening Action
Plan to improve institutional capabilities to manage road network was evidenced. For
example, gradually reducing the current gap for road maintenance funding to ensure
long-term sustainability of the States road network through providing the required
funding for the year 2010-11. Adequate staffing of the cells established with
qualified personnel, training, equipment and development of institutional manuals
are crucial to sustain the momentum gained.

(c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative).

None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 UP PWD carried out three road user satisfaction surveys during
implementation of the project: (i) the first baseline survey of customer satisfaction
                                          15
was carried out in 2005-2006; (i) the second survey to measure the road user
satisfaction level after specific interventions were completed in 2007-2008; and (iii)
the final user satisfaction survey was completed in 2010. The results of the findings
are presented in the Annex-5. A stakeholder workshop was organized comprising
implementing agencies, consultants, contractors, and NGOs who were involved in
preparation and implementation of the project. The participants shared experiences
and discussed the challenges, successes, and lesson learned from the project- for
details, refer to Annex 6.

4. Assessment of risk to development outcome.

Rating: Moderate

4.1.     The risk of sustainability of the achieved development outcomes over the life
cycle of the investments is rated moderate. This rating is based on the assessment of
the expected threats to the achievements under the project, i.e. (i) continuity of the
institutional strengthening actions taken through the establishment of independent
cells; and (ii) sufficient and sustained road maintenance funding commitment of
GoUP. Both of these risks have been duly mitigated. The cells (listed in 3.5.2 above)
are now functional but would require continued commitment and monitoring by the
PWD and GoUP. The GoUP plans to maintain about 7,000 km core roads network
through increased maintenance funding. The above shows the government‘s strong
commitment to sustaining the institutional improvement and allocating adequate
resources to ensure long term sustainability of these project funded road network.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance.

5.1 Bank performance

(a) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry. Rated Moderately
Satisfactory, as described below.

5.1.1. Preparing a large state road project in one of the poorest and populous State
of India, the Bank‘s team faced enormous challenges. However, the Bank team
attempted to carry out rigorous project preparation exercise by incorporating lessons
learnt from similar projects undertaken in other states of India and in the region.
Detailed reviews of the feasibility studies for the proposed roads (prepared by the
consultants) for environmental, economic viability and financial management were
undertaken. However, the Bank‘s team fell short on undertaking full assessment of
the following aspects: (i) evaluating implementation capacity of the borrower‘s
agency to administer the project of this size; (ii) approving the technical designs and
specifications of the roads selected (for upgrading and rehabilitation) to be ready for
immediate implementation after the loan approval; (iii) guiding the implementing
agency by taking them through the full requirements of the land acquisition and
resettlement actions for timely completion; and (iv) advising a realistic
implementation period for proposed project. Furthermore, during the Project
preparation phase, the Bank team could identify a major bottleneck that of only 13
meter Corridor of Impact (CoI) adopted by the PWD for the project roads. This
created significant problems to get the departmental clearance for tree cutting,
                                          16
shifting of utilities and removal of other obstructions to clear the right-of-way for the
construction works. Also, too many output indicators were included in PAD that
were not well targeted and became difficult to monitor performance.

(b) Quality of supervision.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory, the shortcomings noted below were considered
significant in the operations achievement of its objectives efficiently.

5.1.3. The Bank missions were extensive including frequent interim missions every
six months. Although the quality of supervision was good, but it failed to take
timely follow up the actions that were agreed during the missions to expedite/remedy
and rectify the adverse situation, lost time etc., during implementation. Even after
acknowledging that the project scope needed to be curtailed, it failed to
advise/undertake a formal restructuring of the project. The Borrower pointed out that
on occasion the Bank‘s no-objection and approvals also took more time than
anticipated. The outcome/output indicators (as required in the PAD) were not
monitored consistently throughout the project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.1.4. The combined two ratings, Moderately Satisfactory for Quality at Entry and
Moderately Unsatisfactory for Supervision, yielded overall Bank‘s performance
rating as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2. Borrower Performance.

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 GoUP demonstrated a high level of commitment and ownership toward the
project design and preparation through a number of participatory actions at the outset
(re: para. 2.1.3 above). However, the State Government experienced a new level of
challenge and responsibilities for such a large size project financed by the Bank. The
capacities of Government departments (Finance, Revenue, Forest, Power) remained
limited to handle the volume of work relating to: (i) timely issuance of statutory
clearance to enable executing agency carrying out shifting of the utilities (power, gas,
and telephone lines); (ii) timely issuing excise and custom duty waivers to the
contractors (to acquire material and equipment), etc. The GoUP through the Project
mandated Governing Board could effectively help the implementing agency, PWD
to avoid long delays in going through lengthy internal processes to clear all
administrative and financial sanctions. However, the Government action to close the
road maintenance funding gap for 2010-11 supporting the implementation of the
Institutional Development component under the Project, will ensure sustainability of
the State roads assets and investments and indicates its commitment.

                                           17
(b) Implementing agency or agencies performance.

5.2.2   Implementation of the project by PWD is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2.2.1 PIU/PWD performed a huge task of implementing such a large project spread
all over in the most densely populated State. However, as evidenced from the
implementation progress reports of the project, it faced major issues at every stage
and lacked in fulfilling all major activities such as designs, procurement,
administration, quality control, etc.). PIU/ PWD was under staffed to perform
required functions, effective monitoring (re: para. 2.2 above). In addition, there was
frequent turn- around of staff within the Department (especially, rotating the Chief
Engineer and Project Director) that adversely impacted project management.
Although, PWD hired consultants to assist during the implementation of various
activities, still it was challenging for them to manage and monitor the routine work,
supervising the contractors, construction supervision consultants, and NGO when
about 40 contracts were underway at the same time. At the outset, redesigning of the
roads improvements impacted PIU‘s overall planning and scheduling of the activities
and resulted in subsequent curtailing of the Project scope, extension of time and cost
overrun. The procurement decision making was very slow, it took much longer time
because the PWD staff were neither fully conversant with the Bank guidelines nor
with the contract provisions. Therefore, large variations in the works contracts
resulted due to major discrepancies in the bill of quantities vis-à-vis site
measurements of material, etc. The main implementation delays (time and cost
overrun- partly was due to US$ depreciation against INR) were attributed to poor
monitoring by PWD/PIU staff of supervision consultants, inadequate planning (to
complete land acquisition and trees cutting & utilities shifting). The cells created
under the institutional development strengthening component are not fully functional
due to a lack of qualified staff. However, it is worth mentioning that the limited PIU
staff despite considerable challenges, put in commendable efforts to implement the
project.

(c) Justification of rating for overall Borrower performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Balancing all above noted factors, the
shortcomings in the performance of the PWD as the implementing agency were
considered significant in the final delivery of the project efficiently; hence the
overall Borrower‘s performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.   PAD design: The project document should ensure that: (i) PDOs and
monitoring indicators are few, measurable, and objective; and (ii) the project design
incorporates a well-designed evaluation system for assessing the baselines and
subsequently achievement of project outcomes.

6.2.     Project preparation, readiness and due diligence: The agencies involved
must ensure (using needed time and resources) that the necessary preparatory
activities are indeed completed fully. Also, the period between the project
                                         18
preparation and beginning of the implementation should be minimized to avoid
facing major changes in physical conditions.

6.3.   Government commitment: The Government‘s sustained ownership is
extremely vital to undertake such large projects. This is the second State Roads
Project (Kerela State Transport Project) implemented in recent years for which the
envisaged scope had to be scaled down and also incurred substantial time, and cost
overrun.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.    The Borrower‘s suggestion that consultant recruitment following QCBS
should not be the default modality, because it discourages good and qualified firm to
bid because they will not win based on the 20 percent bid cost preference. This
results in the recruitment of under qualified consultants whose firms pay less
fee/salaries. This suggestion would be brought to the attention of the Bank‘s regional
procurement team.

(b) Cofinanciers

None.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Description of the components of the project that were evaluated for the Economic
Analysis.

1.      The project had two civil works components: (i) Upgrading; and (ii)
Rehabilitation/Major Maintenance of identified road corridors.

2.      Upgrading component: At appraisal stage, a total length of 971 km of corridors
was envisaged to be taken up for upgrading without including bridges. The civil works
contracts were planned to be carried out in seven packages with an estimated cost of US$286
million (at 2001-2002 prices including price contingencies). The average expected
implementation period for each package was three years. This component was revised and
by the time of completion, 685 km of roads had received attention, for an investment of
US$217 million (at 2010-11 prices). The average cost overrun for the component was eight
percent. The average implementation period for each package was 3.8 years which
represents an average of 25 percent time overrun (calculated as the difference between date
of completion as per contract bond and date of actual completion).

3.      Road maintenance component: At appraisal stage, a total length of 2,513 km of
State roads was envisaged for road maintenance. The civil works contracts were planned to
be carried out in 39 packages. The estimated cost was US$225.2 million (at 2001-2002
prices including price contingencies). This component was not implemented as envisaged.
At the time of completion, 1,910 km of roads had received attention, for an investment of
US$271 million (at 2010-11 prices). The average cost overrun for the component was 58
percent. The average implementation period for each package was 2.5 years which is an
average of 25 percent time overrun (calculated as the difference between date of completion
as per contract bond and date of actual completion).

B.         Comparison between Appraisal and ICR stage
                                                                                        3
4.       An economic analysis was carried out at the ICR stage . The analysis re-assessed the
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and economic net present value (ENPV) of the
project components upon completion.

5.       While the economic analysis, at appraisal stage, used HDM-3 software to carry out
the economic analysis, the economic analysis at ICR stage used the basis of Indian Road
Congress special publication (IRC: SP: 30-2009) and the calculations are based on some
empirical relations contained therein. Unfortunately, this makes the comparison more
inaccurate; nevertheless, the results presented below are informative of the efficiency of the
project in achieving the objectives in terms of economic rate of return.

6.      All costs and benefits considered in the analysis were in monetary terms expressed
in economic prices to avoid distortions in the input prices due to tax, grants, labor price etc.
Comparison between the total transport costs for the projects roads between ‗with project‘
and ‗without project‘ were done during the defined analysis period. The cost includes cost of
construction, and periodic maintenance. The benefits includes saving on vehicle operating
cost (VOC), travel time, accident cost, and road maintenance cost.

7.      To the extent possible, the same input variables used during the appraisal stage were
used for the present ICR stage adjusting forecasted values to actual values. Unfortunately,
the forecasted traffic growth, at appraisal, was not available and, therefore, traffic growth
rate projections used during design stage were used. The average annual traffic growth rate
in the projects road sections was approximately 10 percent during the implementation
period. This rate is quite high when compared to the country average. This could be an
indicator that a significant volume of traffic has been diverted to project roads.

8.      For the ex-post economic evaluation, all seven packages (a total of 666 km) under
the ―upgrading‖ component were considered. Of the 1,910 km of roads taken up for major
maintenance, only 28 percent of the roads (537 km including nine packages) were
considered in the economic analysis due to the limited scope of the travel time survey. Even

though, this sample is limited, it includes roads in both, the eastern and the western parts of
the UP State. Five of nine packages (i.e. RMC 06; 36; 37; 38; and 51) are located in the
Western side and four (i.e. RMC 17; 18; 19; 21; -44; and 45) are located in the Eastern part
of the State.

9.      Upgrading component: Due to the different model used at appraisal and ICR
stage, the comparison remains very limited. Table A3.3 shows EIRR and ENPV at both
Appraisal and ICR stage for the upgrading component.

10.      The average economic rate of return at appraisal stage, for the upgrading component
(including all the roads originally considered for the project) was 35.3 percent. When EIRR,
at appraisal, was adjusted to include only the roads that were completed during the life of the
project, EIRR is reduced to a weighted average of 31 percent.

11.     At ICR stage, the economic analysis was redone replacing forecasted information
with actual data. The ex-post economic analysis indicates that ENPV is positive and EIRR is
above the 12 percent threshold for all the sections but two (packages UPG-04 and UPG-06).
These values are based on a 20 years operation period. The negative EIRR values are
incalculable since the flow of benefits remains negative during the whole period of analysis.
The weighted average EIRR for the 666 km of roads completed was calculated at 25.4
percent and this number is likely to overestimate the actual rate of return due to the two
incalculable EIRR that were assumed to be zero. The NPV indicates that this component as a
whole has a positive NPV of INRs 40,967 million (using a 12 percent discount rate).

12.      Increased implementation period has been an adverse change in all the sections,
ranging from 11 percent to 37 percent increase. On average, project implementation period
has taken 25 percent more time than originally planned. Cost per km, on average, increased
by         8 percent. It is important to mention that three packages namely UPG/05, 06 & 08
were downgraded to rehabilitation and their cost went down drastically. The average annual
traffic growth rate for the road sections upgraded during the life of the project was 11
                                                                         24
percent. Unfortunately, many of these roads had high volume of traffic (average AADT of
2,700) and they have become congested after the road improvement. The congestion cost is
the main factor that has contributed to the negative EIRRs.

13.    Road maintenance component: Due to the different model used at Appraisal and
ICR stages, the comparison remains very limited. Table A3.4 shows the EIRR and ENPV at
Appraisal and ICR stages for the maintenance component. As previously mentioned, the
economic analysis was only carried out for a sample of roads that are described in the table
below.

14.     The economic rate of return at appraisal stage for the maintenance component was
calculated at 34.9 percent based on a sample of 425 km. When this EIRR, at appraisal, was
adjusted to include only the roads that were completed during the life of the project (327
km), EIRR was reduced to a weighted average of five percent. This is clearly below the
threshold of 12 percent. Table A3.4 shows that this result was driven by two packages (RMC
21 and RMC 36). These packages were likely to be chosen due to their importance as key
links within a corridor that connect important cities. For example, RMC 36 is a clear link
between two other packages (RMC 6 and 37) and crucial to connect the Kachaghat - Ganga
Bridge. Unfortunately, these benefits were not captured in the economic analysis at appraisal
stage.

15.     The ex-post economic analysis indicates that ENPV is positive and EIRR is above
the 12 percent threshold for all the sections but two sections in the sample (packages RMC
18 & 19 and 21). These values are based on a 10 years operation period. The negative values
are incalculable since the flow of benefits remains negative during the whole period of
analysis. At the ICR stage, the weighted average rate of return is 36.5 percent and this
number is likely to overestimate the actual rate of return since the two sections that have
incalculable EIRR were assumed to have a rate of return of zero. The NPV indicates that


                                                                       25
this component as a whole has a positive NPV of INRs 27,053 million (using 12 percent
discount rate).

16.     Increased implementation period has been an adverse change in all the sections,
ranging from 15 percent to 64 percent increase. On average, project implementation period
has taken 25 percent more time than originally planned. Cost per km has, on average,
increased by 58 percent. The average annual traffic growth rate for the road sections
upgraded during the life of the project was eight percent. Unfortunately, many of these roads
had high volume of traffic (average AADT of 3,500) and have become congested after the
road improvement. The congestion cost is the main factor that has contributed to the
negative EIRR in two sections.

C.      Main Conclusions

17.      The overall weighted average EIRR for the upgrading component is 25.4 percent at
the ICR stage. When compared to the original estimated EIRR at appraisal (35.3 percent),
this represents approximately a ten percent points decrease, or even more if the two sections
with negative EIRR were to be considered. However, with a positive NPV of INRs. 40,967
million, it is certain that EIRR is above the threshold of 12 percent.

18.      The overall weighted average EIRR of the maintenance component is 39.5 percent
at the ICR stage which is higher than the estimated EIRR at Appraisal for the original
component (34.9 percent). This represents approximately five percent points increase.
However, since two out of nine packages for maintenance have negative EIRR that are
incalculable, the increase is likely to be less significant. With a positive NPV of INRs.
27,053 million, it is certain that the average EIRR is above the 12 percent threshold.

1. There were three surveys on user/customer satisfaction undertaken. The result of the
outcome is summarized as follows:

Objectives of the RUSS.

2.      The survey goal was to help improve road transport outcomes in Uttar Pradesh by
giving senior management in the Public Works Department an insight into the issues and
concerns raised by road users of the road network and thereby influence future strategic and
operational decisions. The specific objectives of the survey and the studies were to:

       Elicit views on public perceptions of current sector outcomes, public works
        department's performances and government policies;
       Document the views in a comprehensive format suitable for comparison over time;
        and
       Present the findings of the survey to senior decision makers in GoUP and the general
        public.

National Highways Vs. State Roads - A comparative picture

3. In order to meet the primary objective of the study through eliciting public perceptions
of current road sector outcomes, information was specifically collected from road users on
critical issues like Road conditions, Road capacity, Road Accidents, and Road maintenance
on National Highways as well as State Roads to derive the comparative between the two.

4. A wide range of variables like road geometrics, surface quality, condition of shoulders,
stopping distance, drainage, traffic delays, accidents observed, riding comfort levels, etc.
were used to capture public perceptions to rate the prevalent road conditions, capacity, safety
and maintenance aspects. Since frequent road users e.g. vehicle drivers and commuters are
the best judges of a road, the survey included a sample of 193 drivers (57 from Western zone,
57 from Eastern zone and 79 from central zone) and 88 commuters (26 from Western Zone,
26 from Eastern Zone and 36 from central zone) for specific analysis. The main findings
have been presented to compare the status of various road related attributes on National
Highways (NH) vis-à-vis corridors under State Roads Project (SRP) vis-à-vis Overall Status
of the State Roads (OSR) in Uttar Pradesh.

             Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      The Bank participated in a workshop organized by UP PWD inviting all
implementing agencies, contractors, consultants and NGOs who have been involved
in the preparation and implementation during the life of project. The objective of the
workshop was to provide participants with opportunity to express lessons learned
from successes and failures observed during the life of the project. The following
issues discussed are summarized below:

      Designs should be carefully reviewed and endorsed by the Client/WB to
       avoid delays at the construction phase.
      Social, Forest, Environment and LA clearances should be requested during

      Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR

1.      INTRODUCTION

1.1     Background

After successful completion of Uttar Pradesh State Roads Project- I from Nov., 1989 to
June 1996 with loan assistance from World Bank and Varanasi Shakti Nagar project from
March., 1993 to Oct., 1998 with loan assistance from Asian Development Bank, a major
initiative for improvement of core road network of Uttar Pradesh through Uttar Pradesh
State Roads project was started on with loan assistance from World Bank.

Prior to this a strategic option study (S.O.S.) was carried out in May 1996 covering nearly
10,000 Kms of roads for prioritization. Out of which, 2724 Kms of State Highways and
Major District Roads of core road network were identified and further techno- economic
feasibility study was carried out.

The P.C.C. (project coordinating consultant) started further investigations and detailed
Engineering in 1999 under Technical Assistance Loan no. 4114-IN of US$ 4.50 million and
submitted Borrowers Project Implementation Plan in April 2002 The project appraisal was
done in November, 2002 by the Bank for a project cost US$ 614.84 million of which Bank
financing was US$ 488.00 million and State contribution was US$ 126.84 million. A loan
agreement was signed for US$ 488.00 million between the Government of India and the
Bank and between the Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh, respectively,
on 19 February 2003 in New Delhi with 2 April, 2003 being the loan effective date. Project
implementation period was 5½ years, which was extended twice for 1 year each. Loan
repayment period is 15 years and there is a moratorium period of 5 years. The estimated
project cost is US$ 614.84 million of which Bank financing is US$ 488.00 million and State
contribution is US$ 126.84 million

The project has achieved completion in December, 2010 and this I.C.R. regarding
borrower‘s assessment of outcome of the project, role and performances of Bank/borrower,
lessons learnt, and suggestions is being submitted.

Project Scope

Total length of state‘s paved road at the time of carrying out ―SOS‖ was 104157 Km, which
consisted of 9777 Km SHs, 8868 kms MDR and 82779 kms ODR. These roads were having
inadequate capacity and structural soundness. To improve these roads, GoUP sought World
Bank assistance and undertook up-gradation and rehabilitation of about 3500 kms.

The project envisaged following activities.
i)     Up-gradation and Rehabilitation
       Phase – I: Up-gradation of 374 km and rehabilitation of 780 kms roads.
       Phase –II: Up-gradation of 590 km and rehabilitation of 1733 kms roads,
       construction of 4 nos. bypasses total length 20 kms and 5 nos. major bridges.
ii)    Institutional strengthening, Advisory Technical Assistance, Training, Equipment
       & Pre investment studies.
iii)   Pilot Highway safety program.

Need was felt to restructure the project as there was short fall in terms of Indian 650 Crores
(US$147.7 million) due to appreciation of Rupee against US Dollar. Moreover the cost of
                                             33
works increased due to redesigning and due to increase in cost of construction material such
as Bitumen, POL and labor. Thus the project was restructured and some of the packages
were dropped from the project.

After restructuring, the project had six main components:
i)      Up-gradation and widening of about 406 km and rehabilitation of 787 kms roads and
        2.0 km length of Bypass (Bangarmau) in Phase-I.
ii)     Rehabilitation of about 1113 Km and up-gradation of 263 kms of roads in Phase-II
        of the project. The up-gradation works were downgraded to Rehabilitation and
        major maintenance due to reasons stated above.
iii)    Construction of four nos. Major Bridges (out of which two numbers Bridges were
        dropped and one added)
iv)     Construction of one no. R.O.B.
v)      Institutional strengthening of PWD and development of an effective Road
        Maintenance Management system in the PWD.
vi)     Road Safety and Traffic Operations.

Key performance indicators

Following performance indicators vis-à-vis their outcome were benchmarked by the Bank
for measuring the achievement of the Project development objective:

 Increase in the share of the core road network in       Out of entire core road network , the condition
 good or better condition from 17 to 33 percent by       of almost 63 percent roads is good to fair as per
 midterm review (MTR) and 70 percent by end of           roughness study conducted by the Data
 project (EOP).                                          collection consultant at EOP.( IRI Good≤3.58,

                                                  Engineers on 09.11.2010 for implementation.

2.      Project Implementation

2.1     Components of the Project

The project envisaged following component, their objectives and achievements are
mentioned below:

Project Component 1

Upgrading and widening of State Highways: The PCC had identified 974.9 kms of road
length for up-gradation in order to increase the capacity and structural strength of the core
road network. This component also included construction of four new bypasses and five
major bridges. This component was to be implemented in two phases wherein 373.9 kms
were to be constructed in phase-I while 597 kms were to be constructed in phase-II. This
component also entailed supervision of the contract by construction supervision consultants
who were responsible for the entire quality and quantity of the works. Apart from
civil/construction aspects on the beheads and guidance of Bank, resettlement action plan for
the entire phase-I and phase-II projects were prepared on the basis of resettlement and
rehabilitation policy exclusively drafted and approved for UPSRP by GoUP. Moreover route
specific environmental management plan were also prepared, which were outcome of
environmental assessment study carried out for both phases. The above sub components
have been described below

Civil Works: Phase-I up-gradation project were completed within the stipulated time and
certain amendments were carried out, wherein some link roads lying on phase-I up-gradation
packages were also converted to up-gradation from rehabilitation as envisaged earlier.
Therefore total length for phase-I up-gradation became 406 kms. After constant interaction
with the construction supervision consultants and the PIU, the initial hitches were removed
promptly and the execution of phase-I up-gradation works has resulted in good quality road
corridors which the state can boast off. These roads have not only provided smoother ride to
the road users but also they have been instrumental in saving time and money by reducing
wear and tear of the vehicles.

The erstwhile identified 579 Km of Phase-II up-gradation packages were not only
downgraded to Rehabilitation contracts but out of 7 packages only 3 packages were taken up
for up-gradation due to devaluation of dollar values and increase in POL cost and redesign
of works, which resulted in increase of project cost. Moreover two Bridges were also kept
out of the priority of the project. Due to this reason almost 245.0 Km length of roads has
been upgraded within the available resources.

Supervision of Civil works and Project Management Support: The supervision work of both
Phase-I and Phase-II contracts were carried out by three supervision consultants, who were

                                             35
responsible for certifying the entire quality and quantity of the works. The contract
management part was also handled by them with the help of the client through the PIU.

Project component 2

Rehabilitation of SHs & MDRs: The PCC had identified 780 kms length consisting 16
packages for phase-I major maintenance and 1733 kms lengths consisting32 packages for
phase-II major maintenance works. The 16 packages under phase-I have been completed ,
however due to reasons cited in above para regarding downsizing/reducing the scope only 23
packages having 1068.40 Km length have been completed. All rehabilitation contracts have
been by PWD with the help of Technical Advisory Consultants. The TA consultants carried
out the quality and quantity check on sample basis, while entire work has been carried out by
PWD, which has produced in-house team of experienced Engineers, which cancan handle
big projects both in respect of supervision and contract management as well.

A generic Environmental and Social management plan was prepared for the rehabilitation
contracts, which was made part of agreement, thus these issues, which were alien to the
department, were monitored and successfully implemented by PWD staff. This has not only
enriched their experience in social and Environmental management aspects but also
sensitized the PWD staff regarding these issues.

Project component 3

Institutional strengthening, Advisory Technical Assistance, Training, Equipment and
Pre-investment studies: This component inter-alias included various activities to strengthen
the present setup of the department and to facilitate certain other activities for future road
investment projects. The subcomponent wise details are as under:

a.      Institutional Strengthening & Advisory Technical Assistance: This component
        was meant to strengthen the institutional capacity of the department so that the
        department may be able to inculcate latest equipments and techniques to augment its
        functioning more efficiently in the department. In the year 1999 a study was
        conducted to assess the existing institutional setup of the department and
        recommend measures for strengthening the institutional setup of the department.
        The recommendations were further augmented by advisory technical assistance and
        in depth study of the whole setup of the PWD including its functional hierarchy and
        organizational setup including the availability of human resources were studied in
        detail. This advisory assistance further recommended formation of different sense
        namely 1. Project Planning Cell, 2. HRD Cell, 3. Quality Management Cell, 4. IT
        Cell, 5. Environmental and Social Development Cell, 6. Road Safety Cell etc. The
        cells were subsequently setup and are functioning well. This effort if pushed further
        will yield magnificent results in the time to come.

b.     Training Equipment and Pre-investment Studies: UPSRP has been able to deliver
        goods by means of providing training in the field of environment and social aspects,
        road safety, contract management, GIS and latest equipment and developments used
        for design of roads. However, further efforts are needed to impart training on
        continual basis with the rapidly changing technological advances and latest
        equipments and techniques, which are being developed and deployed by various
        organizations throughout the world.

        It was also amend for the project to undertake surveys to assess road users
        satisfaction with road infrastructure and PWD performance thrice during the project

                                             36
       period. These surveys were conducted in the year 2005, 2008 and 2010 and they
       have clearly outline the perception of the public about the road infrastructure of the
       state and about performance of PWD. As these survey were carried out on a gamut
       of the road categories present in the state (i.e. NH, SH, MDR etc.). They also aimed
       to gauge the public perception with respect to UPSRP and other ongoing projects
       (not upgraded and SRF etc). It is heartening to note that not only the public
       perception in terms of overall satisfaction has increased for UPSRP project, but also
       there has been marked improvement in the public perception about PWD
       performance. The overall satisfaction level has increased from 45.38 to 62.05 and
       PWD performance has improved from 53.33 to 64.60 between the last five years,
       which reveals the success story of the project.

c.     GIS: Under SRP - II efforts were made to establish a GIS based road and bridge
       information system in UP-PWD, at a pilot scale for nineteen districts, as a part of
       institutional strengthening and capacity building. This will enhance the capacity of
       PWD to manage their asset more effectively by providing a source of readily
       accessible, relevant and valid information of the road system as well as improved
       support for decision making.

       The most important component of the proposed road and bridge information
       database is to have all the road features mapped in GIS. Hence, GIS will be the basic
       platform for all spatial features of road assets with an integrated database for storing
       attributes of the data feature.

       The most important objective of this work was to establish a GIS assessable to all
       PWD offices which can facilitate reporting, analysis, problem solving, and enhance
       decision making at various levels of its core business activities.
              Strategic Level: This comprises the top level staff in HQ
              Management Control Level: comprising the managers who control the core
               business activities in the zones
              Operational Level: The staff managing the day to day operation and
               management in Circles and Divisions

       GIS thus planned should support functions that are being performed at all these
       levels by providing adequate information and analysis results to aid decision making
       and to facilitate smooth and efficient running of the department. It should also be
       adequate, scalable and integrated with planned core business applications for PWD.

d.     Data collection on core road network: Data collection work on entire core road
       network is in progress. This will provide the data pertaining to road conditions,
       which will enable the decision makers to take decisions objectively with respect to
       road condition.

Project component 4

Social and Environmental Safeguards: The social and environmental safeguard measures
were embedded in the project right from pre-feasibility stage. Though these aspects were
alien to PWD officers‘ earlier but, adequate training and facilitation by the Bank, lead to
their proper implementation during the execution of the project.

Environmental safeguards: Environmental impacts anticipated at the time of project
preparation were mitigated by judicious implementation of project specific Environmental
Management Plan for up-gradation packages and generic Environmental and Social
                                             37
management Plan for Rehabilitation packages. . Regular monitoring of air, water and noise
samples were carried during the entire duration of the projects and facilities at labor camp
were monitored and improved from time to time. The environmental aspects were also
included as enhancement measures wherein several old ponds /temples were restored and
beautified to their pristine glory. This improved the image of the project proponents in
public eye and no public resistance or outcry was witnessed during implementation of the
project. This indicates that the project has been able to drive home through the hearts of the
public and achieved its intended goal for the same.

Land acquisition, Resettlement and Utility relocation: The project envisaged payment of
assistance to non title holders also (encroacher, squatters, Kiosk, etc) whose eviction was
necessitated, so that their standard of living improved or at least remained same from that of
their previous status. This was stipulated and approved by GoUP in the R&R Policy
especially drafted for the project. Almost 320.0 ha area of land has been acquired through
private negotiations in the project with the help of NGOs.

The entire resettlement and rehabilitation activity was monitored closely with guidance from
the Bank and independent impact evaluation studies were carried out towards the outcome of
the Rap (Resettlement Action Plan) during midterm and EndE term of the project. During
midterm it was observed that families under BPL (Rs 20000 per annum) decreased from
51.38 percent to 43.58 percent in the post project period. A majority (49 percent) reported an
average improvement in their social status and more than 50 percent saw an average
improvement in their economic position after the project and R&R activities. However,
during the End term evaluation, close to 70 percent of the titleholders reported to have
improved their economic and social status following the project. By contrast, 80 percent of
the non-titleholders stated that there has been an improvement in their overall status post-
project.

It had indicated that the living standard of project affected person has improved or at least
remained the same, which was the main objective of the project. However, training on dairy
and tailoring was imparted to project affected person, which also helped to improve their
social status. The project also took some novel approach by installing condom vending
machine at selected location as a safeguard against AIDS.

Though utility shifting was a big impediment as it took almost two to three years to complete
this activity, however the delay did not deter the progress of work and also did not lead to
claims by the contractors because the problem was judiciously overcome by the client by
altering the milestones and opting for those milestones were encumbrances were
insignificant.

Project component 5

Pilot Highway Safety program and Traffic operations: This component was meant to
finance civil works for the implementation of engineering and traffic management measures
to enhance road safety and mitigate traffic accidents at selected black spot locations. A
detailed road safety study was conducted with the help of consultants and recommendations
were sent to Government for restructuring the road safety council. Training was imparted to
PWD officers to identify Black spots on roads and subsequently 50 Black spots were
identified and mitigation measures were implemented for their rectification. First time in the
state, all the stake holding departments, namely education, traffic police, police, transport
and PWD were collectively imparted to underline their roles regarding traffic safety
operations. This effort has to be carried out further in the state to improve road safety
scenario.

2.2     Delay and other concurrent problems faced

2.2.1   Reasons for delays

The initial closing date of the loan period was December 31, 2008 but the project crossed
two years, and the actual date of closing of the loan agreement is December 31, 2010. So
there was a delay of two years: The main reasons for the delays were:
i.      Dispute with Project Coordinating Consultant (PCC): M/s DHV was the Project
        Coordinating Consultant for the U.P. State Road Project - II. After the start of
        Phase-I work, PCC was asked to revise the design philosophy of Phase - II work and
        submit Package wise Detailed Project Report.DPR Reluctance by PCC delayed the
        entire procurement of Phase - II Packages.
ii.     Revision in Scope of Work:- With the experience of Phase - I, need was felt for
        changing design philosophy. After lot of deliberation, design philosophy was
        finalized which changed the entire scope of work. Revision in scope of work
        resulted in enhancement of the quantities for various BOQ items especially WMM
        which necessitated longer duration time for completion of the work.
iii.    Delay in getting Statutory clearance, Utility shifting and Land Acquisition:-
        Problems were faced in coordination with the various service providing departments
        such as Power Corporations, BSNL, etc as well as MoEF, etc. which resulted in
        delay in getting forest clearance and cutting of trees, shifting of electricity poles and
        lines, etc.
iv.     Delay in appointing Supervision Consultant (SC) for Up-gradation Phase-I
        works:- There was about one year delay in appointment of Supervision Consultant
        for Phase - I Up-gradation of works due to complaints by a SC which led to late
        completion of Phase - I Up-gradation works.
v.      Delay due to frequent restructuring of the project caused by frequent change of
        US Dollars exchange rates:- The project loan agreement with the World Bank was
        conceived with US Dollar rate equal to `48.00. However excessive fluctuation was
        witnessed in US Dollar exchange rates viz. minimum being `39.27, maximum being
        `52.06 and the average was `44.95. So frequent restructuring was required i.e.
        reducing / reinstating the number of packages so as to keep the total amount of work
        within loan limit. This frequent change in restructuring of projects delayed
        procurement process, which resulted in late completion of the project.

2.2.2   Problems faced
i.      Due to a large gap between the project preparation (2000) and project
        implementation (2003-10) the ground conditions changed considerably causing
        deterioration of pavement resulting into change in scope of work and consequently
        increase in quantities. Initiation of pavement distress has been observed earlier than
        design life in some of the contract packages due to excessive increase in traffic
        volume and VDF, mostly due to better riding quality resulting after completion of
        project road. (Refer Suggestion 4.2.1(i)]
ii.     Large variation in quantities of DPR prepared by PCC mostly profile corrective
        course, overlays and C.D. works and absence of provision for connecting
        intersecting roads. (Refer Suggestion 4.2.1(i)]
iii.    Unprecedented heavy monsoon in the year 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008 resulted in:
        (a) Short working period
        (b) Higher moisture content in soil.
        (c) Borrow area and quarries filled with water for longer duration.
        (d) Introduction of many additional CD works


                                               39
     iv.     Strengthening and widening of existing 7 m wide pavement was envisaged under
             this project, therefore construction activities in specified sections had to be restricted
             on half the width of carriageway and the remaining half CW was left open for
             movement of the regular traffic. On high volume traffic corridors, the management
             of traffic on half width of carriageway had posed a big problem especially on
             sections where overlay of wet mix macadam was provided. The WMM surface is
             prone to disintegration if the traffic moves on freshly laid surface without
             bituminous paving layer. Despite having all traffic management measures in place it
             was awfully difficult to control the movement of traffic on WMM surface which
             caused disintegration and damages to WMM surfaces. [Refer suggestion 4.2.1(vi)].
     v.      Contractor‘s tendency to slide down to inferior quality and sluggishness as soon as
             employer‘s vigil goes down. Also Contractor's mobilization was in general delayed.
             [Refer suggestion 4.2.4 (iii)].
     vi.     Lack of commitment and ownership sense in CSC. [Refer suggestion 4.2.4(vi)]
     vii.    Problem in construction did arise because of lack of effective cooperation from
             various departments such as Revenue, Forest, Power Corporation, Telecom and
             other agencies. [Refer suggestion 4.2.1(iv),(v)].
     viii.   Increase in Heavy vehicular traffic on urban and rural link of the corridors due to
             improvement in riding quality after completion of project road. [Refer suggestion
             4.2.1 (xii)]
     ix.     Steep rise in prices of bitumen and fuel during project implementation period had
             upset the contractor‘s financial planning.
     x.      Some of the contractors did not submit work program due to which there was
             problem in monitoring of the progress.

     2.3     Economic Re-evaluation upon completion: The economic analysis on completion
     was not carried out for the entire project instead it was carried out on a sample of roads. The
     pertinent data has been shared with the Bank.

     3.      Assessment (by borrower - GoUP/UPPWD) of implemented project

     A - Rating

  i.         UPPWD provides internal rating to the project as satisfactory. This statement gets
             support of user satisfaction surveys and grown up confidence and enhanced skill
             capabilities of UPPWD staff along with contractors.
 ii.         The Banks support missions were highly beneficial to the project. The Bank‘s
             mission touching the minute details helped in successful completion of civil works
             and implementation of EMAP & R&R. The comments and suggestions in Aide
             Memoire had helped in solving the problems with other line departments of GoUP.
iii.         In all, the project has received good appreciation from all spheres. The able
             assistance from WB, contribution from PIU-UPPWD with lean staffing structure
             and particularly GoUP along with consultants and contractors made it possible to
             provide quality infrastructure. The targeted benefits to the community are getting
             realized and will continue to accrue in years to come.
iv.          Such good experience and exposure have made department more confident to take
             on with similar project in near future.

B - Experience Gained

i.           The UPPWD officers were actively involved in the corridor readiness activities,
             local liaison, monitoring of the works, environmental/social issues and gained direct
             or indirect experience of the duties of the Engineer and contract administration

                                                    40
               under FIDIC conditions. This will be of great utility for other projects of such
               magnitude.
 ii.           During project execution the Divisional and Circle Officers were actively involved,
               somewhere directly (especially in RMC works and implementation of EMP & RAP)
               somewhere indirectly.
iii.           UPPWD's staff got trained and enhanced technical skills through UPSRP-II, has
               demonstrated skill transfer in many ways. After the termination of service of PCC,
               the design, tender related issues, environmental and R& R work were done in-house.
iv.            Auditors are normally not aware of FIDIC contract conditions, roles and
               responsibilities of client and CSC, etc. They need to have some training and
               exposure to such big contracts and projects.
 v.            A frequent staff change amongst the consultant was an issue which constantly arose
               during the project duration. Replacements were not found of same caliber of the
               original staff and on many occasions it has been observed that the personnel
               employed by the consultant are project specific and not belonging to the regular
               establishment of the consultant. Such project specific personnel lacks allegiance
               towards work, therefore the quality of work suffers.

       4.      Lesson learnt and suggestions

       4.1     Lesson Learnt
       i.      Do avoid a major delay between Project Preparation and Implementation: Huge time
               gap between the completion of project preparation and commencement of
               implementation created lot of problems.
       ii.     Verification of contractor‘s, consultant's and Key Personnel's Pre-qualification
               Statement is must: It is often found that the information submitted by the
               prospective bidder for pre-qualification (both for contractors as well as consultants)
               on paper bears little resemblance to his actual capabilities. There should be a
               National Board having rating facilities for Contractor, Consultant and Key Personnel
               for verifying their credentials.
       iii.    Requirement of adequate diversion width: Provision of Diversion should be a paid
               item in Bill of Quantity and also there should be provision of Temporary land
               acquisition for traffic diversion where insufficient space exists within the ROW.
       iv.     Environmental Management to be part of project BOQ: Environmental Management
               is an aspect of the contract which is very difficult to control with. The majority of
               contractors will not make sufficient allowance in their price and do their best to
               avoid or minimize their expenditure on EMAP compliance after contract award.
               Provision of EMP activities as a paid BOQ item will help control such violation.
       v.      Need for safety audits: Proper safety audits in construction zone helped a lot. This
               should be made mandatory for all projects.
       vi.     Two envelop system and opening of financial Bids of only responsive bidders:- If
               the 1st lowest bid happens to be non-responsive it is very difficult for the employer
               to reject the bid because of difficulties in justifying such action to the auditors. The
               Employer would rather ask the bidder to clarify the work experience / machineries /
               resubmit a corrected bid security, which could be seen as unfairly affecting the
               position of the L2 bidder who submitted a required work experience / list of
               machineries / proper bid security. As such financial bid should be opened only after
               technical evaluation.
       vii.    Define Substantial Completion of the Project: The basic requirement to satisfy
               substantial completion are not clearly defined in the bidding / contract documents.
               Substantial completion should be properly defined in the contract document.
       viii.   Actual Deployment of Contractor‘s Key Staff: Contractor‘s key personnel named in
               the schedule to the contract or approved replacement candidates are mostly not

                                                     41
        available at works site during normal working hours. Sometimes contractor‘s
        foreman or junior technical personnel manage the day to day construction activities
        at site. This has adverse impact on the quality of work. There should be a provision
        of penalty for non-deployment of key personnel and its replacement.
ix.     Office equipment for Consultant: The rent of office furniture, equipment, etc was
        high due to which the total cost of rent was more than the cost of the material. The
        Auditors objected to this.
x.      Construction Supervision Consultant deployment beyond project completion:-
        Normally reference for arbitration is made after completion of work and by that time
        the CSC has already demobilized his establishment from project office, therefore the
        entire onus of defending the matter before the arbitrator lies on the Employer. This
        needs to be addressed by providing some suitable after demobilization service
        liability for the CSC.

4.2 Suggestions

From the lessons learnt and experiences, some of the suggestions are given below in this
section.

4.2.1   Suggestion for improving Project Preparation:
i.      Time gap between the completion of project preparation and commencement of
        implementation preferably should not be more than 6 to 9 months.
ii.     The dedicated divisions for carrying out the project must be in place during the
        project preparation for coordinating with the consultant and verifying its work. This
        dedicated division should be responsible for routine and periodical maintenance of
        the road out of State budget till commencement date of the concerned package.
iii.    Major Maintenance should be carried out only on those roads which has been found
        to be structurally sound and constructed as per IRC:37 (2001) i.e. embankment and
        sub-grade properly compacted, bottom of sub-grade at least 60cms above HFL, and
        at least adequate thickness of sub-base.
iv.     Effective and vigorous Public Consultancy should be conducted on proposals
        regarding realignment or any bypasses to incorporate their views and local
        requirements.
v.      All the furniture, equipments, etc should not be on rent basis. The provision should
        be for reimbursement of the cost so as to be the property of the employer. The
        consultant shall return it to the employer on completion of the project / work.

Design and DPR stage

(i)     DPR for Major Maintenance should be prepared firstly by taking representative
        Benkelman Beam Deflection of homogeneous section and detailed deflection should
        be taken about three months before calling of bids and overlays provided
        accordingly in the BOQ.
(ii)    Bituminous Macadam and Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete cannot withstand the
        tensile stresses caused by heavy commercial vehicles which are also frequently
        found to be overloaded. Dense Bituminous Macadam and Bituminous Concrete
        should be provided as Base and wearing course.
(iii)   In the absence of strict enforcement regarding legal axle weight, stronger pavement
        designs will be required for corridors carrying high or even moderate volumes of
        industrial and commercial traffic.
(iv)    The TOR for project design should allow for detailed inspection rather than visual
        inspection only of existing structures. This should include NDT testing, taking of


                                             42
         core samples, proper bearing inspection etc, so that the full scope of works required
         can be detailed any properly priced by the bidders.
(v)      Proposals in DPR for shifting of utilities coming in the right of way should be made
         based on proper surveys and consultations with the concerned departments.
(vi)     Where traffic diversions are required, the practicability of constructing diversions
         should be determined at the design stage.
(vii)    Temporary land acquisition for traffic diversions should be identified as far as
         possible and resolved at the design stage in such cases where insufficient space
         exists within the ROW.
(viii)   Site for Disposal of waste/surplus material satisfying environmental criteria should
         be identified and indicated at the DPR stage to allow proper pricing by the bidders
         and the contractor to locate proper sites during execution of work disposal.
(ix)     It is proposed to ensure that BOQ items are put into the bidding documents that
         properly reflect that value of the EMAP compliance.
(x)      Introduction of formal safety audits at the design stage is commensurate with
         international practice for subsequent projects.

4.2.2    Suggestions for Improving the Bidding & Contract Document

4.2.2.1 Instructions to Bidders (ITB)

i.       A condition may be incorporated in prequalification document and ITB stating that
         the unofficial sub-contracting of work either in part or whole is prohibited. Further a
         condition to this effect should also be included in COPA or GCC whereby if during
         execution it is discovered that a contractor had indulged in practice of unofficial sub
         contracting, he would be summarily disqualified for future tendering in the WB
         financed projects.
ii.      All bidder should be asked to submit rate analysis of their quoted rates for all the
         items of Bill of Quantity for deciding rates of variations, etc. as well as evaluation of
         workability and genuineness of quoted rates.
iii.     A condition should be included in COPA/GCC (NCB) which should mean as under:
         The contractor will deploy at site only those key personnel who are approved by the
         ―Engineer‖.
iv.      Joint Venture partners who abscond from their responsibility should be subject to
         punitive action. A condition in ITB and COPA/GCC should be incorporated stating
         that the JV partners would be considered as one entity and all Excise Exemption, etc
         should be in Joint Venture name. Joint Venture firms should jointly respond to the
         needs of the contract as and when required. Responsibilities of JV partners should be
         clearly defined.
v.       The bid security documents should be checked prior to opening of financial bids. If
         on checking the bid security documents are found defective then the bidders bid
         documents should be returned unopened to the bidder. Those bidders who are found
         not qualified as per Bid Qualification requirement should be declared non
         responsive.
vi.      Position of Planning Engineer and Quantity Surveyor should be included in the list
         of required contractor‘s key personnel. All key personnel should be employee of the
         main contractor.
vii.     For better coordination between work force and the contractor‘s engineering staff;
         position of senior foreman (highway/structures) should also be included in the list of
         contractor‘s key personnel.
viii.    Issuing Excise Exemption certificate is taking lot of time. Instead of issuing it,
         reimbursement procedure should be adopted.


                                               43
4.2.2.2 Condition of Contract

i.      Since there are many commercial Banks easily accessible for lending money to the
        contractor, it is recommendable to delete the clause for payment of mobilization
        advances. If the clause for mobilization advance cannot be deleted; then interest
        should be charged at the market rate after four months of notified date of start of the
        work.
ii.     The basic criterion satisfying substantial completion should be well defined in the
        contract documents.
iii.    The submission of as –built drawing (COPA clause 6.6) should not be linked to the
        issue of the Taking over certificate. It would be better to revise the wording of the
        clause to give a specific time limit, (e.g. 14 days after issue of the Taking over
        certificate) and specify remedies available to the Employer in case of non-
        compliance.
iv.     It is suggested that the performance Bank Guarantee should be released after Defect
        Liability Period.
v.      ‗As built drawings‘ should be submitted in the format/template as standardized by
        the Employer and should be a part of Bidding Document The standard
        format/template should be uniformly applicable for the entire project duration.
vi.     Insurance agency should be provided by contractors with well defined costing of
        works to be insured, especially temporary works. Such mandatory provision shall be
        effected through COPA for the contractor to avoid any ambiguity with respect to
        temporary works damage valuation etc.
vii.    Submission of work program should be made mandatory with penalty clause in case
        of default.

International Competitive Bidding

(i)     Where sectional completion is not stipulated, the liquidated damages are to be levied
        if the contractor fails to comply with the time for completion for the entire work,
        whereas, Clause 47.2 speaks for reduction of Liquidated Damages. Its interpretation
        may be done in different manner. In order to avoid ambiguity and dispute this clause
        should be suitably modified so as convey the true intention of the clause or
        interpreted in right earnest manner in COPA.
(ii)    Under FIDIC conditions of contract and COPA, time limit is not prescribed for
        rectification of defects noted or identified during defect liability period. According
        to the clause 49.4 in case of default at the part of the contractor in carrying out such
        instructions within a reasonable time the employer will rectify the defect at the risk
        and cost of the contractor. The reasonable time is very vague term and also it is very
        difficult to get the defect rectified due to small quantity of work. Because of this
        deficiency in contract conditions, the contractors often avoid timely rectification of
        defect causing inconvenience to the public. To avert such situation it is suggested to
        include the following provision in COPA.
        Every time notice of a defect is given, the contractor shall correct the notified defect
        within the length of time specified by the Engineer‘s notice. Performance Bank
        Guarantee should be forfeited if the Contractor fails to rectify the defects.
(iii)   A definite time limit should be prescribed from the date of serving of notice to
        adjudicate the dispute matter to DRB/Adjudicator by any party to the actual date of
        making reference for adjudication and similarly for Arbitration.




                                              44
National Competitive Bidding

(i)     A condition should be included in GCC (NCB) which should mean as under: ―The
        contractor will deploy at site only those key personnel who are approved by the
        Engineer. Non deployment of approved key personnel at work side would attract
        penalty as stated in contract data.
(ii)    The Employer should be empowered to make recovery of a specified amount per
        person per month if the contractor does not deploy key personnel or the approved
        key personnel remains absent from the works site without valid reasons exceeding a
        period of 7 days in a month.
(iii)   According to clause 38 the Engineer will adjust the rate of an item if its final
        quantity differs from the quantity stated in BOQ by more than 25 percent provided
        the change exceeds 1 percent of initial contract price. In order to adjust the rate the
        Contractor should be asked to submit the rate analysis of all the items in BOQ at the
        time of submitting his tender in sealed separate envelope. Clear cut mechanism for
        adjusting the rate should be incorporated in the contract. e.g. whether the adjusted
        rates are to be applied to entire quantity or increase in quantity or quantity increased
        beyond 25 percent.
(iv)    If the contractor‘s quotation is unreasonable for variation item, the Engineer will
        make his own forecast of the effects of the variation on contractor‘s costs.
        Mechanism to forecast the effects on contractor‘s cost should be included in the
        contract.
(v)     According to retention clause (clause 48) during defect liability period only 50
        percent of retention money in the form of Bank Guarantee remains with the
        Employer. Since the amount retained with the employer is not substantial, therefore
        the contractor avoids timely correction of defects. Total amount of retention money
        (5 percent of the actual cost of the project) should be retained with the employer
        during defect liability period. The refund should be made in phased manner
        according to the performance of the contractor and response time taken by him in
        correcting the defects during defect liability period.
(vi)    E-procurement should be allowed by the Bank so as to eliminate the practice of
        pooling by bidders before closing of bids.

4.2.3   Suggestions for improving Project Coordinating Consultant’s Services

i.      The payment to PCC during Detailed Project Report preparation stage should be
        output based and not man-months based in order to ensure timely and quality DPR,
        with provision of man-month monitoring also. If proposed man-month is not
        deployed, there should be proportionate deduction in amount being paid.
ii.     There should be provision for Performance Guarantee and imposition of Liquidity
        Damages in the contract of PCC also, so as to act as deterrent for timely submission
        of reports and performance of services. The TOR/Agreement should incorporate
        suitable clauses for: (i) Quality assurance on detailed engineering designs included
        in DPR, (ii) Quality audit and safety audit on detailed engineering design carried out
        by the design consultant; (iii) Responsibility for accuracy of design with
        economy/aesthetics; (iv) Disincentives and deterrent action for deficiency in designs
        and consultancy services; (v) Performance appraisal report.
iii.    In contract for civil works and in construction supervision contracts the role and
        mandate of project Coordinating Consultant needs to be defined clearly.
iv.     It may be desirable that the PCC is retained as the Supervision Consultant also. This
        will enable quick decision, early processing of design changes and ensure reduction
        in variations.

4.2.4   Suggestions for Improving Supervision Consultant’s Services

i.      The make-up of staff with strong international experience and local staff should be
        more balanced if international consultants are to be employed otherwise the benefit
        of employing an international consultant is diminished.
ii.     Replacement staff must be equal in caliber to the outgoing incumbent and in place in
        a timely fashion. Such replaced person should be inducted only after approval by the
        client. The remuneration should be reduced by 10 percent for each subsequent
        replacement each time.
iii.    The Construction Supervision Consultant need to be very proactive and should
        facilitate the progress of work along with strict quality control. Generally, it has
        been observed that CSC is not interested in the progress of work. They must help
        and guide the contractor to finish the work in time (as per work program). Suitable
        provisions in the contract should be made.
iv.     It is suggested that consultant's personnel posted on site supervision works should
        belong to the regular establishment of the consulting firm.
v.      The entire onus of defending the matter before the arbitrator lies on the employer. It
        is suggested that the CSC should be made responsible to provide his input till the
        arbitration process is over. A condition to this effect should be included in the terms
        reference of CSC services. The contract empowers CSC to take decision in respect
        of many aspects of exclusion without employer‘s concurrence. If any dispute arises,
        act of such decisions taken by engineer, onus of defending such disputes should
        entirely be on the CSC. If any extra payment results from disputes, CSC should be
        made to pay the same.
vi.     Accountability and liabilities of CSC and PCC have not been clearly laid out in the
        TOR of services. The CSC should also be hold responsible for any deficiency in the
        quality / quantity of the executed work and there should be provision of recovery for
        the financial loss sustained by the client, in case of failure of such executed works.

4.2.5   Suggestions for Borrower’s Effectiveness

i.      Dedicated Divisions must be in place right from the preparation stage of DPR. This
        would help in supervising the work of DPR Consultant and would also help during
        construction stage. These dedicated divisions should be made responsible for the
        routine and periodic maintenance of the prospective project road till the start of
        execution of work from state resources.
ii.     There should not be frequent changes of Chief Engineer / Project Director at the top
        level for consistency in decision making and reduction in variations. Similarly
        Executive Engineers and other technical staff working in externally aided project
        should also be posted till completion of concerned project roads.
iii.    Due to exposure of PWD Engineers towards the management of FIDIC Contracts,
        PWD Engineers can work more effectively as 'Engineer'. As such the limit for
        employment of Independent Engineer should be enhanced. Contracts bigger than `
        2000 million should be the threshold.
iv.     Strict and regular monitoring of progress, quality control and enforcement of
        contract provisions should be done at Govt. level. The monthly and quarterly
        progress report should not be stereo type and must contain analytical observations
        also.
v.      There should be regular monitoring of various statutory clearances, removal of
        utilities and Land Acquisition at Govt. level and higher authorities from Forest
        Department, Power Corporation, etc should be included in the monitoring/ steering
        committee.


                                             46
vi.     The Project Steering Committee / Governing Board should be authorized to clear all
        administrative and financial sanctions, issue of Excise/Custom exemption certificate,
        etc also. This will eliminate the lengthy present process of such sanctions and thus
        greatly enhance the progress of the project.
vii.    Detailed guidelines for appointment of Adjudicators / Arbitrators should be in place.
        Persons having knowledge / experience of FIDIC, Externally Aided Projects should
        be preferred.
viii.   The work of land acquisition and shifting of utilities should be well planned and
        coordinated. All preconstruction activities should be completed before the award of
        work. After the approval of draft sale deeds by the Govt, the Executive Engineer
        should be given authority to enter into the sale agreement and each case should not
        be required to be vetted by Law Department and Administrative Department of
        GOUP.O The entitlement unit for R&R should be household instead of PAP.
        However assistance may be increased accordingly.

4.2.6   Suggestions to Bank

i.      In general, the Bank's performance was found to be very good. In some cases,
        however, there were appreciable delay in according required approvals specially
        clearance of BOQ and variations.
ii.     The Employer should be permitted to sanction up to 5/10/15 percent variation in
        BOQ cost excluding price escalation.
iii.    The Bank need to arrange more workshops and advanced training program for
        updating the knowledge and know-how of borrower's personnel.

 5.     Way Forward

 With successful implementation of over 2600 km of highways, the focus will be on proper
 O&M of such road sections. It has been observed that with the improvement in riding
 quality, vehicles are ready to take long routes thereby increasing the traffic volume and
 overloading. So, the road network adjoining the project roads should also be kept in good
 condition. With possible increase in funding, reducing maintenance backlog and within
 budgetary constrains how best the road assets will be managed, shall be directly looked into.
 Apart from this, the Project, Policy and Planning Cell (PPU) established through UPSRP-II
 intervention shall continue to focus on midterm and long term planning and strategies.
 Already on the PPP Cell initiative, Data Collection and Road Network Master Plan work is
 going on which would help in future planning. At the same time perusing with update
 strategic options study, state is in readiness to have UPSRP-III as follow up project
 covering over 1000 km of core roads.

Subject:   -   UP State Roads Project- Loan No. 4684-IN —Draft Implementation
               Completion and Results Report for Comments.
Reference:- Your letter dated June 14, 2011

Dear Madam,

Please refer to your letter regarding abovementioned subject vide which
comments have been sought on the draft implementation completion and results reports.
Perusal of the data sheet indicates that the rating of the borrower's performance has been
rated 'moderately unsatisfactory'. Before giving our comments in detail on the ICR and
Results Report we would like to put forth our point of view with the request that the
above rating does not seen to be justifiable and needs amendment from your side.

The project preparation had started in the year 1999, when the country was on the onset of
economic as well as infrastructure boom. In that period proper and skilled professional
staffs were not available and at the same time a gamut of activities were expected to be
performed by PWD to which they were alien hitherto. To name a few issues , these are
environmental, social, road safety, procurement (both NCB and ICB), Supervision with the
help of Technical Assistance and supervisory consultants and administration and
management of very large sized contracts. Though the Bank did provide their help
throughout the project preparation and implementation of the project, but several issues
kept cropping up and they could not be handled with much promptness. Some of
the problems have been already mentioned in the ICR drafts prepared by PWD which is
placed at annexure 7 under the section 2.2 (delay and other concurred problems faced) on
page no. 39 & 40. This section has highlighted the various


                                            48
reasons due to which delays occurred and the foremost problem was faced due to dispute
and untimely termination of project coordinating consultant's (PCC) contract, which cost
us dearly both in terms of time and money. The PCC Consultants was not only supposed
to design the project but they were also supposed to provide help in
procurement ,implementation of several key issues, which were totally alien to PWD (e.g.
GIS, MIS, RMMS, IDS et.al.). The consultant was supposed to remain present
during the implementation of the project and provide nuance of design details as and when
required during the execution and guide us in proper contract administration. However,
due to unexpected exit of the consultant the department was left midway to handle a
large number of issues regarding which they had no experience of handling. But
the department recovered from the vaccum created due to exit of PCC consultant and
with our own resources and due helps from World Bank form time to time, somehow
completed the project. In our opinion the department should be commended for pushing
the project to a reasonable level. This is surprising that the project has been down rated
by the Bank which seems quite unfair and unreasonable to us. The draft ICR submitted
by PWD highlights all the problems encountered and also gives suggestions for
implementation in future projects. This is further to reiterate that PWD has learned
experience on their own and have delivered a successful project which is being
appreciated by all segment of the society. Moreover, the rating of the Bank team
associated with the project is also very low and we would like to request that if, there has
been any shortcoming due to the performance of the Bank at all, then we should not be
given discredit for that.

In the above background the comments all draft ICR Report of the Bank are mentioned as
below:

       F.               Results Framework Analysis
       a.               PDO Indicators — It has been stated that the PDO were revised but the
                        physical targets were not scale down and they were not presented to the
                        board. Therefore, performance has been assessed against original completion
                        target. — This to mention that the above comments are not fair because
                        revision of PDO was not the responsibility of PWD. Moreover, the perusal of
                        performance itself indicates that the PDOs have been achieved to the
                        maximum extent with few exceptions. In our opinion the achievement should
                        be viewed w.r.t. the revised PDO. Indicator 2 ( reduction in mean travel time)
                        and 3 ( decrease in number of road deaths/10,000 vehicles) have been



\Doeumerdsand Settings \ Office manager \ I k,ktop \ World Hank ICR r r doe
          fulfilled entirely, however our comments on your observations on other
          indicators are as below:

          Indicator 1( Increase in share of the percent of the core network in good
          or better condition As far as the indicator 1 in concerned the actual
                                  -




          achievement is 60% with respect to 70% target . In this case we would like to
          remind the World Bank that the total length of roads proposed to be taken up
          was 3500 Kms but actually only 2562 Kms could be taken up in this project
          mainly due to devaluation of US$ to the extent of 18% (from 48 per US$ to

            39.7 per US$) and untimely termination of PCC. Had the entire road length
          proposed were actually taken up in the project the achievement of Indicator-1
          would have been more than targeted.

          Indicator 4 (Share of project Roads with v:c ratio>1) A s f a r a s
                                                                    -




          indicator 4 is concerned, the vehicle capacity ratio has exceeded on four road
          sections. There was increased emphasis of infrastructure sector in the country
          on the whole. Due to which some areas showed increased traffic activity This
          may be attributed as one of the reasons for exceeding the capacity. Moreover,
          no major widening (from tow lane to four lane) was envisaged in the
          rehabilitation component, therefore no mid way correction could have been
          undertaken to offset this factor.

          Indicator 5 The average EIRR has been calculated at 25.4% against
                      -




          targeted 31% adjusted by actual sample of roads completed as per table No-1
          on page 13 for Upgradation packages. So the achievement is 82% as against
          76% reported. The IIT, Roorkee had earlier reported negative EIRR on four
          numbers of packages, however they were insisted on reviewing the same.
          After reevaluating they have reported EIRR for three packages would be
          negative however for one package (UPG/06) it is 92%. The Bank is not in
          consensus with their revised value. Had the 92% value been considered, then
          ex-post EIRR would have been almost the same as envisaged at the appraisal
          stage.

             In view of above the World Bank's rating in the case of achievement of
          PDO as "moderately unsatisfactory "may be reviewed.

   b.      Intermediate Outcome Indicators All the physical targets (value
                                                     —




           qualitative and quantitative) have been viewed in respect to the original scope
           of work which has reduced the achievements made in the project. It is again


C\Documents end Settings\Office manager\Desktop\World Bank_ICR re rev.doc
                                   requested that revision of PDO was not the responsibility of PWD. Reduction
                                   in scope of work was necessitated due to devaluation of US$ and revised
                                   designs. It is also imperative that the project design was carried out in the
                                   year 1999-2000 while the execution started in 2003-04. Due to this time lag
                                   the road condition deteriorated and the quantities earlier assessed were bound
                                   to be changed. Therefore, PWD should not be underrated for carrying out the
                                   extra quantity of work which not only consumed more time but also lead to
                                   cost and time overrun.

            Perusal of performance of intermediate outcome indicators itself speaks about the
            achievements which should have been lauded instead of underrated in terms of the
            performance.

            2.1.2 Participatory Processes — The statement that the planned detailed
            engineering for about 50 percent of civil works contracts before appraisal and about
            35-40 percent of the contracts prior to loan effectiveness were not adequately
            completed which had an adverse effect during the Project implementation is not true
            because the detailed engineering had been completed before appraisal. However,
            large variations in the quantities were due to deteriorated field conditions, which lead
            to revision of the designs.

            2.2                       (b) Implementation issues: - It has been stated that Lack of effective
                                   collaboration between GoUP/PWD and other concerned Departments lead to
                                   delay in relocation of utilities, R&R , obtaining excise and custom duty etc.
                                   These delays occurred despite the best efforts on part of PWD for which
                                   PWD should not be discredited.

            In view of the large size of the project and even after early exit of the PCC consultant,
            PWD made best efforts despite lack of necessary technical support and completed the
            project, which happens to be a milestone in the road sector of the state. The project has
            been appreciated at large by the public due to which there is further demand for another
            World Bank loan for UPSR-III. The project had exposed PWD Engineers to current trends
            and has accelerated the infrastructure growth in the state. The disbursement of loan
            amount has been to the tune of 91% which is fair enough,in spite of various problems such
            as termination of PCC Consultant and curtailment in project length etc. The other ratings
            of World Bank are moderately satisfactory, so the overall rating of the
C : \ U uum e nts and Se tting s \ O ff i c e m anag e r O e s k to p \ Wo r ld B an t. _ I C R r c my d o c
project as "moderately unsatisfactory "is not acceptable. Therefore in the light of our above
comments it is requested that the rating of the project must be reviewed and PWD
should not discredited for the bottlenecks which were inevitable and not in their control.
