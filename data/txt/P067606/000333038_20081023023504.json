The specific objectives of this RAP are\n            to: identify the PAPs by the type of loss and extent of\n            damage, categorize entitled persons (EPs) according to the\n            eligibility criteria of the resettlement &\n            rehabilitation (R&R) policy of the project, work out\n            entitlements for each EP based on the criteria laid down in\n            the R&R policy, ensure that all PAPs are aware of their\n            entitlements under the policy and participate actively in\n            the project, identify land resettlement and the preferences\n            of the PAPs for their relocation, develop institutional\n            support for implementation of the R&R process, evolve a\n            suitable mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of the\n            R&R process and indicate the parameters for monitoring,\n            and phase the implementation of RAP through nongovernmental\n            organizations. Nearly 8 percent of the total PAPs will be\n            displaced due to loss of residential area. Nearly one third\n            of the PAPs will be displaced due to loss of commercial\n            establishments. Rehabilitation and assistance will be to any\n            individual impacted for loss of livelihood. Project-affected\n            groups are entitled, but not limited, to restoration and\n            improvement of common property resources."}, "docdt": "2007-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
