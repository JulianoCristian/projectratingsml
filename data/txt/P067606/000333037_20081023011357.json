Nearly 8 percent of the total PAPs will be\n            displaced due to loss of residential area. Nearly one third\n            of the PAPs will be displaced due to loss of commercial\n            establishments. Rehabilitation and assistance will be to any\n            individual impacted for loss of livelihood.
