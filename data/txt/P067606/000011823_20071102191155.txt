        Certain negdtive social impacts are inherent with any developmental project. Similarly because of this
        kxoject, 765 agricultural Plots would be acquired many of them would be econon~icallyunviable.

        LAND REQUIREMENTAND ACQUISITION PROCESS

A


        The construction of bridge approaches and guide bund will entail land acquisition. A total of
        approximately 66.3056 hectare of land will be acquired. The land will be acquired through private
PC-

        negotiation. The proposed acquisition will be in three districts and 15villages.
-

        'I he overall affect of the proposed bridge approaches has been on agriculture land. By the proposed
        bridge a total of 783 household including 1567families will be affected which in turn will affect 3084
        persons under the TH category. For NTH category a total of 30 household including 49 families will
        be affected which in turn will affect 104 persons. Majority of the PAPs are other backward caste,
        scheduled castes and general castes. Under TH category out of the total affected families, 831 families
        ate vulne~ableout of which 56 are women headed. Under NTH category 37 vulnerable families will
        bc affected. Hindulsni has mass following in the project area.


        1100 of the total TH PAPs and 43 amongst NTH PAPS are engaged in some economically gainful
        act~vityand hence are in the category of main workers. The survey result shows, agriculture to be the
        main occupation of the PAPs. Income from these sources was added up and weighted average was
        taken to arrive at average annual income figure.

        The household assets recorded during the sample socio-economic survey includes; livestock,
        household furniture, utensils, durables, etc. Ownership of tractor and thrasher is also less than one
        p e ~fam~l>in the project.


        ENTITLEMENTFRAMEWORK


        The Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) policy prepared by Project Co-coordinating Cor~sultants
        (PCC) for Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department (UP PWD) and approved by Government of Uttar
        Pradesli is based on World Bank's Operational Directives (OD) 4.30' and 4.20' for resettlement of
        ~nvolu~~tarilydisplaced persons and indigenous people. The action plan has been prepared based on
        the hroad outlu~eslaid down in the pol~cy.The principle of the R&R policy is the guidlng philosophy
        to provide a development approach to resettle and rehabilitate the people affected by project. In
        pd~ticular


             Wherever possible, displacement will be reduced on 01.avoided altogether by sensitive design of
             civil works (e.g.alternative designs or modification to the design).

     Where displacement is unavoidable, those displaced will have their living stal~dardimproved.
     They will be located as a single unit among the peer groups or will be assisted to integrate into
     thelr new community. Particular attention will be paid to the needs of the most vulnerable groups
     to be resettled.
     I'APs will be compensated, at replacement cost, for assets lost.
     Adequate social and physical infrastructure will be provided.
     PAPs and host community would be encouraged to participate in the design and the
     implementation of RAP.




7 hi ee primal y categories have been identified for entitlement of compensation and assistance under
R&R package of Governmentof Uttar Pradesh, viz.
     Project Affected Families (PAFs)
     Project Affected individual Adults (PAAs)
     Project Affected Groups (PAGs)


Project Affected Families

         livelihood.


Project Affected Persons
All majors in a household (i.e. above the age of 18 years) are eligible for assistance for loss of
livclihoods. Thus, there may be more than one person eligible in each household. The project will
provide rehabilitation and assistance for loss of livelihood for any individual impacted by the project.
Additional support mechanisms will be made available to re-establish or enhance their livelihood
through existing government poverty alleviation programmes. If available, employment associated
with the project would be provided. The entitlement package includes:


r    Rehabilitation and Assistance for lost or diminished livelihood. All PAPs eligible under this
     package will be provided help to improve or at least regain the former income level. Special
     nttent~onwill be paid to the vulnerable groups.

     number of job opportunities will be created by the project. In such opportunities, preference will
     be glven to the PAPS.These job opportunities will be over and above the assistance provided to
     restorc their lost income level. These opportunities are not necessarily limited to the vulnerable
     group, but to every PAP. The majority of the jobs created will be in unskilled and senil-sk~lled
    nature therefore can always be given to the PAPS.

PUBLICCONSULTATIONS


Public participation was undertaken to make explicit the social factors that will affect the
development impacts of planned highway improvements and mediate project results. Through public
participation, stakeholders and key socia1 issues were identified and strategy was formulated. It
included soc~o-culturalanalysis and design of social strategy, institutional analysis and specifically
ncidressed the issue of how poor and vulnerable groups may benefit from the project.


Consultations were held at local (community) level. The main objectives of the consultation program
were to minimize negative impact in the project corridors and to make people aware of the project.
Wonien were consulted to understand their work participation rate, perception about the project,
in~yactof construction of the bridge on their daily work etc. During the process efforts were made to
ascertain the views and preferences of the women.


The aims of community consultation were:

 I    To understand views of the people affected w.r.t to the inipacts of the road

 I    To identify and assess all major economic and sociological characteristics of the village to enable
      effective planning and implementation and,
 r    To resolve the issues relating to affect on community property

ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES


The alternatives were explored for the bridge location and the approaches. The bridge location has
been finalised after carrying out hydraulic model study. This study has been conducted by IIT,
K'inpur. The study recommends optimum bridge length and protection measures. Details of
alternatives have been discussed in section 4.5.

IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULEAND INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENT


Implementation plan has been spread over a period of two years. A simplified sununary of the
operational aspects of the implementation plan will be prepared when the project starts It will be
given to PWD, who along with a route wise selected NGOs will have to put the plan into action.


RAP has the provision for the following mechanism/committees for proper implementation of action
plan:

    G r i e ~ ~ ~redress mechanism: The grievance redress mechanism is an important aspect of R&R.
                 n c e
    'The LA Act provides adequate provision at different stages of the LA process for the PAPs to
    object to the proposed acquisition of land and other properties, compensation rates, etc. The LA
    Act allows the affected person to receive compensation under protest and then refer the case to
    the court for settlement. LA will be an integral part of the project. Hence, grievances will be not
    only related to LA but also for entitlement for rehabilitation assistances. To avoid litigations,
    which may delay the project implementation, RAP has a provision for constituting Grievance
    IZedress Committee at district level. The GRC will try to settle grievances at the project level itself.
    'l'he rne111bel.sof the committee would be DistrictMagistrate as head, representatives of local NGOs,
    ~.epresentativeof people (viz. Member of Parliament, Member of Legislative Assembly, etc),
    representatives of blocks, districts, line departments & affected persons. At central level, Project
    Director of ProjectImplementation Unit will head the committee.
> Effective RAP implementation will require institutional relationships and responsibilities, rapid
    organisational development and collaborative efforts by PWD, State Government, partner NGO
    and affected population. ESRDC has already been established vide GO no. 3262/23/12/003-
    10,G.I./96 TC dated 29-09-2003. The ESRDC is constituted of one executive engineer who reports
    to Chief Engineer (World Bank) and is supported by AE (social) and AE (environment). The
    ESRDC ~villestablish operational links within SRP-I1 and with other agencies of government
    irivolved in project-induced resettlement. It will bridge the distance between the project and
    project affected persons and communities. It will provide the means and mechanisms for co-
    ordinating the delivery of the compensation and assistance entitled to those who will suffer loss.
    ESRDC will link the project with state government agencies, provide liaison with SRP-I1 field
    units and impacted communities, establish district level committees to co-ordinate social
    development and resettlement operations in the field and also to assist NGO partners It will also
    engage required training services, oversee a grievance redress process and actively monitor RAP
    iniplementation. On behalf of PWD, the ESDRC will assume the responsibility for representing
    the social impact and resettlement components of the project for environment clearance. The
    ESDRC will also be responsible for disseminating this information to the public and providing
    additional opportunities for public comment.

Need for NGO/CBO
The relocation disturbs the present activities of PAPs and therefore there is a need to establish and
stabilise their economic living. While all tasks relating to land acquisition is taken care by the Land
Acquisition Officer and his staff, the implementation of RAP is the responsibility of the SDRC under
PWD. The NGO will help in implementing various components of the RAP, particularly the use of
compensation and rehabilitation assistance for niore productive purposes like purchase of land, self-
elnployment, etc. Its involvement is all the more important since there are no social coi~imunity
organisations among the PAPs which otherwise could have taken lead in this regard.


Being new to the area of working with PAPs, the selected NGO will have to work directly under the
SDKC -coordinator who will be defacto in charge for implementation of RAP. Thus implementation
becolnes joint responsibility of PWD and NGO.

Role of NGO
I<esettlement relates to human aspects and economic rehabilitation requires human resources
development conslsbng of education, training, awareness generation, etc. NGO will be mvolved to assist
I'WD rn ~mplementationof RAP. The NGO will help educating PAPs on the proper utilisahon of
conlpensation and rehabilitation grant and help them in getting financial assistance, if requ~red,under
various subsidy related development programmes. It will also organise training programmes to impart
rcquned skill for such PAPs who would prefer to go for self-employment schemes. Specifically, the tasks
of the NGO will be to:


    Tlevelop rapport with PAPs and between PAPs and PWD
    Assess the level of skills and efficiency in pursuing economic activities, identify needs for training
    ,~ndorganise programmes either to improve the efficiency and/or to impart new skills.
    Assist PAP in receiving rehabilitation entitlement due to them
    Motivate and guide PAP for proper utilisation of benefits under R&R policy provisions;
    Facilitate purchase of agriculture land in negotiating price and settling at a reasonable price or
    expedite the same through Land Purchase Committee.
    Assist PAPs in obtaining benefits from the appropriate development programmes.
    Ht.Ip PA13 in increasing their farm income through provision of irrigation facility or improving
    fatmi practices, and
    Ensure marketing of produce particularly those under self-employment activities.
    Complete the consultation at the community level and provide support by describing the
    entitlements to the EPs and assisting them in their choices
    Accompany and represent the EPs at the Grievance Committee meeting.
    Assist the EPs to take advantage of the existing governlnent housing schemes and enlployment
    and training schemes that are selected for use during the project, and
    Carry out other responsibilities as required and identified.


In the context of implementing of RAP, it is important that NGO, which is genuine and committed to
the task entrusted, is selected. An NGO with local presence is, however, more suitable hence would
be preferred. The NGO may be contracted on specified terms and conditions with proper fixation of
financial accountability. The payment to NGO will be linked to the performance of the task assigned
and the time period. The payment will be arranged on quarterly basis to be released on certification of
completing the previous task. The monitoring of R&R programme will also include the perforniance
of NGO. The NGO services will be required for      tzilo yenusfor which provisions have been earmarked
in the plan.


District Level Committees
RAP will be implemented through District Level Committees that will be established in each district
where the project is active. These committees will provide co-coordinating nodes for land acquisition
and compensation, relocation and rehabilitation, distribution of project provided assistance and
PAPs' access to most government programmes. SDRC will service district committees with field staff
allocated to multi-district construction contracts.


The current structure of DLC formed as per GO No. 3262/23 September 2003, PGI/96 TC PWD Div.
XI1 dated 29/09/2003 will be followed. The DLC members include District Magistrate, Chief
Development Officer, Executive Engineer -SRP 11, ADM revenue, Local Lead Bank Manager,
~epresentativesof PAPs and NGO, and Gram Pradhan.




Basic information on IR activities of PAPs will be available from the census and socio-economic
surveys. Information from base line surveys will be available on features of economic activities of
PAPs under two categories, viz. Land based economic activities; Non-land economic activities; Total

Project induced displacement may lead to loss or diminished income for Project Affected Person
(PAPS).'The main categories of impacts are as follows:

      Loss of agriculture land in part or full
      Loss of commercial establishments (permanent)
      1,oss of teniporary commercial structure or mobile vendor (Squatters)
      l,oss of livelihood (Commercial tenants or helping hands, agriculture labours)


Projects like road development involve acquiring linear strips of land; as such the impacts are not
expected to be significant. However, mitigation measures need to be planned and implemented
however insignificant the impacts may be.


The entitlement framework has the following provisions for restoration of income:

r     If a person is losing source of income (wage earning- indirectly affected due to the employer
      being displaced), the individual is entitled for grant equivalent to minimun~wages calculated for
      6 months.
      'Those losing income opportunity are eligible for grant calculated at minimum wages (Rs2000,'-
      per month) for a maximum period of six months. They are also entitled for training for skill
      upgradation.

I     Vulnerable PDPs are eligible for economic rehabilitation grant calculated at minimum one-year
      income level as determined by Planning Commission, Government of India.

1.0     INTRODUCTION

1.1     Project Description

        The Uttar Pradesh State Road Project I1 aims to improve road network of State through up-
        gradation and major maintenance of state roads. The state roads selected in the project
        coniprise of Ordinary District Roads (ODRs), Major District Roads (MDRs) and State
        Highways (SHs).


        In addition to improvement of road network, five bridges have been planned on major rivers
        of state. Out of these two have been planned on Ghaghara river and one on Sharada river that
        are on routes selected for upgradation and remaining two are on routes selected for major
        maintenance routes. The two bridges planned on Ghaghara include one at Chahlari Ghat and
        one at Kamariaghat (Refer Figure 1).


        The present volume covers social assessment and Resettlement Planning of Kamariaghat
        bridge on Ghaghara river. The proposed bridge and its approaches on Ghaghara bridge at
        Knmariaghat would be four laned. The bridge at Kamariaghat will be 840111 in length and its
        approach length towards Gorakhpur will be 9056m and towards Shahganj 504m.To train the
        river the length of guide bund on both Gorakhpur and Shahganj side is 1500m.


        This document comprises the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) of the
        proposed bridges. The RAP meets all Government of India (GOI) and World Bank
        resettlement-related requirements and complies with applicable GO1 and World Bank
        (OP/BP 4.12) regulations, policies, and procedures including those on public participation,
        environmental assessment and indigenous people. It confirms to provisions of Rcsetflernetlt

        1769/23-12-2000-2NHO/99 dated December 13,2000.


        Uttar Pradesh PWD will implement this RAP with assistance from other government
        agencies, and non-governmental- and community-based organisations, and consultants.


1.2     Social Impact Assessment

        Social Impact Assessment of proposed intervention of the project is an important component
        of project preparation. GO1 and GOUP regulations and World Bank policy require social
        impact assessment during the design stage to avoid, reduce or mitigate potential negative
        impacts of project action and enhance positive impacts, sustainability and development
        benefits.


        The assessments also contribute to the preparation of social management action plans,
        governing project implementation and the resettlement and rehabilitation of those who may
        be di5placed by the proposed bridge.

         I'he project's soc~alimpacts and resettlement conlponent includes assessment of soc~al
         impacts of the project and development of appropriate mitigation plans as required. These
         plans must comply with appropriate national and local laws and guidelines, and with World
         Bank policy directives. Social assessment is carried out in close co-ordinahon with
         environmenta1 assessment and includes consultation and participation among project
         stakeholders, local communities and potentially affected groups. The social impact
         assessment and resettlement planning component has following elements:
             C'ensu5 and baseline socio-economic survey of the potentially affected population;
             IJreparatlon of a time-bound Resettlement Action Plan (RAP);
             Consultations at village level;


         A full census has been undertaken in 60 m corridor to register and document the status of the
         potentially affected population within the project impact area1, their assets, and sources of
         livelihood. Socio-economic survey was also carried out on census basis. This survey provides
         a baseline against which mitigation measures and support will be measured and includes
         comprehensive exan~inatioliof people's assets, incomes, important cultural or religious
         networks or sites, and other sources of support such as common property resources. Analyses
         ot survey results cover the needs and resources of different groups and individuals, including
         intra-household and gender analysis. The table 1.1given below provides a comparative
         analysis of impacts in villages of project roads.

        As the table 1.1 above shows, a total of 783 household including 1567families will be affected
        which in turn will affect 3084 persons under the TH category. For NTH category a total of 30
        household including 49 families will be affected which in turn will affect 104persons.

        As the table I .2 above shows, impact is pri~narilyon agriculture land Many of the plot
        acquired would be economically unviable (see Annexure 4) but the project-affected families
        would not be called as project displaced families as they have not been physically displaced
        also majority of parcel of land under question are transferable (sankramaniya) land.


        Preparation of the RAP has been undertaken within the project's social assessment
        component. A key pre-requisite of the RAP is a policy framework for resettlement containing
        categories of impacts and their corresponding entitlements. The RAP provides detailed
        guidnnce on how to implement provisions in the policy framework, including institutional
        arrangements and budgets based on enumeration of project-affected people with entitlements
         under the framework. The RAP is also an important component of the project's overall
         Environmental Management Action Plan developed in the environmental assessment.

         2.1     Introduction
iU**             This section deals with the approach and methodology followed for the collection and
                 analysis of data. Social impact assessment and resettlement planning component has three
                 main elements:
 *pl




                     Identification of affected plots
d*-                  Census and baseline socio-economic survey of potentially affected population, and;
                     Preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan

 &



 --              These elements have been further elaborated in the following paragraphs.


         2.2     Social Assessment Process
                 The complete R&R process included integration of environment and social inputs. The R&R
  DL*
                 team includecl Social Scientists, Civil Engineers, Field Supervisors, Con~munityOrganisers
                 and field investigators doing the census verification, socio-economic surveys and public
  m
                 consultations.


         2.3     Consultation Methodology
v*"


                 The objectives of the consultation were to disseminate information about the project to the

 *r              potentially affected population in order to incorporate their views and suggestion for
                 preparing the RAP. Second objective was later on added, as one of the objectives of State
                 Roads Project is also to alleviate poverty in the districts through which the road is passing
r*

                 through Keeping in view, the complexity of consultation, local level consultations were
                 carried out during census survey. However, during the preparation of RAP for upgradation
4-
                 route in 2001-2002, both district as well as state level discussions was taken up.

.dl
                 Local Level Consultation
                 Women Community Organisers led by a Qualitative Data Expert consulted with the
.m               potentially affected population in-groups. Care was taken to ensure that each group is not
                 larger than 15 persons. Before initiating the Group Discussion, rapport building exercise was

*bb              carried out with the villagers.

                 District Level Consultation
lrre

                 The objective of district level consultations was to create awareness about the project among
                 the people, district administration, and officials of line departments and NGOs working in
C"r

                 the district and particularly along the project road. These consultations were held in
                 Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar. During the consultation R&R policy as
nrrX.
                 approved by State Government was also discussed. Suggestions on design were invited from
-                the participants and it has been incorporated in the design reports.

                 State Level Consultation
                 State Level Stakeholder Workshop was held in Lucknow on February 11, 2002, to appraise
d h

3.0     RESETTLEMENT POLICIES AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

3.1     Background
        The Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) policy prepared by Project Co-ordinating
        Consultants (PCC)for Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department (UPPWD) is based on World
        Bank's Operational Directives (O.D.) 4.301 and 4.204 for resettlement of involuntarily
        d~splacedpersons and indigenous people and UP State Rehabilitation Policy. The action plan
        has been prepared based on the broad outlines laid down in the policy. The principle of the
        K&R policy is the guiding philosophy to provide a development approach to resettle and
        iehahilitate the people affected by project. In particular;


            Wherever possible, displacement will be reduced or avoided altogether by sensitive
            design of civil works (e.g.alternative designs or modification to the design).


            Where displacement is unavoidable, those displaced will have their living standard
            improved. They will be located as a single unit among the peer groups or will be assisted
            to integrate into their new community. Particular attention will be paid to the needs of
            the most vulnerable groups to be resettled.


            PAPS will be compensated, at replacement cost, for assets lost. Adequate social and
            physical infrastructure will be provided.


        o   PAPS and host community would be encouraged to participate in the design and the
            implementatior~of RAP.


        The RAP delivers a comprehensive package of compensation and assistance to entitled
        persons, families/groups suffering losses as a result of the project. It provides mitigatioii for:

            Loss of livelihood or income opportunities
            Collective impact on groups such as loss of community infrastructure, common property
            resources, and others


        All losses will be compensated and assistance will be provided at replacement value,
        irrespective of their legal standing in the project area. Special assistance will be extended to
        the vuh~erableto enhance their earning opportunities.


3.2     Entitlement Categories
        Three primary categories have been identified for entitlement of compensation and assistance
        under R&R package of Government of Uttar Pradesh, viz.
            Project Affected Families
            Project Affected individual Adults (PAAs)

        PROJECTAFFECTED PERSONS
        All niajors in a household (i.e.above the age of 18years) are eligible for assistance for loss of
        livelihoods. Thus, there may be more than one person eligible in each household. The project
        will provide rehabilitation and assistance for loss of livelihood for any individual impacted
        by the project. Additional support mechanisms will be made available to re-establish or
        enhance their livelhood through existing government poverty alleviation programmes. It

            livelihood. Vulnerable group will receive counselling on alternatives, guidance on
            appropriate training programmes and advice on marketing new products.


            Employment opportunities connected with the project to the extent possible. It is
            expected that number of job opportunities will be created by the project. In such
            opportunities, preference will be given to the PAPS.These job opportunities will be over
            and above the assistance provided to restore their lost income level. These opportunities
            are not necessarily limited to the vulnerable group, but to every PAP. The majority of the
           jobs created will be of unskilled and semi-skilled nature therefore can always be given to
            the PAPS.

3.4        Land Acquisition


3.4.1      Land Acquisition through private negotiation

           Total land accluisition will be to the tune of 66.3056 hectares. Land will be acquired through
           p~ivate negotiation under The Uttar Pradesh Land Acquisition (Determination of
           Compensation and Declaration of Award by Agreement) Rules, 1997. The replacement value
           of the land shall be determined by three methods and highest of all shall be considered. NGO
           will facilitate SRP -11 field staff for arriving at replacement value. Three methods to arrive at
           replacement value are:

3.4.1.1 Sale Statistics Method
           Idand being an immovable property, all its sales and purchases have to be registered. The
           registered sale prices can be taken as adequate indicator of market value of a given piece of
           land. Sale prices of those lands, which are comparable in time and quality, are only to be
           considered. Following steps are involved in calculating compensation according to sales
           statistics method.
           Step 1:       Collect statistics of sales of land/buildings adjacent to ones being acquired in
                         three to four years preceding 4(1) notification from Registration Department.
           Step 2:       Workout average of 3 to 4 years per acre/hectare.
           Step 3:       Average Price (AP) + 0.3 AP+0.12APper annum from the date of 4(1) notification
                         to date of award to arrive at compensation.
           Step 4:       Add damages, if any or incidental, if any.
           Step 5:       Calculate interest from date of award at 9% for first 12 nionths and 15%for the
                         period thereafter.


3.4.1.2 Capitalisation Method
           Where reliable information is not available about the prevailing market value of the land,
           capitalisation method is used to decide compensation. Following steps are involved in
           calculating compensation according to capitalisation method.
           Step I:       Gross Income - Cost=Net Income
           Step 2:       Net Income x Multiplier* Market Value
                                                             =

           Step 3:       Market Value (MV) +30% of MV as solatiurn + 12% of MV per antiurn as
                         Additional Market Value =Compensation
           Step 4:       Compensation + Damages / incidental + interest

           "There are    110fixed limits on the choice of the multiplier. It is based on conjectures or
           precedents. Generally, a multiplier of 10 to 12 is used for valuing non-irrigated land whereas
           8 to 10 is deemed sufficient for irrigated lands. For buildings based on net rental income, a

        AND DECLARATION OF AWARD BY AGREEMENT)RULES, 1997
        Tht. rules were made in the exercise of power under subsection 2 of section 11 of the Land
        Acquisition Act, 1894 and was published in Offic~nlGazette No. 2(4)(1)/85 24-Rev-13, dated

        indicating the terms and conditions so settled down and its readiness and willingness for
        determination of compensation and declaration of award in accordance with agreement. The
        Collector shall, if satisfied, issue notice to the persons interested in the land under acquisition
        to evpress their readiness and willingness to execute the agreement in writing, on the matters
        to be included in the award".


        A change was made in the above rules regarding setting up of a committee for finalisation of

4.0     ABOUT THE STATE AND SURVEYRESULTS


4.1     Socio-Demographic Profile of the State


4.1.1   DEMOGRAPHY
        Uttal Pradesh constitutes one of the largest states in India and the state itself represents one
        of the largest self-governing areas in the world in terms of population. The State of Uttar
        Pradesh, whilst fourth largest in India in geographical land area, has a populat~onthat is
        estimated to be of the order of 170million people, a figure superseded by only six countries in
        the world.


        The 2001 Census recorded a figure of 166 million people, which, with a total land area of
        298,000 square kilometres, represented an average population density of 473 persons per
        square kilometre. The population growth rate between the 1971 and 1991 census remained
        constant at 2 3 percent per annum over this twenty-year period. In 1991-2001the growth rate
        increased to 2.6%.Based on this population growth rate, average population density is
        calculated to have increased over 638 persons per square kilometre.


        Table 4.1 shows the regional summary of population and population density, as per the
        Census data, for the last five decades and the corresponding inter-census growth rates. This
        population spread reflects the fact that most of Uttar Pradesh's highly populated areas is
        characterised by the flat, fertile plains of the sub Terai lowlands, conducive to farming and
        agriculture. The less densely populated areas are confined to the south-western parts of the
        State. Northern region of Uttar Pradesh now known as Uttaranchal is a separate State, hence
        has been excluded from further analysis of information.

        The state of Uttar Pradesh is characterized by a relatively large number of small villages with
        half of the State's population living in villages of less than 2,000 inhabitants in 1981.When
        settlements with a population of less than 5,000 people are included, then as much as 80
        percent of the State-wide population is accounted for. As is the trend in developing countries
        worldwide, the extent of urbanization is rising. This is evidenced by the increase to 47 (in
        2001) of the number of urban areas in Uttar Pradesh having a population in excess of 100,000
        people. Urban growth has registered 3.3percent per annum over the period 1991-2001whilst
        the annual growth rate in the rural population was 2.6 percent. The urban to rural split as per
        2001 census is 79.20:20.80.The major urban areas with a population agglomeration in excess
        of one million peopIe (as of 2001) are the State capital Lucknow, the industrial city of Kanpur,

        Regional Variations


        As mentioned in the Five Year Plans, the State of Uttar Pradesh is broken down into four
        economic regions, these being the Western, Central, Eastern and Bundelkhand regions.
        Purely in terms of demography, the Eastern region is relatively disadvantaged in comparison
        to the other regions in that both higher population densities and decennial population growth
        rates have served to place greater pressures on agricultural productivity and output. The
        relative poverty of the eastern region is further evidenced by the published data on various
        socio-economic indicators, infrastructure facilities and per capita output. A sumillary of the
        data across the four regions relative to the value for Uttar Pradesh, is presented below for
        comparative purposes, in Table 4.3.

4.1.2    TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
         Although Uttar Pradesh has three distinct physical divisions, the flat, low-lying Gangetic
         plains largely dominate the State. The Gangetic plains lie largely between 1OOm and 300m
         above sea level. A narrow east-west belt, lying in the northern part of the State alongside the
         border with Nepal, constitutes what is known as the Terai, an area of marshland that was
         once ~lnfitfor human habitation.


         The width of this Terai belt has diminished considerably since the 1950s due to intensive
         measures taken on both sides of the Uttar Pradeshl Nepalese border to eradicate malaria and
         recover the land for agriculture. Outside of the Terai, the high fertility of the plains permits a
         two-crop cycle in both the winter and rainy seasons. The southernmost hills and plateau have
         scarce rainfall and high temperatures.


         There are two major riverine systems in Uttar Pradesh. Although both the Ganga and
         Yan~unarivers originate in the Himalayan glaciers, their respective flows are determined by
         the Hinialayas in the north and by the southern hills and plateau. The Himalayan Rivers are
         full almost all the year round and fill gradually with water from the melting snowfall in the
         summer, whereas the southern rivers dry up in the summer and are therefore more prone to
         rapid flooding in the rainy season.


         There are three main climatic seasons in Uttar Pradesh, the winter months from October to
         February, the summer months from March to June and the monsoon period between June
         and September in which most rainfall takes place. Uttar Pradesh is largely temperate in
         climate with temperatures ranging between 12 and 17degrees Celsius in the winter period in
         January and exceeding the 40 degree Celsius mark in the summer months of May and June.
         The summer months, prior to the onset of the monsoon rains, are also characterised by hot
         winds blowing from the west. Average annual rainfall in most of the State is 990 mm.


4.1.3    LAND USE
         Land use in Uttar Pradesh is predominantly agriculture based. The breakdown of land
         utilisation in the State is shown in Table 4.4. The Remote Sensing Centre within the
         Department of Science and Technology has carried out limited aerial photographic surveys of
         selected urban areas such as Varanasi, but recent land use mapping for the State as a whole is
         not ),et available. The most recent map based published information relating to land use is
         that conta~nedin a detailed Planning Atlas of Uttar Pradesh6, which was published in 1987
         and largely refers to the position prevailing in the State between 1981and 1984.

         Nonetheless, given that agricultural land holdings will have remained relatively unchanged
         over the past 15to 20 years, such mapping provides a useful indication of the major land use
         dctivities in Uttar Pradesh.

4.1.4     ADMINISTRATIVESTRUCTURE
         Under the Constitution of India, Uttar Pradesh has a Governor and a bicameral legislature or
         two IIouses of Assembly, a Vidhan Parishad and a Vidhan Sabha, largely based on the British
         Westminster system. There is the Council of Ministers that is collectively responsible to the
         Vidhan Parishad, this Council being presided over by a Chief Minister who is appointed by
         the Governor. The Vidhan Sabha comprises 403 members. The maximum term of the Vidhan
         Parishad is five years after which elections must be held. The main business of this elected
         chamber is to enact legislation and grant funds for State Government expenditure. Budget
         estimates are put to the vote of Assembly members. The business of the House is assisted by a
          number of legislative, financial and other committees. A State Government Secretariat, based
          in the State capital Lucknow, assists and advises the Council of Ministers. This Secretariat,
         headed by a Chief Secretary and a hierarchy of Principal and other Secretaries, functions as
         the executive authority of the State Government through its various departments. Below the
         Secretariat and Heads of Department levels, the Divisional Commissioner is responsible, at
          divisional level, for law and order, administration, revenue collection and other matters. Each
         division con~prisesa number of districts in which a district officer, either the District
          Magistrate or the Deputy Cornmissioner, is responsible for all administrative affairs in the
          distnct. There are 70 districts in Uttar Pradesh aggregated into 19 administrative divisions.
          For administrative purposes, districts are further disaggregated down into tehsils, blocks and
         villages.


4.2       MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW

4.2.1     State Domestic Product
         Uttar Pradesh, although the State supporting the highest share of the country's population, at
          approximately 16.4 percent, has consistently lagged behind national performance in key
         eco~~oniicareas. On the basis of per capita State Domestic Product (SDP) growth rates? with
          occasional exceptions in the 1970s and the early 1990s, Uttar Pradesh has under-performed
          the all India series. The declining share of State Domestic Product compared to the National
         Domestic Product has been reflected in the State's Five Year Development Plan objectives of
         stemming this decline and endeavouring to keep pace with national projections of economic
         growth. Historical data on SDP is shown in Table 4.5 and the sectoral breakdown, on the
         basis of industrial classification, is shown in Table 4.6 for 1996197 and provisionally
         estimated for 1997198.

          Within the primary and secondary sectors of the economy, the major contributors are
          understandably agriculture and manufacturing respectively, whereas in the tertiary sector,
          the contribution to SDP is more diluted, the key performer being trade and commerce. Table
          4.7 shows the year on year change for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors in the four-
          year period up to 1998.The structure of the labour force is also a reflection of Uttar Pradesh's

        relatively poor economic performance vis-a-vis other major States and the continued reliance
        on agriculture to support much of its population. The agricultural sector accounts for nearly
        three quarters of the work force and the share of workers in industry was nine percent

        In investil~entterms, Uttar Pradesh has, relative to its size with regard to being the most
        populous State in India, historically suffered from receiving a disproportionately lower share
        of both public and private sector funding. In the public sector domain, this is in terms of both
        previous Five Year Plan outlays, the share of the State in the total outlay of the country has
        ranged between five and seven percent. Central government non-departmental undertakings
        also show the share of Uttar Pradesh in these investments ranged between five percent in
        1980/81 and nine percent in 1992/93. The disproportionately low portion of investment
        funds attracted by the State has also been reflected in commercial bank advances and
        disbursenients ot private corporate sector loans.

4.2.2   EIGHTH FIVE YEAR PLAN (1992/93-1996/97)
        The Eighth Plan (1992/93-1996/97) was formulated against the relative performance of the
        State in the preceding Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Plan periods and the need, to maintain good
        rates of overall economic growth in line with the national economy. The Fifth Five Year Plan
        (1974/75-1978/79) marked, for the first time since national planning began in 1951, an
        upward turning point in Uttar Pradesh's historical economic performance, which up to that
        time Iiad been characterised by stagnant agricultural growth.

        Both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors respectively recorded annual growth of 5.7
        percent and 9.4 percent and the economy as a whole, 5.7percent per year. This overall growth
        was matched in the Seventh Five Year Plan (1985/86-2989/90), underpinned by
        manufacturing (11 percent per annum) and the tertiary sector since agricultural growth
        slumped to 2.7 percent per annum. The Eighth Plan therefore envisaged a broad growth
        profile and continued trend with targeted annual overall growth of six percent and sectoral
        growth targets of over four percent per annum for agriculture and ten percent per annuni for
        manufacturing.

        iktuual econon~icperformance however fell significantly below the desired targets with per
        capita growth being marginal. Overall growth was just 2.4 percent per annum over the four
        years to 1996 with agriculture recording annual growth of 1.5 percent and manufacturing 3.3
        percent. Average annual population growth between 1981and 1991 was 2.3 percent. For the
        country as a whole, average annual economic growth was in excess of six percent during the
        Eighth Five Year Plan period.

        The decline in agricultural output was partly due to reduced fertiliser use and limited
        increase in irrigation potential, as well as to adverse climatic conditions. Lower food grain
        productivity in Uttar Pradesh, by comparison with the other two principal food grain
        producing States in India - Punjab and Haryana - is largely due to the relative insufficiency
        in permanent irrigation facilities. Manufacturing industry has been hindered by erratic power
        supplies and shortfalls in electricity generation arid installed capacity to meet required
        demand.

         To some extent, the poor economic performance in the Eighth Plan period has been due to the
         relatively substantial shortfall in expenditure against the Plan's approved outlay, which was
         particularly marked in the agricultural, irrigation and energy sub-sectors. These shortfalls in
         expenditure in turn reflected on the State's inability to mobilise resources from various
         funding sources.


4.2.3     NINTH FIVE YEAR PLAN (1996/97-2001/02)
         The increasing disparity in econo~nicgrowth in Uttar Pradesh and the country as a whole
         during the Eighth Plan period meant that the per capita income gap widened even further by
         some eight-percentage points. In order to break this trend and taking into account the
         structure of the local economy within Uttar Pradesh, the State's Ninth Five Year Plan has
         been formuldted in an attempt to arrest the historical State: Nation disparity in per capita
         income levels.


         Although the agricultural sector is the largest in the Uttar Pradesh economy, both in ternis of
         its contribution to SDP (42 percent in 1996/97) and its share of the labour force (72 percent),
         the fact that there are a relatively large number of marginal land holdings which are
         uneconomic and that a large proportion of the agricultural labour force is estimated to be
         surplus to requirements and grossly underemployed, means that the sectoi has limited scope
         tor raising employment levels. Whilst increased agricultural developnlent nevertheless
         lemalns as one of the Plan's main objectives, within which rural development is to be
         accelerated through greater diversification from low to higher value crops, particular
         emphasis has been placed on the need for more infrastructure development especially in the
         irrigation and power sub-sectors Irrigation and power are crucial to the continued growth
         and development of agriculture and manufacturing, in the former case to enable greater
         exploitation of ground water resources from tube wells, and the latter for industry.


         In order not to increase the disparity in per capita income levels between Uttar Pradesh and
         the country as a whole, the targeted rate of economic growth for the State over the five-year
         period to 2002 has been projected to be the same as that targeted for India, namely seven
         percent per annum. The Ninth Five Year Plan has been prepared against a background in
         which a marked dip in economic performance occurred during the Eighth Plan period
         following relatively good trend growth of, on average, 5.2 percent per annum over a fifteen-
         year time frame between 1974/75 and 1989/905.


         Although the Eighth Plan as a whole saw a sharp decline in average growth, to 2.9 percent
         per annilni, the latter part of the Plan period was characterised by much stronger growth than
         in the first two years it is against this rising growth trend that the Ninth Plan targets have
         been justified. The overall annual growth target of seven percent is underpinned by
         continued high growth in the agricultural sector and especially in the manufacturing sector,
         as follows:


           Primary sector:                    Agriculture                       5.1percent per annurn
           Secondary sector:                  Manufacturing                    12.0percent per annum
           Tert~arysector:                    Other                             6.8percent per anriuni
           All sectors:                                                         7.0percent per annuni


         Whilst the Uttar Pradesh economy will continue to be heavily reliant on the agricultural
         sector in the medium term, the high growth target for the manufacturing sector has reflected
         the need for greater diversification in the economy, in order to fuel higher overall econo~nic
         and per capita income growth as achieved in those States with strong industrial bases.

        In order to achieve the required growth targets set out in the Ninth Plan, the proposed public
        sector funding outlay has focused on those key infrastructure sub-sectors - transport, energy
        and water supply - that are prerequisites for both continued expansion of the primary,
        agricultural sector and inward investment to the secondary, manufacturing sector. Roads,
        power and irrigation in combination account for 43 percent of the planned public sector

4.2.4   THE TENTH PLAN (200Y03-2006107)
        The Ninth Five Year Plan came to an end on 31s' March, 2002. For the Tenth Plan (2002/03-
        2006/07), the State has decided to keep a target of 8%annual for growth. The targeted rates of
        growth, for the main sectors of the economy, of the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07) are as
        follows:


                        Sector                            I--  Annual growthrate      (I%)

        The per-capita income of the State in 2000-2001, at Rs. 9721, is short by 41% of per-capita-
        income of the country, at Rs. 16,487.The growth in the state need to be sufficiently higher in
        the Tenth Plan and in the years to follow, so that the large gaps in the per capita income, do
        not increase still further and, more than that, are phased out or atleast reduced within
        reasonable limits.


        The foremost requirement is of creating and strengthening infrastructure facilities,
        particularly power, road and trarisport, far and wide in the State, so that the flow of private
        investment and growth could become a self- generating process. The State will have to fulfill
        ~ t sforelnost obligation of making investments in critical infra-structures viz., rural
        electrification, the development of irrigation and water management systems, land
        development, state highways, district and rural roads, social sectors such as educational and
        medical public health facilities.


        During the Tenth Plan, a number of measures have been proposed to be taken to promote
        private participation in States industrialization. The table 4.9 and Table 4.10 given below
        gives the sulnniary statement of some key targets of the Tenth Plali and Tenth Plan Outlays
        by Major Heads of Development respectively.

        Whilst priinary and tertiary sector activities are largely evenly distributed throughout Uttar
        Pradesh, the great variation in growth rate estimated for the secondary sector reflects the
        expected impact of the industrial development corridor and growth area initiatives that have
        been identified in the State's industrial policy. Because of the inherent unpredictability in
        medium to longer term forecasting, forecasts of future growth in the economy are usually
        limited to the very short term, covering the next twelve to eighteen month period.


4.4     Census and socio-economic Survey AnaIysis


        Successful implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) depends on appropriate and
        accurate census and socio-economic survey of Project Affected Persons (PAPs). Without
        these, there can be no measurement of precise impacts on the affected persons and therefore it
        becomes difficult to frame appropriate entitlement policies. Also, in the absence of surveys it
        is difficult to measure the achievement or non-achievement of the basic objective of the RAP.
        Two kinds of surveys were taken up in course of the study:


        (1) Census verification survey;
        (2) Census socio-economic survey.


4.5     Objectives of the Census and Socio-economic Surveys


4.5.1   THE OBJECTIVES OFTHE CENSUSVERIFICATIONSURVEYWERE:
            To collect information regarding likely project impacts in order to facilitate designs of
            various components of RAP
            7o set up a cut off date so as to monitor the influx of new people
            To desegregate the properties by type and identification of possible categories of
            entitlement.


4.5.2   THE OBJECTIVES OFTHE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEYWAS:


            To attach actual values to key indicators of the PAPs social and economic status and their
            vulnerability to socio-economic change due to the project.
            To assess use/dependence on common property resource
            To provide a benchmark for any further information needed to monitor and evaluate EPs
            in the future; and
            To provide further inputs in preparation of RAP


        People who are not surveyed during the census will not be considered as PAP, as, the date on
        which the census survey was carried out will act as a cut off date. The cut off date will be
        used to establish whether a person located in the corridor qualifies as a PAP during the
        implementation of the project. However, a person iiot enumerated during the census, but able
        to prove their stay in the project corridor, during the census survey will be considered for

         was clone In 2006 (Started in January 2006 and completed in February 2006) and another
         survey was done in 2007 (Started in March 2007 and completed in April 2007).Second survey
         was done to establish exact number of project affected families and losses after deniarcat~on
         of centreline in the field. Significant level of difference is recorded during the first and second
         census survey in terms of number of PAPS, total losses etc. The dates of second Census
         Survey conducttzd in 2007 would be considered as cut-of date. For titleholders' date of 4(1)
         notif~cationwill be the cut off date.

         As said earlier (section 1.2,table 1.2)primarily agriculture land is getting affected. Apart from
         765 private agriculture plots, 101Government plots will be affected. Majority of the land under
         private occupation have transferable and non-transferable (Saizkuanlaizrya and Asnrzku~~r~~z~zr~jn)

        Analysis of Census and Baseline socio-economicData
        A detailed socio-economic survey was conducted in conjunction with the census of the project-
        affected persons (PAPs)to profile the impacted project area and provide a baseline against which
        mitigation measures and support will be measured. For this purpose, comprehensive
        information related to people's assets, income, socio-cultural and demographic indicators,
        religious struchi~.es,and other sources of support such as common property resources were
        collected. The annlysis has covered the needs and resources of different groups and individuals,
        including intra-household analysis and gender analysis.The analysis is based on the cut off date
        for entitlement assigned in the project (thecut off date for the non title holder is the start date of
        census and for title holders it is the date of legal notification under section 4(1) of LA Act 1894).

        Although, some of the agricultural plots will be adversely affected, PAPs will not be physically
        displaced. For these plots RAP provides assistancesin the form of livelihood restoration, training
        etc.For NTJ1 cal-egorya total of 49 families including 37 vulnerable families will be affected.

       This section of the report mainly deals with the demographic and social characteristics viz., sex
       ratio, family type, ethnic composition, religious groups, literacy and age group classification.
       These indicators later on will help in monitoring the effectiveness of the Rehabilitation Action
       Plan. The demographic and social characteristics are presented in tables 4.17 through 4.18.

        Sex Ratio


        During the census survey, sex of every individual was recorded as it helps in identification of
        family and vulnerable category as per R&R policy. As shown in the table 4.16 above, 1834 of
        the PAPs are made in TH category and 61 males are there in NTH category. The sex ratio of
        TH and NTH PfiPs is 682 and 705 respectively. This is comparatively much lower than state
        average (898).

        Household Type
        The institution of joint family, which has been a characteristic feature of Hindu society from
        ancient times, is breaking down owing to various economic and social factors. Situation is
        somewhat simila~rin the project area where nuclear families were more dominating than any
        other family system.

        Social Stratification
        Hindus in the project area as elsewhere, is based on the traditional four-fold caste syste~iiof
        Blahinin, Kshatriya, Vaishyas and Shudras. The first three categories belong to higher caste
        where as the last category generally belongs to scheduled population. In order to identify
        vulnerable groups, it is important to record the social group affiliation of the PAP. The survey
        results show tha~tGeneral Castes and OBCs are the dominating categories. Since no tribal
        household was found in the area no IPDP is required.

        Distribution of I'APs by Age Group Classification
        As per R&R policy, all males above the age of 18 years, irrespective of marital status will be
        considered as separate family and all women PAPs, above the age of 18but unmarried will be
        considered as separate family. Age group classification also helps in assessing dependent and
        economically ind~ependentpopulation.

              In light of the alsove, PAPs were distributed in 5 age group categories. As the table shows,
               nearly one sixth of the total PAPs fall under the age category of below 14 years (Children).
               Percentage of old and retired PAPs (60 or more than 60 years) is more than 10%.This clearly
               ~ndlc'itesthat avlxage life span of the PAPs in the study area is higher

              Since the definition of child labour restricts the age of child labour at 14years, all those above
               the age of 14 and below the age of 60 has been considered under the category of
               "economically independent group" or "worker's group". As the table above (Table 4.17)
               shows, 73%of the total PAPs are under this category.

4.5.5          RESOURCEBASE OFTHE AFFECTED FAMILIES

              This section of the report deals with the economic status of the Project Affected Persons
               (PAPs). The information presented in table 4.19 (below) has been collected through both
               census as well as sample socio-economic survey. The economic indicators considered during-
               the survey were usual activity, occupational pattern, and average household income. The
               source-wise income and expenditure pattern are presented in Table 4.20 and 4.21
               respectively.

        Usual Activity
        It is important to record usual activity so as to assess whether PAP is gainfully employed or
        not. The activity the PAP is engaged in helps in formulating alternative income generation
        schemes. Such activities may be directly economically gainful or may not be.

        As the table above shows, approximately 42%of the total PAPs (THand NTH) are engaged in
        some or the otl-~erkind of economically gainful activity and hence are in the category of
        workers In rural areas, generally some kind of econoniically gainful activities are always
        dvailablc either 111cultivation or agriculture labour activities. A small percentage of PAPs are
        reportedly nonworkers or unemployed. Hence, such section of PAPs will require special
        attention during implementation phase of RAP.

        Occupational Pattern
        Occupational pattern of the PAPs are recorded to assess their skill so that they can be
        imparted training in the same trade for alternative income generating scheme. Secondly,
        occupational paittern helps in identifying dominating economic activity in the area. As the
        survcy results show, like any other rural area agriculture remains the main occupation.

        Average Annuall HH Income and Expenditure
        Annual income helps in identifying families below poverty line. During the survey income of
        a household through all possible sources was recorded. While calculating the average income,
        certain househollds having unusually high income (figure in lakhs) were omitted from the
        data base as such PAPs, though are having a small property on the project roads, they stay in
        the c~tiesand run other business. Accordingly, the average annual household income, works
        out to Rs. 30823 for TH category and Rs. 21938 for NTH category (Table 4.20). The average
        nn~iualexpenditure is more or less the same as the income. Hence the PAPS do not have
        much savings. Tlhe various sources asked during the survey for calculating household income
        includes agriculture; allied agriculture activities; forestry; agriculture labour; non-agriculture
        labour; household industries; services; trade and business; profession; etc.

        PAPs Below Poverty Line
        Poverty line for the purpose of the project has been considered at annual income of Rs 24,000
        per family. The survey result shows that out of 1567TH families and 49 NTH families getting
        affected, 577 TH and 12 NTH households are below poverty line.

        Household Asset Structure of PAPS
        Any development project brings about a change in the life style and the standard of living of
        the PAPs. Apart from immovable properties such as land and house, it also has an impact on
        movable properties. Any improvement in the economic conditions of the families is usually
        reflected in acquisition of these assets and similarly any adverse economic situation results in
        selling of these assets. The asset structure is an indicator of the economic strength of a
        particular family and its capacity to sustain the impact. The assets recorded during the

        Other Durable Assets
        Utensils and furmiture are the most common household items used by every family across all
        the project corridors. This is mainly because of two reasons viz., apart from being most
        important items, are also the cheapest of all other durable assets used by a family.

        Agriculture Implements
        Small agriculture tools like hoe or sickle is possessed by all the families holding land followed
        by plough (either wooden or iron). Ownership of tractor and thrasher is also less than one
        per family ill the project.


4.5.6   NEED FOR DATA UPDATE AND MECHANISM TO CONDUCT UPDATE
        RAP implementation usually starts within one year after the RAP preparation. I11 case of
        delay, it is suggested that partnering NGOs entrusted with the responsibility of RAP
        implementation along with PWD, should conduct a Core Rapid Appraisal and update the
        database.

        R&R Coordinator from PWD will supervise the entire exercise and this document would
        serve as revised baseline information for the PAPS finally getting affected by the project.
        Ilowever, for lion-title holders the day of census survey (conducted during the preparation
        stage of the project) will remain as cut-off date. The mechanism to conduct update is given in

        Route Alternatives through Strategic Options Study

        A Strateg~cOptions Study (SOS) was commissioned by Uttar Pradesh I'ubl~c Works
        Department in 1996. This study generated a list of 2552 km candidate roads for up-gradation
        and 8000 kni for maintenance. The candidate routes were those satisfying at least one
        criterion out of those listed below:


            Volume to capacity ratio >1
             Volume to capacity ratio >0.8.
            Commercial traffic 70%of fast moving traffic (in PCUs)

        "With" and "Without" Project Scenario

        UP State Road Project I1 (UPSRP11)


        Uttar Pradesh has not been able to develop the road infrastructure at a pace that would allow
        it to compete with other states to become a favourite destination for industry which would
        have enabled rapid development of India's most populous, yet one of the least developed
        states. The 'with' and 'without' project scenarios are analysed with this backdrop of
        requirement of ireliable quality infrastructure for sustained growth of state's economy and
        consequent w7ell being of its citizens.


        With and Without Kamariaghat Bridge Planned on Ghaghara

        The proposal for a bridge at Kamariaghat on Ghaghara was decided by PWD in consultation
        w~tliPCC consu~ltants.The bridge is planned at Kamariaghat on up-gradation routes to be
        implemented in Phase 11. The without bridge scenario will be a bottIeneck and will have no
        utility of the up-gradation route planned in the near by areas. Further, no bridge scenario will
        be a big bottleneck to the motorised traffic and detrimental to the growth in the region. The
        existing bridge on Ghaghara close to Kamariaghat is in the downstream at about 40 km on
        Varanasi-Goraklipur National Highway.


        Basis of selectioln of Location of Proposed Bridge


        The location of the bridge has been planned based on Hydraulic Model Studies conducted for
        the location by the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.
        Based on rnodel studies most suitable location of the bridge has been finalised. The model
        study has also recommended river training and bank protection measures. As per the final
        design, guide bunds have been proposed at the bridge location on both the banks.

        Finalization of .Approaches

        Approaches of IKamariaghat Bridge

        The flood plain of Ghaghara at the proposed bridge location is considerably wide and the
        river flow duriing non-monsoon months remains mostly towards the left side (Gorakhpur
        side). The dry bed of the river is utilised for cultivation by the locals. The planned bridge

        road to the bridge remains smaller on the Shahganj side while a much longer approach road
        is rcclurred on the Gorakhpur side.


        While selecting the bridge approaches the following considerations have been the guiding
        factors:


                 local topography
                 optimum lengths, and

5.0     COMMUNITY F'ARTICIPATION

5.1     Introduction
        Public participation was undertaken to make explicit the social factors that will affect the
        development impacts of planned highway improvements and mediate project results
        Through public participation, stakeholders and key social issues were identified and strategy
        was formulated. It included socio-cultural analysis and design of social strategy, institutional
        analysis and specifically addressed the issue of how poor and vulnerable groups may benefit
        from the project.

        I'articipation is a process, through which stakeholder influence and share control over
        development initiatives and the decisions and the resources, which affects thein. The
        effectiveness of R&R programme is directly related to the degree of continuing involvement
        of those affected by the project. Comprehensive planning is required to assure that local
        government, NC;Os, host population and project staff interacts regularly, frequently and
        purposefully throughout all stages of the project. Participation of persons directly affected by
        projects is a primary requirement in developn~entof R&R, if its programmes are to be suited
        to the needs of the resettled population. Their involvement vastly increases the probability of
        their successful resettlement and rehabilitation.

5.2     Consultation and Participation Mechanisms
        Experience indicates that involuntary resettlement generally gives rise to severe problems for
        the affected population. These problems may be reduced if, as part of a resettlement program,
        people are properly informed and consulted about the project, their situation and
        preferences, and allowred to make meaningful choices. This serves to reduce the insecurity
        and opposition to the project which otherwise are likely to occur.


        The project will therefore ensure that the affected population and other stakeholders are
        inforiiied, consulted, and allowed to participate actively in the development process. This will
        be done throughout the project, both during preparation, implementation, and monitoring of
        project results and impacts.

        During implementation and monitoring stage, information will be disseminated to project
        affected persons and other key stakeholders in appropriate ways. This information will be
        prepared in Hirtdi and local languages as required, describing the main project features
        including the entitlement framework. Consultation will be carried out in ways appropriate
        for cultural, gender-based, and other differences among the stakeholders. Where groups or
        individuals have different views/opinions, particular emphasis will be laid on the views and
        needs of the vulnerable groups.

        Tlie Resettlement Action Plan provides detailed information regarding the consultation
        process. It describes information disclosure at preparation stage. The consultation process
        established during preparation stage of the project uses different types of consultation such as
        in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, seminars and meetings.

                 participation from key stakeholders including local NGOs, academic institutions, government

 y*1*            offic~als,arid others. The purpose of the stakeholder workshop was to present and discuss the
                 framework and approach to social impacts and resettlement, and to achieve agreement about

 *h              implementation mechanisms and coordination among different groups and agencies.


                 The main objectives of the consultation program were to minimise negative impact and to
 r-

                 make people avvare of the project. During the process efforts were made to ascertain the
                 views and preferences of the people. The aims of community consultation were:

        Issues Discussed in State Level Workshop

        The issues discussed in the workshop is summarised below:
        i Themain emphasiswas thatcompensation shouldbeon thebasisof "land for land" and
            for all those losing land. Compensation for other immovable assets should be paid timely
            and on replacement value. The location and type of land is important and should not be
            allotted in fragments.

        7   Physical relocation and resettlement was discussed in length. Participants were of the

            view   that displacement should be avo~dedand in case it is unavoidable, social fabric of
            the persons relocated should be maintained by moving them along with their peer
            groups. Efforts should be made to prevent loss of access to livelihood and PAPs need to
            be fully involved in relocation planning and process right from the project inception
            stage. The time factor in any resettlement is crucial. Participants expressed their concern
            about the failure of various relocation projects and said that resettlement should precede
            deinolishment of structures.
        r   Only local NGOs should be contracted for RAP implementation and should also be
            t ~ a ~ n efor R&R.
                        d
        > PAPs shoulti be informed about both negative and positive impacts of the project and
            their views should be considered. Participants were of the view that unless PAPs are
            taken into confidence, sense of ownership towards the road will not develop aniong them
            and no body will come forward to maintain the roads.
        r Lengthy discTussion took place on the role and utility of Community participation. Quite a
            few participants were of the view that involvement of community creates unnecessary
            problem in the project and hence project gets delayed.            PWD officials primarily
            represented this group. However, another large group strongly supported participation
            of local community in the project. PCC consultants informed the gathering that public
            consultationrj are ongoing process and will continue even during the construction phase
            through NGOs. Project Director requested PWD officials to look into positive aspect of
            community participation and also gave example of Moradabad bypass where land
            accluisition could not take place because of lack of community mobilisation.

5.3.2   DISTRICT LEVEL CONSULTATIONS


        D~str~ctlevel consultations were held during project preparation stage in January 2002. These
        consultations were guideline for the preparation of R&R principles and model for continued
        consultations. District Level consultations were also held to solicit public and PAP inputs in
        project design. These consultations were intended to prepare for district committees that will
        be establ~shedto support RAP implementation. Participants in District level consultations
        included District Magistrate, representatives of district level officials of line departments,
        NGOs, and PAP representatives apart from Project Director and Social arid Environmental
        consultants. Not~cewas published in at least two local newspapers on the day of consultation
        and one day before the consultation was held, for general public to participate.


        The objectives of district level consultations were:


            To expand awareness of the project aniong the public, local government, peoples'
            representatives and non- government organisations in areas impacted by the project
            To identify social and environmental sensitivities and other concerns that should be
            co~isideredduring project design and planning.
            To review potential impacts of the project to date; measure taken to avoid, identified in

5.3.3   LOCAL LEVEL CONSULTATIONS
        L,ocal level consultations were also carried out at the bridge location. The size of group was
        restricted to 10 to 15so that every body gets the chance to express their views on the project.
        Separate group meetings were held for women. Women were consulted to understand thei~
        vies about the project, hardship they face and perceived impact of the project. The objectives
        of local level consultations were to inform the affected persons about the project, R&R policy,
        to incorporate their views in the RAP/design and mitigation measures as suggested by them.

        Methodology
        Consultation team included one Social Scientist specialised in qualitative data collection, a
        women community organiser and one investigator. Data was collected through rural
        appraisal techniques viz., social and resource mapping and group discussions. Meetings were
        organised at Lakhuapakar, Balachak, Baghad, Sultanpur and Jainpur. It was ensured that
        women participated in these meetings. The women community organiser in the team
        separately interacted with the women to record their specific concerns.

        The key findings of the local level consultations are as follows:


            Though participants were aware of the project, they did not know details of the project.
            PAPS were of the view that community should be consulted before the drawings of the
            bridge is finalised. They were informed that team would come back to the village to
            disseminate information regarding finalisation of the design.
            Compensatiol~was the major issue in every discussion. Their fear of low compensation
            was allayed on being informed that one to one negotiation is being proposed in the
            project. Cash compensation is more preferred by the PAPS.
            As regard to employment in the project, permanent job in PWD or with the contractor
            was preferred over temporary job during the project implementation. Majority of PAPS
            engaged in agriculture or as agriculture labour agreed to work as labour with the
            contractor.

5.4     Continuation of Public Consultations
        The effective~iessof the R&R program is directly related to the degree of continuing
        invoivemetit of those affected by the project. Participation of PAPs has been emphasised in
        the developilient of RAP to assure that its components are suited to the needs of the impacted
        and resettled population. Their continued involvement and participation during RAP
        implementation will both increase the probability of their successful resettlement and
        rehabilitation and contribute to the overall project success.


        During the preparation stage, consultations were held at local, district and state level as
        documented above. Several additional rounds of consultations with PAPShave been planned
        in the action plan through partnering NGO during RAP implementation. Consultations
        during RAP implementation will involve agreements on compensation and assistance options
        and entitlements with PAPS and completion of a PAP identity card indicating the accepted
        entitlement package. The other round of consultations will occur when compensation and
        assistance are provided and actual resettlement begins.


            Plan for Continued Participation


            The following set of activities is required for effective implementation of RAP. This will
            also help in timely execution of RAP.

            consultation with PWD.


            Community Participation


            For effective implementation of RAP, it is essential to provide scope of involving
            communities and PAPS in the process. The mechanism of involving communities is
            suggested below :

LAND ACQUISITION AND
   IMPACT ON ASSETS

           6.0     LAND ACQUISITION AND IMPACT ON ASSETS


           6.1     Land Acquisition Estimate
                   A total of 66.3056 hectares of land will be required, out of which 17.302ha is government /
                   panchayat land. The break up is shown below:




                   Land Acquisition and Impact on Farmers
                   Acquisitiori of agriculture land will have negative economic impact on the farmers. The
                   census survey was carried out among the persons affected due to proposed project. Informal
                   discussions were also carried out with the affected persons to gain an insight into the impact
                   L,A will have on farming community.The same has been presented below:

                   Marginal and Small Agriculture plots
                   The survey results show that the average size of holdings of the PAPs is 0.25ha. Since most of
                   the holdings are either marginal or small, loss of land due to guide bund and approaches will
                   certainly bring in further economic hardship on the farming community.

                   Probable change in cropping pattern
                   'The project would acquire about 17.3020 ha. Government land including Gram sabha land
                   and naveen parti would be acquired to construct the bridge approaches and guide bunds. So
                   a change in land use is being envisaged. For this purpose provision are made in the policy
                   document to mitigate the impact. Likewise 49.0036 ha of private land are to be acquired for
                   the construction of bridge. These are mostly agricultural land. Guide bund is being proposed
                   in agriculture land. So there is change in land use pattern and agricultural land would change
                   into non-agricultural use. Consequently, there may be change in land use and cropping
                   pattern After construction of the bridge few Dhabas are likely to come up and they would
                   requ~revegetables and daily items for kitchen. So there will be an increased demand for
                   vegetable cultivation instead of cereal farming in the small left over holdings post acquisition,
                   along the road. There would be temporary loss of income but in long run the project would
                   benefit PAPs. No significant loss of income because of change in cropping pattern or
                   construct~onof bridge is being envisaged.


                   Major Crops Grown in the Area and productivity
                   At the site most of the major Rabi and Kharif crops are grown. Vegetables are also grown but
                   mainly for consumption at household level. The productivity is quite high in the area.


           6.2     Options Preferred by PAPs
                   I3uring the discussion majority of the PAPS opted for cash compensation (Table 6.2). They
                   were of the view that with the compensation amount if provided at replacement value, they
                   will be able to buy new land. About 9%of the households demanded land for land while only
                   4.3% households demanded training for self-employment.

7.0      IMPACT ON WOMEN AND OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS

              L

          families, scheduled families (both caste and tribes), families below poverty line, destitute, old
         aged and orphans. Though no orphan, destitute and old age person was found, significant
         number of scheduled caste, woman headed households and BPL households were found
         during the census survey. Table 7 1gives the distribution of affected vulnerable families.

7.1      Impact on women


         As per UN Human Development Report 2006, India ranks 96 out of 136 countries in the
         gender development index (GDI) that reveals the reality of insufficient level of development
         of women as compared to men in this country. The economic condition of women headed
         households varies considerably depending upon factors such as marital status, social context
         of female leadership and decision making, access to facilities and productive resources,
         income and composition of the household. These conditions form the basis for defining
         indicators to assess the vulnerability of such households.


         While women constitute about 41% the affected population in the project their issues and
         interest are not addressed adequately. Socio econon~icparameters like literacy, work force
         participation rate, general health conditions etc. reveals that social status of women 1s very
         backward in the project area and thereby brought forward the scope of considering the
         households headed by women as vulnerable.


         Women Headed Households
         A total of 43 women headed households (all in TH category) and 1293wonien members (1250
         in TH category and 43 in NTH category) were found in the project area. 1028 women (997in
        TI3 category and 31 in NTH category) in the project area are engaged in the household work.
         Consultation with women reveals that women are not economically empowered.
         Consultation in the project areas evidenced patriarchal society and decision of head of HI3
         prevails. Even in WHH, eldest male member takes decision about most of family affairs.
         During consultation with women it was established that higher education facilities are not
        accessible to most girls student.


         Number of Children per Woman
         In order to understand status of women in terms degree of vulnerability an attempt has been
         macle to assess the number of children per woman on project routes. In this exercise, universe
         includes mothers with child less than or equal to 14 years of age. A total of 438 children (422
         in TH category and 16 in NTH category) below 14 years are found against 811 women (785 in
        TH category and 26 in NTH category) in productive age.

        Women's role in Household Economy
        As can be seen from table 7.2,women participation in economic activities is almost negligible.
        As per 2001 census housework is also considered as an economic activities. The majority, of

        those who are gainfully employed are helping in agriculture related activities (either as
        agriculture labour or in cultivation). As the table shows, nearly 74% of the women are
        engaged   111household work ranging from collecting potable water, cooking and child rearing
        to helping the male members in agriculture field. Traditional values attached to the women's
        movement outside the four walls of the house, among the upper caste, is the main reason
        why less number of women is gainfully engaged.

        Time Disposition
        Following section discusses i~~volvementof women in various activities. The data was
        collected on about 15% of the women population. This section highlights women's
        involvement in various activities throughout the day. Although particulars like child rearing
        are difficult to record as women are of the opinion that there is no fixed time for rearing
        children. In joint family, (majority of families here are joint families) children are taken care of
        by any elder inember of the family and not necessarily the mother. In nuclear families, even
        ileighbours at time take care of children for sometime. In this area among the respondents the
        maximunl time was being spent by the females on household chores like cooking, washing,
        collection of drinking water, cleaning, cattle rearing etc. Those who are engaged in labour
        activities (including service in urban areas) on an average spend 6 to 8 hours every day.
        Wonien those who help family members in cultivation, on an average spent over 5.67 hours
        in a day. The recorded timings for relaxation and entertainment is pretty high because even
        sleeping time of 8 hour are also included in this. Table 7.3 presents average time spent by
        responding women and Table 7.4 gives details on Decision making power among women

        During the group discussion, various issues related to household matter were raised viz.,
        their importance in financial matter, child's education, child's health care, purchase of assets,
        marriages and other functions, etc. As the table 7.4 shows majority of women PAPShave said
        that they do not have any decision making power at household level barring day to day
        nctivlties and social functions.


7.1.1   PARTICIPATIONOFWOMEN IN THE PROJECT
        The GDI value for India is very low and the socio-economic profile of the project area shows
        much lower socio-economic standing for women. It is imperative to bring the issue of
        women's development in the process of socio-economic uplift within the scope of the project.
        For this conscious effort should be made towards integrating the issue in the project.


7.1.2   WOMEN INVOLVEMENT IN DEVELOPMENT PROCESSTHROUGH EMPLOYMENT
        The development experience of at least two decades shows that it is equally necessary to
        consult women and offer them choices in enabling them to make informed choices and decide
        tor their own development.


        Participation of women has been envisaged specifically in the following areas:
            In the pre-planning and planning stages participation from women could be sought
            through allowing them taking part in the consultation process. For this, the local level
            agencies of implementation, i.e. the NGOs have an important role to play.
            Compensation for land lost being same for all the affected families, special care should be
            take11by the NGOs for women group while implementing the process of acquisition and
            compensation as well.
            It is ilnperative that the PWD ensures that the women are consulted and invited to
            participate in group-based activities, to gain access and control over the resource as a part
            of the RAP .
            The NGOs should make sure that women are actually taking part in issuance of identify
            cards, opening accounts in the bank, receiving compensation amounts through cheques
            in their name or not, etc. This will further widen the perspective of participation by the
            mtomenIn the project implementation.
            Under the entitlement framework there is a number of prov~sionskept for con~pensation
            and assistances towards the losses incurred upon the impacted women headed
            households by the project. On the other, some provisions, mostly those of the assistances,
            have been created towards reducing the probable hardship to be experienced by them in
            the process side by side creating scope for their sustainable socio-economic development.
            The assistances to be provided to women as a vulnerable group is creating alternative
            livelihood for them to ensure their sustainable socio-economic upliftment.
            ?he ~mplenientingagencies should provide trainings for upgrading the skill In the
            altetnative l~velihoods and assist throughout t~llthe beneficiaries start up with
            productioi~and business.

             Won~en'sparticipation should be initiated through Self-Help Group formahon in each of
             the villages affected by the project. These groups can then be linked to special
             development schemes of the Government, like DWCRA.The labour force required for the
             construction activities will be mostly of high-skill nature since a lot of machine work will -
             be the~ein the construction of the highway. In addition, there will be requirement of
             unskilled labour where women will certainly contribute. Apart from this, wonieri as
             family ruenlbers of the skilled and semi-skilled labourers, will also stay In the
             construction camps and will be indirectly involved during the construction phase. The
             families of labourer will include their children also.
             For monitoring and evaluation, there should be scope for won~en'sparticipation.
             Monitoring of project inputs concerning benefit to women should involve their
             participation that will make the process more transparent to them.
             Woruen should be encouraged to evaluate the project outputs from their point of view
             a n d their useful suggestions should be noted for taking necessary actions for further
             modifications in the project creating better and congenial situation for increasing
             participation from women. All these done in a participatory way may bring fruit to this
             vulnerable group in an expected way.


7.1.3   SPECIFICPROVISIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION CAMP FOR WOMEN
        The provisions mentioned under this section will specifically help all the women and children
        living in the construction camp.


        Temporary Housing
        During the construction the families of labourers/workers should be provided with
        residential accon~modationsuitable to nuclear families.


        Health Centre
        Health problems of the workers should be taken care of by providing basic health care
        facilities through health centres ten~porarilyset up for the construction camp. The health
        centre should have at least a doctor, nurses, General Duty staff, medicines and minimum
        medical facilities to tackle first-aid requirements or minor accidental cases, linkage with
        nearest higher order hospital to refer patients of major illnesses or critical cases.


        The health centre should have MCW (Mother and Child Welfare) units for treating mothers
        and children in the camp. Apart from this, the health centre should provide with regular
        vaccinations required for children.


        Day Creche Facilities
        It is expected that among the women workers there will be mothers with infants and small
        children. Provision of a day creche may solve the problems of such women who can ledve
        behind their children in such a creche and work for the day in the construction activities. If
        the construction work involves women in its day-night schedules, then the provision of such
        a creche should be made available on a 24-hour basis.


        The creche should be provided with at least a trained ICDS (Integrated Child Development
        Scheme) worker with 'ayahs' to look after the children. The ICDS worker, preferably wromesi,
        may take care of the children in a better way and can manage to provide nutritional food (as
        prescribed in ICDS and provided free of cost by the government) to them. In cases of

        Proper Scheduling Of Construction Works
        Owing to the demand of a fast construction work it is expected that a 24 hours-long work-
        schedule would be in operation. Women, especially the mothers with infants should to be

        exe~iiptedfrom night shifts as far as possible. If unavoidable, creche facilities       In  the
        construction camps must be extended to them in the night shifts too.


        Education Facilities
        'The construction workers are mainly mobile groups of people. They are found to move from
        one place to another taking along their families with them. Thus, there is a need for educating
        their children at the place of their work. For this at least primary schools are required to be
        planned in the construction camps. Wherever feasible, day creche facilities could be extended
        with primary educational facilities.


        Control on Child Labour
        Minors i.e , persons below the age of 14 years should be restricted from getting involved in
        the constructional activities. It will be the responsibility of Environment and Social Cell of
        PWD and NGO to ensure that no child labourer is engaged in the activities (This is one of the
        task in NGO's Terms of Reference). The cell would require cooperation of Colistruction
        Supervision Consultants for effective monitoring for control on child labour.


        Exploitation of young unmarried women is very common in such camps. A strong vigilance
        mechanisni ill ensure ceasing of such exploitation.


        Project LXrector on receipt of complaint from R&R Coordinator or NGO and valid proof may
        take necessary action as per the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986. Apart
        from that Project Director may take following actions:
        1. Penalty
        2. Black listing of the firm


        Special Measures for Controlling STD, AIDS
        Solitary adult males usually dominate the labour force of construction camps. They play a
        significant role in spreading sexually transmitted diseases. In the construction camps as well
        as in the neighbouring areas they are found to indulge in physical relations with different
        wounen. This unhealthy sexual behaviour gives rise to STDs and ADIS.


        While it is difficult to stop such activities, it is wiser to make provisions for means of
        controlling the spread of such diseases. Awareness camps for the target people, both in the
        construction camp and neighbouring villages as well, and supply of condoms at concession
        rate to the male workers may help to large extent in this respect.


7.2     Assistance to Other Vulnerable Groups under R&R Policy
        The II&R policy under paragraph 4 of summary entitlement provides for additional support
        to other vulnerable groups in form of economic rehabilitation grant calculated at one-year
        income level as determined by the Planning Commission of Government of India for Below
        Poverty Line.

        While providing replacement land, emphasis will be to provide larid of equal or more
        productive value. The eligible vulnerable families will have options to choose the locations
        among the available alternatives also.

8.0     INCOME RESTORATION

8.1     Background
        Development project may have an adverse impact on the income of project-affected persons.
        They also have a negative impact on the socio- cultural systems of affected communities. The
        basic postulates of all developmental activities should be that no one is worse of than before
        the ptolect. Restoration of pre-project levels of income is an important part of rehabilitating
        socio-economic arid cultural systems in affected communities.


        To achieve this goal, preparation of IR programmes under Rehabilitation Action Plan sliould
        proceed exactly as it would have for any other economic development programme. IR
        schemes should be designed in consultation with the affected persons and they should
        explicitly approve the programme.


        Due to proposed project, a total of 813households (783in TH and 30 in NTH category) will be
        affected due to loss of agriculture land.


8.2     Income Restoration Measures under R&R Policy
        The R&R policy has the following provisions for income restoration of those whose livelihood
        is getting affected:


            If a person is losing source of income (wage earning- indirectly affected due to the
            employer being displaced), the individual is entitled for grant equivalent to miniilium
            wages calculated for 6 months.
            Those losing commercial establishment and other income generating assets (other than
            agriculture land) are entitled for transitional allowance calculated at minimum wages
            (Rs 2000/- per month) for nine months. Such PAPs are also entitled for rental allowance
            of Rs 500 per month for a maximum period of 6 months apart from a lump sum Rs 1000/-
            towards shifting allowance. Vulnerable PAPs will get commercial plots (maximum up to
            the limit of 25 sq. m) free of cost.
            'I'liose losing income opportunity are eligible for grant calculated at minimum wages
            (Rs 2000/- per month) for a maximum period of six months. They are also entitled for
            training for skill upgradation.
            Vulnerable PAPs are eligible for econon~icrehabilitation grant calculated at minimum
            one year income level as determined by Planning Commission, Government of India.


8.3     Income Restoration Options Preferred by PAPs
        During the discussion majority of the PAPs opted for cash compensation (Table 8.1). They
        were of the view that with the compensation amount if provided at replacement value, they
        will be able to buy new land. Only 9%of the households demanded land for land while only
        4.4% households demanded training for self-employment.

8.4       Inter-Agency Linkages for Income Restoration
          All the eligible families for income restoration earn their livelihood through cultivation
          (primarily small and marginal), and therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the PAPS are
          able to reconstruct their livelihood. The NGOs engaged in the implementation of the RAP
          will ensure that the PAPs are facilitated to obtain plots near their existing habitation to
          minin~isedisruption to their social network and normal work pattern.


          For Income restoration it is important that available skills with the PAPs is identified and
          further upgraded. During verification survey, NGO should specifically ask about the skill
          they posses other than the one related to their current occupation. NGO contracted for
          iniplementatio~ishall also conduct a survey among the PAPS with options of various skills
          related to the resource base of the area and available market (with proper forward and
          backward linkages) and accordingly select trades for training. Based on the training, NGO
          will identify income-generating activities for sustainable economic opportunities. NGOs in
          consultation with the PAPs, R&R Coordinator of PWD, district administration and other
          stakeholders in institutional financing and marketing federations will prepare micro-plans for
          IR activities.


          In case ot ~~pgradingagriculture productivity, the training on technical know-how will be
          alranged as per the choices of the target group population. In case of creation of alternative
          livelihood schemes, felt needs of the target group population will be prioritised through
          people's participation. Further, these options will be tested for their viability against
          availability of skills, resource base of the area and available appropriate technology. Suitable
          alternative livelihood schemes will be chosen finally, where training on skill upgradation,
          capital assistance, and assistance in the form of backward-forward linkages can be provided
          tor making these pursuits sustainable for the beneficiaries or the target groups.


          A comprehensive support system to the PAPS will ensure income security. The project will
          work as a facilitator to the people in the enterprise (but will not act as providers for each and
          every livelihood opportunity). The PAPs are required to participate in developing feasible
          long- term income generating schemes. The long- term options are expected to be developed
          during the implementation of the RAP and also supported by the government assistance.

                      Total income of PAPs from various sources


                  Based on this information IR activities can be planned. IR activities are of two types:
                  (1) Short term; and
                  (2) Long term. The ensuing section describes both IR schemes.

                  Short Term IR activities


                  Short term IR activities means restoring PAPS' income during periods immediately before
                  and after relocation. Such activities wilI focus on the foIIowing:


                      Ensuring that adequate compensation is paid before relocation
                      Providing short term, welfare based grants and aIIowances such as:
                      r    Free or subsidised items

        Long Term IR Activities


        PAP should participate in developing a range of feasible long-term IR options. Long-term
        options are affected by the scale of resettlement which may affect the feasibility of various
        non land based and land based IR options. The long-term options are government financed
        therefore  110separate budget is required. However, in R&R budget provision has been made
        for the expenses to be incurred towards the coordination between project and concerned
        deyarhiients for dove tailing of poverty alleviation schemes. The project officials will
        coordinate with government (district administration), including tribal development and
        social welfare departments, to assure PAPs access to all schemes for improving IR services.
        Project financed programmes should include a specific time frame for handing over the
        project to local administration at the end of a stipulated period. Availability and access to
        existing programmes should be sought for all PAPs.


        Long Term IR activities will be generated once the census surveys and consultation get over
        1R activltles will be generated in consultation with the community. Mechanism to dovetall
        eiistlng governinent poverty alleviation programmes will be developed m consultation with
        the community and officials of district administration and District Rural Development
        Agency (DRDA)


8.5.2   CATEGORIES OF IMPACTS
        Project induced displacement may lead to loss or diminished income for Project Affected
        I'erson (PAPs).PL1limpacts are related to loss of agriculture land.


        The best way to tackle loss of farmland in part or full is to help the concerned PAP to buy
        equivalent farmland in a nearby area using the land compensation received. Land for land
        has been found to be the best sustainable option for Income Restoration. This option can only
        be exercised when a PAP has lost a significant amount of land; it would be impossible and
        inadvisable to replace small strips of land. The compensation received can be deposited in
        blocked bank accounts. The interest accruing will supplement their income from other
        sources. The money can only be reIeased for buying replacement land. It     ISimportant to see
        that the compensation money is not frittered away for consumption expenditure or paying off
        loans especially For the vulnerable sections of PAPs - the more well off can be exempted froin
        th~sprovision and directly paid in cash. The land compensatiori will be pdid at repldcernent
        value and w~llbe sufficient for buying replacement land.


8.6     Alternative Individual Income Restoration Scheme


8.6.1   BASIS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF ALTERNATIVEIR SCHEME
        Keeping in view the resource base of the EPs and also the socio-economic characteristics and
        preferences, PWD and the NGO contracted for the implementation will have to chalk out
        individual IR schemes. Other factors to be considered are:


             Education level of PAPS
             Skill possession
             Likely ecorlomic activities in the post displacement period
             Extent of lard left
             Extent of land purchased
             Suitability of economic activity to supplement the income
             Market potential and marketing facilities

        "The best option is to allow the EP to continue its former occupation". However, during any
        development programme, occupations always change. An exhaustive list of possible IR
        options are given in table 8.3.

        The PAPs will participate in developing a range of feasible long-term Income Restoration
        schemes. These will be developed during the implementation of the project and would be
        financed by project. PWD will work with NGO and liaison with the district administration to
                   . -  ,
        dovetall government's poverty alleviation schemes. The micro plans developed by the
        implementing authority will indicate the type of scheme each family has opted. The grants
        received for econ~omicrehabilitation will be used for purchase of assets. The EPs will receive
        training for acquisition of new skills or upgradation of old skills for the activity selected by
        them.


8.6.2   NON LAND BASED IR SCHEMES
        Since land is scarce and not all PAPs are agriculturists, non-land based and cooperative IR
        schemes becomes all the inore important. The non-land based IR schemes could be:
                       Making of Detergent Powder
                       Detergent soap
                       Cleaning Powder
                       Bath soap

                        Weaving

        Allied Agriculture Activities
        Under allied dgriculture activities, various IR options are available viz., dairy, poultry,
        goatery, sheep rearing, piggery, etc. PAPs who are agriculturist can take up any of these
        options. These will require training, which can be imparted by Khadi Village Industries
        Commission (KVIC) / District Dairy Development Authority (DDDA) and milk route for
        daily milk collection can be extended by local milk federation.


        Petty Traders
        Under this scheme, the available options are grocery shop, vegetable & fruit shop, stationary,
        clothe, tea & snacks, ready-made garments, beetle shop etc. PAPs those who are already in
        the trade and business are suitable for these activities. Implementing NGO will have to
        decide on type of shops to be established as per demand.


        Skill related Schemes
        The options available under this scheme are tailoring, carpentry, masonry, gold smith, black
        smith, motor winding, cycle/motor cycle/auto repair, driving (auto/Matador/etc),
        Television/Tape records/Watch repairing, Pottery, Leather works, etc. PAPs those who are
        in such trades can undergo training for skill upgradation to supplement their annual income.
        District Industries Centre or Khadi Village Industries Board/Commission or Industrial
        Training Institutes imparts training in such trades. Training can also be imparted through
        professional and competent outside agency especially hired for the purpose.


        Others
        Others primarily include loan for various agriculture implements to increase productivity
        viz., pump sets, dug well, bore well, bullock cart, etc. PAPs those who are into agriculture
        and do not have any irrigation facilities can avail such loans. Such loans are given by bank
        after District Rural Development Authority processes the applications.


        The implementation of above-mentioned activities requires organisation of credit camps.
        Extending financial credit support is an important component of non-land based IR schemes.
        It requires organisation of credit camps for EPs. Local government officials, NGOs and PAP
        representatives apart from PWD officials, will attend these camps. The purpose of the camps
        would be to allow local financial institutions to inform participants of credit options and how7
        to avoid procedi~raldelays. All formalities related to processing of applications for credit
        assistance will be completed at these camps.


        For these kinds of camps PWD along with NGO, will have to coordinate closely with the
        Lead Bank managers and other commercial banks operating in the district.


8.7     Training
        One of the strategies for economic sustenance of the PAPs is to help them improve their
        production level or to impart new skills/up grade skills through training. As quite a
        signiticant number of PAPs are dependent on agriculture and others have low skill
        endowment, training becomes an important component of IR. For PAPs who intend to
        diversify their economic activity, suitable income restoration schemes will be identified on
        individual basis and training need would be assessed. Besides training in scheme specific
        skills, general entrepreneurship development will also form part of the training programme,
        mainly to improve the management capabilities of EP.

               The 'I'rnining will be organised in the plan period itself. The NGO contracted for the
               iinplementation of RAP will be assigned this task. Besides, the training are regularly
               conducted by District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) through its programme names
               Training of Rural Youths for Self Employment (TRYSEM),training programmes organised by
               other government agencies will also be availed. The past experiences have shown that
               roughly three-fourth of the PAPs require training. It will be the responsibility of the IJWD to
               ensure that PAPS receives, training in desired trade. The NGO contracted will act as a
               facilitator and training will be imparted either by the government agencies such as DIC,
               KVIC, ITDA, etc. or a professional and competent outside agency. The local Industrial
               Training Institutes (ITIs)can be approached for training.

       8.8     Institutions
               The Institutions for IR schemes include PWD, local government staff, NGO and PAP groups.
               District Level Committee will facilitate with District Rural Development Agency and other
               line departments to give priority to PAPSunder various poverty alleviation schemes.


               The Social Devel'opment and Resettlement Comniittee (ESDRC)should have strong links with
               local government development agencies through coordination committee.


               Coordination Committee: The coordination committee will be formed at project & district
Am-

               level, having representation of PAPs, local government staff, PWD & NGO. The Committee
               will oversee the design of appropriate IR Strategies. The formation of coordinatioi~committee
               should not be influenced by which agency is funding the project.

       8.9     Monitoring of IIt Schemes
               The monitoring of IR schemes will be carried out along with the monitoring of other
               components of RAP by an outside agency contracted for the purpose. The contract will
               specitically provide for regular (every six months) monitoring of income restoration of PAPs.
               The monitoring will be carried out based on economic indicators.


               Vulnerable PAPS who lose their livelihood due to the project will be assisted in alternative
               economic rehabilitation schemes and vocational training for skill upgradation as per the
               requirement of suggested economic scheme. Given below is the detail of selected cooperative

           9.1     Background
                   Institutions for planning and implementation of resettlement programmes are numerous and
ir"



                   vary substantiallly in terms of their respective roles and capacity to successfully carry out

 +%                varlous components. Timely establishment and involvement of appropriate R&R institutions
                   would significarrtly facilitate achievement of the objectives of the R&R Progranime. This
                   document reflects an institutional assessment and provides a strategy for developirig
                   requlred implementation capacity and minimising risks. Capacity buildrng and training are
                   co-ordinated with the project implementation schedule to ensure that skilled staff is available

           9.2     The Process
 Bh
                   PWD will focus effort in three critical areas to commence RAP implementation:
 -
                   (a) To initiate the process, orientation and awareness seminars will be organised for the
                       PWD and other RAP implenienters
                   (b) NGOs with experience in social development and a track record in resettlement and
 .L*l



                       rehabilitation will be partners in RAP implementation.

 r"                (c) To establish Coordination Committee with representatives from local self-government,
                       PAPS and in-~plementingNGO. The objective of this committee is to coordinate between
                       various impl~?n~entingagencies.

                   of RAP implementation are described in sections that follow.
      -
                   Effective RAP implementation will require institutional relationships and responsib~htles,
                   raprd o~ganisationaldevelopment and collaborative efforts by PWD, State Government,

                   engineer who reports to Chief Engineer (World Bank) and is supported by AE (social)and AE
                   (environment). The ESRDC will establish operational links within SRP-I1 and with other
                   agencies of gove~rnmentinvolved in project-induced resettlement. It will bridge the distance
 *Q11

                   between the project and project affected persons aiid communities. It will provide the means
                   aiid mechanisms for co-ordinating the delivery of the compensation and assistance entitled to
                   those who will suffer loss. ESRDC will link the project with state government agencies,
                   p~ovideliaison with SRP-I1 field units and impacted communities, establish district level

                 Among government agencies, the revenue department will have the most important role.
                 lithile the responsibility for land acquisition and payment of compensation for land accluired
                 (including properties there on) lies with the Revenue Department, the ESDRC has to assume
                 responsibility for co-ordinating various matters with the Revenue Department so that both
                 physical possession of land acquired and payment of compensation is not unduly delayed.
                 The responsibility for income restoration and replacement of common property resources
                 would fully be with the ESDRC along with the nodal NGO.


         9.3     Need for NGOICBO
 -.              The relocation disturbs the present activities of PAPSand therefore there is a need to establish
                 and stabilise their economic living. While all tasks relating to Land Acquisition is taken care
                 by the Land Acquisition Officer and his staff, the implementation of RAP is the responsibility
 rUP

                 of the ESDRC under PWD. The NGO will help in implementing various components of the
                 RAP, particularly the use of compensation and rehabilitation assistance for more productive
 nh
                 purposes like purchase of land, self-employment, etc. Its involvement is all the more
                 important since there are no social community organisations among the PAPs which
 -*"(A
                 otherwise could have taken lead in this regard.


                 Being new to the area of working with PAPs, the selected NGO will have to work directly
                 under the ESDRC Co-ordinator who will be defacto in charge for implementation of RAP.
                 Thus implementation becomes joint responsibility of PWD and NGO.

9.4     Role of NGO
        Resettleiiient relates to human aspects and ecor~oniicrehabilitation requires human resources
        development consisting of education, training, awareness generation, etc. In absence of any
        sociologist / anthropologist, NGO will be involved to assist PWD in inipleinentation of RAP.
        'I'he NGO will help educating PAPs on the proper utilisation of compensation and
        rehabilitation grant and help them in getting financial assistance, if required, under various
        subsidy related development programmes. It will also organise training prograninles to
        impart requlred skill for such PAPS who would prefer to go for self-employment schemes
        Specifically, the tasks of the NGO will be to:
             develop rapport with PAPs and between PAPs and PWD
             verification of PAPS
             post design consultations with the community
             assess the level of skills and efficiency in pursuing economic activities, identify needs for
             training and organise programmes either to improve the efficiency and/or to impart new
             skills.
             assist PAP in receiving rehabilitation entitlement due to them
             motivate ancl guide PAP for proper utilisation of benefits under R&R policy provisions;
             facil~tatepurchase of agriculture land in negotiating price and settling at a reasonable
             price or expedite the same through Land Purchase Committee.
             assist PAPs in obtaining benefits from the appropriate development programmes.
             help PAPS in increasing their farm income through provision of irrigation facility        01.

             improving felrm practices,
             ensure marketing of produce particularly those under self-employment activities.
             complete the consultation at the community level and provide support by describing the
             entitlements to the EPs and assisting them in their choices
             accompany and represent the EPs at the Grievance Committee meeting.
             assist the EPs to take advantage of the existing government housing schemes and
             employnient and training schemes that are selected for use during the project, arid
             carry out other responsibilities as required and identified.

        In the context of implementing of RAP, it is important that NGO, which is genuine and
        committed to t111etask entrusted, is selected. An NGO with local presence is, however, more
        suitable hence would be preferred. The NGO may be contracted on specified terms and
        conditions with proper fixation of financial accountability. The payment to NGO will be
        linked to the performance of the task assigned and the tinie period. The payment will be
        arranged on quarterly basis to be released on certification of completing the previous task.
        The monitoring of R&R programme will also include the performance of NGO. The NGO
        services will be required for implementation period for which provisions have been provided
        in the plan.

        Siinultaneously steps can be taken for promoting location specific Commurlity Based
        Organisations (CBOs) of PAPS to handle resettlement planning, implementation and
        monitoring. These groups can be promoted for each adversely affected settlement/villages or
        a group of contagious villages. Until and unless sufficient institutional capacity is built
        a~uongstthe PAPs, so that they can act and react as a group, participatory planning and
        implementation of good re-establishment solutions is nearly impossible.


        Resettlement negotiation, if carried out individually with all displaced families, is both
        uneven and tinie consuming. It favours the good bargainers over the bad bargainers and as
        bargaining capacity is directly related to income levels - favours the more affluent over the
        poorer and more vulnerable sections of the displaced population. This can be minimised by
        organising homogenous groups of displaced persons to handle resettlement negotiations
        together with participatory planning and implementation of re-establishment solutions.

9.5     District Level Colmmittees
        RAP will be impllemented through District Level Committees that will be established ill each
        district where the project is active. These comn~itteeswill provide co-ordinating nodes for
        land acquisition and compensation, relocation and rehabilitation, distribution of project
        provided assistance and PAPS' access to most government programmes. ESDRC will service
        district committees with field staff allocated to multi-district construction contracts.


        District wise RAP implementation parallels corresponding government administrative
        infrastructure and organisation and provides the best basis for co-ordination with both local
        government authorities and field offices of line departments and agencies. The conlmittee
        would meet regularly to review the progress of land acquisition. The committee would also
        decide on the replacement value on the basis of methodology described in RAP.


        The current structure of DLC formed as per GO No. 3262/23 September 2003, PGI/96 TC
        PWD Div. XI1 dated 29/09/2003 will be followed. The DLC members include District
        Magistrate, Chief Development Officer, Executive Engineer -SRP 11, ADM revenue, Local
        Lead Bank Manager, representatives of PAPSand NGO, and Gram Pradhan.

9.6     Training and Capacity Building
        Establishing sufficient implementation capacity to launch and carry out those components of
        project resettlement that must be completed before civil works. To enhance capabilities,
        ESDRC staff can be sent on exposure visits to other projects with good resettleinent
        programmes as well as sponsored for training courses in Resettlement and Rehabilitation
        (R&R).The training would also cover techniques in conducting participatory rural appraisal
        for micro planning, conducting census and socio-economic surveys, dissemination of
        information, conmlunity consultation and progress monitoring and evaluation.


        Training Modules:
        Following training modules will be followed during initial and repeat training sessions of

9.7     Areas of Capacity Building
        PWD needs to build their capacity in the followii~gareas:


        Land Acquisition
        Since only impact of the proposed project is loss of agriculture land, PWD staff needs to be
        trained on process of Land Acquisition. LA generally is a long drawn and demanding
        process. However, PWD will be acquiring land through private negotiation. The existing

        strength of PWD for this purpose is too small. Currently, Project Director is responsible for
        every activity anti arranging for completion of all formalities and procedural requirements for
        1,A w ill also be Project Director's responsibillty. R&R Coordinator of PWD will assist him


        The Project Director, apart from timely acquisition of land is also responsible for number of
        other important components of pre-construction work. Though revenue department of state
        government will do the acquisition, it will require constant follow up. Hence the
        responsibility will come on R&R Coordinator. Among other pressing assignmerits viz.,
        identification and verification of PAFs, Issuing Identity cards, development of resettlement
        sites, etc, R&R Coordinator will also be responsible for regular follow up of land acquisition.


        In light of the above, it would be important to address the following:


            For better co-ordination, the officer responsible for acquisition has to spend sufficient
             time at the site. To enable better follow up the officer should be of sufficiently high rank.


            The procedural requirements have to be formalised and documented for the benefit of all
            projects concerned.


             Ensuring tirliely land acquisition is demanding requirement and requires full time
             involvenlent of an officer, at least during the first six months of the project.

10.0    GRIEVANCE RIEDRESS MECHANISM

10.1    Need for Grievance Redress Mechanism
        Though there is a provision for redress of grievances of PAPs in all aspects relating to Land
        Acquisition (LA) and payment of compensation in Rehabilitation Action Plan. Various
        prov~sionunder LA act enable aggrieved EPs at different stages of LA to represent their cases
        to Land Acquisition Officer or even refer to court for redress and seek higher compensation.
        The most comnlon reason for delay in implementation of projects is grievance of people
        losing land. UPSRP - I has already faced this problem. Considering this, GRC will be formed
        much in advance. It is further suggested that LAO & RRO should hold a meeting at a fixed
        date every month to hear the grievances of EPs. Moreover, Lok Adalats can be held for quick
        disposals of cases.


        However, R&R policy of Government of Uttar Pradesh has a provision of Grievance Redress
        Committee to be headed by District Magistrate of respective districts.

11.0    MONITORING AND EVALUATION


11.1    Introduction
        Monitoring ancl Evaluation (M&E) are critical activities in involuntary resettlement.
        Monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain whether activities are going according to
        the plan. It provildes the feed back necessary for project management to keep the programmes
        on schedule. By contrast, evaluation is essentially a summing up, the end of the project
        assessnient of whether those activities actually achieved their intended alms. As per World
        Banks' OP/BP 4.12 "Monitoring provides both working system for project managers arid a
        channel for the resettles to make known their needs and their reactions to resettlement
        execution".Monitoring exercise will be undertaken both internally and externally. While R&R
        Coordinator of 'PWD on monthly basis will carry out the project's internal monitoring, an
        external agency will be appointed for third party monitoring. External agency will conduct
        monthly and quarterly monitoring and mid term, annual and end term evaluation of the
        project.


        Indicators, which will be monitored during the project, consist of two broad categories:


             Process and output indicators or internal monitoring
             Outcome/ impact indicators or external monitoring


11.2    Process and Output Indicators
        Monitoring of involuntary resettlement operations require in essence, an application of
        general project monitoring procedures and methods to the process accruing in resettlement
        but w~tliparticular attention to the specific high risks intrinsic in such operations.This menris
        monitoring of RcSrR requires certain specialised skills. Therefore a specialised group report~ng
        to tlie PWD must carry out M&E.


        The conventionill monitoring through government machinery often misses focus on certain
        vital aspects, which may otherwise be very important. Therefore R&R Coordinator at
        Luckiiow in close coordination with his counterparts at division level will carry out regular
        ~iionitoringand will produce monthly reports.


        The internal unonitoring is a conventional monitoring of government related to physical
        factors such as, number of families affected, resettled, assistance extended infrastructure
        facilities provided, etc. and other financial aspects, such as compensation paid, grant
        extended, etc. The internal M&E must be simultaneous with the implementation of the
        Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP).

11.2.1 THE OBJECTIVESOFTHE INTERNALMONITORING
        The objectives of'the internal monitoring are:

        *    IIIaily Operations Planning (DOP)
             Management and Implementation (M&I)
             Operational Trouble shooting and Feedback (OTSF)


        The periodicity of internal monitoring could be daily or weekly depending on the issues and
        level.

11.2.2 INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR INTERNAL MONITORING
        For internal monitoring following information will be required:


            Indiviclual filles on each project affected person
            Village Proforma
            Action Plan and Progress reports


11.2.3 MONITORING .ANDREPORTING SYSTEMS
        Crisis arid day to day management and monitoring management will require its own
        improved action plans, regular coordination and onsite training sessions and an Management
        Information System as internal system. It also requires trouble-shooters and infornial
        networks of feedl back from the communities, NGOs, M&E agencies and other government
        bodies.


        Physical monitoring of movement and progress reporting of input stocks, finance and service
        resource in the system to ensure management and financing functions in a timely and
        effective niar1ager.


        Monitoring and verification of the qualifiable progress of the resettlement programme to
        indicate the timeliness of the financial disbursements already agreed to arid deviations from
        the critical path for over all project completion and the required integrated arrangements to
        resettle PAPs.


        EXTERNAL MOIUITORING
        Supervision Consultant will be responsible for meaningful and realistic monitoring of R&R
        programmes on inonthly and quarterly basis. The role of Supervision Consultants will not be
        fault finding but to act as a catalyst in smoothening the process of R&R and thus provide a
        helping hand in the proper implementation of rehabilitation programmes. It should also
        endeavour to briing the problem and difficulties faced by the PAPs to the notice of PWD so as
        to help in formulating corrective measures. However for annual, mid term and end term
        impact evaluation, an external agency will be appointed by PWD. Financial provisions have
        been made to appoint an external agency for M&E. As a feedback to the PWD and other
        concerned, the external agency should submit monthly and quarterly report on progress
        made relating to different aspect of R&R.

11.2.5 THE OBJECTIVESOFTHE EXTERNAL MONITORING
        The objectives of the external monitoring are:
            To track resettled and host population over time in order to document the restoration of
            incomes and standard of living.
            Determine remedial action if required.
            If income and standard of living of the PAPs has at least been restored and has not
            declined.
            In case of host population, whether income and standard of living of host population
            have not declined due to influence of resettlers
            Whether resettlers and host population have re-integrated with each other.


11.2.6  THE INFORMATIONSREQUIREDFOR EXTERNAL MONITORING
        The information required for external monitoring is:
            Baseline survey data
            Sample survey (to be conducted by M&E agency)
            Case studies//Thematicstudies * Issue based research (to be conducted by M&E agency)
            Participatory research (to be carried out by M&E agency)
            Target group monitoring (tobe carried out by M&E agency)

                       1
        changes could occur or where deficiencies in implementation method or style are apparent
        T11e boundaries of this assessment will need the agencies (M&E) to examine the multiplier
        effects and linkages outside of the project definition of affected people and areas.

        The impact evaluation will be carried out after the implementation of RAP is over. This is
        never an easy matter to determine. Financial considerations often require an impact
        evaluation shortly before or after the project concludes. However, project continuous to
        evolve overtime. Therefore it is suggested, that if required, second impact evaluation be
        carried out after three to five years of project conclusion as retrofit survey.

        Impact evaluation will look at all the affected populations; self-relocatee; assisted resettled
        population; host population. Further this larger population will be further broken down into
        vull~erablesegments of each population. Impact evaluation will be carried out on randomly
        selected segment of population.


        'The external agency will submit quarterly report to the PWD.

          Project monitoring will be the responsibility of the R&R Coordinator who will prepare
          monthly progress reports. The reports will compare the progress of the project to targets set
          up at the commencement of the project. The list of impact performance indicators will be
          used to monitor project objectives. The socio-economic survey conducted will provide the

       12.0    IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

       12.1    Background
               Planning, surveying, assessing, policy development, institutional identification, participation,
               income restoration and implementation are typical activities of RAP. While these activities
               have discrete calmponents that can be put on a time line, there is a close inter relationship of
               each activity to the whole. The breakdown of each activity according to a specific time frame
               has been provicled to assist Public Works Department in implementation of RAP at various
               stages.

               It is further cautioned that specific situation may require an increase in time, allotted to a task.
               Such situations includes, but not limited to local opposition; seasonal factors, social and
               economic concerns, training of support staff and financial constraints. Complementation
               Schedule will require detailed coordination between the project authorities and various line
               departments.

               In~plementationplan has been spread over a period of two years for both the locations. A
               simpl~fiedsumrnary of the operational aspects of the implementation plan will be prepared
               when the project starts. It will be given to PWD, who along with a route wise selected NGOs
               will have to put the plan into action.


       12.2    Implementatiort Procedure
               The implementation of the RAP will consist of four major stages:


                    Establishment of replacement value for land.
                    Verification of land of EPs and estimation of their level of losses.
                    Disbursement of compensation and R&R assistances
                    Income Restoration


       32.3    Land Acquisition Process
               Since PWD will lbe acquiring land through private negotiation, the process may take six months

13.0     COSTS AND BUDGET


13.1     Introduction
         The budget is indicative with outlays for the different expenditure categories. The costs used
         for the budget are based on information collected during census and socio-economic surveys,
         revenue department and PWD. The resettlement budget, particularly, the compensation and
         assistance payment components for non-land assets have been computed based on market
         survey. Land value was collected from revenue officials of various categories to arrive at an
         estimate. It is suggested that during land acquisition, an independent committee on
         Replacement value Assessments should assess the cost and accordingly the budget will be
         111odified.


         The total budget has been estimated at Rs. 103.06 million. The basis for budget estimation
         and detailed budget has been provided in ensuing sections.

1      INTRODUCTION

1 . 1  Government of IJttar Pradesh has plans to improve the State road network. The aim
       and the objective are to improveand strengthen the state's road transport network.


1.2    Apart from the positive aspects of the road upgradation, the project may cause loss of
       land, structures, other immobile properties and various sources of livelihood. This
       document describes the principles and approach to be followed in minimizing and
       mitigating negative social and economic impacts caused by projects so that the
       affected are able to restore and improve their standardof living.



2      BROAD PRINCIF'LES

2.1    This policy recognizes that involuntary resettlement dismantles a previous production
       system and a way of life, all such rehabilitation programs will adopt a developmental
       approach rather than the welfare approach. These guidelines details out the
       assistance in re-establishing the homes and livelihoods of the Project Affected People
       (PAP) during the course of projects. The broad principles of the Resettlement and
       Rehabilitation (R&R)policy are as given below:


       a)    All negative impacts including displacement should be avoided or minimised
             wherever feasible by exploring all viable alternative project designs.

       b)    Where negative impacts are unavoidable, efforts should be made either to
             improve the standard of living of the affected persons or at least assist them in
             restoringtheir previous standard of living at no cost to them.
       c)    Ensure people's participation during the course of the project cycle.
       d)    Effort should be made towards the enhancement of the positive impact of the
             projects.

2.2 The project will broadly have three impacts that require mitigation measures. They are:

       a)    Loss of immovable assets viz., land, house, commercial establishments wells,
             ponds, etc
       b)    Loss of livelihood or income opportunities viz., for agriculture labours, helping
             hands in c~ommercialestablishments,etc.
       c)    Impact on the community in terms of loss of common property resources.

       The first two categories represent direct impacts on an identified population. The
       people likely to be affected will be surveyed and registered, and project monitoring
       and evaluationwill compare long-term impactsagainst baseline socio-economydata.

       The third category represents a group impact, where gains and losses of a group -
       oriented nature are not quantifiable in terms of impact on the individual. Mitigation

       and support mechanisms will be collectively oriented, and the monitoring will focus on
       impact on such groups.

2.3    All acquisition of private land would be under the Land Acquisition (Amendment)Act,
       1984,which provides for compensation and solatium for the properties to be acquired.


       a)    Support will be extended under the broad principles of this policy to meet the
             replacement value of the assets and loss of livelihood.
       b)    The policy further recongnises extension of support to non-titleholdersfor the loss
             of livelihood and replacement value for assets other than land.
       c)    The common property resources will be replaced as far as feasible and if not
             then assistance will be provided at replacement value to the group.

2.4    Major widening crnd strengtheningwork planned will take place within the Right of Way
       (ROW)based on land availability, gradient, traffic and congestion of population along
       the road length. Efforts will be made during implementation to minimise any
       disturbance in the daily activities of the local people.

2.5    Before taking possession of the acquired lands and properties, all compensation,
       resettlementancl rehabilitation would be made in accordance with this policy.

2.5    In case of displacement, resettlement sites will be developed as part of the project. In
       such circumstances care should be taken so that there is no / or minimum adverse
       social, economic: and environmental effects of displacement on the host communities
       and specific measures would be provided in the Resettlement and Rehabilitation
       Action Plan (RAP)to mitigate any such impacts.

2.7 Before taking possession of acquired property sufficient time would be provided to
       harvest the crop.

2.8 The implementalion of the R & R Action Planwill be synchronized with the civil works

2.9. The project will ensure that no civil works are initiated before compensation and
       assistance to affected population has been provided in accordance with this policy.

5      BROAD PROCEIDURES

5.1 Basic Approach

       a)    The policy recognizes that along with the positive aspects of infrastructure
             development, there are also negative impacts.


       b)    The policy principle is to provide R&R assistance to both PDPs and PAPs.


       c)    Every effort should be made during project design and preparation to minimise
             acquisitior of land and other assets and to reduce negative socio-economic
             impacts. The structures / assets falling outside the COI and within the ROW would
             be left unclisturbed.

       safety zone. This corridor is referred to as the Corridor of Impact (COI),and comprises
       typically the total construction width, inclusive of drainslembankments, shoulders. The
       COI may have dlifferent extent to the right and left from the road centre line and may
       vary as per the social requirement in order to avoid / minimise adverse impacts.



6.2 Surveys

       For proper rehabilitation of the project affected and displaced persons, social impact
       assessment shall be undertaken.            This will help in assessing the magnitude of
       displacement, losses to be sustained by PDPs and PAPs, better targeting of vulnerable
       groups, ascertai~qingthe cost of R&R, drawing out the rehabilitation package and
       administering the, same.

       The social impact assessment survey will consist of two surveys viz.,


       a)    Census verification of 100 percent of the population.
       b)    BaselineSocio-economic survey covering 25 percent of the affected households.

       affected population within the project impact area, demographic, social and
       economic profile of the PAPS and to prepare strip maps indicating individual,
       community and loublic assets along the road stretches.
