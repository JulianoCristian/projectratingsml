was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the project document should ensure that: (i) project\n            development objectives (PDOs) and monitoring indicators are\n            few, measurable, and objective; and (ii) the project design\n            incorporates a well-designed evaluation system for assessing\n            the baselines and subsequently achievement of project\n            outcomes. The agencies involved must ensure (using needed\n            time and resources) that the necessary preparatory\n            activities are indeed completed fully. Also, the period\n            between the project preparation and beginning of the\n            implementation should be minimized to avoid facing major\n            changes in physical conditions. The Government's\n            sustained ownership is extremely vital to undertake such\n            large projects. This is the second State Roads Project\n            (Kerela State Transport Project) implemented in recent years\n            for which the envisaged scope had to be scaled down and also\n            incurred substantial time, and cost overrun."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
