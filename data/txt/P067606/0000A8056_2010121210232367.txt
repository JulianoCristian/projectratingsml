                         Civil Works: with regards to implementation of civil works, project progress is currently reflected below:
                         o        39 out of 40 rehabilitation contracts (RMC) completed
                         o        6 out of 8 road upgrading contracts completed
                         o        4 bridge contracts on-going
                         In terms of road kms completed or substantially completed (works to final surfacing):
                         o Upgrading contracts: 646 kms completed; 39 kms ongoing. (95% complete)
                         o RMC contracts: 1858 kms completed; 8 kms on-going. (99.5% complete)

                         Of the four bridge contracts, one is unlikely to be completed by project closure. This is due to complexities encountered in thebridge design and the changing flow of the river. IIT
                         Kanpur has reviewed the situation on ground and proposed an additionalbridge as a solution.

                         Eight Human Resource cells have been set up by the PWD, staffing assignments for key positions to these cells have been completed.Though a training program has been
                         approved, funding has not yet been allocated. However there has been substantial progress in thework being done in the Institutional development component, including the GIS
                         mapping of PWD roads and the procuring of amaintenance management system.
