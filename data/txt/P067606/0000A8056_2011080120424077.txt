                         capacity and quality of the core state highway network and major district roads; (ii) enhancing road maintenance planning and execution, and reducing the
                         backlog of deferred periodic maintenance; (iii) reducing accidents; (iv) easing traffic movement at selected inter-state crossings; and (v) strengthening the
                         capacities of the Public Works Department.

                         execution, and reducing the backlog of deferred periodic maintenance; (iii) reducing accidents; (iv) easing traffic movement at selected inter-state crossings; and (v) strengthening the

                         The overall progress of all components of the project has advanced very well. Over 99 percent of the Loan funds have now been effectively committed (completed and committed
                         contracts including expected cost increases). Progress of work are:

                         Upgrading:
                         i. Overall8 road upgrading contracts have been completed
                         ii. 3 bridge contracts are substantially completed, of the remaining three contracts, one will be completed by March 2011 and the other two which are complementary to each other,
                         will be completed a year after loan closure largely due to design changes brought about by complexities encountered in the bridge design and the changing flow of the river. Poor
                         contractor performance has also been partially responsible for delay

                         Rehabilitation:
                         i. Progress on rehabilitation work is 100 percent with 40 contracts covering 1910 km of state roads having been rehabilitated
                         ii. Rehabilitated roads are currently under maintenance plan and the funding allocated to the maintenance of State Roads has increased to about 80% of maintenance needs

                         Institutional strengthening:
                         i. The six Human Resource cells created under the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan are functional.
                         ii. Each cell has been manned with qualified personnel, but not all cells have sufficient staff, which also affects the quality of the output.
                         iii. The provision of adequate personnel, training, equipment and the development of the institutional manuals is crucial to sustain the momentum gained through the creation of these
                         cells.

                         Road safety and traffic operations:
                         i. UPPWD has instituted the practice of road marking on edges and center line and providing cats-eye in all the roads taken up for strengthening and widening.
                         ii. Road safety cell is interacting with the State Road Safety Council to finalize the safety policy using the guidelines provided by the consultants and has recommended a list of item
                         that should form a part of BOQ for each contract to enhance the safety features of a road.
