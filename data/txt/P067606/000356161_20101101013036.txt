SUMMARY
The proposed changes will support the cancellation of an amount of US $28 million from
the Uttar Pradesh State Roads Project (LN 4684-IN). This cancellation was requested by
the Government of India through their letter dated September 9, 2010.


PROJECT STATUS
As of September 15, 2010, out of the IBRD loan of US$488 million about US$430
million (88%) has been disbursed, with US58 million undisbursed. The key project data
is as follows:

               Project Data                            Current Project Performance Ratings
Board Approval:       December 19, 2002     Summary Ratings:
Effectiveness Date:   April 2, 2003         Achievement of Project Development Objectives MS
Loan Closing Date:    December 31, 2010     Implementation Progress                       MS
                                            Risk Flags                                    2
Loan Amount:           US$ 488 million
Amount Disbursed:      US$ 429.81 million




 Over 95 percent of the Loan funds have now been effectively committed (completed and
 committed contracts including expected cost increases). During the course of the
 project, the original scope of works was scaled down to compensate for the reduced
 rupee value of the Loan, higher construction costs due to the need for increased
 pavement strength and rapid cost escalation for some key inputs. Some of the roads were
 also converted into National Highways. The achievement of targets for the revised scope
 of work is as follows. With regards to civil works, 646km out of 682km of upgrading
 works has been completed, and 1902 km out of 2000km of major maintenance works
 has been completed. Four bridge contracts are still underway. Under the Institutional
 Action Plan, the cells created are functional, and have been manned with qualified
 personnel. The Human Resource Development cell and quality management cell have
 appointed a consultant to help them in formulation of the training program for the new
 appointees at the level of assistant and junior engineers, developing quality control
 manual and laboratory facilities. A draft Road Policy for the State has been prepared and
 is being discussed and evaluated by concerned departments.

    · Cancellations
During a previous mission in May 2010, the Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) was
requested to identify possible unutilized funds and to submit a request to the Bank for a
commensurate reduction in the loan amount. GoUP subsequently undertook a detailed
review of final project costs and the estimated Loan funding requirements up to project
closure. On this basis, the GoUP established that an amount of US$28 million would
remain unutilized. The planned revised scope of work has remained mainly the same.
GoUP will be unable to utilize the remaining funds on any additional works due to time
constraints. The task team has reviewed the request for cancellation. The team believes
all project objectives and project components with UP related to UPSRP are likely to be
implemented as anticipated, by the end of project. Following this cancellation and
considering ongoing contracts, all available project funds for UPSRP are committed.
