      The project will bring in connectivity, which in turn will result in evenly spread of
      industrialisation and other economic activities. This in turn will bring in prosperity to the project
      areas.

      for short and long term), access to various amenities, increase in business opportunities, increase
      in avnilability of passenger transport services are some of the other expected benefits.




C'ertc~iiinegative social impacts are inherent with any developmental project. Similarly because of this
project, 361 agricultural Plots would be acquired many of them would be economically unviable.
Such farmers would be compensated as per R&R framework of UPSRP.


LAND REQUIREMENT AND ACQUISITION PROCESS


,l h(> construction of bridge approaches and guide bund will entail land accluisition. A total of
ayproximatelv 50.8937 hectare of land will be acquired. The land will be acquired through private
negc'tiation. 'lhe proposed acquisition will be in two districts and 6 villages.




The overall affect of the proposed bridge approaches has been on agriculture land. A total of 396
fciiiiilieswill be affected, which in turn will affect 927 persons. 548 males and 379 females would be
affected by the proposed bridge. Majority of the PAPs are other backward caste, scheduled castes and
g i ' i ~ r ~ ~ l
            castes. 168 vulnerable households have been identified and they will be supported under the
I<&[< Policy of the project. Among the vulnerable, 21 are women headed households, 50 belong to
scheduled caste category and 97 are below poverty line.Hiriduism has niass following in the project area.


Approxi~iiately339 of the total PAPs are engaged in some economically gainful activity and hence are
in the category of main workers. The survey result shows, agriculture to be the main occupation of
the PAPS. Income from these sources was added up and weighted average was taken to arrive at
avc,rage annual income figure.


l'he household assets recorded during the sample socio-economic survey includes; livestock,
ho~~selioldfurniture, utensils, durables, etc. Sinall agriculture tools like hoe or sickle is possessed by
all tlie families holding land followed by plough (either wooden or iron). Ownership of tractor and
thrasher is also less than one per family in the project.




The Resettlenient and Rehabilitation (R&R)policy prepared by Project CO-coordmatmgConsultants
(I1(    ) tor Uttnr Praclesli Public Works Department (UP PWD) and approved by Governnient of Uttar
Iil,ttlc,si. is based on World Bank's Operational Direct~ves(OD) 4.30' and 4 20' for resettlement of
i~ikoii~ntnr~ly   displaced persons and ind~genouspeople. The action plan has been prepared based on
tlie broad outlines laid down in the policy. The principle of the R&R policy is the guiding philosophy
to provide a development approach to resettle and rehabilitate the people affected by project I11
pal ticular:


      \Yherever possible, displacement will be reduced on or avoided altogether by sensitive design of
      civ~lworks (e.g.alternative designs or modification to the design).

 I'ublic participation was undertaken to make explicit the social factors that will affect the
 cie\;elopnient impacts of planned highway improvellients and mediate project results. Through public
 prticipation, stakeholders and key social issues were identified and strategy was formulated. It
  included socio-cultural analysis and design of social strategy, institutional analysis and specifically
 addrrssed the issue of how poor and vulnerable groups may benefit from the project.


 Consultations were held at local (community) level. The main objectives of the consultation program
 were to minimize negative impact in the project corridors and to make people aware of the project.
 Wom~nwere consulted to understand their work participation rate, perception about the project,
 impact ot construction of the bridge on their daily work etc. During the process eftorts were niade to
 i-t\cc.~tain the vlews nnci preferences of the women.


The aims of com~nunityconsultation were:

  I    To understar-tdvlews of the people affected w.r.tto the impacts of the road

 r     To identify and assess all major economic and sociological characteristics of the village to enable
       effective planning and implementation and,

  r    To resolve the issues relating to affect on community property


 ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES


  l'ht. '~lternativeswere explored for the bridge location and the approaches. The bridge location has
 becn finalised after carrying out hydraulic model study. This study has been conducted by IIT,
 I<anpur. The study recommends optimum bridge length and protection measures. Details of
 alternatives have been discussed in section 4.5.

Itnplementatlon plan has been spread over a period of two years. A simplified summary of the
operational aspects of the implementation plan will be prepared when the project starts. It will be
given to PWD, who along with a route wise selected NGOs will have to put the plan into action.


Ii,AI' Iin5 the p1ovis~onto1 the following niechanlstn/comni~tteesfor proper implementation of action
kjlan


     Grielrance reciress mechanism: The grievance redress mechanism is an important aspect of R&R.
     'The LA Act provides adequate provision at different stages of the LA process for the PAPs to
      object to the proposed acquisition of land and other properties, compensation rates, etc. The LA
      Act allows the affected person to receive compensation under protest and then refer the case to
      the court for settlement. LA will be an integral part of the project. Hence, grievances will be not
     only related to LA but also for entitlement for rehabilitation assistances. TO avoid litigations,
      which may delay the project implementation, RAP has a provision for constituting Grievance
      Redress Committee at district level. The GRC will try to settle grievances at the project level itself.
       1 hc n1c.m bers of the comniittee w,ould be District Magistrate as head, representatives of local NGOs,
      representative of people (viz. Meniber of Parliament, Member of Legislative Assembly, etc),
      represei~tativesof blocks, districts, line departments & affected persons. At central level, Project
      Director of Project Implementation Unit will head the committee.
     Effective RAP implementation will require institutional relationships and responsibilities, rapid
      organisational development and collaborative efforts by PWD, State Government, partner NGO
      and affected population. ESRDC has already been established vide GO              110. 3262/23/12/003-
      'lU,GCI./c)~ dated 29-09-2003.The ESRDC is constituted of one executive engineer who reports
                   TC
      to Chief Engineer (World Bank) and is supported by AE (social) and AE (environment). l'he
      ESKDC will establish operational links within SRP-I1 and with other agencies of government
      involved in project-induced resettlement. It will bridge the distance between the project and
     project affected persons and communities. It will provide the ineans and rnechanisnis for co-
     ordinating the delivery of the compensation and assistance entitled to those who will suffer loss.
     ESRDC will link the project with state governn~entagencies, provide liaison with SRP-I1 field
      units and impacted communities, establish district level committees to co-ordinate social
      development and resettleinellt operations in the field and also to assist NGO partners It ill also
     engage required training services, oversee a grievance redress process and actively monitor RAP
      in~plenientation.On behalf of PWD, tlie ESDRC will assume the responsibility for representing
      t  i social impdct anci resettlement components of tlie project for environment clearance. l'lic~
            ~
     1,:SI)RC ill also be responsible for disseminati~~gthis information to the public and providing
     additional opportunities for public comment.


Need for NGO/CBO
The relocation disturbs the present activities of PAPs and therefore there is a need to establish and
stabilise their economic living. While all tasks relating to land acquisition is taken care by the Land
Acquisition Officer and his staff, the implementation of RAP is the responsibility of the SDRC under
I'n'D. 7'he NGO will help in implen~entingvarious components of the RAP, particularly tlie use of
coml- isati at ion ancl rehabilitation assistance for more productive purposes like purcllase of laiid, self-
employment, etc. Its involvement is all the more important since there are no social community
organisdtions among the PAPs which otherwise could have taken lead in this regard.


Being riew to the area of working with PAPs, the selected NGO will have to work directly under the
SDRC -coordinator who will be defacto in charge for implementation of RAP. Thus iniplen~entation
becomes jolnt responsibility of PWD and NGO.

Role of NGO
IZesettlement relates to human aspects and economic rehabilitation requires human resources
development consisting of education, training, awareness generation, etc. NGO will be i~ivolvedto assist
PWII in iniplementation of RAP. The NGO will help educating PAPs on the proper utilisation of
compensation and rehabilitation grant and help them in getting financial assistance, if required, undel.
various subsidy related developmerit programmes. It will also organise training programmes to impart
required skill tcx such PAPS who would prefer to go for self-employment schemes. Specifically, the tasks
of thtl N(;O ill be to:


       Ilevelop rapport with PAPs and between PAPs and I'WD
b Assess the level of skills and efficiency in pursuing econoniic activities, identify needs for training
       arid organise programmes either to improve the efficiency and/or to impart new skills.
i-     Assist PAP in receiving rehabilitation entitlement due to them
b Motivate and guide PAP for proper utilisation of benefits under R&R policy provisions;

In tlie context of implementing of RAP, it is important that NGO, which is genuine and coliimitted to
the task entrusted, is selected. An NGO with local presence is, however, more suitable hence would
bc t3referred. The NGO may be contracted on specified ternis and conditions with proper fixation of
financial accountability. The payment to NGO will be linked to the performance of the task assigned
and tlie time period. The payment will be arranged on quarterly basis to be released on certification of
completing the previous task. The monitoring of R&R programme will also include the performance
ot NC;O. The NGO services will be required for tzoo !/cars for which provisions have been earmarked
in the plan

District Level Committees
RAP will be implemented through District Level Committees that will be established in each district
whtw the project is active. These committees will provide co-coordinating nodes for land acquisitioli
and compensation, relocation and rehabilitation, distribution of project provided assistance and
Pill's' access to most government programmes. SDRC will service district conlmittees with field staff
allocated to multi-district construction contracts.

          T'hr Uttar Pradesh State Road Project I1 aims to improve road networh of State througll uy-
          graclation and major maintenance of state roads. The state roads selected in the project
         comprise of Ordinary District Roads (ODRs), Major District Iioads (MDRs) and State
         Highways (SI-Is).


          In addct~onto ~mprovenientof load network, five brldges have been planned on nlajol rlvers
          ot %t,itc>Out of these two have been planned on Ghaghara rtvel and one on Sharada rlvel that

          one at Kainaria Ghat (Refer Figure 1).


          The present volume covers social assessment and Resettlement Planning of Chahlari Ghat
          bridge on Ghaghara river. The proposed bridge and its approaches on Ghaghara bridge at
          C'hahlnrr Ghat would be four laned. The bridge locations have been decided based on
          hyd~aulccmodel study conducted by IIT Kanpurl. The bridge at Chahlaii Ghat wlll be 840 m
          long w ~ t hdpproach lengths of 620 m towards Bahraich and 4340 ni towards Sitapur side To
          train the          river    the length of guide bund on Sitapur side is 1485n1long while on Bahraich side

1.2       Social Impact Assessment


          Social Ii-iipactAssessment of proposed intervention of the project is an iniportant component
          of project preparation. GO1 arid GOUP regulations and World Bank policy require social
          impact assessment during the design stage to avoid, reduce or mitigate potent~alnegative
          ~mpactsof project action and enhance pos~tiveimpacts, sustainab~l~tyand development
          benef~ts.


          The assess~ileutsalso contribute to the preparation of social management action plans,
          governing project implementation and the resettlement and rehabilitation of those who may
          be d~spincedby the proposed bridge

        Preparation of the RAP has been undertaken within the project's social nssessment
        component. A key pre-requisite of the RAP is a policy framework for resettlement containing
        categories of impacts and tlieir corresponding erititlements. The RAP provides detailed
        guidance on how to implement provisio~~sin the policy framework, including institutional
        arrangements and budgets based on enumeration of project-affected people with entitlements
        under the framework. The RAP is also an important compo~ientof the project's overall
        Iinvironmental Manageii~entAction Plan developed in the environmental assessment.

        These elemetits have been further elaborated in the follom7ing paragraphs.


2.2     Social Assessment Process
        The conlplete R&II process included integration of environnier~tand soc~alinputs. The IiQR
        team included Social Scientists, Civil Engineers, Field Supervisors, Comrnui~ityOrganisers
        and field investigators doing the census verification, socio-economic surveys and public
        consultations.


2.3     Consultation Methodology
        The objectives of the consultation were to disseminate information about the project to tlie
        potentially affected population in order to incorporate their views and suggestion for
        preparing the RAP. Seconcl objective was later on adcled, as one of the objectives of State
        Roacis 13rojc.ctis also to alleviate poverty in the districts through which the road is passing
        through. Keeping in view, the complexity of consultation, local level consultations were
        carried out during census survey. However, during the preparation of RAP for upgradation
        route in 2001-2002, both district as well as state level discussions was taken up.


        Local Level Consultation
        lYolnen Community Organisers led by a Qualitative Data Expert consulted wlth the
        potentially affected population in-groups. Care was taken to ensure that each group is not
        large1 than 15persons. Before in~tiatingthe Group Discussion, rapport building cxerclse mras
        carr~edout with the villagers.

        'l'he objective of district level consultations was to create awareness about the project among
        tlie people, district administration, and officials of line departments and NGOs working in
        the district and particularly along the project road. These consultations were held in Sitapur,
        Kaharaicli. During the consultation R&R policy as approved by State Government was also
        discussett. Suggestions on design were invited from the participants and it has been
        inior1.~1r~1tedin the design reports.


        State Level Consultation
        State Level Stakeholder Workshop was held in Luchnow on February 11, 2002, to appraise
        various stakeholders about the project, its components and R&R policy.

         3.4.1.l Sale Statistics Method
                     Land being an inimovable property, all its sales and purchases have to be registered. The
                     registered sale prices can be taken as adequate indicator of market value of a given piece of
                     land. S'ile prices of those lands, which are comparable in time and quality, are only to be
                     consiclercd. Fc11Ic)wing steps are involved in calculating conipensation according to sales
                     statistics method.
                     Step 1:         Collect statistics of sales of land/buildings adjacent to ones being acquired in
                                     three to four years precedi~ig4(1) notification from Registration Department.
                     Step 2:         Workout average of 3 to 4 years per acre/hectare.
                     Step 3:         Average Price (AP) + 0.3 A P + O . ~ ~perPannum from the date of 3(1) notification
                                                                                      A
                                     to date of award to arrive at compensation.
                     Step 4:         Add damages, if any or incidental, if any.
                     Step 5:         Calculate interest from date of award at 9% for first 12 nlontlls and 15%for the
                                     period thereafter.


                     Capitalisation Method
                     Where reliable information is not available about the prevailing market value of the land,
                     capitalisation method is used to decide compelisation. Following steps are involved in
                     cdlculatil~gconipensation according to capitalisation method.
                     Step 1:         Gross Income - Cost=Net Income
                     Step 2:         Net Income x Multiplier" = Market Value
                     Step 3:         Market Value (MV) +30% of MV as solatium + 12% of MV per annuin as
                                     Additional Market Value ==Compensation

        'The statc of Uttar Pradesh is characterized by a relatively large number of small villages with
         half of the Statt.'s population living in villages of less than 2,000 inhabitants in 1981. When

         percent of the State-wide population is accounted for. As is the trend it1 developing countries
        worldwide, the extent of urbanization is rising. This is evidenced by the increase to 42 (in
        1991)of the number of urban areas in Uttar Pradesh having a population in excess of 100,000
         people. Urban growth has registered 3.3percent per annum over the period 1981-1991 whilst
         the annual growth rate in the rural population was 2.1 percent. The urban to rural split
        increased from a ratio of 18:82 to 20:80 during the corresponding ten years The major urban
        areas with a population agglomeration in excess of one million people (as of 1991) were the

         Regional Variations


         As mentioned in the Five Year Plans,, the State of Uttar Pradesh is broken down into four
         eco~iomicregions, these being the Western, Central, Eastern and Bundelkhand regions,
         Purely in terms of demography, the Eastern region is relatively disadvantaged in comparison
         to the other regions in that both higher population densities and decennial population growth
         rates have served to place greater pressures on agricultural productivity and output. The
         relative poverty of the eastern region is further evidenced by the published data on various
         socio-ecoiioniic i~~dicators,infrastructure facilities arid per capita output. A summary of the
         data across the four regions relative to the value for Uttar Pradesh, is presented below for
         cotnparative purposes, in Table 4.3.

              pl;t~n\Ia~gelycilomrnate the State The Ga~iget~cp1a111she largely between 100n1 and 3OOm

                        e
              bolder w ~ t hNepal, const~tuteswhat                IS known as the Terai, an area of marshland that was
              once unflt for human habitation.


              The width of this Terai belt has diminished considerably since the 1950s due to intensive
              measures taken on both sides of the Uttar Pradesh/ Nepalese border to eradicate malaria and
              recover the land for agriculture. Outside of the Terai, the high fertility of the plains permits a
              two-crop cycle in both the winter and rainy seasons. The southernmost hills and plateau have
              scarce rainfall and high temperatures.


              There are two major riverine systems in Uttar Pradesh. Although both the Ganga and
              Yamuna rivers originate in the Himalayan glaciers, their respective flows are deterni~nedby
              the Himalayas in the north and by the southern hills and plateau. The Himalayan Rivers are
              full almost all the year round and fill gradually with water from the melting snowfall in the
              summer, whereas the southern rivers dry up in the summer and are therefore more prone to
              rapid Flooding         ill the rainy season.


              'l'herr are three main clinlatic seasons in Uttar Pradesh, the winter months from October to
              February, the summer months from March to June and the monsoon period between June
              and September in which most rainfall takes place. Uttar Pradesh is largely temperate in
              climate with temperatures ranging between 12 and 17degrees Celsius in the winter period in
             J a ~ ~ u aand exceeding the 40 degree Celsius mark in the summer months of May and June.
                          r y
              The summer months, prior to the onset of the monsoon rains, are also characterised by hot
              winds blowing from the west. Average annual rainfall in most of the State is 990 mm.


4.1.3         LAND USE
              1,and use in Uttar Pradesh is predoiliinantly agriculture based. The breakdown of land
              utilisation in the State is shown in Table 3.4. The Remote Sensing Centre witl~inthe
              Department of Science and Technology has carried out limited aerial photograph~csurveys of
              selected urban areas such as Varanasi, but recent land use mapping for the State as a whole is
              not yet available. The most recent map based published information relating to land use is
              that contained in a detailed Planning Atlas of Uttar Pradesh6, which was published in 1987
              and largely refers to the position prevailing in the State between 1981<lnd1984.

4.1.4      ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE
           Under the Constitution of India, Uttar Pradesh has a Gover~iorand a bicameral legislature or
           two Houses of Assembly, a Vidhan Parishad and a Vidhan Sabha, largely based                            011  the British
           Westminster system. There is the Council of Ministers that is collectively responsible to the
            Vicilian Parishad, this Council being presided over by a Chief Minister who is appointed by
           tlie Governor. The Vidhan Sabha comprises 403 members. The maximum tern1 of the Vidhan
           I'atisliad is five years after which elections must be held. The main business of this elected
           chamber is to enact legislation and grant funds for State Government expenditure. Budget
           estimates are put to the vote of Assembly members. The business of the House is assisted by a
            number of legislative, financial and other committees. A State Government Secretariat, based
           in the State capital Lucknow, assists and advises the Council of Ministers. This Secretariat,
           headed by a Chief Secretary and a hierarchy of Principal and other Secretaries, functions as
           the executive authority of the State Government through its various departments. Below the
           Secretariat and lleads of Department levels, the Divisional Commissioner is responsible, at
           divisional le\.el, for law and order, administration, revenue collection and other matters. Each
           clivisio~~comprises a number of districts in which a district officer, either the District
           Magistrate ctr the Deputy Commissioner, is responsible for all administrative affairs in the
           district. There are 70 districts in Uttar Pradesh aggregated into 19 acirninistrative divisions.
           For administrative purposes, districts are further disaggregated down into tehsils, blocks and
           villages.


4.2        MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW

4.2.1      State Domestic Product
           Uttar Pradesh, although the State supporting the highest share of the country's population, at
           approximately 16.4 percent, has consistently lagged behind national perforri~ancein key
           economic areas. On the basis of per capita State Domestic Product (SDP) growth rates7, with
           occasional exceptions in the 1970s and the early 1990s, Uttar Pradesh has under-performed
           the all India series. The declining share of State Domestic Product compared to the National
           Domestic Product has been reflected in the State's Five Year Development Plan objectives of
           stemming this decline and endeavouring to keep pace with national projections of economic
           growth. Historical data on SDP is shown in Table 3.4 and the sectoral breakdown, on the
           basis of industrial classification, is shown in Table 4.5 for 1996/97 and provisionally
           estimated for 1997/98.

            Within the primary and secondary sectors of the economy, the major contributors are
            understandably agriculture and manufacturing respectively, whereas in the tertiary sector,
            the coritr~butionto SDP is more diluted, the key performer being trade and commerce. Table
            4.6 shows the year on year change for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors in the four-

        relativelj~poor economic performalice vis-a-vis other major States and the continued reliance
        on agriculture to support much of its population. The agricultural sector accounts for nearly
        three quarters of the work force and the share of workers in industry was nine percent
        ,iccording to the Census records.




        In investment terms, Uttar Pradesh has, relative to its size with regard to beiiig the most
        populous State in India, historically suffered from receiving a disproportionately lower share
        of both public and private sector funding. In the public sector domain, this is ill terms of both
        previous Five Year Plan outlays, the share of the State in the total outlay of the country has
        ranged between five and seven percent. Central government non-departmental undertakings
        also s1io.c~the share of Uttar Pradesh in these investments ranged between five percent in
        1C)X0/81 and nine percent in 1992/9:3. The disproportionately low portion of investment
        funds attracted by the State has also been reflected in commercial bank advances and
        disbursernerits of private corporate sector loans.

4.2.2   EIGHTH FIVE YEAR PLAN (1992/93-1996197)
        The Eighth Plan (1992/93-1996/97) was formulated against the relative performance of the
        State in the preceding Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Plan periods and the need, to maintain good
        rates of overall economic growth in line with the national economy. The Fifth Five Year Plan
        (1974/75-1978/:79) marked, for the first tinie since national planning bega~iin 1951, all
        u p ~ . a r dturning point in Uttar Pradesh's historical economic performance, which up to that
        tinie had been characterised by stagnant agricultural growth.

        Both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors respectively recorded annual growth of 5.7
        percent and 9.4 percent and the economy as a whole, 5.7 percent per year This overall growth
        was matched in the Seventh Five Year Plan (1985/86-1989/90), underpinned                      by
        manufacturing (11 percent per annum) and the tertiary sector since agricultural growth
        slumped to 2 7 percent per annum. The Eighth Plan therefore envisaged a broad growth
        p ~ o t ~and continued trend with targeted annual overall growth of six percent and sectoral
                  l e
        growth targets of over foul percent per annuni for agriculture and ten percent per annum f o ~
        manufactul Ing

        Actual econo~liicperformance however fell significantly below the desired targets with per
        capita growth being marginal. Overall growth was just 2.4 percent per annum over the four
        years to 1996 with agriculture recording annual growtli of 1.5percent and manufacturing 3.3
        percent. Average annual population growth between 1981 and 1991 was 2.3 percent. For the
        country as a whole, average annual economic growtli was in excess of six percent during the
        Eighth Five Year Plan period.

        'l'he decline in agricultural output was partly due to reduced fertiliser use and liniited
        increase in irrigation potential, as well as to adverse climatic conditions. Lower food grain
        productivity in Uttar Pradesh, by comparison with the other two principal food grain
        producing States in India - Punjab and Haryana - is largely due to the relative insufficiency
        in permanent irrigation facilities. Man~~facturingindustry has been hiiidered by erratic power
        supplies and shortfalls in electricity generation and installed capacity to meet required
        demand.

        '1'0 some extent, the poor economic perforinance in the Eighth Plan period has been due to the
        relatively substantial shortfall in expenditure against the Plan's approved outlay, which was
        particularly marked in the agricultural, irrigation and energy sub-sectors. These shortfalls in
        expenditure in turn reflected on the State's inability to mobilise resources from various
        funding sources.


4.2.3    NINTH FIVE YEAR PLAN (1996197-2001/02)
        The increasing disparity in economic growth in Uttar Pradesh and the country as a whole
        d u lng the E~ghthPlan period meant that the per capita income gap widened even further by
             ~
        some e~ght-pe~c-entagepo~nts In order to break this trend and taking into account the
        structure of the local economy within Uttar Pradesh, the State's Ninth F~veYear Plan has
        been formulatetl in an attempt to arrest the historical State: Nation disparity in per capita
        inconie levels.


        Although the agricultural sector is the largest in the Uttar Pradesh economy, both in terms of
        its contribution to SDP (42 percent in 1996/97) and its share of the labour force (72 percent),
        the fact that there are a relatively large number of marginal land holdings which are
        uneconomic and that a large proportion of the agricultural labour force is estimated to be
        surplus to requirements and grossly undereniployed, llieans that the sector has limited scope
        for raising employment levels. Whilst increased agricultural development nevertheless
        remains as one of the Plan's main objectives, within which rural development is to be
        accelerated through greater diversification from low to higher value crops, particular
        emphasis has been placed on the need for more infrastructure developu~ientespecially in the
        irrigation and power sub-sectors Irrigation and power are crucial to the continued growth
        and cievelopment of agriculture and manufacturing, in the former case to enable greater
        exploitation of ground water resources from tube wells, and the latter for industry.


        111 o~cie~not to increase the dispar~tyin per capita income levels between Uttar P~adeshand
        thc country as a whole, the targeted rate of economic growth for the State over the five-year
        per~odto 2002 has been projected to be the same as that targeted for India, namely seven
        percent per anllum. The Ninth Five Year Plan has been prepared against a backg~oundin
        which a marked dip in economic performance occurred during the Eighth Plan period
        tollowlng relatively good trend growth of, on average, 5.2 percent per annuni over a fifteen-
        yea1 time frame between 1974/75 and 1989/905


        Although the b,rghtli Plan as a whole saw a sharp decl~nein average growth, to 2.9 percent
        per ai~iuni,the latter part of the Plan period was characterised by much stronger growth than

        in  the flrst two years it is against this rising growth trend that the Ninth Plan targets have
        been justified. The overall annual growth target of seven percent is underpinned by
        continued high growth in the agricultural sector and especially in the manufactu~~ng to^,sec
        as follo~~s:


                                          Agriculture                           5.1percent per annuni
                                          Manufacturing                        12.0 percent per annuni
        .
                                          Other                                 6.8 percent per annum
                                                                                7.0 percent per annum


        Whilst the Uttar Pradesh economy ill continue to be heavily reliant on the agricultural
        sector in the medium term, the high growth target for the manufacturing sector has reflected
        the need for greater diversification in the economy, in order to fuel higher overall economic
        and per capita income growth as achieved in those States with strong industrial bases.

         The N ~ n t hFive Year Plan came to an end on 315t March, 2002. For the Tenth Plan (2002/03-
         2006/07), the State lias decided to keep a target of 8%annual for growth. The targeted rates of

         The per-capita Income of the State in 2000-2001, at Rs. 9721, is short by 41% of per-capita-
         income of the country, at Rs. 16,487. 'The growth in the state need to be sufficiently higher in
         the Tenth Plan and in the years to follow, so that the large gaps in the per capita income, do
         not illcrease still further and, more than that, are phased out or atleast reduced within
         reasonable limits.


         The foremost requirement is of creating and strengthening infrastructure facilities,
         particularly power, road and transport, far and wide in the State, so that the flow of private
         invest~iientand growth could become a self- generating process. The State will have to fulfil1
         its foremost obligation of niaking investments in critical infra-structures viz., rural
         electrification, the development of irrigation and water management systems, land
         development, state highways, district and rural roads, social sectors such as educational and
         medical public health facilities.


         During the Tenth Plan, a number of measures have been proposed to be taken to promote
         private participation in States industrialization. The table 4.8 and Table 4.9 given below gives
         the summary statement of some key targets of the Tenth Plan and Tenth Plan Outlays by

4.4     Census and socio-economic Survey Analysis


        Suicesstul in~plenlentationof Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) depends on appropriate and
        accuratc census and socio-economic survey of Project Affected Persons (PAPs). Without
        these, there can be no measurement of precise impacts on the affected persons and therefore it
        becomes difficult to frame appropriate entitlement policies. Also, in the absence of surveys it
        is ctifficult to measure the achievement or non-achievement of the basic objective of the RAP.
        Two kinds of surveys were taken up in course of the study:


        (1) Census verification survey;
        (2) Census socio-economic survey.


4.5     Objectives of the Census and Socio-economic Surveys


4.5.1   THE OBJECTIVESOF THE CENSUS VERIFICATION SURVEYWERE:
             To collect information regarding likely project impacts in order to facilitate designs of
             various components of RAP
             To set up a cut off date so as to monitor the influx of new people
             10 desegregate the properties by type and identification of possible categories of
             cnt~tlement


4.5.2   THE OBJECTIVES OFTHE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEYWAS:


             To attach actual values to key indicators of the PAPs social and economic status and their
             vulnerability to socio-economic change due to the project.
             To assess use/dependence on common property resource
             To provide a benchmark for any further information needed to monitor and evaluate EPs
             In the futu~e;and
             To provide further inputs in preparation of RAP


        People who are not surveyed during the census w~illnot be considered as PAP, as, the date on
        whicli the census survey was carried out will act as a cut off date. The cut off clate will be
        used to establish whether a person located in the corridor qualifies as a PAP during the
        ~mplen~entationof the project. However, a person not enumerated during the census, but able
        to prove their stay in the project corridor, during the census survey will be considered for
                                                                    -

        \vas done in 2006 (Started in January 2006 and completed in February 2006) and another
        sul.vcv \\.as done in 2007 (Started and completed in March 2007). Second survey was done to

        in the field. Significant level of difference is recorded during the first and secot~dcensus
        survey in terms of number of PAPs, total losses etc. The dates of second Census Survey
        conducted in 2007 would be considered as cut-of date. For titleholders'                date of 4(1)
        notification will be the cut off date.


4.5.3   CATEGORIESOF PROPERTIES AFFECTED

        As said earlier (section 1.2, table 1.2)primarily agriculture land is getting affected. Apart honl
        365 private agriculture plots, 17 Government plots will be affected. Majority of the land under
        private occupation have transferable and non-transferable (S~arzkmnrai~i!/oai~iiAsizilkra/i~~~/li!lil)
        patta. 'These titles are based on present occupant of land certified from Tahsil. These pattas are
        subject to change over time. However land records have not been updated in last 10 years.
        Approximately 50.8937 hectare of land will be acquired. These lands would be acquired froni

         Sex Ratio

         1 1 ~ 1 1
               ing the census survey, sex of every individual was recorded as it helps in identification of
         t~~~iitly vulnerable category as per R&R policy. As shown in the table 4.16 above, 548 of
                   ancl
         the PAl's are male. The sex ratio of PAPS (692) is comparatively much lower than state
         average (898).

         Household Type
         The institution of joint family, which has been a characteristic feature of Hindu society from
         'incient times, is breaking down owing to various economic and social factors. Situation is
         some~vhatsimilar in the project area where nuclear families were more dominating than any
         other farnily system.


         Religious Groups
         Data on religious groups were collected in order to identify religious minorities among the
         PAPS. As the tabIe (Table 4.17) above shows, only two faiths are professed in the study area
         vi7., I Iinduism and Islam. Hinduism is the dominant of two.


         Social Stratification
         Hindus in the project area as elsewhere, is based on the traditional four-fold caste system of
         Rrali~nin,Kshatriya, Vaishyas and Shudras. The first three categories belong to higher caste
         cvhere as the last category generally belongs to scheduled population. I11 order to identify
         vulnerable groups, it is important to record the social group affiliation of the PAP. The survey
         results show that General Castes and OBCs are the dominating categories. Since no tribal
         household was found in the area no IPDP is required.

         Distribution of PAPs by Age Group Classification
         As per R&R policy, all males above the age of 18 years, ~rrespectiveof marital status w1l1be
         considerc.cl as separate fanuly and all women PAPs, above the age of 18but uilnial rled will be
         cons~derecias separate family. Age group classification also helps in assessing dependent and
         econoln~callyindependent population.


         In light of the above, PAPS were distributed in 5 age group categories. As the table shows,
         nearly one fourth of the total PAPS fall under the age category of below 14 years (Children).
         Percentage of old and retired PAPs (60 or more than 60 years) is more than 10%.This clearly
         indicates that average life span of the PAPSin the study area is higher.


         Since the definition of child labour restricts the age of child labour at 14 years, all those above
         tliv ~igcof 11 and below the age of 60 has been considered under the category of
         "economicnlly tndependent group" or "worker's group". As the table above (Table 4 16)
         shows, 67% of the total PAPs are under this category

        Usual Activity
        It is important to record usual activity so as to assess whether PAP is gainfully employed or
        not. The activity the PAP is engaged in helps in formulating alternative iricome generation
        ~clienlesSuch act~vitiesmay be directly economically gainful or may not be.

        As the table above shows, approximately 36 percent of the total PAPs are engaged in sonic or
        the other kind of economically gainful activity ancl hence are in the category of workers. In
        rural areas, generally some kind of economically gainful activities are always available either
        in cultivation or non-agriculture labour activities run under various government poverty
        alleviation schemes. Still a small percentage of PAPs are reportedly non-workers               01.

        ~~neniployed.Hence, such section of PAPs will require special attention during
        implementation phase of RAP.

        Occupational Pattern
        C)ccupational pattern of the PAPs are recorded to assess their skill so that they can be
        imparted training in the same trade for alternative income generating scheme. Secondly,
        occupational pattern helps in identifying dominating economic activity in the area. As thtl
        survey results show, like any other rural area agriculture remailis the main occupation.

        Average Annual HH Income and Expenditure
        Annual income helps in identifying families below poverty line. During the survey income of
        a household through all possible sources was recorded. While calculating the average inconie,
        ~.tl~.tainhouseholds having unusually high income (figure in lakhs) were otllittcd from the
        data base as such PAPs, though are having a small property on the project roads, they stay in
        the cities ancl run other business. Accordingly, the average annual household income, as the
        table above indicates works out to Rs. 31478. The average annual expenditure is more or less
        the same as the income. Hence the PAPS do not have much savings. The various sources
        asked during the survey for calculating household income includes agriculture; allied
        agriculture activities; forestry; agriculture Iabour; non-agriculture labour; householci
        industries; services; trade and business; profession; etc. Income from these sources was
        added up dnd weighted average was taken to arrive at average annual income figure.

        PAPs Below Poverty Line
        Poverty line for the purpose of the project has been considered at annual inconie of Rs 24,000
        per family. The survey result shows that out of 213 households getting affected 109are below
        poverty line, which is approximately 51% of the total affected households.

        Household Asset Structure of PAPS
        Any development project brings about a change in the life style and the standard of living of
        the PAPs. Apart from ininiovable properties such as land and house, it also has an impact on
        movable properties. Any improvement in the economic conditions of the families is usually
                  .
                       ~




        rcflccted in acquisition of these assets and similarly any adverse ecorio~~iicsituation results in
        selling of these assets. The asset structure is an indicator of the economic strength of a
        particular family and its capacity to sustain the impact. The assets recorded during the
        sample socio-economic survey includes; livestock, household furniture, utensils, durables,
        etc.

        Agriculture Implements
        Small agriculture tools like hoe or sickle is possessed by all the families holding land followed
        by plough (either wooden or iron). Ownership of tractor and thrasher is also less than one
        pc1 tCiniilyin the project.


        Livestock Ownership
        Tlie average number of cattle heads owned by a family in the project area is 9.63. Similarly
        average number of poultry birds owned by a family is 17. Ownership of goats/sheep/pigs is
        about 9 in the project corridors.


4.5.6   NEED FOR DATA UPDATE AND MECHANISM TO CONDUCT UPDATE
        1V.I' implementation usually starts within one year after the RAP preparation. In case ot
        delay, it    IS suggested that partnering NGOs entrusted with the responsibll~tyof RAP
        ~~nplenie~itationalong with PWD, should conduct a Core Rapid Appraisal and update the
        data base.


        li&R Coordinator from PWD will supervise the ent~reexercise and th~sdocument ~voilld
        serve as revised baseline information for the PAPS finaIly getting affected by the project
        Ilowever, for non-title holders the day of census survey (conducted during the preparation
        stage of the project) will remain as cut-off date. Tlie mechanism to conduct update is given In

                    implemented in Phase 11. The without bridge scenario will be a bottleneck and will have no
                    utility of the up-gradation route planned in the near by areas. Further, no bridge scenario will
                    be a big bottleneck to the motorised traffic and detrimental to the growth in the region.

        The flood plain of Ghaghara at the proposed bridge location is considerably wide and the

        The dry bed of the river is utilised for cultivation by the locals. For river crossirig during the
        dry season, locals use the dry riverbed on Sitapur side and the pedestrian path that is located
        nlostly on the wasteland/ Government land on the Bahraich side. The planned bridge proper
        is confined between the two guide bunds towards Bahraich side. Thus, the approach road to
        the bridge remains smaller on the Bahraich side while a much longer approach road is
        required on the Sitapur side.


        The entire approach    011 the Sitapur side falls in the flood plain. The land is utilised by the
        locals for cultivation during tlie non-monsoon period. A straight alignment of the approach
        Iias been considered on this side of the river, as it would minimise private land acquisitioli for
        this purpose.


        On Bahraich side, two options were considered (i) foI1owing the existing pedestrian path
        used by the locals (ii) a new alignment through the private agricultural fields. The first opt~on
        was preferred, as the existing pedestrian path that passes mostly through waste land/

5.0     COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

5.1     Introduction
        IJublic participation was undertaken to make explicit the social factors that will affect the
        cievclopment i~ripactsof planned highway improvements and mediate project results.
        'I'hrougli public participation, stakeholders and key social issues were identified and strategy
        bvas formulated. It included socio-cultural analysis and design of social strategy, institutional
        analysis and spt~cificallyaddressed the issue of how poor and vulnerable groups may benefit
        from the project.


        Participation is a process, through which stakeholder influence arid share control over
        development initiatives and the decisions and the resources, which affects them. 'I'he
        effectiveness of R&R programme is directly related to the degree of continuing involvement
        of tlioscl affected by tlie project. Comprehensive planning is required to assure that local
        government, NGOs, host population and project staff interacts regularly, frequently and
        purposefully throughout all stages of the project. Participation of persons directly affected by
        projects is a primary requirement in developnient of R&R, if its programmes are to be suited
        to the needs of the resettled population. Their involvement vastly increases the probability of
        their successful resettlement and rehabilitation.


5.2     Consultation and Participation Mechanisms
        1:xperience indicates that involuntary resettlement generally gives rise to severe problems for
        ilic <~ff~rtedpopulation. These problen~smay be reduced if, as part of a resettlement program,
        people are properly informed and co~isulted about the project, their situation and
        preterences, ant1 allowed to make slleaningful choices. This serves to reduce the insecurity
        and opposition to the project which otherwise are likely to occur.


        'The project will therefore ensure that the affected population and other stakeholders are
        informed, consulted, and allowed to participate actively in the development process. This will
        be clone throughout the project, both cluring preparation, implementation, and monitoring of
        project resu Its and impacts.


        During implementation and monitoring stage, information will be disseminated to project
        affected persons and other key stakeholders in appropriate ways. This information wiIl be
        prepared in Hindi and local languages as required, describing the main project features
        including tlie entitlement framework. Consultation will be carried out in ways appropriate
        for cult~~ral,gender-based, and other differences aniong the stakeholders. Where groups or
        il~dividualshave different views/opinions, particular emphasis will be laid on the views and
        necds of the vulnerable groups.


         Flit. Kesettlenier~tAction Plan provides detailed information regarding the consultat~on
        process. It describes information disclosure at preparation stage. The consultation process
        established during preparation stage of the project uses different types of consultation such as
        in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, seminars and meetings
        The consultation program included, the following:


              Heads of households likely to be impacted;
              Houseliolcl members;
              Clusters of 13APs;

        As part of the preparation for the project, state level workshop was conducted with
        participation fro111key stakeholders including local NGOs, academic institutions, government
        offic~als,and others. The purpose of the stakeholder workshop was to present and discuss the
        tramcwork and approach to soc~alimpacts and resettlement, and to achieve agreement about
        lniylementation nlechanisms and coordination among different groups and agencies.


        The main objectives of the consultation program were to n~inimisenegative impact ancl to
        make people aware of the project. During the process efforts were made to ascertain the
        views and preferences of the people. The aims of community consultation were:


            To understand views of the people affected             W r t to the ~mpactsof the project
            To ident~fyand assess all major economic and sociological character~st~csof the v~llageto

5.3.-!  STATE LEVEL CONSULTATION


        An essential feature of the assess~nentprocess is consultation with locdl experts and
        stakeholders particularly those who w~illbe most directly affected. Considering this a state
        level workshop was held in Lucknow on             l l t l lof February 2002. The participants included
        social and environmental scientists from research sector, non-government organisations,
        PWD representatives and PAPSfrom various project routes. The Workshop was divided into
        three sessions. Session I was generic introduction of the project, session I1 was presentation of
        social and environmental issues and session I11 was open discussion on social and
        environmental issues, where findings of the group discussions were sumniarised. The
        purpose, of the workshop was to yrorriote public awareness and understanding of proposed
        project actions arid to notify stakeholders and others of opportunities to participate in
        consultations and the assessment process.


        Planning for the workshop included contacts with numerous social and environmental NGOs
        arid other project stakeholders to encourage participation. I11 order to make PAPS and NGOs
        to participate, open invitation was given through newspapers (one in Ilindi local and one in
        Fnglisli) for two consecutive days. Care was taken to ensure that newspaper selected have
        the ~ . i d e scirculation in Uttar Pradesh. Nearly 150 people attended the state level workshop.
                       t


        At the State Level, consultation process also included consultation with representatives of key
        project stakeholders and in-depth discussion with PWD / PWD representatives, agencies
        concerned with highway safety and health conditions and NGOs working on highway
        associated diseases.

        Issues Discussed in State Level Workshop


        'The issurs discussed in tlie workshop ns sum~narisedbelow:
            The ~nainemphasis was that compensation should be on the basis of "land for larid" and
            for all those losing land. Compensation for other immovable assets should be paid timely
            and on replacement value. The location and type of land is important and should not be
            allotted in fragments.
        r   Physical relocation and resettlement was discussed in length. Participants were of the
            view that displacement should be avoided and in case it is unavoidable, social fabric of
            tlie persons relocated should be maintained bp moving them along with their peel.
            g r o ~ ~ pEfforts should be made to prevent loss of access to livelihood and PAPS need to
                       s .
            bc Fully involved in relocation plannir~gand process right from the project inception
            stage. The time factor in any resettlement is crucial. Participants expressed their concern
            about the failure of various relocation projects and said that resettlement should precede
            demolishment of structures.

        I   Only local NGOs should be contracted for RAP implementation and should also be
            trained for R&R.
        r PAPs should be informed about both negative and positive impacts of the project and

            their views should be considered. Participants were of the view that unless PAPs are
            taken into confidence, sense of ownership towards the road will not develop among them
            and no body will come forward to maintain the roads.

        I   I.engthy discussion took place on the role arid utility of Community participation. Quite a
            few participants were of the view that involvement of community creates unnecessary
            problem in the project and hence project gets delayed.             PWD officials primarily
            represented this group. However, another large group strongly supported participation
            of local community in the project. PCC consultants informed the gathering that public
            consultatiolls are ongoing process and will continue even during the construction phase
            through NGOs. Project Director requested PWD officials to look into positive aspect of
            community participation ancl also gave example of Moradabad bypass where land
            accluisition could not take place because of lack of community mobilisation.


5.3.2   DISTRICT LEVEL CONSULTATIONS


        District level consultations were held during project preparation stage in January 2002. 'These
        corisultations w7ereguideline for the preparation of R&R principles and model for continued
        consultations. Ilistrict Level consultations were also held to solicit public and PAP i n p ~ ~in

        project design..These consultations were intended to prepare for district committees that will
        be established to support RAP implementation. Participants in District level consultations
        included District Magistrate, representatives of district level officials of line departments,
        NGOs, and PAP representatives apart from Project Director and Social and Environmental
        consultants. Notice was published in at least two local newspapers on the day of consultation
        arid one day before the consultation was heId, for general public to participate.

5.3.3   LOCAL LEVEL CONSULTATIONS
        1,ocal level consultations were also carried out at the bridge location. The size of group was
        restricted to 10 to 15 so that every body gets the chance to express their views on the project.
        Separate group meetings were held for women. Women were consulted to understand their
        vies about the project, hardship they face and perceived impact of the project. Defecation in
        open agricultural fields is a common practise among the villagers. One of tlie concern
        e ~ p r e s ~ ebyd the participants was related to security and privacy during construction period.
        Other issues were related to safety of their children and livestock in post construction period,
        social severance, etc. The objectives of local level consultations were to inform the affected
        persons about the project, R&R policy, to incorporate their views in the RAP/design and
        nlitigation measures as suggested by them.


        Methodology
        Consultation tea111included one Social Scientist specialised in qualitative data collection,     '1

        Lvomen community organiser and one investigator. Data was collected through rural
        appraisal techniques viz., social and resource mapping and group discussions. Meetings were
        organisecl at Sisiya chirmani village, a flood affected village and at Husainpur, Golok Kondar,
        Baharpur and Kamhour. It was ensured that women participated in these meetings. The
        women corl~munityorganiser in the team separately interacted with the women to record
        their specific concerns.


        Issues raised and Key findings of the local level consultations
        Following issues were mail1concern of the people
             Permanent Governmentjob in case of displacement
             Conipensation at replacement value
             Proper Drainage
             Concentric widening


        'The key findings of the local level consultations are as follows:


             Though participants were aware of'the project, they did not know details of the project.
             PAPs were of the view that community should be consulted before the drawings of the
             bridge is finalised. They were informed that team would collie back to the village to
             disseminate information regarding finalisation of the design.
             Compensation was the major issue in every discussion. Their fear of low compensation
             was allayed on being informed that one to one negotiation is being proposed in the
             project. Cash compensation is more preferred by the PAPs.
             As regard to employment in the project, permanent job in PWD or with the contractor
             was preferred over temporary job during the project inlplementation. Majority of PAPS
             engaged in agriculture or as agriculture labour agreed to work as labour with the
             contractor.


5.4     Continuation of Public Consultations
         The effectiveness of the R&R program is directly related to tlie degree of cont~nutng
        ~nvolvementof those affected by the project. Participation of PAPs has been emphasised In
        the development of RAP to assure that its components are suited to the needs of the impacted
        and resettled population. Tlieir continued involvement and participation during RAP
        implementation will both increase the probability of their successful resettlement aiid
        rehabilitation and contribute to the overall project success.

6.0                LAND ACQUISITION AND IMPACT ON ASSETS


6.1                Land Acquisition Estimate
                   A total of 50.8937hectares of land w7ill be required, out of which 3.4187 ha is government /
                   pancllayat land. The break up is shown below:

                   Land Acquisition and Impact on Farmers
                   Acquisition of agriculture land will have negative economic impact on the farmers. 'Tht)
                   census survey was carried out among the persons affected due to proposed project. Informal
                   discussions were also carried out with the affected persons to gain an insight into the inipact
                   l,A will have on farming community The same has been presented below:


                   Marginal and Small Agriculture plots
                   Thc survey results show that the average size of holdings of the PAPs is 0.55ha. Since most of
                   the holdings are either marginal or small, loss of land due to guide bund and approaches will
                   certainly bring in further economic hardship on the farming community.

                   Probable change in cropping pattern
                   The project would acquire about 3.42 ha. Government land including Gauchar land, Gran1
                   sabha land and naveen parti would be acquired to construct the bridge approaches. So a
                   change in land use is being envisaged. For this purpose provision are made in the policy
                   doci~mentto mitigate the impact. Likewise 47.45 ha of private land are to be acquired for the
                   coustsuction of bridge. These are mostly agricultural land. Guide bund is being proposed in
                   agriculture land. So there is change in land use pattern and agricultural land would change
                   into non-agricultural use. Consequently, there may be change in land use and cropping
                   pattern. After construction of the bridge few Dhabas are likely to come up ancl they would
                   require vegetables and daily items for kitchen. So there will be an increased demand for
                   vegetable cultivation instead of cereal farming in the small left over holdings post acquisition,
                   along the road. Because of advancement of communication, mango-processing unit may
                   come u p along the project corridor. There would be temporary loss of income but in long run
                   the project ~ . o u l dbenefit PAPs. No significant loss of income because of change in cropping
                   pattern or construction of bridge is being envisaged.


                   Major Crops Grown in the Area and productivity
                   As the table 6.2 below shows that most of the major Rabi and Kharif crops are grown In both
                   the project sites. Vegetables are also grown but mainly for consumption at household level.
                   4 s the table indicates, productivity is quite high in the area.

6.2     Options Preferred by PAPS
        1l)uring the discussion majority of the PAPS opted for cash compensation (Table 6.3). The!.
        were of the view that with the conipe~~sationamount if provided at replacement value, they
        will be able to buy new land. Only about 6%of the households demanded land for land while
        only 4% Iiouseholds demanded training for self-employment.

7.0     IMPACT ON WOMEN AND OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS


        The vulnerable section of the society for the purpose of the project includes, wonian headed
        families, scheduled families (both caste and tribes), families below poverty line, destitute, old
        aged and orphans. Though no orphan, destitute and old age person was found, significant
        number of scliecluled caste, woman headed households and BPL households were found
        during the census survey. Table 7.1gives the distribution of affected vulnerable families.

7.1     Impact on women


        As per UN Human Development Report 2006, India ranks 96 out of 136 countries in the
        gender development index (GDI) that reveals the reality of insufficient level of development
        of women as compared to men in this country. The economic condition of woilien headed
        households varies considerably depending upon factors such as marital status, social context
        of female leadership and decision making, access to facilities and productive resources,
        iticome ancl composition of the household. These conditions form the basis for defining
        indicators to assess the vulnerability of such households.


        While women constitute about 40% the affected population in the project thei~issues and
        interest are not addressed adequately. Socio econoniic parameters like liteiacy, ~ o r forcek
        participation rate, general health conditions etc. reveals that social status of wonien is very
        backward in the project area and thereby brought forward the scope of considering the
        Iiou~eholdsheaded by women as vulnerable.


        Women Headed Households
        A total of 21 woiiien headed liouseliolds and 379 women members were found in the project
        area. 282 women in the project area are engaged in the household work. Consultation with
        wonien reveals that women are not economically empowered. Consultation in the project
        areas evidenced patriarchal society and decision of head of HH prevails. Even in WI-IH,
        eldest male member takes decision about most of family affairs. During consultation with
        wromen it was established that higher education facilities are not accessible to most girls
        student.


        Number of Children per Woman
        In orcler to understand status of wonien in terms degree of vulnerability ail attempt has beer1
        made to assess the number of children per wonian on project routes. In this exercise, universe
        includes mothers with child less than or equal to 14 years of age. A total of 225 children
        below 13years are found against 213 women in productive age.


        Women's role in Household Economy
        12s can he seen from table 7.2, woiiien participation in economic activities is almost negligible.

        i"i pei 2001 census housework is also considered as an economic activities. The majority, ot
        those ~ ' 1 1 0are gainfully employed are helping In agriculture related activities (either as
        agriculture labour or in cultivation). As the table shows, nearly 74% of the women arc.

            their importance in financial matter, child's education, child's health care, purchase of assets,
            iiialriages and other functions, etc. As the table 7.4 shows iliajority of women PAPShave said
            that they do not have any decision making power at household level barring day to day
            activities and social functions.


7.1.1       PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN THE PROJECT
            Thi, (;D1 l~aluefor India is verv low and the socio-economic profile of the project area shows

             I I I L I C ~lower socio-economic standing for women. It is imperative to bring the issue of
            n,ornen's developmerit in the process of socio-economic uplift within the scope of the project.
            For this conscious effort should be made towards integrating the issue in the project.


7.1.2       WOMEN INVOLVEMENT IN DEVELOPMENT PROCESSTHROUGH EMPLOYMENT
            The development experience of at least two decades shows that it is equally necessary to
            consult wTolnenand offer them choices in enabling them to make informed choices and decide
             for their own development.


            I'articipation of women has been envisaged specifically in the following areas:
                      In the pre-planning and planning stages participation from women could be sought
                      through allowing them taking part in the consultation process. For this, the local level
                      agencies of implementation, i.e. the NGOs have an important role to play.
                      Compensation for land lost being same for all the affected families, special care should be
                      taken by the NGOs for women group while implementing the process of acquisition and
                      compensation as well.
                      It is imperative that the PWD ensures that the women are consulted and invited to
                      participate in group-based activities, to gain access and control over the resource as a part
                      of the IiAP .
                      The NGOs should make sure that women are actually taking part in issuance of identify
                      cards, opening accounts in the bank, receiving compensation amounts through cheques
                      in their name or not, etc. This will further widen the perspective of participation by the
                      women in the project implementation.
                      Under the entitlement framework there is a number of provisions kept for cornpensation
                      arid assistances towards the losses incurred upon the impacted women headed
                      households by the project. On the other, some provisions, mostly those of the assistarlces,
                      have been created towards reducing the probable hardship to be experienced by them in
                      the process side by side creating scope for their sustainable socio-economic development.
                      The assistances to be provided to women as a vulnerable group is creating alternative
                      livelil~oodfor them to ensure their sustainable socio-economic upliftnient.

             The implementing agencies should provide trainings for upgrading the skill in the
             alternative livelihoods and assist throughout till the beneficiaries start up with
             pro~i~~ctionand business.

        0    Women's participation should be initiated through Self-Help Group formation in each of
             the villages affected by the project. These groups can then be linked to special
             development schemes of the Government, like DWCRA. The labour force required for thc
             construction activities will be mostly of high-skill nature since a lot of machine work lvill
             be there in the construction of the highway. In addition, there will be requirement of
             unskillecl labour where women will certainly contribute. Apart from this, women as
             family members of the skilled and semi-skilled labourers, will also stay in the
             construction camps and will be indirectly involved during the construction phase. Thc
             families of labourer will include their children also.
             For monitoring and evaluation, there should be scope for women's participation.
             hlonitoring of project inputs concerning benefit to women should irivolve their
             participation that will make the process more transparent to them.
             Women should be encouraged to evaluate the project outputs from their point of view
             and their useful suggestions should be noted for taking necessary actions for further
             modifications in the project creating better and congenial situation for increasing
             pdrticipation from women. All these done in a participatory way may bring fruit to this
             vulnerable group in an expected way.


7.1.3   SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN THE CONSTRUCTION CAMP FOR WOMEN
        The provisions mentioned under this section will specifically help all the women and children
        living in the construction camp.


        Temporary Housing
        During the construction the families of labourers/workers should be provided with
        residei-ttialaccommodation suitable to nuclear families.


        Health Centre
        I-lealtli problems of the workers should be taken care of by providing basic health care
        facilities through health centres temporarily set up for the construction camp The health
        centre should have at least a doctor, nurses, General Duty staff, medicines and mii-timum
        medical facilities to tackle first-aid requirements or minor accidental cases, linkage with
        nearest higher order hospital to refer patients of major illnesses or critical cases.


        Thc health centre should have MCW (Mother and Child Welfare) units for treating mothers
        and children in the camp. Apart from this, the health centre should provide with regular
        vnccinations required for children


        Day Creche Facilities
        It is expected that among the women workers there will be mothers with infants and small
        children Provision of a day creche may solve the problems of such women who can leave
        behind their children in such a creche and work for the day in the construction activ~t~es.     If
        the construction work involves women       IIIits day-night schedules, then the provision of such
        n c~Pcheshoulcl be made available on a 24-hour basis.


        The crPche should be provided with at least a trained ICDS (Integrated Child Development
        Scheme) worker with 'ayahs' to look after the children. The ICDS worker, preferably women,
        may take care of the children in a better way and can manage to provide nutritional food (as
        prescribed in ICDS and provided free of cost by the government) to them. In cases of
        emergency she, being trained, can tackle the health problems of the children and can     01gar-tise
        treatment linking the nearest health centre.

        Proper Scheduling Of Construction Works
        Owing to the demand of a fast construction work it is expected that a 24 hours-long work-
        schedule would be in operation. Women, especially the mothers with infants should to be
        exempted from night shifts as far as possible. If unavoidable, creche facilities in the
        construction camps must be extended to them in tlie night shifts too.


        Education Facilities
        'l'he construction workers are mainly mobile groups of people. They are fourid to move from
        one place to another taking along their families with them. Thus, there is a need for educating
        their children at the place of their work. For this at least primary schools are required to be
        planned in the construction camps. Wherever feasible, day creche facilities could be extended
        with primary educational facilities.


        Control on Child Labour
        Minors i.e., persons below the age of 14 years should be restricted from getting involved in
        the constructional activities. It will be the responsibility of Enviro~imentand Social Cell of
        l'M'1) and NGO to ensure that no child labourer is engaged in the activities (This is one of thc
        tcisk in NGO's 'Terms of Reference). The cell would require cooperation of Construction
        Supwvisio~~Consultants for effective monitoring for control on child labour.


        Exploitation of young unmarried women is very common in such camps. A strong vigilance
        mechanism will ensure ceasing of such exploitation.


        Project Director on receipt of coniplaint from R&R Coordinator or NGO and valid proof may
        take necessary action as per the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986. Apart
        from that Project Director may take following actions:
        I. Penalty
        2.   Black listing of the firm


        Special Measures for Controlling STD, AIDS
        Solitary adult males usually dominate the labour force of construction camps They play a
        significant role in spreading sexually transmitted diseases. In the constructioii camps as well
        as in the neighbouring areas they are found to indulge in physical relations with different
        wonieii. This unhealthy sexual behaviour gives rise to STDs and ADIS.


        While. it is ciifficult to stop such activities, it is wiser to make provisions for means of
        controlling the spread of such diseases. Awareness camps for the target people, both in the
        construction camp and neighbouring villages as well, and supply of condoms at concession
        rate to the male workers may help to large extent in this respect.


7.2     Assistance to Other Vulnerable Groups under R&R Policy
        The R&R policy under paragraph 4 of sunlmary entitlement provides for additional support
        to other vulnerable groups    illform of ecol-romic rehabilitation grant calculated at one-year
        income level as determined by the Planning Commission of Government of India for Belo~
        Poverty Tine.


        Laizdfor Land
        As a     speciaI measure in the project, the vulnerable group will receive land as
        compensation/replacement for the land lost due to tlie project.


        While providing replacement land, emphasis will be to provide land of equal or more
        productive value. 'The eligible vulnerable families will have options to choose the locations

8.0     INCOME RESTORATION

8.1     Background
        Development project may Iiave an adverse impact on the income of project-affected persons.
        They al\o have a negative impact on the socio- cultural systems of affected communities. The
        bas~cpostulates of all developmental activities should be that no one is worse of than before
        the project. Restoratioli of pre-project levels of income 1s an important part of rehabilitating
        socio-economic and cultural systems in affected communities.


        'To achieve this goal, preparation of IR programmes under Rehabilitation Action Plan should
        proceed exactly as it would have for any other economic development programme. IIZ
        schemes should be designed in consultatiol~with the affected persons and they should
        eul.>licitlyapprove the programme.


        I>ucto proposed project, a total of 228 ho~~seholdswill be affected due to loss of agriculture
        land. Among such households, 168are vulnerable.


8.2     Income Restoration Measures under R&R Policy
        'The R&R policy has the following provisions for income restoration of those whose livelihood
        is getting affected:
        -
            If a person is losing source of income (wage earning- indirectly affected due to the
            employer being displaced), the individual is entitled for grant equivalent to minimum
            wages calculated for 6 months.
            Those losing commercial establishment and other income generating assets (other than
            agriculture land) are entitled for transitional allowance calculated at minimum wages
            (Rs 2000,'- per month) for nine months. Such PAPs are also entitled for rental allowance
            of Rs 500 per month for a maximum period of 6 months apart from a Iump sum Rs 1000/-
            towards shifting allowance. Vulnerable PAPs will get commercial plots (maximum up to
            the limit of 25 sq. m) free of cost.
            'riiose losing income opportunity are eligible for grant calculated at minimum wages
            (Rs2000/- per month) for a maximum period of six months. They are also entitled for
            training for skill upgradation.
            Vulnerable PAPS are eligible for economic rehabilitation grant calculated at minimum
            one year income level as determined by Planning Commission, Government of India.


8.3     Income Restoration Options Preferred by PAPs
        During the discussion majority of the PAPs opted for cash con~pensation(Table 8.1). 'The)!
        were of the view that with the compensation amount if provided at replacement value, they
        will be able to buy new land. Only about 6%ofthe households demanded land for land while
        only 4% households demanded training for self-employment.

8.4      Inter-Agency Linkages for Income Restoration
         All the eligible families for income restoration earn their livelihood through cultivation
         (pr~marilysmall and marginal), and therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the PAPs are
         able to reconstruct their livelihood. The NGOs engaged in the implementation of the RAP
         will ensure that the PAPs are facilitated to obtain plots near their existing habitation to
         minimise disruption to their social network and normal work pattern.


         For Income restoration it is important that available skills with the PAPs is identified and
         ft~rtherupgraded. During verification survey, NGO should specifically ask about the skill
         thcy posses other than the one related to their current occupation. NGO contracted for
         in~plementatiorishall also conduct a survey among the PAPs with options of various skills
         related to the resource base of the area and available market (with proper forward and
         backward linkages) and accordingly select trades for training. Based on the training, NGO
         will identify income-generating activities for sustainable economic opportunities. NGCh in
         corlsultation with the PAPs, R&R Coordinator of PWD, district administration and other
         stakeholclers in institutional financing and marketing federations will prepare micro-plans for
         1Ii activities.


         In case of upgrading agriculture productivity, the training on technical know-how will be
         arranged as per the choices of the target group population. In case of creation of alternative
         livelihood schemes, felt needs of the target group population will be prioritised through
         people's participation. Further, these options will be tested for their viability against
         availability of skills, resource base of the area and available appropriate technology. Suitable
         alternative livelihood schemes will be chosen finally, where training on skill upgradation,
         capital assistance, and assistance in the form of backward-forward linkages can be provided
         tor tndking these pursuits sustainable for the beneficiaries or the target groups.


         A comprehensive support system to the PAPs will ensure income security. The project will
         work as a facilitator to the people in the enterprise (but will not act as providers for each and
        every livelihood opportunity). The PAPs are required to participate in developing feasible
         long- term income generating schemes. The long- term options are expected to be developed
         ~luringthe implementation of the RAP and also supported by the government assistance.

8.5       Steps in Income Restoration


8.5.1     Information on Economic Activities of PAPs
          Basic information on IR activities of PAPs will be available from the census and socio-
          economic surveys. Information from base line surveys will be available on features of
          economic activities of PAPs under two categories, viz.,
               [,and based economic activities

          0    Non-land economic activities
               lotal income of PAPsfrom various sources


          Based on this information IR activities can be planned. IR activities are of two types:
          (1) Short term; and
          (2) L,ongterm. The ensuing section describes both IR schemes.


          Short Term IR activities


          Short term IR activities means restoring PAPs' income during periods immediately before
          nnd after relocation. Such activities will focus on the following:


               Ensuring that adequate compensation is paid before relocation
               Providing short term, welfare based grants and allowances such as:

               F   Free or subsidised items

               F   Transitional allowances or grants until adequate income is generated, special
                   allowances for vulnerable groups

               F   \Y~thcons~derationof PAPs skills and needs, promoting PAP access to project relatecl
                   employment opportunities such as:
                       Work under the Main Investment Project
                   U   Work on relocation teams (e.g., driver, food provision, etc.)

        Long Term IR Activities

        PAP should participate in developing a range of feasible long-term IR options. Long-term
        options are affected by the scale of resettlement which may affect the feasibility of various
        non land based and land based IR options. The long-term options are government financed,
        therefore no separate budget is required. However, in IZ&R budget provision has been made
        for the expenses to be incurred towards the coordination between project and concerned
        departments for dove tailing of poverty alleviation schemes. The project officials will
        coc~rdinatewith government (district adniinistration), including tribal developruent and
        social welfare departments, to assure PAPs access to all schemes for improving IR services.
        Project financed programmes should include a specific time frame for handing over the
        project to local administration at the end of a stipulated period. Availability and access to
        existing programmes should be sought for all PAPS.


        Long 'Term IR activities will be generated once the census surveys and consultation get over.
        IR dctivities will be generated in consultation with the community. Mechanism to dovetail
        existing government poverty alleviation programllles will be developed in consultation with
        the community and officials of district administration and District Rural Development
        Agency (DRDA).


8.5.2   CATEGORIESOF IMPACTS
        Project induced displacement may lead to loss or diminished income for Project Affected
        Person (PAPs).All impacts are related to loss of agriculture land.


        'The best way to tackle loss of farmland in part or full is to help the concerned PAP to buy
        cxliiivalent farmland in a nearby area using the land compensation received. Land for land
        has been found to be the best sustainable option for Income Restoration. This option can only
        be exercised when a PAP has lost a significant amount of land; it would be impossible and
        inadvisable to replace small strips of land. The compensation received can be deposited in
        blocked bank accounts. The interest accruing will supplement their income from other
        sources. The money can only be released for buying replacement land. It is important to see
        that the compensation money is not frittered away for consumption expenditure or paying off
        loans especially for the vuhierable sections of PAPS- the more well off can be exempted from
        this provision and directly paid in cash. The land compensation will be paid at replacement
        value and will be sufficient for buying replacement land.


8.6     Alternative Individual Income Restoration Scheme


8.6.1   BASIS FOR IDENTIFICATION OFALTERNATIVE IR SCHEME
        Keeping in view the resource base of the EPs and also the socio-economic characteristics atid
        preferences, PWD and the NGO contracted for the implementation will have to chalk out
        individual IR schemes. Other factors to be considered are:


            Eclncation level of I'APs
            Skill possession
            Likely economic activities in the post displacement period
            Extent of land left
            Extent of land purchased
            Suitability of economic activity to supplement the income
            Market potential and marketing facilities

        "The best option is to allow the EP to continue its former occupatioil". However, during any
        development programme, occupations always change. An exhaustive 1st of possible Ili
        options are given in table 8.3.

                            Table 8.3: Criteria for Alternative IR Schemes

                              Business builds on/uses existing skill of the PAP


  d) Continuing previous
  empLoyment




                              PAPs are linked to existing government job programmes (like
                                  harashtra legislation reserving 5%of government jobs for PAPs)
                                 ere is a good coordination between project and government



        The PAPs will participate in developing a range of feasible long-term Income Restoration
        schemes. 'These will be developed during the implelnentation of the project and would be
        financed by project. PWD will work with NGO and liaison with the district administration to
        dovetail government's poverty alleviation schemes. The micro plaiis developed by the
        implenienting authority will indicate the type of scheme each family has opted. The grants
        1.c.ct1ivcdfor economic rehabilitation will be usecl for purchase of assets. The EPs will receive
        training tor acquisition of new7skills or upgradation of old skills for the activity selected by
        them.


8.6.2   NON LAND BASED IR SCHEMES
        Since land is scarce and not all PAPs are agriculturists, non-land based and cooperative IR
        schemes becomes a11the more important. The non-land based IR schemes could be:
                        Making of Detergent Powder
                        Detergent soap
                        Cleaning Powder
                        Bath soap

                       Vl'eavitig


        Allied Agriculture Activities
        Under allied agriculture activities, various IR options are available viz., dairy, poultry,
        goatery, sheep rearing, piggery, etc. PAPs who are agriculturist can take up any of these
        options. These will require training, which can be imparted by Khadi Village Industries
        Comniission (KVIC) / District Dairy Development Authority (DDDA) and milk route for
        daily milk collection can be extended by local milk federation.


        Petty Traders
        Under th~sscheme, the available options are grocery shop, vegetable & fruit shop, stationary,
        clothe, tea & snacks, ready-made garments, beetle shop etc. PAPS those who are already in
        the trade and business are suitable for these activities. Implementing NGO will have to
        decide on type of shops to be established as per demand.


        Skill related Schemes
        The options available under this scheme are tailoring, carpentry, masonry, gold smith, black
        smith, motor winding, cycle/niotor cycle/auto repair, driving (auto/Matador/etc.),
        TeItwision/Tape records/ Watch repairing, Pottery, Leather works, etc. PAPS those who are
        in s~~clitrades can undergo training for skill upgradation to supplement their annual income.
        District Industries Centre or Khadi Village Industries Board/Con~missionor I~idustrial
        Training Institutes imparts training in such trades. Training can also be imparted through
        professional and competent outside agency especially hired for the purpose.


        Others
        Others primarily include loan for various agriculture implements to increase procluctivity

        VIZ., punip ~ets,dug well, bore well, bullock cart, etc. PAPS those who are into agriculture
        anci do not have any irrigation facilities can avail such loans. Such loans are given by bank
        after District Rural Development Authority processes the applications.


        'The iniplementation of above-mentioned activities requires organisation of credit canips.
        Extending financial credit support is an important component of non-land based IR schenies.
        It requires organisation of credit camps for EPs. Local government officials, NGOs and PAP
        representatives apart from PWD officials, will attend these camps. The purpose of the camps
        woi~ldbe to allow local financial institutions to inform participants of credit options and how
        to avoid procedural deIays. AI1 formalities related to processing of applications for credit
        <lssistancewill be completed at these camps.


        For these kinds of camps PWD along with NGO, will have to coordinate closely with the
        liead Bank managers and other commercial banks operating in the district.


8.7     Training
        One of the strategies for economic sustenance of the PAPS is to help them improve their
        production level or to impart new skills/up grade skills through training. As quite a
        significant number of PAPs are dependent on agriculture and others have low skill
        endowment, training becomes an important component of IR. For PAPS who intend to
        diversify their econoniic activity, suitable income restoration schemes will be identified on
        individual basis and training need would be assessed. Besides training in scheme specific
        skills, general entrepreneurship development will also form part of the training programme,
        mainly to improve the management capabilities of EP.

        other government agencies will also be availed. The past experiences have sliown that
        roughly three-fourth of the PAPS require training. It will be the responsibility of the PWD to
        ensure that PAPS receives, training in desired trade. The NGO contracted will act as a
        facilitator and training will be imparted either by the governnient agencies such as DIC,
        .-KVIC,    ITDA, etc. or a professional and competent outside agency. The local Industrial
         1 raining Institutes (ITIs)can be approached for training.

9.0     INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS


9.1     Background
        Institutions for planning and implenientation of resettlement programmes are numerous and
        \far), substantially in terms of their respective roles and capacity to successfully carry out
        various components. Timely establishment and involvement of appropriate R&R institutions
        vvoulct significantly facilitate achievement of the objectives of the R&R Programme. This
        document reflects an institutional assessment and provides a strategy for developing
        required implementation capacity and minimising risks. Capacity building and training are
        co-ordinated with the project implementation schedule to ensure that skilled staff is available
        to implenient the RAP without delay in civil works. The main R&R institutions would
        include:

            Monrtoring & Evaluation Agency


9.2     The Process
        PWD will focus effort in three critical areas to commence RAP implementation:


        (a) To initiate the process, orientation and awareness seminars will be organised for the
            PWD and other RAP implementers
        (b) NGOs with experience it1 social development and a track record in resettlement and
            rehabilitation will be partners in RAP implementation.
        (c) 'To establish Coordination Cornillittee with representatives from local self-government,
            PAPS and implementing NGO. The objective of this committee is to coordinate between
            various implementing agencies.


        The institutional context of resettlement in the project is reviewed below and major features
        of RAP implementation are described in sections that follow.


        Effective RAP implementation will require institutional relationships and responsibilities,
        rapid organisational development and collaborative efforts by PWD, State Government,
        partner NGO anci affected population. ESRDC has already been established vide GO no.

        engineer who reports to Chief Engineer (World Bank) and is supported by AE (social) and AE
        (environment). The ESRDC will establish operational links within SRP-I1 aiid with other
        agencies of government involved in project-induced resettlement. It will bridge the distance
        between the project and project affected persons and communities. It wilI provide the means

                Among government agencies, the revenue department will have the most important role
                Wlille the responsibility for land acquisition and payment of compensation for land acquired
                (including properties there on) lies with the Revenue Department, the ESDRC has to assume
                responsibility for co-ordinating various matters with the Revenue Department so that both
                physical possession of land acquired and payment of compensation is not unduly delayed.
                The responsibility for income restoration and replacement of common property resources
                would fully be with the ESDRC along with the nodal NGO.


        9.3     Need for NGO/CBO
                The relocation disturbs the present activities of PAPSand therefore there is a need to establish
                and stabilise their econoinic living. While all tasks relating to Land Acquisition is taken care
                by the 1,and Acquisition Officer and his staff, the implementation of RAP is the responsibility
                of the ESDRC under PWD. The NGO will help in implementing varlous components of the
                RAP, particularly the use of compensation and rehabilitation assistance for more product~ve
                purposes like purchase of land, self-employment, etc. Its involvement           IS all the more
                important since there are no social community organ~sationsamong the PAPS wh~cli
                otl~erw~secould have taken lead in this regard.


                Ue~ngnrh to the area of working with PAPS, the selected NGO will have to work directly
                under the ESDRC Co-ordinator who will be defacto in charge for implementation of RAP.
                Thus implementation becomes joint responsibility of PWD and NGO.

9.4     Role of NGO
        Resettlement relates to human aspects and economic rehabilitation requires human resources
        developnient consisting of education, training, awareness generation, etc. In absence of any
        sociologist / anthropologist, NGO will be involved to assist PWD in implementation of RAP.
        7The NGO will help educating PAPS on the proper utilisation of compensation c~rid
        rehabilitation grant and help them in getting financial assistance, if required, under various
        subsidy related development programmes. It will also organise training programtnes to
        impart t.oquirec1 skill for such PAPs who would prefer to go for self-employment schemes.
        Specifically, the tasks of the NGO will be to:
            develop rapport with PAPSand between PAPs and PWD
            verification of PAPs
            post design consultations with the community
            assess the level of skills and efficiency in pursuing ecoriomic activities, identify needs for
            training and organise programmes either to improve the efficiency and/or to impart new
            skills.
        m   assist P1'I13in receiving rehabilitation entitlement due to them
            motivate and guide PAP for proper utilisation of benefits under R&R policy provisions;
            facilitate purchase of agriculture land in negotiating price and settling at a reasonable
            price or expedite the same through Land Purchase Committee.
            assist PAPSin obtaining benefits from the appropriate development programmes.
            help PAPS in increasing their farm income through provision of irrigation facility or
            i~iipsovi~igfarm practices,
            ensure marketing of produce particularly those under self-employment activities.
        *   complete the consultation at the cc)mmunity level and provide support by describing the
            entitlements to the EPs and assisting them in their clioices
            accompany and represent the EPs at the Grievance Committee meeting.
            assist the EPs to take advantage of the existing government housing schemes and
            employment and training schemes that are selected for use during the project, and
            carry out other responsibilities as required and identified.


        In the context of implementing of RAP, it is important that NGO, which is genuine and
        committed to the task entrusted, is selected. An NGO with local presence is, however, more
        suitable hence would be preferred. The NGO may be contracted on specified terms and
        conclitions with proper fixation of financial accountability. The payment to NGO will be
        linked to the performance of the task assigned and the time period. The payment will be
        arranged on quarterly basis to be released on certification of completing the previous task.
        The rriotiitoring of R&R programme will also include the performance of NGO. The NGO
        services will be required for implementation period for which provisions have been provided
        in the plan.


        S~rnultaneouslysteps can be taken for promoting location specific Con~niunityBased
        (3rg;uiisations (CBOs) of PAPs to handle resettlement planning, implementation and
        tnonitorrng. These groups can be promoted for each adversely affected settlenient/villages or

        '1group of contagious villages. Until and unless sufficient institutional capacity is built
        amongst the PAPs, so that they can act and react as a group, participatory planning and
        implementation of good re-establishment solutions is nearly impossible.


        Resettlement negotiation, if carried out individually with all displaced families,        IS both
        uneven and time consuming. It favours the good bargainers over the bad bargainers and as
        bargaining capacity is directly related to income levels - favours the more affluent over the
        pooret and more vulnerable sections of the displaced population. This can be nunimised by
        organising homogenous groups of displaced persons to handle resettlement negotiations
        together ~11thparticipatory planning and implementation of re-establishment solutions

9.5     District Level Committees
        RAP will be implemented through District Level Con~niitteesthat will be established in each
        ciistrict where the project is active. These committees will provide co-ordinating nodes for
        land acquisition and compensation, relocation and rehabilitation, distribution of project
        provided assistance and PAPs' access to most government progranimes. ESDRC will service
        district cornmittees with field staff allocated to multi-district construction contracts.

        would meet regularly to review the progress of land acquisition. The committee would also
        decide on the replacement value on the basis of methodology described in RAP.

9.6     Training and Capacity Building
        Establishing sufficient implementation capacity to launch and carry out those components of
        project resettlement that must be completed before civil works. To enhance capabilities,
        ESDRC staff can be sent on exposure visits to other projects with good resettlement
        programmes as well as sponsored for training courses in Resettlement and Rehabilitation
        (r\~'kR).'l'lie training would also cover techniques in conducting participatory rural appraisal
         to^.t11ic1.0 planning, conductirlg census and socio-economic surveys, dissemination of

9.7     Areas of Capacity Building
        PWII nccds to build their capacity in the following areas:

        Land Acquisition
        Since only impact of the proposed project is loss of agriculture land, PWD staff needs to be
        trained on process of Land Acquisition. LA generally is a long drawn and demanding
        process. However, PWD will be acquiring land through private negotiation The existing

-.-p
        strength of PWD for this purpose is too small. Currently, Project Director is responsible for
        every activity and arranging for completion of all formalities and procedural requirements for
        LA will also be IJrojectDirector's responsibility. R&R Coordinator of PWD will assist him.


        The Project Ilirector, apart from timely acquisition of land is also responsible for number of
        other important components of pre-construction work. Thougl~revenue department of state
        government will do the acquisition, it will require constant follow up. Hence the
        responsibility will come on R&R Coordinator. Among other pressing assign~i~entsviz.,
        identification and verification of PAFs, Issuing Identity cards, development of resettlement
        sites, etc, R&R Coordinator will also be responsible for regular follow up of land acquisition.


        In light of the above, it would be important to address the following:

        *    For better co-ordination, the officer responsible for acquisition has to spend sufficient
             time at the site. To enable better follow up the officer should be of sufficiently high rank.


            The procedural requirements have to be formalised and documented for the benefit of all
             projects concerned.


            Ensuring timely land acquisition is demanding requirement and requires full time
             involvemelit of an officer, at least during the first six months of the project.

10.0    GRIEVANCE REDRESS MECHANISM


10.1    Need for Grievance Redress Mechanism
        I'hough there is a provision for redress of grievances of PAPs in all aspects relating to L,and
        ilccluisition (LA) and payment of compensation in Rehabilitation Action Plan. Various
        provision under LA act enable aggrieved EPs at different stages of LA to represent their cases
        to Land Acquisition Officer or even refer to court for redress and seek higher compensation.
        The most common reason for delay in implementation of projects is grievance of people
        losing land. UPSRP - I has already faced this problem. Considering this, GRC will be formed
        much in advance. It is further suggested that LA0 & RRO should hold a meeting at a fixed
        date every month to hear the grievances of EPs. Moreover, Lok Adalats can be lield for quick
        disposals of cases.


        FIowever, R&R policy of Government of Uttar Pradesh has a provision of Grievance Reclress
        Committee to be headed by District Magistrate of respective districts.


        Members of the committee: Apart from District Magistrate as head of the committee at
        district level, the committee will comprise of representatives of                  local NGOs,
                                                                                      h 7 0

        representative of people (viz., Member of Parliament, Member of Legislative Assembly, etc),
        reyreseiitatives of blocks, districts, line departments & affected persons. At central level,
        Project Director of Project Imple~iie~~tationUnit will head the committee


        Meetings and decision-making process of the committee: It is suggested that Grievance cell
        shall meet regularly (at least once a month) on a pre-fixed date (preferably on first 7t11day of
        the month). The committee will fix responsibilities to implement the decisions of the

11.0    MONITORING AND EVALUATION

11.1    Introduction
        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) are critical activities in involuntary resettlement.
        Monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain whether activities are going according to
        the plan. It provides the feed back necessary for project management to keep the programmes
        on scheciule. By contrast, evaluation is essentially a summing up, the end of the project
        nssessment of whether those activities actually achieved their intended aims. As per World
        Banks' OP/BP 4.12 "Monitoring provides both working system for project managers and a
        channel for the resettles to make known their needs and their reactions to resettlement
        execution". Monitoring exercise will be undertaken both internally and externally. \hlhile R&II
        Coordinator of PWD on monthly basis will carry out the project's internal monitoring, an
        external agency will be appointed for third party monitoring. External agency will conduct
        monthly and quarterly monitoring and mid term, annual and end term evaluation of the
        project.


        Inct~catnls, Ivhicb will be monitored during the project, consist of two broad categories:

        *   Process and output indicators or internal monitoring
            Outconie/impact indicators or external monitoring


11.2    Process and Output Indicators
        Monitoring of involuntary resettlement operations require in essence, an application of
        general project monitoring procedures and methods to the process accruing in resettlement
        but ~ ~ ' i tparticular attention to the specific high risks intrinsic in such operations. This means
                     t i
        monitoring of R&R requires certain specialised skills. Therefore a specialised group reporting
        to the PWD must carry out M&E.


        The conventional monitoring through government machinery often misses focus on certain
        vital aspects, which niay otherwise be very important. Therefore R&R Coordinator at
        Lucknow in close coordination with his counterparts at division level will carry out legular
        monitoring and will produce ~iionthlyreports.


         Ihe internal monltor~ng1s a coriventional monitoring of government related to physrcal
        factors such as, number of families affected, resettled, assistance extended mfrastructure
        facilities provided, etc. and other financial aspects, such as compensation paid, grant
        extended, etc. The internal M&E must be simultaneous with the implementation of the
        Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP).


11.2.1  THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INTERNAL MONITORING
        The objectives of the internal monitoring are:


             Daily Operations Planning (DOP)
            Man'lgenient and Implementation (MM)
            Operational Trouble shooting and Feedback (OTSF)


        'The periodicity of internal monitoring could be daily or weekly depending on the issues and
        level.

11.2.2  INFORMATIONREQUIRED FOR INTERNALMONITORING
        For internal monitoring following information will be required:


             Individual files on each project affected person
        *    Village Proforma
             Action Plan and Progress reports


11.2.3  MONITORING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS
        CI.'I   and day to day management and monitoring management will require its own
             '~ I ~

        improved action plans, regular coordination and onsite training sessions and an Management
        Information System as internal system. It also requires trouble-shooters and informal
        networks of feed back from the comniunities, NGOs, M&E agencies and other government
        bodies.

        indicate the timeliness of the financial disbursements already agreed to and deviations from
        tlie critical path for over all project completion and the required integrated arrangements to
        resettle PAPs.


11.2,4  EXTERNALMONITORING
        Supervision Consultant will be responsible for meaningful and realistic monitoring of R&R
        progl.aniliies on monthly and quarterly basis. The role of Supervision Consultants will not be
        fault finding but to act as a catalyst in smoothening the process of R&R and thus provide a
        helping hand in the proper implementation of rehabilitation programmes. It should also
        endeavour to bring the problem and difficulties faced by the PAPs to the notice of PWD so as
        to help in formulating corrective measures. However for annual, mid term and end tern1
        impact evaluation, an external agency will be appointed by PWD. Financial provisions have
        been made to appoint an external agency for M&E. As a feedback to the PWD and other
        coilicrned, tlie external agency should submit monthly and quarterly report on progress
        mc1de relating to different aspect of R&R.


11.2.5 THE OBJECTIVESOFTHE EXTERNALMONITORING
        The objectives of the external monitoring are:
             To track resettled and host population over time in order to document the restoration of
             incomes and standard of living.
             Determine remedial action if required.
             It iliconie and standard of living of the PAPs has at least been restored and has not
             declined.
             In case of host population, whether income arid standard of living of host populat~on
             have not declined due to influence of resettlers
             Whether resettlers and host population have re-integrated with each other.


11.2.6 THE INFORMATIONS REQUIRED FOR EXTERNAL MONITORING
        The information required for external monitoring is:
        *    Baseline survey data
             Sample survey (to be conducted by M&E agency)
        *    Case studies/Theniatic st~ldies* Issue based research (to be conducted by M&E agency)
             Participatory research (to be carried out by M&E agency)
             Target group monitoring (to be carried out by M&E agency)

11.2.7  MONITORING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS
        Observing and appraising various specific parameters and processes as objectively as
        possiblt' will carried out. Periodic evaluation of these would indicate where and when policy
        changes could occur or where deficiencies in implementation method or style are apparent.
        'I'he boundaries of this assessment will need the agencies (M&E) to examine the multiplier
        etfects and linkages outside of the project definition of affected people and areas.


        The in~yactevaluation will be carried out after the implementation of RAP is over. This         1s
        never an easy matter to determine. Financial considerations often require an impact
        rvaluat~onshortly before or after the project concludes. However, project continuous to
        evolve overtime. Therefore it is suggested, that if required, second impact evaluation be
        carried out after three to five years of project coi~clusionas retrofit survey.


        Intpact cvaluation will look at all the affected populations; self-relocatee; ass~stedresettled
        populdt~on,host population. Further this larger population will be further broken down into
        vulnerable segments of each populatioil. Impact evaluation will be carried out on randorllly
        selected segment of population.


         The external agency will submit quarterly report to the PWD.

12.0    IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

12.1    Background
        Planning, surveying, assessing, policy development, institutional identification, participation,
        income restoration and implementation are typical activities of RAP. While these activities
        have discrete components that can be put on a time line, there is a close inter relationship of
        c.dch activity to the whole. The breakdown of each activity according to a specific time frame
        has been provided to assist Public Works Department in impleme~itatio~iof RAP at various
        stages.


        It is further cautioned that specific situation may require an increase in time, allotted to a task.
        Such situations includes, but not limited to local opposition; seasonal factors, socidl and
        economic concerns, training of support staff and financial constraints. Coniplementation
        Schedule will require detailed coordination between the project authorities and various line
        departments.


        Iri~plenientationplan has been spread over a period of two years for both the locations. A
        simplified summary of the operational aspects of the in~plementationplan will be prepared
        when the project starts. It will be giver1 to PWD, who aloi~gwith a route wise selected NGOs

13.0      COSTS AND BUDGET

13.1      I~itroduction
          The budget is indicative with outlays for the different expenditure categories. The costs used
          for the budget are based on information collected during census and socio-economic surveys,
          revenue department and PWD. The resettlement budget, particularly, the compensation and
          assistance payment components for non-land assets have been computed based on market
          survey. Land value was collected from revenue officials of various categories to arrive at an
          estimate. It is suggested that during land acquisition, an independent committee on
          Replacement value Assessments should assess the cost and accordingly the budget will be
          modified.


          The total budget has been estimated at Rs. 55.00 nullion. The basis for budget estimation and
          detailed budget has been provided in ensuing sections.


13.1.1    THE LAND VALUE
          As per the market survey and discussion with the revenue officials the value of different
          categories of land is as under:


          Table 13.1: Land Value in Project Area

13.2      Income Generation and Vocational Training
          The amount used to estimate the budget for training will be calculated based on following
          norms:


          Table 13.2: Estimate of budget for training
        Lees of NGO ver EP                                         Rs 800.00
        1 Food and Stav of each EP for seven davs                 Rs 750.00           11



          Training provided to each eligible EP will be as per their choice for skill upgradation.
          Vulnerable group PAPS will be given preference for this support. Training will be provided
          under District Rural Development Agency (DRDA)scheme of TRYSEM.


13.3      Transitional Allowance
          The transitional allowance for PAPSlosing agriculture land has been calculated at min~muni
          wages for 9 months if the residual land is not viable or for 6 months if residual land is viable.
          For loss of non-agriculture land and assets, transitional allowance has been calculatecl at
          niinimum wages in form of grant to cover maxi~nun~nine months. The minimum wages has
          been calculated at Rs 2000,'- per month.


13.4      Economic Rehabilitation Grant


          Economic rehabilitation grant has been calculated at minimum wages as deterniined by
          Planning Commission, Government of India for Below Poverty Line. An estimated 'imount
          has been taken to calculate the budgetary requirement for M&E agency, NGO, Staff training,
          Office set-up etc.

 Note.     Provision has been made in the budget towards additional studies. In course of the RAP
           implementation, it is likely that unexpected issues, obstacles and snags will be encountered
           The project authority therefore, should have the capacity to rapidly deploy problem solving
           '~ndaction orlented corrective action. The problem solving and action oriented corrective
           actions will come from the results of thematic studies. A tentative list of thematic studies is
          given below:

1      INTRODUCTION

1 . 1  Government of Uttar Pradesh has plans to improve the State road network. The aim
       and the objective are to improve and strengthen the state's road transport network.

1.2 Apart from the positive aspects of the road upgradation, the project may cause loss of
       land, structures, other immobile properties and various sources of livelihood. This
       document describes the principles and approach to be followed in minimizing and
       mitigating negative social and economic impacts caused by projects so that the
       affected are able to restore and improve their standard of living.



2      BROAD PRINCIPLES

2.1    This policy recognizes that involuntary resettlement dismantles a previous production
       system and a way of life, all such rehabilitation programs will adopt a developmental
       approach rather than the welfare approach. These guidelines details out the
       assistance in re-establishing the homes and livelihoods of the Project Affected People
       (PAP) during the course of projects. The broad principles of the Resettlement and
       Rehabilitation (R&R) policy are as given below:


       a)     All negative impacts including displacement should be avoided or minimised
             wherever feasible by exploring all viable alternative project designs.
       b)     Where negative impacts are unavoidable, efforts should be made either to
             improve the standard of living of the affected persons or at least assist them in
             restoringtheir previousstandard of living at no cost to them.
       c)     Ensure people's participation during the course of the project cycle.
       d)     Effort should be made towards the enhancement of the positive impact of the
              projects.

2.2 The project will broadly have three impacts that require mitigation measures. They are:

       a)     Loss of immovable assets viz., land, house, commercial establishments wells,
              ponds, etc
       b)     Loss of livelihood or income opportunities viz., for agriculture labours, helping
              hands in commercial establishments,etc.
       c)     Impact on the community in terms of loss of common property resources.

       The first two categories represent direct impacts on an identified population. The
       people likely to be affected will be surveyed and registered, grid project monitoring
       and evaluation will compare long-termimpacts against baseline socio-economy data.

       The third category represents a group impact, where gains and losses of a group -
       oriented nature are not quantifiable in terms of impact on the individual. Mitigation

       and support mechanisms will be collectively oriented, and the monitoring will focus on
       impact on such groups.

2.3 All acquisition of private land would be under the Land Acquisition (Amendment)Act,
       1984, which provides for compensation and solatium for the properties to be acquired.


       a)    Support will be extended under the broad principles of this policy to meet the
             replacement value of the assets and loss of livelihood.
       b)    The policy further recongnises extension of support to non-titleholders for the loss
             of livelihood and replacement value for assets other than land.
       c)    The common property resources will be replaced as far as feasible and if not
             then assistance will be provided at replacement value to the group.

2.4 Major widening and strengtheningwork planned will take place within the Right of Way
       (ROW] based on land availability, gradient, traffic and congestion of population along
       the road length. Efforts will be made during implementation to minimise any
       disturbance in the daily activitiesof the local people.

2.5 Before taking possession of the acquired lands and properties, all compensation,
       resettlementand rehabilitation would be made in accordance with this policy.

2.6 In case of displacement, resettlement sites will be developed as part of the project. In
       such circumstances care should be taken so that there is no / or minimum adverse
       social, economic and environmental effects of displacement on the host communities
       and specific measures would be provided in the Resettlement and Rehabilitation
       Action Plan (RAP)to mitigate any such impacts.

2.7 Before taking possession of acquired property sufficient time would be pr~videdto
       harvest the crop.

28 The implementation of the R 8, R Action Planwill be synchronizedwith the civil works

2.9.   The project will ensure that no civil works are initiated before compensation and
       assistance to affected population has been provided in accordance with this policy.

          persons.



5      BROAD PROCEDURES

       Basic Approach

       a)    The policy recognizes that along with the positive aspects of infrastructure
             development, there are also negative impacts.


       b)    The policy principle is to provide R&R assistance to both PDPs and PAPs.


       c)    Every effort should be made during project design and preparation to minimise
             acquisition of land and other assets and to reduce negative socio-economic
             impacts. The structures / assets falling outside the CO1and within the ROW would
             be left undisturbed.

       d)     People losing their home represent a particular challenge in the resettlement
              program. Every effort will be to ensure that new housing is available before
              people are displaced.


       e)     If the project impact leads to people being unable to continue with their
              previous occupation, the project will provide support and assist through
              alternative employment strategies.           Long-term earning opportunities will be
              provided through strategies such as vocational training, employment counseling,
              inclusionin income generating schemes, and access to credit, etc.


       f)     Absence of legal title to land will not bar the people from rehabilitation
              assistance.     However, compensation for land will not be extended to the
              encroachers and squatters, considering the illegal nature of their possession.


       g)     The identification of encroachers and squatters, in case they do not possess
              ration cards, would be sought from voter's list, or any other legal documents or
              information from the community.             In the absence of any supporting legal
              documents, findings of the Census survey shall be relied upon.


       h)     Efforts should be made to ensure consultation, involvement and participation of
              the people, Non-government Organisations (NGOs) and stakeholders in
              planning, implementation and monitoring of the project through focus group
              discussions, workshops at district level and also at state level. The PAPs and
              particularly in the case of vulnerable individuals and groups, who will be
              encouraged to choose the options,which entail the lowest risk


       i)     Copies of this document, information on its salient features or its executive
              summary, will be displayed at the notice board of the offices of the project
              authority, and prominent public places for general information to the public.
              Summary of the Policy with entitlement framework translated in local language
              will be distributed to the affected people. Interested persons may contact
               project authorities for further details.
       j)     The R&R assistance for each and every PAP will be determined as per their
              respective entitlement as defined in annex A.



5.2 Compensation and R&R

       a)     All PAPs will be entitled to R&R assistance over and above the compensation
              received under the LA Act. Those PAPSwho are not entitled for compensation
               (encroachers and squatters)will get R&R benefits as per their entitlement.


       b)     The compensation for land and building shall be provided within the ambit of LA
              Act and to meet the replacement value, R&R assistancewill be provided.


       c)     All losses, including loss of income, will be compensated within the overall R&R
              package as per the entitlement framework. The unit of entitlement will be the
              family as defined in section 4.0.


       d)     In case of acquisition of houses/community buildingslor any other assets, the
              replacement value will be considered. In case the replacement value is more
              than the compensation at market value determined by the competent authority,
              the difference is to be paid in form of assistance.

6      SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND RESETTLEMENT PLANNING

6.1    Corridor of Impact

       Displacement will be limited to the corridor required for the road, which includes the
      safety zone. This corridor is referred to as the Corridor of Impact (Col),and comprises
      typically the total construction width, inclusive of drains/embankments, shoulders. The
       CO1 may have different extent to the right and left from the road centre line and may
      vary as per the social requirement in order to avoid / minimise adverse impacts.



6.2 Surveys

      For proper rehabilitation of the project affected and displaced persons, social impact
      assessment shall be undertaken.              This will help in assessing the magnitude of
      displacement, losses to be sustained by PDPs and PAPs, better targeting of vulnerable
      groups, ascertaining the cost of R&R,           drawing out the rehabilitation package and
      administering the same.

      The social impact assessment survey will consist of two surveys viz.,


      a)    Census verification of 100 percent of the population.
      b)    BaselineSocio-economic survey covering 25 percent of the affected households.



6.2.1 The purpose of the census is to register and document the status of the potentially
      affected population within the project impact area, demographic, social and
      economic profile of the PAPs and to prepare strip maps indicating individual,
      community and public assets along the road stretches.
