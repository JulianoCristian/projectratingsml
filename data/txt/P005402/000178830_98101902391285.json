and on the technical and economic\n            viability of the alternative options for their development,\n            taking into account Morocco's environmental, financial,\n            and manpower constraints, so that the Government can make an\n            informed decision regarding future investments in oil shale.\n            The project consists of: (a) construction and operation of a\n            test station at Timahdit; (b) technical evaluation of\n            alternative retorting processes; (c) preparation of a\n            comprehensive feasibility study of commercial oil shale\n            retorting operations at Timahdit, which will be divided into\n            separate components for the mine and for the retorting plant\n            and infrastructure; and (d) comparison of the economics of\n            shale retorting with direct combustion in power plants."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
