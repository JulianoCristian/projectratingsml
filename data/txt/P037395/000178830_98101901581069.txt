APPRAISAL OF
THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT CCMPANY LIMITED
(IRELAND)
SUMMARY
(i)      The Industrial Credit Company Limited (ICC) was established in 1933 as
a Government-owned company to provide capital for industry. The Government now
holds all but £642 of its paid-up capital of £8.83 million. The Government
has provided loans to ICC amounting to about £13.5 million and has guaranteed
a loan from the Irish banks of £1.8 million.  Since 1969, ICC has begun to
accept deposits, which are guaranteed by the Government.
(ii)     During the first two decades of ICC's existence, economic policy in
Ireland aimed at the development of import-substituting industries, behind high
tariffs. In the mid-1950's the Government changed its policy, abandoning the
emphasis on self-sufficiency and instead began making efforts to attract export
oriented foreign investment by means of attractive financial incentives. As a
result, industrial investment, output, exports and employment have grown rapidly
during the past ten years. Currently, the economy is facing price stability and
balance of payments problems. Measures to curtail public expenditure, strengthen
price controls, limit wage increases and increase direct tax on companies have
been taken.
(iii)    ICC's Board, nominated by the Government, consists of experienced business-
men and bankers; its Chairman has served with ICC throughout nearly all its exist-
ence. The Government closely follows ICC's performance but makes a point of res-
pecting its autonory. ICC's management and senior staff are experienced and
competent. ICC's project appraisals are adequate in terms of financial analysis
and management assessment, but technical and economic assessments need strengthening.
(iv)     In 37 years ICC has provided, through direct financing and underwriting,
£74 million for Irish industry; £55 million of this in the past eleven years.
During the past ten years financing of existing medium and small industries has
formed the greater part of its business, while new firms coming to Ireland as a
result of the Government's incentive have obtained substantial funding directly
from the Government. ICC has diversified its activities to include hire-purchase
financing of industrial goods, leasing of machinery, finance for shipping and for
distributive trades and advising on mergers.
(v)      ICCts earnings have been low.  The contributing factors include a narrow
spread on its borrowed funds, substantial losses incurred on a few of its larger
loans and equity investments, application for a time of some of its resources to
two large non-income yielding projects at the request of the Government. During
the past four years, 90% of ICC's earnings before taxes and provisions have
either been set aside to provide for sure losses or written off. Further small
additions to provisions will be made this year to bring the valuation of ICC's
portfolio into line with its real worth.
(vi)     As the Government has become more selective in providing incentive grants,
ICC is expecting to play a more important role in the future. Projections for
1971-1975 show that ICC's total commitments will more than double (from £6.2
million in 1970 to £15.1 milion in 1975). Its operational profits before tax and
provisions will triple (from £589,000 in 1970 to £1,706,000 in 1975).



(ii)
(vii.) ICCts resource position is tight. As of October 31, 1970, ICC's total
commitments had exceeded its total resources available by approximately £2 million.
Up to the end of CY 1972, ICC's resource gap is estimated to amount to $13.1 -
17.9 million equivalent, after additional loans from the Government are taken into
account. The foreign exchange component of ICC's term loans and equity investments
in manufacturing industry for the two calendar years 1971 and 1972 would amount to
approximately $12.5 million equivalent.
(viii) ICC's management has shown adaptability and vitality in the field of in-
dustrial development financing. It has been active in exploring possibilities
for mobilizing resources. There is a resource gap, however, which ICC finds it
difficult to meet. The proposed $10 million Bank loan, to be used for ICC's long-
term lending program, would contribute substantially to the company's achieving its
business potential over the next 2 years. The terms of the loan follow those nor-
mally applied to development finance company loans.

(IRELAND)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ireland has approached the Bank, on behalf
of The Industrial Credit Company Limited (ICC) for a loan to assist the
company to finance industrial development in Ireland. A mission con-
sisting of Messrs. W.H.J. Christie (Consultant), M.C. Piek and V. Dubey
appraised ICC in August 1970. This was followed by a second mission
consisting of Messrs. E.C.H. Su and M.C. Piek in November. Their find-
ings and recommendations are contained in this report. Further economic
background is provided in Memorandum on the Economic Situation of Ireland,
dated July 2, 1970 (EMA 23a).
II. THE ECONOMIC SETTING
Economic Policies and Performance
2.01      Ireland missed the industrial revolution, and entered the
twentieth century an underdeveloped colntry, with a population of less
than three million. Over a period in which European agricultural
populations were moving into industrial employment within their own
countries, the Irish were emigrating, The few existing industries
were based on inefficient agriculture. For some years after Ireland
gained independence in 1921, civil war and constitutional issues
postponed attention to the economy.
2.02      In the mid-1950's more outward-looking economic policies were
adopted.  The rapid growth of manufacturing industry was really the only
means to achieve these goals. Since the domestic market was small,
industrial growth had to be geared to exports. This in turn could only
be accomplished rapidly by attracting foreign enterprise to Ireland and
this required an attractive incentive program. (See paragraphs 2.08 to
2.13.)  The current Third Program, which continues this emphasis,
covers the period 1969-1972.
2.03      The new policies have attracted industry, and the Irish economic
performance has improved in the last 10 years. The average annual growth
of GNP was 4% in real terms during 1960-1969 - nearly three times the
growth rate of the previous decade. The share of industry in GNP has
increased from 27% in 1958 to 35% in 1968; the output of the industrial
sector has expanded at an average rate of over 7% per year in the 1960's
and has been most marked in the industry groups of chemicals, clay products,
glass and cement, and metal engineering. These groaps provided about 60%
of the increased industrial jobs in the 1960's. Exports of manufactured



-2-
goods increased at an average rate of about 18% a year during 1959-1969 and the
share of industrial exports in total exports has increased. There has been a
rapid increase in manufacturing jobs and net emigration has fallen, althoulgh the
rate of unemployment remains at about 5%. In absolute terms the fLod sector is-
largest, contributing about 35% of manufacturing output, followed by metal engi-
neering (-1l6).
204    The Irish economy, however, is currently faced with price stability and
balance of payments problems. The rapid increase in investment has overheated
thie economy - first in 1965 and again in the last two years. A four months' ce-
me-rt strike early in 1970 restricted new capital investment; and a long bank
s'krle, which started in May and lasted until October 20 disrupted normal finan-
cial transactions. It has yet to be seen whether the strike has had the effect
of restricting credit or the reverse. Measures for curtailing public expenditure
have been announced recently.  The greatest problem, however, is the rate of growth
of wage incomes.  Labor is well organized and recent regular "rounds" of wage ne-
gotiations have led to large increases.
2.05    The growth of exports and GNP has been accompanied by a rapid increase of
imports, and the trade gap in 1969 was over £218 million. The current account
deficit was £22.3 million in 1968 and increased to £69 million in 1969.  In 1970 it
is expected to be around £60 million. These current account deficits have been met by
inflows of direct investment, private and official borrowing abroad and changes
in reserves. The debt service burden is low; the debt service ratio being about
1 -2% of export earnings. Reserves at the end of August were equivalent of about
six months' imports.
Economic Prospects
2.06    The targets of the Third Program of Economic and Social Development
(1969-1972) assume large contributions from new enterprises to the growth of
:1,.astrial production, exports and employment. Incentives will continue to
be used to attract new industry to Ireland. Industrial exports have grown at
an a-erage rate of 18% during the last 10 years.  The competitiveness of Irish
exports could be effected by rising unit wage costs (recently 10% per annum),
especially relative to those of the U. K., which takes nearly 70% of Ireland's
exports. In October the Government announced measures to control inflationary
preosures. Price controls have been strengthened and extended. Public expendi-
ture is to be reduced and a more conservative budgetary financing policy is being
folLowed. The Third Program envisaged fixed investment increasing in real terms
at about 6.5% per annum; in fact, to date the increase has been double this rate
ar.d it is most likely that the estimate will be exceeded as well in the coming
tlfo years.
2.07    Ireland's export-based industry is also closely affected by the pros-
pects of the entry of the U. K. and Ireland into the European Common Market
some time in the 1970's.   The operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area
Agreement, effective from July 1966, will have helped somewhat to condition
Irish industry to the impact of free trade and competition. Under this agree-
ment a wide range of Irish exports had immediate duty-free access to British
markets, while duties on British goods imported into Ireland are being progres-
sively reduced to elimination by 1975. Tariffs on goods imported from the 'U.K.
range between 16%-23% and on those from other countries between 25%-50%.



-3-
Industrial Incentives
2.08      The Government's main instruments since 1952 for the attrac-
tion of foreign enterprises and the expansion of industry have been the
Industrial Development Authority (IDA) and the Grants Board. These two
bodies were amalgamated in 1969. As noted earlier, Ireland had no
options other than creating export industries and given Ireland's small
industrial base, its late start in attracting foreign investment and
severe competition with other nearby countries for attracting investment
(Annex 2), its incentive program had to be liberal and efficiently adminis-
tered. While creation of employment has been an important object of
Ireland's industrial policy, the need to gear industrial development to
export markets has, by necessity, tended to make efficiency rather than
employment the major determinant.  The incentive program, now administered
by IDA, consists of the following potential benefits (see Annex 1 for
details).
(i) Tax exemptioln for 15-20 years on profits earned
on exports;
(ii) Cash grants equivalent to 25%-60% of the capital
costs of new plants;
(iii) Cash grants of 25%-35% on costs of replacing
equipment;
(iv) Miscellaneous grants for training and technical
assistance;
(v) Accelerated depreciation;
(vi) Duty relief on imported inputs used for producing
export goods;
(vii) Since 1969, IDA can also subsidize the interest
paid on bank or ICC loans, although it has not
yet done so; and
(viii) The Shannon Free Airport Development Company
(SFAC) has funds for developing its industrial
area. The Government has provided about £12.3
million to SFAC for grants and loans.
While the incentives have been fundamental to many investors' decisions,
it is also true that some firms find the underlying attractions of
Ireland's geographical position and the availability of labor as per-
suasive factors for investment in Ireland as the incentive scheme.

2.09      The magnitude of the program in recent years is indicated in
the following table:  (E million)

No. of firms                         -     -     -     32   144   229
2.10      Over 500 new industrial projects were set up with the help of
the incentive grants during the 1960's, of which about 350 were sponsored
by foreign firms.   Total grants approved under the various schemes up to
March 31, 1970 were 1, 102.2 million.   The total of new industry and
adaptation grants disbursedduring 1965-1970 was B 40.3 million or about
16p of investment in manufacturing industry during that period.
2.11      The incentive program has undoubtedly been very effective in
bringing about a rapid growth of export-based manufacturing industry,
although it is difficult to quantify the costs and benefits of the scheme.
There was a Survey of Grant Aided Industry carried out by IDA in 1966/1967
which reported on the working of the scheme;  but assisted companies are
not required to submit their accounts or operating financial data for
inspection, and the eventual ability of grant-aided firms to be interna-
tionally competitive tithout subsidization is difficult to examine.
2.12      Certain observations on the operation of the incentive system
are of interest. (i) The domestic value added by many grant-aided firms
is quite low and this, taken together with profit remittances has meant
that the net balance of payments gain is estimated at only about 35%-45%
of export earnings.   This still represents, of course, a significant
gain in absolute terms.   (ii) Irish consumers may not get the full advantage
from the all new export firms because these firms may sell in the domestic
market only if their products substitute for imports.   (iii) Re-equipment
grants have not made a significant impact on competitiveness of the
assisted enterprises because they have been based on simply improving
physical assets and have not influenced managerial and marketing capa-
bilities.
2.13      Because of the above points and the increasing demand for con-
cessions, the Government has been prompted to rethink its policies, and
IDA has become more selective.   Hilgher grants are now given to projects
with high (i) male employment, (ii) value added, (iii) growth potential
and (iv) technological content.   Whereas in the past almost all projects
almost automatically received grants, this is no longer the case.   The
Irish Government and IDA are aware that the incentive system has not been
a precision instrument but a method of achieving increased investment
quickly iqhen other alternatives were not available.   Consequently, (i) the
criteria by Which Government decides the magnitude of resources it
will devote to the incentive scheme and (ii) the criteria for the selection
of firms enjoying the benefits of the incentives have been, necessarily,



quite subjective. The Government is both pleased with the success of the
past industrial effort and cngnizant of its need and ability to become more
selective in its incentive program.
Finance for industry
2.14      Material is lacking for an up-to-date account of the financing
of industry in Ireland, but retained profits, depreciation, privately
subscribed funds and bank overdrafts are the main sources of finance.
Comparatively little recourse has been made to public bond or share issues.
Governmental sources are also important as indicated below: (E million)

2.15      An analysis of 47 grant-aided companies that have received loans
from I5C (ICC's total clients number 266) and their accounts show that of
their total assets of 1 20 million, 24ho  was financed by the pronoters,
21% by grants, 28% by the ICC and 27% by other lenders.   Of the total
loans to these firms of E 11 million, E 7.6 million were medium- and long-
term loans and the ICC's share of these was 74%.   While there is some
overlap in their activities, ICC and IDA work cuite independently.
2.16      In 1966 the commercial banks in Ireland amalgamated into two
main groups:  The Bank of Ireland and the Allied Irish banks.   In
February, 1970, their outstanding loans to industry (mostly for working
capital) totalled E 90 million.   The bank overdraft rate for prime
borrowers is 9-1/2%.
2.17      There are three merchant banks operating in Ireland.  They
provide, among other services, short-term loans and bridging finance,
acceptance credits and advice on mergers.   The extent of their loans to
industry are not knowm, but term loans are unusual.   There are also two
investment banks which provide and organize loan and equity capital. The
commercial banks have also established hire-purchase and equipment leasing
ce-mpanies that provide instalment credit for both consumer and industrial
goods.
2.18      There are 14 insurance companies, including Irish Life Ltd.
the largest, which is a State insurance company.   These companies used
to invest their funds abroad, but agreed with the Government to invest,
by 1977, 80? of their Irish resources within the country.   They make
long-term loans but contribute little to industrial finance, being mainly

interested in commercial building finance and Government securities.
2.19      The Security Market.   About 110 Irish industrial companies
are quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange. Their total paid-up capital is
about £70 million. In 1969 there were only 11 industrial capital issues
amounting to £h.4 million. There were even fewer issues in 1970. There
is very little trading in equities. Good class commercial stocks at
present give dividend yields of about 9%-lO%. Government bond issues are
made annually; the current yield is 9 5<4. The banks are the main buyers
of these issues.
2.20      The Irish capital market reflects structural problems.   On the
demand side, many Irish-owned companies are small family concerns, too
small to raise their requirements by public issue.   Issues of share
capital by well-established companies with growth potential are over-
subscribed.   Other inhibiting factors are the Governmental funds avail-
able for financing industry and the lack of interest of foreign firms in
sharing their equity with Irish investors.   More fundamentally, on the
supply side, the proximity of the London capital market inhibits the
development of the Irish market.   With free monetary movements between
the U.K. and Ireland, Irish investors find the large choice of invest-
ments and their ready marketability in London a strong attraction.
(Irish firms on the other hand are presently blocked from raising capital
in the London market.)
2.21      There are however, factors which could assist the growth of a
capital market.   One is the tendency toward mergers of small industrial
companies into larger units.   Another is the possibility that the
Government's tightening resource position will result in a gradual cur-
tailment of grants for industry relativetothe demand for funds and firms
may find it more necessary to approach the market.   However, the mobili-
zation of substantially increased domestic savings through the local
market remains a long-run prospect.
III.  ICC's ORGANIZATION AND ROLE
Legal Status Objectives and Role
3.01      ICC wCas established by the Industrial Credit Act 1933.   ICC
has wide powers, which are set out in its Memorandum of Association,
enabling it to underwrite capital issues; to provide issuing house
facilities; to provide permanent long-and medium-term capital for
industry, by way of loans and loan guarantees or by direct investment
in shares or securities.   It may lend to public sector enterprises,
but as a matter of policy, has done so only in two exceptional cases.
(See para. 4.21)
3.02      ICC was the first, and until 1960 the predominant, institution
in Ireland providing long-term finance for industry.   It has been the
traditional long-term financier for much of Ireland' s locally-owned
industry and as such has performed a valuable role.   In recent years,
when IDA stepped up its efforts to bring industry to Ireland by offer-
Ing incentives (industry that otherTise probably would not have come),



the overall manufacturing investment levels have grown rapidly.  To
some extent ICC has shared in this investrment boom although in the
main it has concentrated on financing Irish enterprises while IDA has
provided significant capital for the new foreign firms locating in
Ireland.   As investment continues to grow and Government begins to
follow through on its intended policy of being more selective in
giving grants, ICC will continue to play an important role and, given
resources, could even play an increasingly key role in Ireland's
industrialization.   This is explicitly recognized by the Government.
Indeed it is one of the reasons the Government is anxious to see the
Bank support ICC.
Ownership
3.03      The first public issue of ICC shares in 1933 was undervritten
by the Government.  This issue, and two subsequent issues in 1936 and
1952, failed to attract public interest, and the Government now holds
all but 6 642 of the paid-up capital of E 8,830,000.   The Irish banks
were invited in 1966 to take up some of ICC s equity held by the Govern-
ment, but declined, prefering more profitable and readily marketable
securities.
The Board of Directors
3.04      The Chairman and six Members of the Board of ICC (Annex 3) are
nominated by the Minister for Finance.   The Chairman, Dr. J.P. Beddy,
has been associated with ICC since its incorporation.   He has been
Chairman since 1949, and wras also Managing Director until 1969, when the
latter post was discontinued.   Dr. Beddy is a highly respected figure
in Ireland and has done much to establish ICC's autonomy and position.
The six Directors are highly experienced businessmen who take an active
interest in ICC's activities.   They review all financing proposals (with
the exception of small hire-purchase loans) and even review those cases
where the management's recommendation is negative.   There has been no
change in the Board in the last six years.   It meets about twice a month
and the attendance of Directors is regular.   The Directors serve for
nominal remuneration.
Management and Staff
3.05      Mr. Frank Casey, the General Manager, has served with ICC for
over 20 years, the last six years in a managerial capacity.   He wias
appointed General Manager in May 1969 when the post of Managing Director
was discontinued, and has ably filled his present post.   He is profes-
sionally well qualified and experienced.   The two Assistant General
Managers, Mr. L. Heelan and IMLr. J. Ryan, are also well qualified men in
their early 40's.   The Financial Controller is a competent Chartered
Accountant.   The remaining four senior executive staff have good pro-
fessional and academic qualifications.   The professional staff, including
the senior staff mentioned above, numbers 33, and has increased by almost
50% in the Dast two years as a result of increasing business and diversi-
fication of activities. (See Annex 4)



3.06      Salaries and benefits in ICC are slightly better than those of
comparable civil service posts and generally in line with those paid by
commercial employers in Ireland.   Turnover of staff is low;  ICC has
lost three junior staff but no senior staff in the last two yenrs.
3.07      The company is feeling the strain of increased business and
diversification of its operations.   Internal reportirg to the manage-
ment needs strengthening.   The management is aware of this and has
asked the Financial Controller to set up a new system of management
accounting and budgetary controls, and to improve the internal flow of
information.
Organization
3.08      Under the General Manager and two Assistant General Managers,
who form a management committee to approve submissions to the Board,
there are five divisions including those of the Secretary and the Financial
Controller.   (Annex 4).  The two main operational divisions are titled
New Business and Securities.   The first appraises new applications and
negotiates loans and investments up to the stage of Board approval. The
second supervises projects, including disbursement, after Board approval,
and also handles applications for "repeat" business.  Machinery Finance
(hire-purchase and equipment leasing) is handled in a separate division.
There is a separate Legal Department with two solicitors.   ICC also has
a public relations man who travels for the company explaining its policies
and procedures to prospective clients.
3.09      Shipping finance and mergers are handled by ICC's staff through
two wholly-owned subsidiary companies.   A third subsidiary, Irish Film
Finance Corporation Ltd., has been inactive for some years.   These sub-
sidiaries were formed partly because their business is outside ICC's
normal operations, and partly for tax reasons.
3.10      A Branch Office was opened in Cork in November 1969 to deal with
ICC's business in the South and    southwest of Ireland.   It has at
present an executive staff of two and has had about T 400,000 of business
approved.   This level does not justify a separate office, but ICC expects
business out of this area to increase significantly.
Resources
3.11      ICC has historically depended on Government loans for the major
part of its resources.   As of October 31, 1970 it had the following
resources (see Annex 5 for details):



-9-
(£ million)     % of Total
Share capital                     8.8            34
Reserves                          1.1             4
Loan from Irish banks             1.8             7
Government loans                 13.5            52
Deposits                          1.0             3
Total_/              -26'             100
3.12      ICC's resource position has been tight since 1968.  During the past
two years ICC's disbursements exceeded the loans made available to ICC annually
by the Government (see para. 3.13), by approximately £1.0 million. Upon ICC's
request, the Government agreed to make supplementary loans for this amount.  At
October 31, 1970, ICC's outstanding portfolio and undisbursed commitments exceed-
ed the total resources available by almost £2.0 million. The annual budget
allocation by the Government for loans is made on April 1; the amount is based
on ICC's forecast disbursements for the year. ICC continues to make commitments,
_in anticipation of a new budget allocation, even if it no longer has uncommitted
funds at its disposal.  If the actual amount of the budget al'location turns out
to be less than anticipated by ICC, as has been the case in the past two years,
ICCts management decides how and to what extent it will be necessary to cut back
on the group's operations. While it is quite common for ICC to be in a deficit
commitment position prior to announcements of new Government loan allocations,
ICC's internal cash generation (about £3 million annually) provides the company
vnth a considerable cushion so that it could adjust its commitment levels to be
able to meet disbursements should Government funds be unexpectedly decreased
..gnificantly. No definite priorities are set between the various activities of
ICC but in the past two years restrictions were imposed on machinery finance in
view of ICC's tight resource position.
".13      Although the Government loans are repayable the question of time and
method had not been fixed on the loans used for ICC's industrial operations.
TC' is informed of the interest rate at the time of each drawing. Between 1960
and 1967, the rate charged was 0.5% above the Exchequer lending rate; since 1967
the rate has been set at the current yield on the latest National Loan (now 9.5%).
The weighted average cost of these funds is now about 7.0%. The question of fix-
ing the repayment terms on these funds was discussed with ICC and the Government.
0      The Government has decided that the loans will be repayable in 20 years (from 1971),
including five years of grace. The interest payable will be 7%.
3.14      The £1.8 million loan from the Irish banks, guaranteed by the Government
was made in 1958. The loan is repayable between 1970-1990 but no repayment sched-
ule has been fixed.  The Government has undertaken that should the Irish banks call
for repayment of this loan in such a way as to present a cash flow problem for ICC,
it (the Government) will provide ICC with additional credit to allow ICC to ful-
fill its obligations. The interest rate on this loan is 8-1/h%. Since 1969 ICC
has begun to increase its resources by accepting deposits, which are guaranteed by
1/ In addition, ICC has a short-term bank overdraft facility in Ireland with a
limit of £500,000. Also, ICC associates with Kleinwort Benson Ltd., merchant
bankers of London, who provide an unsecured revolving acceptance credit of
,500,000, mainly for financing hire-purchase transactions.  ICCts drafts are
discounted on the London market at a commission of 1/4% on each 90-day draft.
This credit is renewable once a year. These two sources are excluded from
the resource table since they are used only for temporary purposes and are
reduced each year to nil at March 31.

Government. These deposits reached El,028 as of October 31, 1970.  Interest of
6-1/4% is paid on one month deposits, rising to 7-3/4% for nine month deposits.
Special quotations are given for deposits in excess of B10,000. The rate current-
ly quoted on three months' deposits in this category is between 8-1/2% and 9%.
Most of ICC's deposits are in the three month range. They are used for the early
maturities of its machinery finance loans.
3.15   ICC states that raising additional funds in the Irish capital market is
not feasible at the present time, because of the limited size of the Irish market
and the high cost of such borrowing. During the past three yeas, ICC has also
attempted to borrow in the principal European capital markets2f.  In 1968, the
General Manager visited Germany and Belgium to explore the possibilities of rais-
ing a long-term loan. ICC executives also visited England frequently for the
same purpose. These efforts were so far unsuccessful. In the spring of 1970, the
General Manager visited three banking groups in Switzerland. One group indicated
its willingness to extend a three-year loan to ICC.  The amount will be between
£500,000 to £1,000,000 and the terms are under negotiation. If the loan is con-
cluded, ICC intends to use it for hire-purchase and leasing operations.  ICC is
c.entinuing to explore the possibilities of raising money abroad.
Financial Policies
3.16   While ICC has no written policies concerning financial prudence in regard
to investment and portfolio management, its operational policies, built up over
35 years, are appropriate and in line with those followed by most development
finance companies. For example, ICC normally limits its equity holding in a
single firm to 10% of the firm's equity. It holds its aggregate equity portfolio
well below its own net worth.  The largest commitment ever made to a single firm
was equivalent to about 15% of ICC's net worth. Histoiically it has followed a
conservative dividend policy, generally wishing to plough back earnings.
ICC and the Government
3.17   As its sponsor, the Government is proud of ICC's record.  It did not
originally intend to own and finance it as completely as it does now, and, it
emphasizes the intention that ICC should be independent by making it pay a
conmercial price for its money, interest on advances, dividends on equity, if
earned and adequately covered, and tax.  ICCfs Board and management guard their
autonomy and hold the Government, so far as possible, at arms length. The
G0cvernment does not try to influence the day to day management and investment
decisions of ICC. ICC has, for example, resisted suggestions by Government that
ICC should provide its own funds for "rescue" operations which ICC does not approve.
3.18   The Government has used ICC to act on its behalf for a number of specific
jcbs.  For example, ICC manages, for a fee of £5,000 a year, a state finance
comlpany, Taisci Stait Teoranta.  Taisci is essentially a fund used by the Govern-
ment to finance companies whose operations the Government considers to be of
particular interest to the country but which are unable to raise sufficient
capital on commercial terms. The task of managing Taisci,which consists of
administering of the loans, creates relatively little work for ICC. (ICC claims
that the fee covers its costs) nor does it involve ICC in conflicts with the
Government because decisions are taken by the latter and ICC is only concerned
with the bookkeeping. Taisci may be reorganized into a more aggressive operation
in which case ICC's fees will be increased.
2/  There is some question as to whether ICC, under the Industrial Credit Act
of 1933 is allowed to raise funds outside Ireland. Government has proposed
legislation to clarify this matter.

1969-70 (2 years)      0.3             10.4        10.7
4.01      Since 1958, when its capital was increased, both the volume and
the rarp of the ICG Group's operations have grown rapidly. It continued
to underwrite capital issues (I 11 million in the last 12 years); its
direct financing, mostly by loans, has amounted to over L 45 million dur-
ing this period.
4.02      At the same time ICC diversified its activities to include
finance for hire-purchase and leasing of equipment, for shipping and
distributive trades, for the film industry and for special loans to
under-capitalized industries. ICC also now provides advice on mergers
and takeovers and other advisory services for industries. ICC has been
pragmatic; when needs for special financing services are identified, ICC
has shown initiative in moving into new areas of activity.
4.03      After the minor recession of 1966, ICC's performance gathered
momentum and commitments for industrial_/finance ixreased by 36%, 42%
and 58% in each of fiscals 1967, 1968 and 1969. Details on ICC's recent
operations are given in Annex S. The following table summarizes ICC's
commitments during the 1965-1970 period.

Term Loans
4.04       Term loans, including shipping finance, row form 66% of ICC's
portfolio. Torms range from 7 to 20 years. Grace periods are nu*r-lly
two to three years (exceptionally up to six years). Interest rates
vary according to the term of the loan:  10% up to seven years, 10-1/2%
from 7 to 15 years and 11% over 15 years. ICC normally requires a first
mortgage debenture charge on assets. ICC has recently become more active
in obtaining conversion options on some of its loans. Hcwever, ICC has
so far exercised its conversion rights in only three cases. As to size,
there are no formal limits; ICC has made loans for a few hundred pounds,
but it does not normally undertake loans over b 300,000. It has some-
times invited other institutions to participate when larger sums are
required. In six cases the total of several loans made to the same
cAnpany greatly exceeds this ameunt (the largest commitment, including
an eqaity investment, to a single firm is L l.  million representing 15%
of ICC's net worth, and the next largesit L 500,000) but only 28 of ICC's
266 outstanding te-rm loans are for more than L lC,C,OW and only eight for
more than 15 years. Eighty-one percent of approvals (by number) of term
loans (including distrilbution loans) in 1970 were for less than I 50,0C0
and 20% were for less than 1E 5,000. The size distribution of IDOCts
approvals is given in Annex 7.
h.05       ICC is aware of the relatively high cost of these small opera-
tions but considers that the financing of small or medium sized industries
with growth potential one of its important functions.  ICC's financing of
new industries increased from about 15% of its loan approvals by amount
(excluding shipping) in 1967 to 28% in 1969.
V~iuit7 Izmest?rments
4.06       ICC's paid-up equity investments amounted on OctTher 31, I?70  to
E 3.c' million.  They consist in about equal proportions, of quoted and
unquoted securities.  Equity investmerts hare not figured prominently in
ICC's recent business.  During 1967-1970 ICC made only six direct equity
investments amountig to 6 713,COO. Am noted earlier, ICC normally holds no more
than 1'% of a client company's equity.. However, in three companies, ICC



- 13 -
now holds the majority shares (Galway Textiles 100%, Sandersons Newbridge
Ltd., 66% and B. Wood & Sons 60%. The first case is a company that is in
receivership with ICC being the receiver. The other two companies are
to be publicly floated and ICC will thereby reduce its position con-
siderably.) l4hen possible ICC turns over its portfolio by public sale.
Over the past six years, approximately :LO% of its equity portfolio has
been sold annually. Because ICC may wish to provide additional finance
to these companies, which are technical:Ly "Government" owned, a maximum
of 15% of the proposed loan can be used by ICC for non-private concerns.
Machinery Finance
4.07   Hire-purchase and leasing, started by ICC in 1962, form 16%
of ICC's industrial portfolio, but has grown in importance in the last
three years. It is now showing signs of levelling off and ICC does not
expect the past rate of growth to be maintained because of increasing com-
petition from other finance companies.  Machinery finance is not available
for new companies and it is only provided for new machinery.  Hire-
purchase loans are for periods of two to five years; loans are made for
up to 75% of the cash price of new equipment. The size of these loans
ranges between £ 200 and £ 100,000. Leasing arrangements generally cover
five years. For both services ICC charges an effective interest of
10-1/2%, Although the average size of each contract is small the work
involved in appraisal is generally less than for term loans. The manage-
ment is authorized to approve contracts involving £ 10,000 or less. For
these contracts, decisions are taken on the basis of commercial credit-
worthiness. Applications between £10,000 to £50,000 are subject to
approval by the Chairman and those above £ 50,000, by the Board.  For
the latter, a more detailed appraisal of the company, along the lines of
those made for term loans, is required.
Distribution Finance
4.08   In 1968 ICC began financing wholesalers and retailers, who have
been in business for at least five years, and who show a profitable
record.  Finance is given for such purposes as acquisition of premises,
shop and warehouse equipment, forklift trucks and vehicles.  ICC regards
this business as an important indirect service to industry, although it
forms a comparatively small part of ICC's activities so far. At the end of
fiscal 1970 only £ 173,000 of disbursed funds related to distribution loans.
Shipping Finance Corporation Ltd. (SFC)
4.09   SFC, a wholly-owned subsidiary (with a paid-in share capital
of £ 100) was formed in 1961 to provide loans to purchasers of ships
built in the Verolme (Cork) Dockyardi!. During 1967-1970, SFC has been
active, committing £7e1 million. SFC may lend up to 80% of the cost of
vessels, for between eight to ten years and takes a first charge on the
vessel. (SF0 normally finances only about 55% of the cost.) SFC borrows from
ICC at its current rate of 10-1/2% to 11%, and receives from the Government
1/ The Government pays the dockyard a subsidy amounting to 8% of the
cost of construction. This is decreasing and may soon be entirely
unnecessary because of improved efficiency.



- 14 -
an interest subsidy which enables it to lend to the purchaser at a concession-
ary rate, at present 6-1/2%. The loans to ICC are repaid to the Government as
they are collected from the ship o=ners. SFC makes an independent appraisal
of its borrowers; who are normally foreign shipping concerns.
Finance for Under-Capitalized Concerns
4.10       In 1969 ICC initiated a program for small or medium sized
firms that could not obtain additional share or loan capital on normal
terms.  Applicants who can show a satisfactory record, background and
prospects, qualify for two-tier loans, one on commercial and the other on
special terms (i.e. grace periods of up to seven years and deferment of
interest up to three years). The loans normally carry conversion rights.
This is a new activity, and so far only three loans have been approved;
no applications are pending.
Mergers Limited
4.11       In the early years of ICC very few industrial mergers took
place as the number of industrial conceirns in the country were few. In
the late 1960's, with the prospect of freer trade and of entry into the
EEC, the trend towards mergers and takeovers increased. Consequently,
ICC decided in 1969 to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary (capital of
I6 100) to specialize in this business. The Board consists of the Chairman
and General Manager of ICC, a Director of Kleinwort Benson, London, and
an Assistant Managing Director of A. Guinness & Son, Co., Dublin. The
services provided consist of the identification of firms which might
benefit from a merger, introduction of such firms to suitable partners,
valuation of the shares of the parties, assistance with the mechanics of
the merger, and arrangements for finance, if necessary.
14.12      The company has succeeded in bringing about nine mergers.  It
has given advice in six cases where mergers did not result, and is cur-
rently advising 17 Irish companies on merger proposals. There is no
( doubt that its work is usoful in the context of the Irish economy. The
0           accounts for 1969 showed a small loss but not all relevant revenues were
included on an accrual basis.      A profit was made on the operntion
in 1970. ICC claims that mergers prov:ide additional benefits in that the
larger combinations cften apply to ICC for term loans; 1 500,000 has so
far been lent to merged companies. Mergers Limited occupies three full-time
prefessif=aa3-s   and on occasion absorbs a good deal of the General
Manager's time.
The Irish Film Finance Corporation Ltd. (IFFC)
4.13       IFFC, another wholly-owned subsidiary, was formed in 1960,
but is now inactive. In the early 1960 s it provided capital amounting
to L 386,000 for 15 films produced in the Ardmore Studios. Some of these
films were successful, but more incurred substantial losses. IFFC has
done no new business for some years; the loans oustanding on the books,
after writing off E 312,000, are I, 15,000. ICC contemplates winding up
the company.

Underwriting and Issuing House Facilities
4.14       Underwriting has become of less importance relative to term
lending in the last ten years although, until the last two years when the
market for new issues, was very poor, ICC's business in this field also
grew.  ICC advises on the timing of capital issues, prepares and cir-
culates prospectuses and provides other issuing house services, including
bridging finance when necessary. There have been 140 capital issues by
industrial companies in Ireland since 1933, The total capital raised
being £42 million. ICC underwrote 71 of these issues. ICC charges a fee
of 1-1/2%-3% depending upon the risk involved in the underwriting.
Sectoral Distribution of Loans and Investments
4.15       ICC's portfolio is well diversified among industrial sectors;
but the exposure in the textiles industry, although decreasing, is still
substantial: £3.4 million or 24.7% of investment fundsl/ at the end of
1969 compared with 35% in 1967. (Annex i3)
Geographic Distribution
4.16       The geographic distribution of ICC's portfolio (excluding
ship finance) suggests that its assistance, like Irish industry as a
whole, is concentrated in the countries of Dublin and Cork. (See Annex
9). The two provinces, Leinster and MIunster, of which Dublin and Cork
counties form part, account for the bulk of industrial activity2/.
These areas accounted for over 80% of ICC('s disbursed funds at the end of
1969, while firms in these areas at5counted for 92% of total industrial
output in that year. ICC has attempted to broaden the geographic basis
of its assistance into less developed areas of the country, but the need
for its finance by new and expanding industries in those areas, the so-
called "designated" areas, has so far been limited. ICC is confident
that the o)pening of its branch office in Cork, which will cater for
business in the south and southwest of Ireland, can contribute to a more
balanced geographic distribution of its portfolio.
Qaality of Appraisals
4.17       ICC's appraisal reports are brief and emphasize the client's
management, capital structure, trading and financial record, market
end the cover for the loan and the securiLty.  However, there is little
explicit analysis of the technic-a  aspects of projects financed and
their international competitiveness.   For a commercial company
making relatively small loans to existing) enterprises this procedure
may be adequate.   Moreover, in a small c:ountry like Ireland, most
businessmen, including the experienced Board of ICC, are familiar with
I/  Excluding loans outstanding by Shipping Finance Corporation of
- £4.7 million or 25.4% of outstanding funds of the ICC Group as a
whole, as compared to 18.5% for textiles.
2/ Almost 55% of Ireland's working population in 1966 was concentrated
irn these two provinces,



- 16 -
the business and croditworthiness ef many of ICONs borrAwors, particu-
larly in those casss where ICC has been lending to the enterprise over
some period of time. The main deficiency, for this type of loan is an
explicit analysis of the borrowers viability vis-a-ris foreign competi-
tors. However, for larger loans, representing significant capacity
increases, this type of appraisal is not enough and ICC needs to deepen
its analytical work on such projects. ICC occasionally employs consult-
ants and retains an architect to report on site and factory building
matters when necessary, but its review of' engineering aspects is norm.ally
thin.
4.18       ICC has been informed of the areas in which its appraisal
work should be improved, namely more analysis of the technical aspects
of its larger projects and an explicit analysis of the international
competitiveness of the projects financed.    The management of ICC
feels that there would be no difficulty in doing so and ICC intends to
strengthen its work in these areas.
Portfolio Sip23rvision
4.19       ICC's end-use supervision also needs upgrading.  Reporting
requirements are generally prescribed in the loan agreements but many
borrowers either ignore the requirements or submit reports irregularly.
Because of a shortage of staff, factory visits have been infrequent.
During 1969 only 27 projects were visited, about 10% of the active loans
in ICC's portfolio. These visits will be increased now that the
Securities Division has more staff and ICC is in the process of improving
its reporting requirements and the handling of the data submitted by
clients.  Factory visit reports which the mission saw were detailed and
of good quality. ICC has been provided by the Bank with some examples
of progress reports used by other DFC's at its request.
Profitability and Financial Position (Anaexes 10, 11and 12)
4.20       Earnings Performance.  ICC has not been a profitable invest-
ment for the Governuent in terms of its return on net worth. In 1958,
the paid-in share capital of ICC was increased to its present level of
; 8.83 million.  Accumulated retained earnings were only £1.1 million at
the end of 1970; i.e., the effective discounted annual yield on the
company's share capital over this 12 year period was less than 1% per
annum. ICC paid no dividends in 1958-1968, but resumed its dividend
payment (at 2-1/2%) in 1969. The highest! dividend paid prior to 1958
was 5%.



- 17 --
4.21       Various factors have contributed to ICCIs low profit per-
fermance. Firstly, ICC has been operating with a very narrow spread
on its borrowed resources. The gross spread between the average cost
of capital and average lending rate on its principal resources (Govern-
ment loans) has been abont 1%. At present, ICC is paying interest at
9-1/2% on recent Government loans while charging its borrowers rates
ranging between 10% and 11%. Secondly, ICC has incurred substantial
losses on both the loan and equity portiLons of its portfolio. Apart
from the losses on the projects appraised by itself, ICC's profitability
has also been adversely affected by its making loans and euity invest-
ments totalling E 4.7 million to two projects in 1958 namely: Industrial
Engineering Co., Ltd. and Verolme Cork I)ockyard, Ltd. These projects
were not appraised by ICC but the Government used ICC as an intermediary
to finance them. The Government provided non-interest bearing advances
to the extent of L 2.2 million for these two projects, but ICC had to
invest from its other resources the balance of E 2.5 million.  ICC did
not receive any interest payments on these loans. They were finally
transferred from ICC to the Government iLn 1968 and since that time
Taisci (para. 3.] ) is used for such operations. Had ICC's capital not
been tied up in these projects but profiLtably employed for viable projects,
its annual profit would have been at least L 150,000 - L 250,000 higher.
Thirdly, during the past five years, more than 20% of ICC's loan and
equity portfolio (not including the loanis to Industrial Engineering
Company and Verolme Cork Dockyard, Ltd.) which had been invested in com-
panies experiencing financial difficulties did not yield any income.
(Accrual of interest is discontinued aflter the interest payment has
been overdue for a period of six months.) Fourthly, only in the past
four years has a detailed review of portfolio, provisions fcr losses
and actual write-offs been made.  This means that some losses which
should have been written off in previous years were charged to the income
of the past four years. As a result, ollt of the earnings (before taxes
and provisions) during this period totaLling E 1,620,000 a sum of
L 1454,000 or 90% has either been set aside to provide for sure losses
or written off. Ratios of ICC's financ:Lal record during the past five
years are given in Annex 1212.
4.22       In some respects ICC can be applauded for taking risks; how-
ever, if the company had been making sound appraisals the risks that
paid off should have more effectively counter-balanced those that did
not, thereby leaving ICC in a somewhat more favorable earnings position.
It is true that the loans that have caused problems have been very few
in number, relative to ICC's overall operations, but large in size. In
fact 90% of the losses incurred to date relate to only three projects.
1/ ICC is subject to normal corporate taxes which run about 35-h5%
of earnings before tax and after provisions.



- 18 -
I.23       In the last four years or so, ICC,s e4quity portfolio has not
been a source of substantial profits. The average dividenlincome has
been 5.5% but capital gains have been small (£ 208,000 in 10 years).
In fact, write-offs of equities have actuaLLy exceeded capital gains
during the last four years.
h.24       The cxmpany's administrative budget, given the rather small-
loan nature sf its operations, does not appeaar unreasonabl.e. These
expenses now total about £ 220,000 per annum, which for an organization
supporting a professional staff of 33 personss is jEtified. These
expenses have, however, increased 70% in the last twn years as the staff
has been expanded by 11 professionals. The current administrative
expense/total asset ratio is about 1%.
4.25       Financial Pusition and Portfolio Quality.  ICG has been char-
acterized by low gear;ng mf its equity (the debt equity ratio has
been constant at about 1:1 in recent years), seemingly low liquidity
(cash and temporary investments are nil), and little net growth in total
assets in the past five years. Concerning the seemingly low liquidity,
the company uses o-verdraft lines of £ 1.0 million and the undisbursed
portions (at present g 5.2 million) of its Government loans as liquidity
reserves. With respect to asset growth, more growth would have been
registered in the last few years except, as mentioned abcve, that £ 4.7 mil-
lion was taken out of its portfolio and transferred to the Government in
1968.
4,.26      ICC's portfolio at Ontober 31, 1970 consisted of about 270 termloans,
including shipping and distribution loans, amounting to £ 13.9 million
after provisions; equity investments in 47 companies amounting to
£ 3.6 million after provisions, and several hundred machinery finance
contracts amounting to £,3. 5million. There are 16 projects exper-
iencing difficult repayment problems, Loans outstanding on these pro-
jects total £ 1.4 million or 9% of ICC's loan portfolio. Provisions of
Z 2[0,000 have been set aside for these projects. The major part of
the loans in arrears (80%) relates to four projects.  A review of these
projects indicates that after a reasonable valuation of the security ICC
has on these companies, there was a deficiency in provisions of about
£ 155,000 as of July 31, 1970.
4.27       Concerning ICC's equity portfoli.o, out of a total of £ 3.9
million (cost), £ 1.7 million is in quoted shares, the market price of
which was £ 1.33 million as of July 31, 19710. The balance, £ 2.2 million,
was in unquoted shares and a oompany by company valuation of those
shares indicates that they are presently worth about S 135,000 less than
ICC's acquisition cost of these shares. Therefore, ICC's equity port-
foliowas overstated by about £ 500,000, while provisions for equity loees
are S£ 275,C00, leaving a deficiency in provisions of about £225,CCM as
far as the equity portfolio is concerned. There are no siglificant un-
realized hidden gains in the unquoted equity portfolio, although the
Irish market now is very low and should it again start to rise the picture
would improve somewhat.



- 19 -
4.28      At the end of its most recent fiscal year (October 31, 1970), ICC
made additional write-offs and provisions of £270,000 and will at the end of
its current fiscal year make additional provisions to more than cover the
possible losses of £380,000 mentioned above.
V. BUSINESS FORECASTS
General
5.01      The Third Program of Economic and Social Development for 1969-1972
envisaged that fixed investments in manufacturing industry would increase at
about 13% per year.  In the past three years investments almost doubled; in
1969 investment in manufacturing grew by about 25% to an estimated £75 million.
It is reasonable to assume that, despite anti-inflationary measures recently
announced by the Government, manufacturing investments will increase at about
13% per year in the next two years.  If so, investment in manufacturing indus-
try will have increased in 1972 to an arnual rate of just over £95 million.
ICC's Forecasts
5.02      ICC's share in total manufacturing investment (on a disbursement
basis) has averaged about 6% in recent years. Forecasts of ICC's approvalsg
commitments and disbursements in the next five years have been made (Annex 11)
in the light of the project applications in the pipeline as of October 31, 1970
(the industrial loan pipeline was about £2.7 million at that point), ICC s
actual commitments in the past three years, taking into consideration the
impact of the cement strike and bank strike during 1970, and the estimated
manufacturing investment in the future. ICC's projected commitments are
summarized in the following table. They would result in disbursements, equiva-
lent to about 6% of projected manufacturing investment, the relative level
achieved by ICC in the last few years.

5.03      Barring any unforeseen events such as labor trouble, drastic
curtailment of investments by industries as a result of the new prices and
incomes policy, or increased taxes as a result of the October 1970 supple-
mentary Budget, it is reasonable to expect that the above projected volume
of operations will be achieved. ICC's commitments in the calendar years
1971 and 1972 would total £20.1 million or $48.3 million equivalent.
5.04      ICC will use the proceeds of the Bank loan for its long-term indus-
trial loan and equity business. Shipping loans and its shorter term lending
activities will be funded from other sources.



-20-
- 05    Since the Irish pound is freely convertible within the sterling area, ICC
has not identified the foreign exchange component of its operations.  Examination
of a representative sample of industrial projects showed that approximately 56%
of ICC's commitments for industrial term loans and equity investments represent
identifiable foreign exchange expenditures, and thus ICC's "foreign exchange"
requirements for the two calendar years 1971 and 1972 would bez5.1 million or US$
12.3 million equivalent.i/
Resource Availabilities
5.o6    As of October 31, 1970, the close of ICC's past financial year, ICC's
total commitments had exceeded its total resource availabilities by approximately
. 2 million. ICC has estimated that receipts from loan repayments and portfolio
sales in the 26 months, November 1970 - December 1972, and retained earnings will
*      amount to about £. 9.14 million.  In addition, ICC expects to receive £ 1.5 mil-
lion from a net increase of term deposits, a reasonable assumption in the light
of actual funds received since the scheme began in 1969. Given this, ICC will
have a remaining gap of Z 13.44 million (or $32.3 million equivalent) in its
total resource requirements to cover the 26 month commitments through December
1972. ICC will continue to receive budget allocations from the Government: one
in April 1971 and another in April 1972. The size of these loans is uncertain
as the Government has made no commitment on this matter. From the best estimates
available, however, the Government would provide between £ 3 and £F 4 million in
each budget and thus the total resource gap of ICC through the end of CY 1972
would be £ 5.44 million ($13.1 million equivalent) to £ 7.44 million ($17.9 mil-
lion equivalent). A Bank loan of $10 million would cover the bulk of the for-
eign exchange portion of ICC's commitments on industrial term lending and equity
investments during CY 1971 and 1972. If the Government makes an allocation of
£ 4 million a year, ICC's resource gap, after the proposed Bank loan is made,
will be met by the loan which ICC is negotiating with a bank in Switzerland.
Otherwise, ICC will have to mobilize fresh resources elsewhere in the next two
years.
_      5.07    Projected Profitability and Financial Position.   Projected consolidated in-
W      come statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for the fiscal years
1971 through 1975, together with the financial ratios and the underlying as-
sumptions for making the projections, are included in Annexes 14-18.   ICC's
profits before provisions and taxes are expected to grow from £ 785,000 (7.8% of
average net worth) in FY 1971 to £ 1,211,000 (11.1% of average net worth) in 1973
and to £ 1,706,000 (13.8% of average net worth) in 1975.   However, profits
after provisions and taxes expressed as a percentage of average net worth will
remain between 4.l% and 8.3% in the projected 5-year period.    After provi-
sions have been made for 1970, the potential losses on equity portfolio would
1/ The proposed loan should be available for financing only foreign
exchange expenditure, including a fixed percentage (70%) of off-the-
shelf imported items and 35% of construction costs, which is below
the actual import content of normal factory construction costs in
Ireland.



- 21 -
stLl' exceed pro-isions by £1.10,000 but the book value of ICCIs loan port-
folio would have been brought in line with its real worth.  ICC intends to
make provisions as rapidly as possible to cover the equity portfolio loss
and to build up provisions until the cumulative provisions amount to 3% of
the term loan and equity portfolio. On the -whole, the projected profit-
ability is a remark,able improvement over ICC's pa3t performance. ICC intends
to maintain a 2.5%o dividend on its shares; the pay-out ratio would decline
from 31% in FY 1971 to 14% in FY 1975.  ICC has no plan to increase its share
capital during the forecast period.  Alninistrative expenses, while increas-
ing at an average of 17% per annum in absolute terns, remain at about 1% of
average total assets.
5.o8      ICkCs debt service position will remain satisfactory during the
entire period of the proposed Bank loan. The Government has also agreed to
take the foreign exchange risk on the proposed loan, at no charge to ICC.
This will be done by adjusting the interest payable on Government loans to
an amount that compensates for any foreign exchange gain or loss ICC might
encounter. In Ireland sub-borrowers would be reluctant to assume the foreign
exchange risk involved in a Bank loan; hence the need for a special arrange-
ment to cover the risk.
5.09      On the basis of the projected volume of operations, ICC's total
assets would increase from £22.2 million at the end of FY 1970 to £54.6
million at the end of 1975. The loan and equity portfolio, before provisions,
is estimated to increase from £21.7 million in FY 1970 to £53.6 million in
FY 1975, and total long term debt outstanding is expected to grow from £.8 million
in FY 1970 to £35.8 million in FY 1975. The total long-term debt (including
guarantees) to equity is projected to increase from 1:1 in FY 1970 to 2.8:1
in FY 1975. A debt equity ratio of 3:1, which is proposed for this loan,
would allow sufficient leeway for ICC to expand its operations while maintain-
ing a reasonable level of indebtedness. Provisions for losses are estimated
to amolmt to £726,000 at the end of FY 1970, £1,026;0oo at the end of FY 1972
and £l.48 million at the end of FY 1975.  As a percentage of ICC's total loan
and equity portfolio the provisions will be 3.3% in FY 1970, 3.1% in FY 1972
and 2.8% in FY 1975. If reserves are added to the provisions, they will
amount to 8.4% of the total partfolio in Fr 1970, 8,2% in FY 1972, and 9.8% in
FY 1975. The book value of ICC's shares increases toll9% in 1972 and 143%
in 1975.
VI.  CONCLUSIONS AEND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      ICC, since its beginning in 1933, has made a steady contribution
to the development of Irish manufacturing industry, through term loans and
equity investments.  Also, by underwriting new issues and assisting mergers,
it has helped in the development of an Irish capital market.
6.02      Although with the establishmennt and development of other means of
financing new and large scale industry, ICC's function as the main provider
of finance for industry has been somewhat diminished, it has shown vitality
by adapting itself successfully to supplementary activities, e.g., hire-
purchase and leasing, finance for distributive trades, shipping finance,
finance for under-capitalized industriels and merger business. These have
inevitably resulted in some diffusion cf its operative strength.



- 22 -
6.03      ICC continues to be the main supplier, with little competition,
of a widening resource gap for industry,, i.e., medium- and long-term loans
to existing Irish industry, for expansion and re-equipment.  In this respect
its importance is expected to increase, and if, as is possible, there is
some curtailment of the Government's grant schemes, ICC's function of
financing new industries will increase.
6.04      Although owned and largely financed by the Government, ICC has,
with few exceptions, preserved its independence of operation. It has,
however, operated at a low level of profits as a few large losses have
absorbed earnings.
6.05      The company's basic staff is competent but its appraisals lack
technical and economic examination in depth, and its reporting and super-
vision of projects require strengthening. ICC's management intends to up-
grade its work in these areas.
6.06      ICC's initial free limit should be $100,000 equivalent, with an
aggregate limit for "?B" projects amounting to 35% of the proposed loan
amount. This would mean that ICC would be submitting about 20 projects
to the Bank each year for approval.
6.07      ICC's forecasts show a total resource gap in the calendar year
1971 and 1972 amounting to $13.1- $17.9 million equivalent. A Bank loan
of $10 million would cover the bulk of the foreign exchange portion of
ICC's commitments on industrial term lending and equity investments dur-
ing these two years.
6.08      The loan will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of
sub-projects including:
(i) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported goods
and services;
(ii) 70% of the invoice price of imported goods
purchased from domestic suppliers;
(iii) 35% of factory constraction costs, which is
below the estimated foreign exchange component
of such expenditures.
6.09     ICC may also use 15% of the loan to finance non-private concerns
as noted in paragraph 4.06.  The other conditions of the loan are those
normally applied to development finance company loans.
