Key lessons stress the need for high level\n            government commitments towards both technical progress, and\n            resource mobilization and allocation, to be facilitated\n            through project design, and management arrangements. Such\n            facilitation should also prod the integration of project\n            activities into the routine work programs of local\n            governments, essential in achieving the impact, and\n            sustainability of project achievements. However,\n            projects' fund transfers should be used as incentives\n            for structural reform in health services, and gains in line\n            with national policy, and local needs, rather than\n            prioritizing on health infrastructure investments as many\n            local governments do, hampering the importance of system\n            reform, capacity building, and service quality, and\n            affordability. Moreover, the constraints of human resources\n            in rural health reform remain critical, thus a focused\n            sector work for human resources development is needed,\n            including an adjustment of the roles of public, and private\n            sector. Further improvements are needed in the areas of\n            project financing; policy and planning as part of project\n            design; and, in the uses of technical assistance,\n            procurement of equipment, and, in balancing population\n            coverage with supervisory support."}, "docdt": "2001-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
