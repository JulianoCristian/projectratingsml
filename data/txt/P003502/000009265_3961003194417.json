      the quality of rural health manpower, thereby contributing\n            to better quality health services and an improved health\n            status of the rural poor in the six provinces. The project\n            has three province-specific components and one central\n            component. The Health Workers Planning component will\n            strengthen the planning capability at the national,\n            provincial and local levels. This component will define the\n            tasks to be done to solve health problems and will identify\n            the demand, the requirements and the utilization for all\n            health worker categories. The Health Workers Training\n            component will retrain large numbers of minimally trained\n            rural health workers, train additional workers for\n            underserved areas, and strengthen the training capability at\n            the provincial, prefectural and county levels. Technical\n            assistance will be provided for developing and implementing\n            community oriented curricula, new teaching and learning\n            methods, teacher training in pedagogy, integration of theory\n            and practice, and evaluation of changes and innovations. The\n            Rural Health Services Management component will improve the\n            working conditions of rural health workers, develop\n            alternative means for mobilizing financial resources to\n            support rural health care delivery, for organizing and\n            managing rural health services, and for compensating and\n            stimulating rural health workers to emphasize preventive\n            care; and provide support systems for supervising these\n            workers effectively. A small Central Component will augment\n            the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Public Health\n            (MOPH) for coordinating and supporting project\n            implementation activities. It will strengthen MOPH's\n            capability to carry out its national mandate in planning and\n            policy formulation, provide technical assistance to the\n            project provinces, and evaluate project activities in order\n            to disseminate the experience gained to the rest of the country."}, "docdt": "1993-07-12T00:00:00Z"}
