1.6. Activities prior and during construction stage - Means for transportation of
materials, equipment and machinery to the site
        a/ Main works of the project prior and during construction stage:
        - Carry out compensation, site clearance.
        - Handling over construction site, set up camps
        - Mobilization of materials, equipment and workforce to construction site
       - Level the surface, building access road.

 VI. Community Consultation and Infonnation Disclosure

 VI.l. Procedure, process and contents of public participation and consultation and
 information disclosure:
      In the stage of project preparation (2010), CREB has carried out the following
      activities:
      - Activity number 1: Information supply and discussion with Local Authorities about
 line route direction.
      - Activity number 2: Check and make inventory of the impact and number of affected
      households.
      - Activity number 3: Contact with project affected households (P AHs)
      When the investigation is completed, the CREB will cooperate with the
representatives of communes, villages and hamlets (in project areas) to hold meeting with
households whose assets are affected by project. During these meetings, the CREB's staff
will present these following contents: Summary of project, draft of resettlement plan
(plan of compensation and resettlement), draft of EMP (Environmental management
Plan), site maps, statistics and other related documents.
          The CREB's staff announces the project objectives, land and crop impact by
project, compensative regulations and policies to PAHs and recommends local people
not to build new houses or structures under ROWs. PAHs are consulted about
compensation policies and value. PAHs' questions are answered appropriately;
propositions of PAHs will be recorded.
     - Activity number 4: Continue to get feedback from PAHs.
     - Activity number 5: Disclosure information;
          The project will get the decision of investment and approval of design- total cost
estimate, design of construction engineering drawings after appropriate adjustment of
project location, design document, capacity and/or project technologies in order to meet
the demand of environmental protection and resettlement. In order to meet the demand of
OP 4.01 on information announcement, after WB approved this EMP, the CREB will be:
     • Supply Vietnamese documents of resettlement plan and environmental
          management plan to the People's Committees of Communes and Districts in
