F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is the efficient development of Vietnam's transmission
and distribution system. The project will achieve this through:
  (i) Investment support to overcome bottlenecks in the 500 kV and 220 kV
        transmission system and upgrades to selected 110 kV distribution systems;
  (ii) Replacement of the national and regional load dispatch and control systems made
        in coordination with complementary investments, to be financed separately, in
        metering and remote terminal units; and
  (iii) Assistance in the reform and restructuring of EVN and its affiliates to manage and
        operate the transmission system efficiently in an unbundled and increasing
        market-oriented power industry.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority): The PDO was not revised.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Sector Background
Meeting Growing Electricity Demand: Economic growth, spurred by the Doi Moi
reforms of the 1990s, saw strong electricity demand growth with average increases of
over 15 percent annually from 1990 to 2004. According to the 5th Power Development
Master Plan (PDMP5), electricity demand was projected to continue to grow by as high
as 7-8 percent per year. To meet demand, the PDMP5 stipulated the necessity to expand
power generation capacity from 9,956 MW in 2004 to 20,636 MW in 2010. Despite the
efforts of the Government of Vietnam (GoV) and Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the reserve
margin remained tight due to vulnerability of hydropower generation to rainfall. Meeting
growing power demand was a key challenge of the power sector in Vietnam.
Challenge in Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Investment: The T&D network
needs to be developed in accordance with growing demand and changing patterns of
supply and demand. In spite of network improvements as a result of investments, further
T&D investments were required to complement new generation capacity; complete key
transmission rings; and improve load dispatch, metering and communication across the
entire national network. The PDMP5 set out several key T&D developments, including
the development of two transmission rings in the north and south of the country, and the
enhancement of T&D systems around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Financing Challenge: One of the biggest issues in the power sector at the time of
appraisal was how to mobilize financing amid the pressing need for electricity
infrastructure investment to meet rapidly increasing demand. EVN projected that based
on the PDMP5, the sector needed $11 billion for new generation capacity, $4 billion for
further construction of the power grids, and $4 billion for debt service. Based on the
average tariff level (5.1 $cents/kWh in 2004) and EVN’s challenging financial position, it
was expected that EVN could only meet 40 percent of the investment requirements.
Sector Reform: To tackle the power sector challenges, continued progress on power
sector reform was imperative. At the time of appraisal, the main elements of the
government’s reform strategy were laid out in the Electricity Law (2005). The law
stipulated market-oriented power provisions, the restructuring of EVN into separate
generation, transmission and distribution utilities, and the establishment of a separate unit
within the Ministry of Industry (MoI)1 for regulation of the power sector, which would
eventually become an autonomous regulatory authority.
At the time of appraisal, most of the generation capacity and transmission networks (500
kV and 220 kV) were owned and managed by EVN, and the distribution function was the
responsibility of the eleven Power Companies (PCs) which were EVN’s subsidiary
entities; including Power Company No.1 (PC1) 2 covering the northern region, Power

  MoI has been re-organized as Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT).

  The GoV’s reform program aimed to strengthen the distribution companies. 11 PCs were legally re-
established as five PCs in 2010. PC1 merged with Hai Phong PC, Hai Duong PC, and Ninh Binh PC to
form Northern Power Corporation (NPC).


                                                1
Company No.2 (PC2)3 covering the southern region, and Power Company No.3 (PC3)4
covering the central region of the country. Important implications of the Electricity Law
included the separation of a single transmission company as a subsidiary of EVN, and the
commencement of an internal power market.
Rationale for Bank Assistance
The World Bank was continuously involved in the Vietnam power sector since the early
1990s. Through two closed projects and five on-going projects at the timing of appraisal,
the Bank had already played an important role in assisting the critical transmission
network development, improving the quality and coverage of electricity supply, and
supporting the entry of the private sector in generation. Building on those achievements,
the Second Transmission and Distribution Project (TD2, or the Project) was expected to
support further development of T&D systems and the power sector reform agenda.
The project was closely linked with the national power development plan at the time of
appraisal. All the investment subprojects included in the project were incorporated in the
PDMP5. Successful completion of these subprojects would contribute to efficient
development of the national T&D network.
The project was fully in line with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2003-
2006, which was presented to the Bank’s Board in September 2003. More specifically,
the project aimed to contribute to the CAS objectives of high growth through the
transition to a market economy and narrowing the gap for disadvantaged areas. Meeting
the needs of growth required expansion of the electricity system, which improves the
investment climate not only for the power sector but for the whole economy by
improving the quality, availability, and reliability of electricity – a vital input, to industry
and commerce. In the power sector, efficiency and reliability improvements and loss
reductions were needed to ensure that EVN remained a financially healthy enterprise.
IDA together with other donors, notably Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were key sources of financing for investments
in the power sector. Good coordination had been established between the Bank and ADB
where the Bank planned to support T&D development mainly in the southern and central
regions through the TD2 Project, and ADB focused on the northern region (ADB
Northern Power Transmission Project, closed in 2012).
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
    approved)
The project objective was to assist the Borrower in developing an efficient electricity
transmission and distribution system, thus enabling the timely evacuation of power from
new electricity generation plants to growing load centers and maintenance of system

security, reliability and power quality; and contributing to the restructuring of the power
sector5.
The project would achieve this through:
   (i) Investment support to overcome bottlenecks in the 500 kV and 220 kV
         transmission system and upgrades to selected 110 kV distribution systems;
   (ii) Replacement of the national and regional load dispatch and control systems
         made in coordination with complementary investments, to be financed
         separately, in metering and remote terminal units; and
   (iii) Assistance in the reform and restructuring of EVN and its affiliates to manage
         and operate the transmission system efficiently in an unbundled and increasing
         market-oriented power industry.
The three types of performance indicators at the PDO level were:
    Generation capacity connected to project financed 500 kV transmission systems;
    Number and duration of interruptions in the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission
       system and 110 kV distribution systems; and
    Peak hour minimum voltages at system weak points.
The three key output indicators at the intermediate outcome level were:
    Additional transmission system assets created (Component 1);
    Commissioning of new market and transmission system information and control
       systems (Component 2);
    Market transition support, including two sub-indicators: (i) development of a
       single transmission subsidiary (Component 3) and (ii) development of a
       functional internal power market (Component 3).
Section F in the Data Sheet presents the results for both the development objective level
and the intermediate outcome level indicators.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification
The PDO was not revised. Several changes were made to key performance indicators as
part of the Additional Financing (AF) which was approved on March 29, 2011. The AF
was provided to scale up Component 1 and its associated development impacts and
benefits.
First, outcome indicators that measure the number and duration of interruptions on
transmission and distribution systems were re-calculated by excluding the impact of
natural phenomena such as typhoons to better capture the changes due to transmission
investments.

  There is a discrepancy in the wording of the PDO between the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and
the Development Credit Agreement. The PDO in the PAD is: “The objective of the Project was the
efficient development of Vietnam's T&D system”. The ICR uses the PDO from the Credit Agreement,
because the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank encourages the use of the PDO appearing in
the Credit Agreement as the basis for evaluation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The beneficiaries were not clearly stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) or the
Project Paper (PP). However, it is easy to infer that the primary beneficiaries of the
project were EVN and its affiliate entities, and all segments of the population in Vietnam
given the nature of the project. Successful implementation of the project components was
expected to support EVN in terms of: (i) moving towards achieving the target of national
T&D investments; (ii) improving the quality of electricity supply; and (iii) assisting the
reform and restructuring of EVN. The population was expected to benefit from improved
quality of supply. The project was also expected to bring direct temporary benefits for
skilled and unskilled workers who were employed for the construction of the subprojects.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: T&D Systems Expansion and Reinforcement ($297.75 million, of
which IDA financing was $176.55 million): This component consisted of subprojects to
build new, or reinforce existing, 500 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV T&D lines and substations
(SSs). Subprojects included in this component were identified in the government’s
PDMP5 or its 6th Power Development Master Plan for 2006-2015 (PDMP6), which was
under preparation at that time. This component consisted of three subcomponents;
       1.1: 500 kV and 220 kV Transmission System Expansion and Reinforcement
            ($237.37 million), of which IDA financing was $129.15 million;
       1.2: 220 kV/110 kV gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) SSs ($48.64 million), of
            which IDA financing was $40.09 million; and



                                            4
       1.3: Regional Distribution System Expansion and Reinforcement ($11.75 million),
            of which IDA financing was $7.31 million.
Component 1 was divided into two phases. Phase 1 consisted of subprojects that had been
already approved and were ready for procurement in subcomponents 1.1 and 1.2. Phase 2
consisted of subprojects in subcomponent 1.1 and 1.3 under consideration at the time of
appraisal. Candidate projects in phase 2 were to be appraised when preparation was
completed, on a first-come, first appraised basis and implemented until all the funds
allocated to this component had been committed.
Component 2: Electricity Market and System Operations Modernization ($22.80
million, of which IDA financing was $21.80 million): This component consisted of: (i)
the supply and installation of a supervisory control and data acquisition and energy
management system (SCADA/EMS) for the National Load Dispatch Center (NLDC); (ii)
replacement of the existing VietPool Interim Market System with a fully functional
market management system; and (iii) improving the telecommunication backbone to
support the new systems. SCADA/EMS and market systems were expected to include
both hardware and software to support NLDC’s system operator and market operator
responsibilities.
Component 3: Market Transition Support ($1.65 million, all IDA financed): This
component aimed to provide technical assistance to EVN to develop its transmission
business as a separate entity and establish an internal power market, with particular focus
on: (i) enabling EVN to manage power market operations; (ii) reviewing future
investments in transmission and regional interconnections; (iii) developing a generation
expansion investment plan; (iv) preparing a business plan; and (v) providing training and
support in the development of a power market.
1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised. However, several subprojects in Component 1 of the
original financing were dropped or replaced by similar subprojects, while seven new
projects were added in the AF. Details of the subprojects and rationale for drop and/or
addition are described in Annex 2. Also, a new technical assistance: ‘capacity building to
enhance National Power Transmission Corporation’s (NPT) capabilities in the critical
areas of investment planning and financing, debt management, and the management of
regulatory affairs ($0.50 million)’ was included in Component 3.
1.7 Other Significant Changes
Additional Financing of a $180 million IBRD loan was approved on March 29, 2011 to
scale up Component 1 to effectively respond to increasing network financing
requirements and to cope with rising power demand. The closing date for the project was
revised twice.
Firstly, the closing date was extended from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 through
the first restructuring (December 17, 2010), to allow adequate time for processing the AF.
Secondly, following the approval of the AF on March 29, 2011, the closing date was
further extended to June 30, 2014 to provide enough time for implementing newly added
subprojects.



                                            5
During the AF approval, due to the creation of NPT as a fully-owned EVN subsidiary to
own and operate the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission network, and with the merger of
eleven PCs into five PCs in 2010, the implementation arrangements were changed as
shown in Table 2. Legal documents were amended to transfer implementation
responsibility, liabilities and covenants to the new entities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project design was adequate based on a sound background analysis. The project
thoroughly analyzed the sectoral context and correctly identified the key needs for
Vietnam at appraisal. They were: (a) to develop electricity infrastructure which keeps
pace with rapidly growing electricity demand; and (b) to consolidate and coordinate
transmission functions, leading to a single transmission legal entity conducting reliable
grid operations. This analysis was supplemented by in-depth discussions with EVN, and
relevant analytic work: ‘Transmission and Distribution Study’, which was carried out
under the Transmission Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction Project (Cr. 3034-VN,
closed 2007). The project design was evidence based and clearly reflected thorough
analysis, incorporating both T&D subprojects that contribute to better reliability and
quality of power supply, and the SCADA/EMS system at the center of the integrated load
dispatching operation amid the on-going power sector reform. There was good donor
coordination with ADB who supported transmission network development in the northern
region and the Bank focused on T&D subprojects in the southern and central regions.6
Lesson learnt from past operations, namely flexibility mechanism, was incorporated
in the project design. The PAD identified seven key lessons learnt, all of which were
adequately reflected in the overall project design. Among them, a flexible approach
enabling the project to accommodate changing priorities as load grows and demand
patterns changed to better select relevant T&D subprojects, leading to efficient use of
funds and a better achievement of the PDO.
The government showed strong commitment at both sector and project levels. At the
timing of approval, the government provided strong evidence of the need for resolving
vast investment requirements and sector restructuring through enacting the Electricity

 Following the AF, Quang Ninh – Hiep Hoa transmission line in the north, which accounted for about 50%
of the AF budget, was included in the project.


                                                  6
Law in 2005. At project level, the government demonstrated its strong support through
accelerating its approval processes for project preparation which only took one year.
Key project risks were identified early, but other risks could have been analyzed in
more detail. The project clearly identified two key risks: (i) slow implementation due to
administrative procedures, delays in procurement and disbursement, and insufficient
attention to safeguards; and (ii) slow implementation of sector reforms by the government
after enacting the Electricity Law in 2005. To mitigate these risks, the team introduced
measures including continued dialogue with the government on reform-related activities,
and EVN support to remove bottlenecks in safeguard, fiduciary and procurement aspects.
Overall, social and environmental safeguard issues were addressed adequately in the
project design to minimize social and environmental impacts and ensure compliance with
the relevant World Bank policies.
In hindsight, there are several other risks the team could have analyzed in more detail,
including: (a) EVN’s and NPT’s potential financial difficulties during implementation
and the associated breach of the project financial covenants; (b) potential delay of
SCADA/EMS component arising from technically complex nature of the subproject and
pre-mature feasibility study at appraisal stage; and (c) potential impact of slow
implementation of TA based on experience from other Bank financed projects.
2.2 Implementation
This section discusses factors which contributed to the project performance and how
project stakeholders responded to ensure smooth implementation.
Delay in project effectiveness: Project effectiveness was delayed after its approval on
July 28, 2005, because EVN wanted to delay paying the commitment fee until the last
moment. The Bank explained to EVN that the saving on the fee was minimal and the risk
associated with delaying disbursement. The project became effective on May 31, 2006.
Implementation delay at the early stage: Slow project implementation was observed in
January 2007 due to various administrative reasons, including: (i) late appointment of
Deputy Director for International Cooperation Department in EVN; (ii) lack of attention
to due dates regarding procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and (iii) delays in
document submission relating to social and environmental safeguards. The first two
issues were readily resolved by a request from the Bank team. The third issue took longer
because of the different progress of T&D subprojects. It was eventually solved by the end
of 2008 after continuous guidance was provided by the Bank’s safeguard specialists.
The SCADA/EMS subproject (Component 2), which, with the transmission
expansion, aimed to support the efficient development of the transmission operation,
faced complex difficulties, which caused its incompletion at project closure. These
included: (i) the feasibility study was not completed even after project effectiveness,
leading to a delay in EVN’s investment decision, which then suspended the selection of
the consultant for this subproject; and (ii) finalization of the technical specification was
only completed after EVN’s formal decision on the building to locate the system.
After project effectiveness, EVN was in the process of selecting land for their new
headquarter, where the SCADA/EMS was to be installed. To avoid further delays, the
Bank and EVN discussed various options, including financing the land acquisition by


                                             7
project funds, and extension of the project closure. In 2009, NLDC signed a contract with
an international consultant to support NLDC during the implementation phases of the
subproject, and it was at the end of 2012 when NLDC signed a contract with a main
system supplier. At this stage, it became clear that it would be difficult to fully complete
system installation by the end of the project on June 30, 2014.
Breach of project financial covenants: Since 2008, NPT suffered net operating losses
mainly because of non-cost-reflective transmission tariffs. To meet the rapidly growing
electricity demand, NPT needed to debt finance large parts of its investment.
Consequently, NPT was not able to comply with the financial covenants required for
loans received from various international financial institutions during the project period.
It was acknowledged that the financial situation of NPT and the power sector cannot be
solved at the project level, and it was agreed to adopt a more holistic approach to tackle
the overall financial viability of the power sector, including EVN and all its subsidiaries.
To achieve that objective, the World Bank, jointly with EVN, a Government Working
Group (GWG) and in close cooperation with other institutional financial institutions,
conducted a relevant technical study and jointly developed a Financial Recovery Plan
(FRP) for EVN, NPT and the PCs in 2014. The FRP covers the period up to 2020 and
includes a gliding tariff adjustment path to ensure full cost recovery of NPT’s
transmission business and recommends operational and technical improvements to
increase its overall efficiency.
The transfer of implementing agency (IA) for the technical assistance (TA)
component made it difficult to produce the knowledge product in a timely manner.
At the time of the appraisal, the output from the TA activity was expected to be fed into a
future national power development plan (PDMP7). However, there was a delay in the
implementation of the TA activity. This was partly caused by the transfer of the IA from
EVN to NPT, which was established in July 2008. The newly established entity needed
time to evolve and fully establish internal procedures, staffing etc. Due to the delays in
NPT, it was only in August 2009 that the selected international consultant started work,
submitting an inception report in September 2009 and first interim report in March 2010.
Incompletion of 3 out of 17 T&D subprojects under Component 1 was caused by
challenges in land acquisition. Land acquisition and compensation payments, although
eventually resolved, did not allow timely completion of three transmission subprojects by
project closure, affecting the achievement of some intermediate indicators. Cau Bong SS
was completed in October 2014 and the remaining two will be completed in 2015.
Flexibility mechanism worked well for better achievement of PDO. A flexible
approach enabling the project to accommodate changing priorities as load grows and
demand patterns change helped to better select T&D subprojects, leading to efficient use
of funds and a better achievement of the PDO. Additions and/or drop of subprojects after
approval are summarized in Annex 2.
There was no Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review of the quality of project
supervision.




                                             8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design: PDO indicators were selected to measure the effect of the project in
facilitating the new generation capacity to alleviate power shortages, reduce transmission
interruptions and overloading, and improve quality of supply by reducing voltage
excursions in the transmission system. The intermediate indicators were straightforward
and directly connected with the physical project outcomes: (i) lengths of transmission line
created; and (ii) capacity of transformer installed. The indicators also aimed to track the
project impact in improving load dispatch and control systems, and the sector
restructuring objectives.
Following the AF approval, there was no deletion or addition made to the type of
indicators. However, two modifications were made. First, at the PDO level, the target
values of system reliability indicators (the number and duration of power interruptions)
were revised to reflect only technical interruptions and exclude those caused by natural
phenomena such as typhoon. Second, the values of intermediate indicators were updated
based on the final list of subprojects under the parent project plus the impact of
expenditures under the AF loan.
The Bank team recognized in the MTR that frequency and duration of interruption as part
of the outcome indicators measure not only the impact of investments under the project,
but also the effects of the overall investment in T&D7 as well as other factors such as
higher or lower demand growth than expected. For better monitoring, the Bank team
decided that the extent to which the project will achieve its objectives will be assessed
mainly on the basis of the outcome indicator on the new generation capacity connected as
a result of the project and the intermediate indicators related to the T&D assets created.
For M&E of the change to the actual peak hour minimum voltage measured at known
system weak points, the Bank should have selected the substations which would be
directly impacted by the investments made under the Project (see to PDO indicator 5).
M&E implementation: The collection of M&E indicators was conducted effectively.
The indicators were regularly collected and reported by EVN. The quality of information
provided was good as it was EVN’s internal management data, supplemented by progress
reports from IAs and field visits.
M&E utilization: The indicators were designed to capture the physical progress of the
project and were collected regularly. Hence, they could be used effectively to evaluate
the timeliness of project implementation, identify required actions to remedy delays and
bottlenecks, and help timely decision making for the AF.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The project was classified as Environmental Category B because the potential impacts
and risks identified were minor to moderate and manageable. The project triggered three




7
  The percentage of the Bank’s contribution to the total T&D investment during the project period was
approximately 10% of the total network investment requirements in the PMDP5. HCMCPC reported that
the Bank’s contribution to their network investment during the project period was 12.2%.


                                                 9
safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Indigenous Peoples
(OP/BP 4.10), and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).
Social Safeguards
All safeguard documents were prepared, reviewed, cleared and publicly disclosed per
requirements of the Bank safeguard policies.
The implementation of involuntary resettlement in transmission investments (especially
220 kV-500 kV subprojects) was challenging. First, the magnitude of impacts for
transmission subprojects is more significant than lower voltage investments due to: (i)
larger area of land required for tower foundations or substations; (ii) wider rights-of-way,
resulting in the limitation of land use on larger areas; (iii) more severe impacts, including
physical relocation. In addition, during implementation, IAs faced a lot of difficulties in:
(i) negotiating with affected households about compensation packages; (ii) collaborating
with local authorities in daily activities of land acquisition, compensation and
resettlement; and (iii) dealing with unexpected changes in project design.
Although there are some subprojects that are still under construction after the project
closure, IAs adequately managed activities related to involuntary resettlement, with some
recognized good practices, including the relocation of a private religious structure (Phu
My – Song May 500 kV TL subproject); the completion of a very complicated subproject
(Quang Ninh – Hiep Hoa 500 kV TL subproject); and the usage of monitoring reports as
a tool for performance improvement (Southern Projects Management Board-SPMB). The
overall compliance with the triggered social safeguard policies is ‘Satisfactory’.
Environmental Safeguard
The client prepared environmental guidelines (EG) to provide guidance on the
environmental assessment (EA) process during investment preparation and
implementation for the subprojects to be considered for financing under the project. The
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) of subprojects were prepared for the
transmission lines and SSs in line with the project EG and include detailed practical
mitigation measures and estimated budgets for their implementation, institutional
responsibilities, monitoring plans, and building capacity for environmental management
and supervision. Specific requirements were included in all bidding documents to ensure
effective execution of the mitigation measures during construction.
An environmental monitoring system comprising contractors, construction supervision
consultants, independent environmental monitoring consultants, PMBs, local authorities,
and local communities was established and functioned effectively. Monitoring and
reporting on EMP implementation was relatively poor at the beginning, but it gradually
improved with assistance from the supervision consultants and the Bank team. The EMPs
were implemented satisfactorily as confirmed by field and supervision engineers in
project progress reports. Bank missions consistently rated the environmental performance
of the Project as ‘Satisfactory’ during project implementation. There were no outstanding
environmental safeguard issues. The PMBs strictly followed government regulations on
electricity safety, fire prevention, and waste management during operation of the
transmission lines and SSs.




                                             10
Financial Management
Financial management (FM) performance ranged between ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ and
‘Satisfactory’ throughout the project period. The project FM system and arrangement
provided adequate assurance for the use of project funds for intended purposes. With the
exception of noncompliance with some financial covenants which has been a sector wide
issue rather than being project specific, the IAs were proactive in dealing with the
recommendations from the Bank team’s missions.
There was one instance of loss of materials/equipment being consigned at the contractor’s
warehouse with significant financial impacts to NPT. Tighter inventory management
processes need to be designed for future projects to avoid similar incidents. This was
incorporated into the FM arrangements for Transmission Efficiency Project (TEP) where
consignment is restricted and inventory count/reconciliation was formalized.
Procurement
The project procurement packages covered civil works, electrical and mechanical
equipment, erection and installation, and consulting services. These activities were
effectively organized and carried out in accordance with the Bank’s guidelines. The IAs
were effective in following the procurement process to overcome issues such as delays in
the procurement and delivery of the main equipment and lag between the delivery of
material/equipment and construction work. During the early stages in the project, some
IAs delayed the procurement process in large part due to their unfamiliarity with the
Bank’s procurement process, such as SCADA/EMS package, but also due to uncertainty
related to the power sector reform, such as Assessment of the Network Development.
Another reason for delays in procurement was the complex approval processes, but this
was not specific to the project or the power sector. However, this situation improved as
the IAs learned from experience and with Bank’s support. The Bank’s oversight and
close involvement in all phases helped ensuring the transparency and effectiveness of all
procurement, and contributed to the IAs’ ability to procure quality goods and services at
competitive prices. During implementation, the overall procurement performance of the
Project was ‘Satisfactory’ and no cases of fraud and corruption were detected.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Post project arrangement: The IAs, the government and the Bank have agreed that the
completed subprojects will continue to be managed by EVN subsidiaries. Operation and
maintenance of the transmission related facilities will be transferred to Power Trading
Company 1 (PTC1) in the northern region, and PTC2 in the southern region. Distribution
related facilities implemented by HCMCPC and CPC will be managed by each agency.
This is the most suitable arrangement, and all the above agencies have good technical
experience and expertise for the operation and maintenance of the power grid.
Status of on-going subprojects: On-going subprojects, which are: (i) SCADA/EMS
implemented by NLDC; and (ii) three transmission investments implemented by the
Southern Power Projects Management Board (SPPMB), are making good progress
towards completion by 2015. Cau Bong SS was already completed in October 2014. The
technical quality of SCADA/EMS system has been confirmed by the successful
completion of a factory acceptance test (FAT) in November 2014, and the equipment will
be shipped and installed at the EVN headquarter in early 2015 for final acceptance testing.


                                           11
NLDC and SPPMB have sufficient technical expertise in completing, operating and
maintaining the respective asset. Both the EVN and the Bank have agreed that the
required funding for completion of the subprojects is fully borne by EVN.
Follow-up activities by the World Bank Group: The sustainability of the project
outcomes will be further strengthened by the Banks’ ongoing energy dialogue and
lending portfolio in Vietnam. In particular, Distribution Efficiency Project (DEP) and
Transmission Efficiency Project (TEP) are the direct follow-up of TD2, and focus on the
further improvement of T&D network with the aim of improving the quality and
reliability of power supply. Other projects and programs supporting the power sector
reform and financial viability of the power companies, include: (i) Third Power Sector
Reform Development Policy Operation (PSRDPO3, approved on June 30, 2014); (ii)
Development of Strategic Options for Financial Recovery of EVN and its subsidiaries;
(iii) Equitization and Divestiture Strategy for EVN Generation Assets (Gencos); and (iv)
Support Development of Vietnam Wholesale Electricity Market (VWEM) will all help to
improve the financial sustainability of the power sector.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project objectives remain highly relevant with the current country policy
priorities as well as the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Efficient
development of Vietnam's T&D system has been making progress but remains an
important issue in the national level policy. Vietnam’s Socio-economic Development
Plan (SEDP) 2011-2015 and its Socio-economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-
2020 aim for sustainable economic growth on the basis of improving quality,
effectiveness and competitiveness. The World Bank’s current CPS for the period FY12-
FY16, which is aligned with both the SEDP and SEDS, supports the competitiveness
pillar. One of the outcomes for this pillar is the improved quality and efficiency of energy
and infrastructure services, which is connected to the Government’s agenda for raising
the quality of economic growth. The TD2 project directly contributes to the pillar by
improving the quality and efficiency of electricity infrastructure and services, including
enhancing the grid’s capacity to absorb new generation.
The relevance of the project design and implementation are substantial. The largest
project component, which is the T&D expansion Component 1, was successfully
implemented and has fully met the project objectives. The Electricity Market and System
Operations Modernization (Component 2) that was designed to ensure more efficient grid
operation and the SCADA/EMS will be completed in 2015. The Market transition
support (Component 3) was aimed to assist power sector reform and restructuring of
EVN and its subsidiaries to manage and operate the transmission system efficiently in an
unbundled and increasing market-oriented power industry.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO is “to assist the Borrower in (i) developing an efficient electricity transmission
and distribution system, thus enabling the (ii) timely evacuation of power from new
electricity generation plants to growing load centers; and (iii) maintenance of system
security, reliability and power quality; and (iv) contributing to the restructuring of the



                                            12
 power sector”. In this ICR report, achievement of the PDO is assessed based on these
 four aspects.
 Developing an efficient electricity transmission and distribution system
 For Component 1, four out of six sub-targets were fully achieved. The remaining two
 indicators exceeded the original targets but did not reach the revised targets because three
 220 kV transmission subprojects were not fully completed by project closure. One of
 them was energized in October 2014 and the remaining two will be completed in 2015.
 For Component 2, the new SCADA/EMS system will be fully completed in July 2015.
 Once the system is in place, it will contribute to the efficient operation of the
 transmission system by: (i) creating savings from enabling better economic dispatch of
 generators; (ii) reducing fuel costs due to better hydrothermal scheduling; and (iii)
 creating savings from optimizing power flow. The VietPool System component was not
 implemented by a decision of EVN/NLDC in 2007.

 Timely evacuation of power from new electricity generation plants to growing load
 centers
 Connection of new generation capacity was almost double (2,250MW) compared to the
 target value of 1,200MW. This was achieved by selecting subprojects that were urgently
 needed to support the growing electricity demand in Vietnam.
 Maintenance of system security, reliability and power quality
 The reductions of the number and durations of interruptions at all levels (500 kV, 220 kV
 and 110 kV) were fully achieved.

Contributing to the restructuring of the power sector
Key performance indicators on Component 3 have been achieved. NPT was established
under the EVN’s decision No.223/QD-EVN of April 11, 2008 as a single transmission
subsidiary within EVN, responsible for investment in and the management and operation
of 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines and associated substations. In 2010, eleven PCs
were merged into five PCs to create economies of scale and scope in distribution. These
structural reforms enabled the development of a functioning internal power market. The
TA impact in the original financing for the indicators was limited. However, the AF
effectively supported the development of an investment appraisal methodology, which
helps NPT to become a more financially viable transmission company. This TA is
complementary to other related and ongoing Bank activities including the support to
further sector reform and adjustment of retail electricity and transmission tariffs and the
implementation of a Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) for EVN and all its subsidiaries that
was developed jointly with EVN and a Government Working Group (GWG).
There are also various robust cases for the T&D component contributing to improved
reliability of the power network at regional level. These cases include various aspects,
including: (i) connection of new generation capacity to the grid; (ii) creation of robust
loop power grid; (iii) reduction of interruption at regional level; and (iv) reduction of
power losses at regional level. These aspects are detailed in Table A2-3 of Annex 2.
Overall, the outcome of the project is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory. As the
value of PDO indicators has been formally revised during the project, the achievement
needs to be assessed against both original and revised target values8.

     Rating against the original target at the time of AF is assessed Satisfactory. A
      comparison of progress against the original project indicators at AF shows the
      progress was on-track to achieving all original PDO indicators at completion.
     Achievement against the revised target at completion is assessed Moderately
      Satisfactory. Achievement of Component 1 is assessed as satisfactory based on
      the fact that the indicators directly linked to the investments made in this project
      have reached or exceeded the target. Achievement of Component 2 is assessed as
      moderately satisfactory considering the fact that the SCADA/EMS is still under
      implementation and will be in place in 2015, expecting to bring the full benefit for
      more efficient T&D operation. Investments made in Component 1 were not
      affected by this delay because the existing system supports the operation of the
      whole transmission system. The achievement of Component 3 is assessed as
      moderately satisfactory because the impact of the TA for the original financing
      was limited while the outcome of the TA in the AF had larger impacts and will be
      fully utilized for future investment decision by NPT. Considering that
      Component 1 accounted for more than 90% of the project costs and had the
      largest impacts on achieving key output indicators, the achievement of the PDO is
      assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
3.3 Efficiency
Net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (EIRR) were calculated at the Project
completion for both economic and financial analysis. The calculation considered
component 1 (transmission and distribution component) for ensuring consistency
between the methodology at appraisal and at completion of the Project. This component
accounted for 92 percent ($297.75 million) of the total project cost at PAD stage, 96
percent ($675.13 million) of the total project cost at AF stage and 98 percent ($620.61
million) of the total project cost at completion stage. In this section, the total Project cost
means the sum of that funded by the Bank support and paid by the counterpart fund. The
detailed methodology is described in Annex 3.
Economic Analysis: The calculated NPV and economic IRR (EIRR) are shown in Table
5. Total NPV of $445 million and EIRR of 22.9 percent clearly demonstrate that this
project has brought substantial economic benefits to Vietnam. The NPV at completion
stage was significantly reduced from appraisal and AF, caused by delayed
implementation of subprojects. The analysis did not include other economic benefits such
as reduction of transmission/distribution losses and improvement of supply reliability for
ensuring a conservative assessment.

                                   EIRR            NPV @ 10% ($ million)               Coverage(*1)
           At appraisal            21.8%                  386.9                           92%

          At completion            22.9%                  445.0                           98%
        *1: Coverage refers to the percentage of total project cost for which EIRR was calculated.

Financial Analysis: As seen in Table 6, total NPV of $385 million and financial IRR
(FIRR) of 16.6 percent demonstrate that the project has been financially viable. NPV and




                                                       15
FIRR at completion stage are a bit higher than at appraisal and AF, mainly because of the
increase of general tariff levels.
                           Table 6: Results of Financial Analysis
                               FIRR         NPV @ 6.5% ($ million)         Coverage
            At appraisal        9.6%               105.7                     92%
               At AF           14.8%               201.9                     96%
           At completion       16.6%               385.1                     98%
Considering that all the subprojects are part of the national Power Development Master
Plans, which were developed in a least cost manner, the costs associated with Component
1 are reasonable for achieving the project objectives.
Efficiency analysis was not conducted for Component 2 (SCADA/EMS), because the
component is still ongoing and the final technical quality of the installed system will
determine the benefits. Once in place and fully installed, the system will bring benefits
by: (i) reducing power generation cost of approximately 0.1% per year through better
economic dispatch; (ii) reducing fuel cost by approximately 0.05% per year due to better
hydrothermal scheduling; and (iii) reducing transmission losses by 1% per year through
optimizing power flow9.
Combining the high efficiency achieved in Component 1 which comprised more than
90% of the project costs and efficiency to be defined in 2015 in Component 2, the
efficiency of the Project is rated as ‘substantial’.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall outcome of the TD2 Project is rated as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ based on
high relevance to the country policy and the Bank’s CPS, moderately satisfactory rating
of the achievement of PDO, and substantial rating of the efficiency.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Although there is no specific study to assess specific impacts of the project on poverty,
gender, and social development, the project’s key performance indicators show that the
quantity and quality of electricity supply have been improved. Such improvement
contributes to bringing favorable conditions for economic development, more job
opportunities for local people, and increased household income. Better access to
electricity helps extend the hours available for both productive and leisure activities,
particularly for women. Improved power supply helps meet growing electricity demand,
thus leading to the development of various industries and the improvement of people’s
cultural life. These positive effects have been evaluated by various studies10,11.

Gender and social aspects need to be assessed considering increases in electricity tariffs,
which was a result of the overall tariff reform. Residential electricity tariffs have
increased since the launch of the Prime Minister Decision 21 in 2009. As of August 2013,
the average tariff reached 1,509 VND/kWh (US 7.1 cents/kWh). The World Bank
assessed the impact in 2014 and found the following12;
     (i) In 2012, Vietnamese nationals spent 2.1 percent (2.4 percent for poor) of their
          total expenditure on electricity payments, indicating the affordability of electricity.
     (ii) Even after taking account the price increase in 2013 and further increases in 2014,
          the impact is acceptable and electricity remains affordable for all income groups.
     (iii)Social tariffs for low-income customers, which were introduced by the PM
          Decision 268 in 2011, have remained at an affordable level. Poor households
          consuming less than 50 kWh/month are charged a tariff of 993 VND/kWh ($4.7
          cents/kWh), and also each household receives 30,000 VND per month in cash.
     (iv) The difference in terms of the share of electricity expenditure is small between
          male-headed and female-headed households.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
During the project period, the Vietnamese electricity sector has undergone a significant
institutional change. In order to enable the development of effective competition and cost
reflective power tariffs, the government has adopted a gradual approach towards change
in the EVN structure, with the creation of independent corporatized subsidiaries having
their own accounting and management and managed structure and being functionally
separated from EVN. NPT was created in 2008 as a 100 percent EVN-owned subsidiary
being responsible for transmission investment and maintenance.
The creation of the NPT was critical for the development of the Vietnam Competitive
Generation Market (VCGM) that became fully operational in 2014. The creation of an
unbundled transmission company is also a precondition for the successful implementation
of the next phase of the power sector reform agenda that will start from 2015 with the
pilot Vietnam Wholesale Electricity Market (VWEM). Component 3 aimed to assist EVN
and its subsidiaries to manage and operate the transmission system more efficiently in an
unbundled and increasingly market-oriented power sector environment. This project
supported the development of an investment appraisal methodology, which is used by
NPT to improve its financial standing as a single transmission subsidiary of EVN
working within an internal power market. The impact of the TA activity is important as
NPT will employ the methodology for economic and financial analysis of projects which
will be used in their future project appraisal.

Not applicable.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Key risks to sustainability are: (a) unsuccessful completion of on-going subprojects; (b)
insufficient technical capability of NPT and PCs to operate and maintain assets; (c)
increasing energy consumption in project areas that result in deterioration of the
reliability and quality of power supply; and (d) deterioration of the financial situation of
NPT and PCs to meet future T&D investment requirements.
    a) Risk of non completion of on-going subprojects is assessed as low. There are
         three 220 kV transmission subprojects and SCADA/EMS which were not fully
         completed by project closure. The IAs’ commitment to finance remaining costs
         from their own funds and fully complete all projects by 2015. All projects made
         good progress towards successful completion by July 2015. One transmission
         subproject (Cau Bong SS) has been already completed in October 2014.
    b) Risk of maintaining and operating assets is assessed as low. NPT and PCs
         have a long proven track record of effectively operating and maintaining T&D
         assets. It is highly unlikely that the investment assets are poorly operated due to
         lack of maintenance or technical expertise.
    c) The risk of increasing energy consumption in project areas resulting in a
         deterioration of the reliability and quality of power supply is assessed
         moderate. The risk will be mitigated by the implementation of TEP, which
         finances about 15 percent of the transmission investment demand up to 2020. TEP
         investment components focus on addressing major transmission bottlenecks and
         reinforcement in the Ho Chi Minh City and Mekong Delta areas and Central
         region all of which are to be built on the outcomes achieved in TD2 Project.
    d) Risk of financial viability of NPT and PCs are assessed as moderate. A new
         series of reform measures is being implemented to enable a move towards a
         competitive wholesale market as well as to further address the financial
         sustainability of the sector. Realizing the large technical, institutional and
         financial challenges posed by increasing demand and a more competitive power
         market, EVN has identified the need to develop capacity within PCs and NPT on
         issues such as network planning, financial forecasting and performance
         monitoring. EVN has also launched and continues to implement an ambitious
         Smart Grid Program aiming to improve the efficiency of the power system and
         further reduce costs. The World Bank is actively involved to improve the
         financial situation of the power sector. Under a TA on the ‘Strategic Options for
         Financial Recovery of EVN and its Subsidiaries’ which has been implemented in
         close cooperation with EVN and a Government Working Group (GWG), a
         comprehensive financial recovery plan was developed up to 2020. The plan
         indicates the need for further power tariff increases for NPT and PCs to ensure


                                            18
       their financial viability in a competitive power market and to allow the companies
       to meet its operations, maintenance and investment needs. (see Annex 3). These
       risks will be further mitigated by the Bank’s comprehensive support to the power
       sector including relevant investments (for example, TEP and DEP) that include
       smart grid and demand side energy efficiency program for NPT and PCs to
       further reduce costs and increase efficiency.
Taking all the above aspects into account, the risk to the sustainability of development
outcome is assessed as ‘Moderate’.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank’s performance in project identification, preparation and appraisal is rated
‘Moderately Satisfactory’. The project was adequately designed based on a sound
background analysis. The project reflected various past analyses, incorporating both T&D
subprojects that contribute to better quality of power supply, and SCADA/EMS that
supports the integrated power system operation under the on-going power sector reform.
Lesson learnt from past operations were incorporated in the project design. Among them,
a flexible approach enabling the Project to accommodate changing priorities as load
grows and demand patterns helped to better select and implement T&D subprojects,
leading to efficient use of funds and better achievement of key performance indicators.
The social and environmental safeguard issues were addressed adequately in the project
design to minimize social and environmental impacts and ensure compliance with the
relevant Bank policies.
Although the Bank team identified and addressed most of key project risks which were
drawn from the past project operation, there are several areas where the team could have
identified risks not necessarily drawn from the past operations. These include: (a) EVN’s
potential financial difficulties during implementation; (b) potential delay of
SCADA/EMS component arising from technically complex nature of the subproject and
pre-mature feasibility study at appraisal stage; and (c) potential impact of slow
implementation of TA.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Transmission and Distribution Expansion (Component 1): The Bank’s supervision
team was able to properly monitor the progress of each subproject identifying the
challenges associated with land acquisition and compensation and providing detailed
guidance to EVN and its subsidiary IAs. Careful monitoring of key performance
indicators and a timely MTR allowed the subprojects to be revised in the AF, leading to a
better achievement of the PDO.
Electricity Market & System Operations Modernization (Component 2):
Considering the technically complex nature of SCADA/EMS, and various delays


                                           19
occurring from the outset of the project, the Bank supervision team could have provided a
more critical review of the implementation progress and work plan reported by NLDC.
This would have allowed taking early remedial actions (e.g., further extension of the
closing date and rationalization of scope of work in line with the actual work progress).
However, it should be noted that the cause of the delays was outside the Bank’s
supervision control.
Market Transition Support (Component 3): The Bank team could have paid more
attention to the monitoring of the TAs’ implementation progress. Supervision should
have intensively reviewed the technical output of each TA, and discussed with NPT how
the TA’s outcome will be utilized.
Quality of supervision for fiduciary, procurement and safeguard aspects has been
satisfactory throughout the project. The Bank experts identified various fiduciary and
safeguard issues in a timely manner, and responded to the clients by providing suitable
advice on how to address issues and achieve compliance with Bank policies. All the IAs,
in their borrower ICR reports, acknowledged the Bank experts’ rigorous support on this
aspect throughout project implementation. Taking all the above aspects into account, the
Bank’s supervision quality is assessed as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Combining the Bank’s satisfactory performance at entry and moderately satisfactory
performance during supervision, the overall Bank performance for this project is rated
‘Moderately Satisfactory’.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Government, represented by Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), was committed
to power sector reform13 as demonstrated by the enactment of the Electricity Law in 2005
and the issuance of the sector reform roadmap, as by the PM Decision 26 in 200614. The
Bank’s Project Document for the Third Power Sector Reform Development Policy
Operation (PSRDPO3) discusses that the reform process is continuously moving ahead
and reaching positive outcomes.
The government has adopted a gradual approach for power sector restructuring, through
the creation of affiliate companies in charge of operations in generation (3 Gencos),
transmission (NPT), distribution and retail (5 PCs), and system and market operation
(NLDC), with accounting, management and functional autonomy. In addition, the general
tariff system has been gradually restructured to allow periodic adjustment while
introducing a social tariff aiming to protect vulnerable and poor customers. Through the


13
   The reform included four key policy areas: (i) development of a competitive generation market; (ii)
power sector restructuring; (iii) electricity tariff reform; and (iv) promoting demand side energy efficiency.
14
   This Decision was amended by the PM Decision No. 63 in 2013 .


                                                     20
application of these mechanisms, the average tariffs have increased steadily (by 44
percent during 2010-2013). Also, the government through the PM Decision No. 2165 in
2013, approved a retail tariff bracket between 1,437 VND/kWh ($7.2 cents/kWh) and
1,835 VND/kWh ($9.2 cents/kWh), demonstrating the government’s commitment to
further adjust electricity tariffs. All of these efforts have positive effects to create a
favorable environment for NPT and PCs to stand as an autonomous institution and to be
capable for financing future network investment.
Local governments -the People’s Committee at district and city/province levels- for each
province worked with the IAs to resolve land acquisition and compensation challenges
under the current relevant legislations. The Committees coordinated with local
compensation councils to arrange meetings to actively provide information and guidance
to the affected people.
Overall, government performance is assessed as ‘Satisfactory’, given the central
government’s continuous efforts for sector reform and the local government’s vigorous
effort for resolving safeguard issues toward the successful subproject implementation.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Performance of NPT -SPPMB and CPPMB- as the IAs for T&D subprojects (Component
1.1) is assessed as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’. SPPMB and CPPMB worked very closely
with the Bank team to monitor the progress of each subproject, identify the challenges
associated with land acquisition and compensation, and implement guidance provided by
the government and the Bank. Careful monitoring of key performance indicators and a
timely MTR allowed subprojects to be revised in the AF, leading to better achievement of
the PDO. However, three subprojects were not fully completed by project closure,
leading to partial achievement of several performance indicators.
Performance of the PCs including HCMCPC and CPC (Component 1.2 and 1.3) is
‘Satisfactory’. Both entities were able to complete the subprojects before project closure.
For HCMCPC, although it faced several implementation difficulties, including: (i)
temporary debilitation of the Hiep Binh Phuoc 220 kV SS due to the pending completion
of the linked Hoc Mon – Hiep Binh Phuoc 220 kV transmission line, and (ii) land
acquisition issues in a factory location and crowded residential areas, it consulted with
the Bank and relevant authorities in a timely manner, and successfully resolved the issue
by the end of the Project. For CPC, although it faced difficulties regarding the purchased
materials for a canceled project, it was able to utilize them by identifying two new similar
subprojects which contributed to the achievement of the PDO.
All the IAs related with Component 1 worked with the People’s Committees at district
and city/province levels at the early stage to propose measures to address land acquisition
and compensation issues. This enabled local authorities to better understand the
importance of providing authority directions towards successful Project implementation.
Performance of NLDC for SCADA/EMS (Component 2) is assessed as ‘Moderately
Satisfactory’. It should be noted that the biggest cause of the partial incompletion was the
significant delay of EVN’s decision on the location for accommodating the new system,
which was not under NLDC’s control.


                                            21
Performance of NPT for TA (Component 3) is assessed as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’. The
impact of the TA activity under the original financing was limited. Although this was
partially caused by the exogenous factors, including: (i) the transfer of IA for the TA
component from EVN to the newly established NPT who faced a number of difficulties
in terms of staffing, allocation of responsibilities and internal procedures; and (ii)
insufficient output quality from the hired consultants, NPT should have coordinated more
closely and intensively with the Bank team and the consultants to address the
implementation delay and ensure that the acceptable technical outputs are delivered in a
timely manner. The impact of the TA activity for AF is important as NPT will employ a
methodology for economic and financial analysis of projects which will be used in their
future project appraisal after the methodology is reviewed and approved by NPT’s
management board and EVN.
Combining the above assessments with a larger emphasis on Component 1, due to its size
and more significance to the achievement of key performance indicators, implementation
performance by IAs is assessed as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Combining the government’s satisfactory performance and the IA’s moderately
satisfactory performance, the overall borrower performance for this project is rated
‘Moderately Satisfactory’.
6. Lessons Learned
Project design
    a) Flexibility is important when a project has a large number of subprojects that are
       implemented over a long period of time. This approach is particularly important
       for T&D projects in order to accommodate changing priorities as load grows and
       demand patterns change. This approach helps to better select important T&D
       subprojects, leading to efficient use of funds and better achievement of the PDO.
    b) Project design needs to consider readiness of subprojects so as to realize smooth
       implementation and timely disbursement. Part of the subprojects need to be
       appraised and ready for implementation upon Board approval. To ensure this, as
       implemented in various power projects for Vietnam (for example, TD2, RE2,
       DEP, and TEP), a project should include two groups of subprojects. The first
       group is appraised and ready for implementation upon the Board’s approval and
       the second group will be appraised and ready during the implementation period.
       This will enhance flexibility, allowing the use of cost savings or shifting of funds
       between subprojects and creating incentives for timely implementation.
    c) This two stage approach described under b) is far more critical for implementing
       subprojects that introduce technologies where IAs has limited experience. In the
       TD2 Project, Component 2 was a technically challenging SCADA/EMS that was
       not fully appraised by the Board approval. The feasibility study was not
       completed and the relevant investment approval was yet to be obtained. This was
       a cause for the component to encounter various difficulties during implementation.




                                           22
   d) In a T&D project, key performance indicators should be designed to capture
      impacts that are brought by specific investments. A nation-wide System Average
      Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), System Average Interruption Duration
      Index (SAIDI) or voltage level, which was used as key performance indicators for
      the TD2 Project, measures not only the impact of investment under the project,
      but also the effects of the overall investment in T&D as well as other factors such
      as higher or lower demand growth than expected. The indicator of newly
      connected generation capacity was used as a proxy to better monitor the impact of
      specific investments. One should also consider regional interruption statistics for
      measuring the benefits of subprojects that prevail within a specific area. This
      notion has been already employed by TEP, by defining various regional fault
      statistics as key performance indicators.
   e) Project financial covenants turned out to be ineffective and the financial
      challenges need to be addressed more holistically at the overall sector level.
Implementation arrangement
   a) Transfer of responsibility from one IA to another during implementation can
      cause significant implementation delay. This is critical when the transferred IA is
      a newly established. In the project, NPT, established in 2008 faced a number of
      start-up hurdles in terms of staffing, allocation of responsibility and internal
      procedure.
   b) It is important that subprojects among PMBs are allocated to avoid overload in a
      specific IA. The successful implementation of Quang Ninh- Hiep Hoa
      transmission line in just two years, which accounts for half of the AF budget, has
      been due to CPPMB concentrating on this specific task.
Safeguard, procurement and financial management aspects
   a) Early comprehensive and effective engagement by PCs with all levels of local
      government and affected residents is critical to address land acquisition and
      compensation issues. In addition, IAs and the Bank need to be ready for related
      challenges: (i) negotiating with affected households about the compensation
      package; (ii) collaborating with local authorities in daily activities of land
      acquisition, compensation and resettlement; and (iii) unexpected change in project
      design (especially in the transmission line subproject).
   b) The manufacture and delivery of equipment should be properly sequenced with
      civil works; otherwise construction can be delayed. Alternatively, if equipment is
      purchased and left on site for long periods ahead of works commencing, there are
      risks that the equipment could be damaged, stolen or deteriorated.
Implementation of technical assistance
   a) The TA component needs to be supervised intensively so as to ensure the impact
      of outputs to the clients. Client and Bank supervision often focus on
      implementing the investment component, which usually accounts for more than
      90 percent of the total project cost. But it is equally important to implement the
      TA component to bring impacts to the regulatory environment and institutional
      capacity development of the clients. In this regard, the Bank and the client ’s
      supervision should focus more on: (i) ensuring continuous commitment from
      clients about TAs; (ii) monitoring implementation progress of TAs; (iii) critically


                                           23
      reviewing technical outputs; and (iv) aiming to impact the regulatory environment
      and institutional capacity of the client through TAs.
   b) TA activities should be completed well before the end of the project so as to allow
      sufficient time to monitor how the TA outcomes bring positive impact to clients.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1:        Transmission     and    Distribution    Systems    Expansion     and
Reinforcement
Selection of the subprojects
The subprojects listed in the PAD were selected from those in EVN’s PDMP5 or PDMP6,
which were already approved by EVN and ready for procurement. Those projects were in
line with the Project’s objective, namely to facilitate evaluation of power from power
plants to growing load center, and to maintain system reliability and power quality.
Addition of new subprojects was allowed using the following criteria so that the Project
can accommodate the changing priorities in the electricity sector. This criterion was also
used to select subprojects in the Financing Agreement (FA).
 (i) The subprojects will contribute to the aforementioned Project objectives;
 (ii) The subproject will meet international technical standards and best practice, and
       has been formulated after considering other alternative investments
 (iii) The subproject is included in PFMP5 or PDMP6, as being approved by the GoV;
 (iv) The subproject has an economic rate of return of at least 10 percent, and a
       financial rate of return of at least 6.5 percent, calculated using a methodology
       acceptable to the World Bank;
 (v) Subprojects’ EAs, RAPs and EMDP, which are satisfactory to th e Bank, have
       been prepared and disclosed in accordance with the frameworks and guidelines
       adopted by GoV and EVN;
 (vi) All necessary clearances/approvals for implementing the subproject have been
       given by the relevant agencies or authorities; and
 (vii) Financing, procurement and implementation plans satisfactory to the Bank have
       been prepared.
Table 2 shows the list of subprojects included in the PAD/PP, and added/dropped after
the Project approval. As to the original financing, all the three subprojects included in
the component 1.3 of the PAD were transferred to System Efficiency Improvement,
Equitization and Renewable s Project (SEIER). Instead, CPC proposed to included Hoa
Thuan SS, North Dong Hoi SS, and Nam Chu Lai SS. However, Nam Chu Lai 110 kV
substation and branch line, which aimed to supply power to Dung Quat shipbuilding
industry combination factory under Vinashin Group, was cancelled after the completion
of equipment procurement because of the restructuring of Vinashin group and consequent
cancellation of the factory. Agreed by the Bank and EVN, CPC supplemented further two
subs-projects: ‘Increase capacity of My Thanh 110 kV SS’ and ‘Quan Ngang 110 kV SS
and branch line’ for using purchased equipment and materials of Nam Chu Lai 110 kV
substation. Hoc Mon-Hiep Binh Phuoc TL was added to reinforce the connection line to
the 220 kV Hiep Binh Phuoc SS. As to the AF, two subprojects in the reserve list were
not financed since the other eight firm subprojects fulfilled the Project budget.

Implementation of the subprojects
Outputs of subprojects are summarized in Table 3. Of the 24 subprojects, 3 were still
under construction at the time of the Project closure. These are (i) 220 kV Uyen Hung
substation, (ii) 220 kV Tan Dinh –Uyen Hung TL, and (iii) 500 kV Cau Bong SS. For (i)
and (ii), routing of TL and connecting line to the SS was forced to change because of the
modification of local urban planning led by the government, which caused significant
revision of technical specifications and revision of the construction contract. For (iii),
although the substation itself was completed in good timing, construction of the


                                               27
connecting line was delayed due to slow land acquisition and compensation. The Cau
Bong SS was finally completed in October 2014. NPT/SPPMB confirmed the remaining
two subproject swill be completed in 2015.

Component 2: Electricity Market and System Operations Modernization
This component consisted of: (i) the supply and installation of a supervisory control and
data acquisition and energy management system (SCADA/EMS) for the national load
dispatch center (NLDC); (ii) replacement of the existing VietPool Interim Market System
with a fully-functional market management system; and (iii) improving the
telecommunication backbone to support the new systems. The SCADA/EMS and market
system was expected to include both hardware and software to support the system
operator and market operator responsibilities of NLDC.
This component also included consulting service to NLDC staff with technical support,
training procurement, coordination of interface designs of the three different subprojects,
technical advice on an on-call basis, supervision of contractors, factory testing and
training in system commissioning.
This component aimed to complement investment under (a) the System Efficiency
Improvement, Equitization and Renewable s Project (SEIER, Cr.3680) which was to
finance the installation of a commercial metering and a meter management system
required to operate the proposed single buyer power market; and (b) the ADB’s Northern
Power Transmission Project to install 230 Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and associated
communication links at various substations.
The SCADA/EMS subproject faced complex difficulties, which caused its incompletion
at the end of the Project. This is because (i) the feasibility study was not completed even
after the effectiveness of the project, leading to delay of the investment decision by EVN,
which suspended made the selection of the consultant for this subproject, (ii) there was
significant delay of grid code issuance by ERAV, which was the critical determinant of
detailed technical specifications for the whole load dispatching system, and (iii)
finalization of the technical specification was found to be impossible before EVN
formally decided the building to accommodate the system. Even after the effectiveness of


                                             30
the project, EVN was in the selection process to obtain a land for their new headquarter,
where the SCADA system was to be installed. The Bank and EVN discussed various
options to cope with this situation, including financing the land acquisition by this project
fund, and extension of the project closure. In 2009 NLDC signed a contract with an
international consultant to support NLDC during the implementation phases of the
subproject. By the end of 2012 NLDC signed a contract with a main system supplier. At
this stage, it was found to be difficult to complete the system by the end of the project on
June 30, 2014.
The ICR team was informed that the Factory Assurance Test (FAT) was successfully
completed in November 2014, confirming the technical quality of the system. The related
equipment will be shipped and installed in EVN’s headquarter by March 2015, followed
by the final System Acceptance Testing (SAT), which will last for 2-3 months. After
NLDC’s approval for the SAT results, the whole system will start operation by the end of
July 2015. The funds for completing the remaining work have been already secured by
EVN’s own resources.
The ICR mission was informed that the remaining work will be financed by EVN’s own
financial resources, and the SCADA/EMS system will be commissioned at the end of
July 2015.
The remaining subcomponents including the replacement of the existing VietPool Interim
Market System and the improvement of the telecommunication backbone to support the
new systems were not implemented by the decision of EVN/NLDC.
The planned cost estimate was $20.73 million, and the estimated actual cost was $13.41
million (65 percent), reflecting the percentage of completion of installation work.
Component 3: Market Transition Support
There were two TA activities in this component.
Transmission system planning (calculating of the Vietnam power transmission system)
in the period between 2008 and 2015 with perspectives to 2025
The above activity was carried out based on the objective for the Component 3 (see
section 1.5). More specifically, this activity was designed to provide short-term and
medium-term investment plans to serve demand in the period 2008-2015 with an
extended perspective up to 2025. The outcome was expected to be fed into a future
national power development plan (PDMP7).
There was little progress since the Project approval in 2006. This was partly caused by
the transfer of implementing agency from EVN to NPT, which was established in July
2008. At that time, NPT faced a number of difficulties in terms of staffing, allocation of
responsibility and internal procedure. It was August 2009 when the selected international
consultant started its service. They submitted an inception report in September 2009 and
first interim report in March 2010. Further delay was caused due to the disagreement
between NPT and the consultant regarding the latter’s performance against the terms of
reference. As a result, the study’s intended output did not arrive in good timing to provide
guidance for the preparation of PDMP7. So, the contract was terminated and the
consultant was paid 40 percent of the contract value.

Capacity building to enhance NPT’s capabilities in the critical areas of investment
planning and financing, debt management, and the management of regulatory affairs
The additional financing in 2011 included a new TA. The TA comprised support to
improve its: (a) planning and financing of transmission investments with a view to
improving investment decisions; (b) management of liabilities to minimize the impact of
currency depreciation and high interest rates; and (c) determination of tariff adjustment
requirements and management of the regulatory process in order to enhance revenues
from transmission fees.
In 2013, NPT proposed to drop activities (b) and (c) on the grounds that the management
of liabilities was already being addressed under the EVN-wide financial study and that
the need for (c) had been overtaken by events since the procedures for preparing tariff
proposals had already been codified under MoIT Circular No. 14. For activity (a), the
activity focused on developing methodologies for economic and financial evaluation of
transmission projects that were inconsistent among NPT and donors, and developing
internal NPT processes for conducting the evaluation. The hired consultant completed the
study by June, 2014.
NPT reported that the developed methodology for economic and financial analysis will
be used in their future project appraisal after the methodology is reviewed and approved
by NPT’s management board and EVN.
The planned cost estimate was $1.65 million for original financing and $0.50 million for
AF, all of which were to be financed by the Bank. The estimated disbursement is $0.29
million for the original financing and $0.20 million for the AF.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Economic and financial analysis has been conducted to the Component 1 of the project.
Component 1 accounts for 92 percent ($297.75 million) of the total Project cost at PAD
stage, 96 percent ($675.13 million) of the total Project cost at AF stage and 98 percent
($620.61 million) of the total Project cost at completion stage.
A.      Economic Analysis
The economic analysis calculates net present value (NPV) and economic internal rate of
return (EIRR) for each subproject or group of subprojects. Some subprojects are grouped
together when there is an identifiable stream of benefits and costs associated with the
group that cannot be attributed to individual subprojects within the group.
The same methodology, assumptions and constant 2004 prices, and economic discount
rate of 10 percent, which were used at appraisal, were used to make the comparison
between the appraisal stage and completion stage viable. The analysis was carried out
using two scenarios: (i) “with” the project; and (ii) “without” the project scenario. The
“without” scenario means that the individual investment did not take place but the
otherwise system expansion continued unhindered. The project period is assumed to be
20 years after energized. Operation and maintenance cost were assumed to be 2 percent
of the economic capital investment cost. Economic cost includes the cost for land
acquisition, compensation and environmental rehabilitation, but does not include transfer
cost such as tax, duty, and interest during construction (IDC).
The economic benefits theoretically include: (i) increased power sales; (ii) reduction of
transmission or distribution losses; and (iii) increased reliability from reduced
interruption of the power supply caused through faults. In this analysis, only incremental
power sales are taken into account, which allows for conservative estimates of the Project
benefits. Along with the increase of demand in Vietnam, power sales will increase after
the commission of each subproject. But this was not assumed in the calculation to ensure
a further conservative analysis.
Revenue from incremental sales is estimated using the power purchase cost at
transmission level and bulk supply tariff (BST) 15 at the T&D level as a proxy for
economic analysis. This treatment also allows for conservative estimate of the Project
benefit since it ignores consumer surplus, which is difficult to determine by subproject
basis. Increase of these cost level was maintained throughout the project period.
The calculated NPV and EIRR are shown in Table A3-1. Total NPV of $445 million and
EIRR of 22.9 percent clearly demonstrate that this Project has brought substantial
economic benefit to the Vietnamese society. But NPV at completion stage was
significantly reduced from the sum of appraisal and additional financing, which was
caused by delayed implementation of subprojects. The calculated benefit will be
increased if we include other economic benefits such as reduction of
transmission/distribution loss and improvement of supply reliability.

   #: The two closely linked projects were analyzed jointly because the benefits are not separable.
   B.       Financial Analysis
   The financial analysis calculates net present value (NPV) and FIRR for each subproject
   or group of subprojects. The assumption for financial analysis was generally the same as
   that for economic analysis, but the following difference needs to be noted: (i) investment
   cost includes tax, duty and interest during construction (IDC); (ii) revenue from
   incremental energy sales is the product of the difference between the average sales price
   at the point of delivery at that voltage level and the average price paid at the receiving
   point, and the total incremental sales (after deducting loss)16. The financial cash flow was
   discounted at the rate of 6.5 percent. The calculated NPV and FIRR are shown in Table
   A3-2. Total NPV of $385 million and FIRR of 16.6 percent demonstrate that the Project
   has been financially viable. NPV and FIRR at completion stage are a bit higher the

      summation of those at appraisal and AF, mainly because of the increase of general tariff
      levels. It should be pointed out the NPV for several subprojects has become significantly
      lower than the expectations because of the slower implementation of subprojects, leading
      to deeper discount of the NPV.

      C.       Overview of NPT’s Financial Sustainability
      National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) is a fully-owned subsidiary of EVN,
      established in 2008, as the result of the restructuring of EVN. NPT is responsible for the
      construction, operation and maintenance of all the 500kV and 220kV systems in Vietnam.
      Since 2008, NPT suffered net operating losses mainly because of the insufficient
      transmission tariff. Although MoIT Circular No. 14 dated April, 2010, stipulates the
      transmission tariff to be based on a cost-plus approach, the regulation has not fully
      implemented. To meet the rapidly growing investment demand to keep up with the




                                                           35
electricity demand, NPT needed to debt finance large parts of its investment 17 .
Consequently, NPT was not able to comply with the financial covenants required for
loans received from various international financial institutions during 2009-2011. NPT’s
financial situation improved in 2012, resulting in a final net profit for the first time since
its establishment in 2008. The reasons were: (i) increase in transmission tariff from 76
VND/kWh ($0.36 cent/kWh) in 2011 to 83.3 VND/kWh ($0.40 cent/kWh); (ii) favorable
conditions for exchange rate between VND and foreign currencies; and (iii) substantial
devaluation of capital assets18, leading to lowering NPT’s debt-to-equity ratio.
NPT’s key challenge is the financing of its continuing large investment program.
According to the PDMP7, the total transmission investment needs reach 176 trillion VND
($8.2 billion) during 2015-2020.NPT continues to be dependent on profits for the self-
financing its investment program while keeping its debt equity ratio at an acceptable level
to attract loans from international financial institutions.
According the Bank’s TA on “Strategic options for financial recovery of power sector”
an economic tariff level for NPT to cover all the operating cost, depreciation and
financing cost should be at least 50 percent higher than the current level19.
      Figure A3-1: NPT Operating Margin under Adjusted Transmission Tariff




17
   In 2011, over 90 percent of the NPT’s transmission investment was funded with debt.
18
   Auditor for NPT’s financial statement was not able to confi rm the reliability of the revaluation since they
were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about the objectivity of the valuation process.
19
   PM Decision 2165 dated November 2013 approved the raise of average retail tariff (exclusive of VAT)
from 1,437 VND/kWh in 2013 to 1,835 VND/kWh in 2015. Adopting this rate increase to NPT,
transmission tariff should increase from 83.3 VND/kWh ($0.4 cent/kWh) in 2013 to 106.5 VND/kWh ($0.5
cent/kWh) in 2015.

D.     Overview of PC’s Financial Sustainability
In 2010 and as part of the government’s power sector reform program targeted to
strengthen the companies participating in the sector, EVN’s 11 power distribution
companies were legally re-established as five Power Corporations (PCs). They are:
Northern Power Corporation (NPC); Southern Power Corporation (SPC); Central Power
Corporation (CPC); Hanoi Power Corporation (HNPC); and Ho Chi Minh City Power
Corporation (HCMCPC).
The financial performance of PC is more solid and all the PCs generated positive net cash
flows from their operations between 2008 and 2012. That meant that cash receipts from
electricity sales covered all operating and maintenance expenditures. In terms of debt,
PCs are more balanced between debt and equity, partly because they are relatively less
capital intensive.
However, PCs still face major financial challenges. First, investments in distribution
networks executed by PCs based on PMDP 7 are large, totaling 446,354 billion VND
(approx. $23.4 billion) during 2011-2030. Second, PC’s financial performance is strongly
affected not only by the retail tariff but also the mechanism for setting bulk supply tariffs,
which is the price paid by the PCs for electricity purchased from the Single Buyer (EVN)
to supply their customers.
According the study on ‘Strategic options for financial recovery of power sector’,
economic distribution tariffs, to be calculated as the retail tariff minus the bulk supply
tariff, needs to be increased over the time to meet with the demand while complying with
various financial covenants. The required tariff level differs from PC to PC, but on
average, distribution tariffs will have to be increased by at least 35 percent during 2012-
2020.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Summary of Borrower’s ICR
The borrower ICR reports were submitted by all the implementing agencies, including
NPT (including SPPMB and CPPMB), NLDC, HCMCPC, and CPC. This annex
summarizes: (i) implementation issues; (ii) the borrower’s performance; (iii) the Bank’s
performance; and (iv) the lesson learned.
1. Implementation issues
(NPT) Two main shortcomings hampered effective implementation. First, project
preparation was not well advanced upon credit approval, thus requiring first the hiring of
consultants to complete the preparation of the major investment components before they
could be implemented.
(NPT) As to procurement, a dedicated management group comprised of Ministry of
Industry and EVN officials supported the executing agencies of EVN and the NPT, which
were not fully familiar with complex procurement processes. Procurement was slow
overall, since large packages in particular required multiple levels of approval all the way
up to the Prime Minister.
(NPT) As to financial management, there were two recurrent issues: (i) late submission
of financial management reports and audit reports; and (ii) slow processing of
disbursement requests within the GOV and delayed payments, which in some cases had a
noticeable effect on the financial performance of the PCs which for the most part had to
pay their suppliers before the GOV review of the disbursement request was complete.
Financial reporting improved toward the end of the project. The project team reports that
audits were satisfactory throughout and were generally unqualified.
(NPT) There was significant depreciation of the US$ against the SDR (in which the
credit was denominated) in the latter stages of the project. After the May 2005
restructuring, EVN and the PCs were unable to identify sufficient subprojects to use the
balance of the credit amount. Further savings were incurred on the subprojects that were
actually implemented, thus resulting in successive cancellations of SDR 27 million
(US$40 million equivalent) and SDR 11.4 million (US$17 million equivalent).
(CPPMB) In spite of efforts to minimize land acquisition and compensation, CPPMB
encountered difficulties in land acquisition and compensation due to the long distance
(139 km) of the transmission route, despite their effort to minimize it. To overcome the
issue, CPPMB established procedures for route changes, which took a lot of time,
affecting work progress.
(HCMCPC) Because of the obstacles in compensation and site clearance, implementation
schedules were affected.
(HCMCPC) Delay of package implementation was caused by high inflation from 2007 to
2009 which made changes of forex rate, price of goods. Therefore, packages of
substations needed to be re-bid and/or their procurement plan needed to be adjusted.
(CPC) Difficult financial situation of suppliers and contractors in the context of general
difficult period of the economy also slowed down the progress of implementation of
some sub-projects compared to the original plan. However, CPC and PMB have provided


                                            42
maximum support regularly so that contractors could fulfill the contract. In order to
mitigate risks for contractors in process of implementing contracts due to depreciation,
WB agreed and CPC adopted price adjustment form for works contracts.
(CPC) The lay-out of power cut for construction and connection was much difficult,
especially for expanded transformers, power cuts will cause widespread power outages.
Thus, it needed to plan and register the power cut monthly/weekly to be initiative in
construction power cut arrangement. Simultaneously, maximum human resource was
mobilized in power cut days to increase work volume and finish at the registered time.
(CPC) The Nam Chu Lai 110kV substation and branch line was included in a subproject
to supply power to Dung Quat shipbuilding industry combination factory under Vinashin
Group. However, the Government proceeded with restructuring Vinashin Group and the
above factory was transferred to PetroVietnam. While equipment and materials of Nam
Chu Lai 110 kV substation had been already purchased and put into store, PetroVietnam
had no plan of constructing the factory. Being agreed by WB as well as Vietnam
Electricity, CPC supplement further 2 subs-projects: “ Increase capacity of My Thanh
110kV substation” and “Quan Ngang 110kV substation and branch line” to perform
within the framework of TD2 project for using purchased equipment and materials of
Nam Chu Lai 110 kV substation.
(NPT TA) NPT was established in July, 2008. During the transfer period, NPT faced a
number of difficulties in terms of staffing, procedures, legal issues, etc. As a consequence,
it took more time for project implementation, particularly at the beginning stage.
2. The borrower’s performance
(NPT) EVN and the NPT showed strong commitment to the project and implemented the
components, albeit with considerable delays due to procedural requirements not entirely
within their control. Their performance on technical, safeguards and fiduciary aspects
was satisfactory overall. Professionalism and the quality of work among their ranks
improved during the life of the project.
(CPPMB) Contract negotiation process went smoothly and all contracts for the supply of
goods and construction were signed without any delay. Effective coordination among
CPPMB, Consultants and Suppliers led to good implementation of contracts. On the other
hand, CPPMB faced a lot of difficulties in compensation as the line passed through a long
distance from Bac Giang province to Quang Ninh province. With the support from local
authorities, CPPMB managed to resolve the compensation issue and complete the
subproject by the end of the Project.
(HCMCPC) The Corporation has made all efforts to meet the requirements of the Bank,
EVN in order to ensure the completion of three subprojects under subcomponent 1.2.
(CPC) In spite of all the CPC’s efforts, implementation progress of a number of sub-
projects was low. It is necessary to learn from experience to shorten time of organizing
and carrying out future projects.
3. The Bank’s performance
(CPPMB) Through implementation support mission, the implementation progress and
issues arisen were effectively monitored by the Bank and measures were recommended.


                                            43
The Bank also worked with MOIT to support CPPMB in solving compensation issues
faced at some districts. Also, the Bank’s supervision enabled CPPMB to make necessary
adjustment to develop a realistic work schedule. Besides, the energy team of World Bank
in Vietnam is very enthusiastic. They work very closely and willing to support
EVNNPT/CPPMB when needed. Without their great support, the completion of the
project would have been impossible.
(HCMCPC) The Bank is highly responsible and enthusiasm for supporting EVNHCMC
during project implementation, especially for implementation of disbursement,
withdrawal applications, periodic financial reports and procurement.
(NPT TA) As to the design, implementation and evaluation, the coordination between
NPT and the World Bank has been very close since the early stage of the Project. The
World Bank always supported NPT and gave necessary advice immediately. Kind
assistance and instructions from the World Bank during the project implementation has
made a significant contribution to the success of NPT operations.
4. The lesson learned
(CPPMB) Implementing agencies need to work with the People’s Committee at district
and city/province levels at the early stage to propose measures to address land acquisition
and compensation issues. This enables local authorities to better understand the
importance of providing government directions towards the successful implementation of
the project. More importantly, it is necessary to coordinate with local compensation
councils to arrange meetings to actively provide information and guidance to the affected
people.
(HCMCPC) To avoid adverse impacts on the environment that cannot be adequately
mitigated by the Project, the implementing agency needs to perform the initial screening
to determine how the subprojects cause serious impacts.
(HCMCPC) The implementing agency should accurate the secondary data serving for
assessment of the impacts on environment and society for the environment and affected
people.
(HCMCPC) The performance of safeguards and other activities including site clearance
under the project period shall be smooth and prompt with close cooperation between the
implementing agency and the local authorities.
(CPC) Early approach the local authorities prior to project implementation, provide
information and analysis of project’s efficiencies and requirements needing local’s help.
In case the local does not meet the project’s requirements, reasonable adjustments should
be considered. It is important to cooperate closely with local authorities to carry well the
compensation and clearance; solve problems quickly to ensure construction conditions.
(CPC) As to procurement, it is important to organize the bidding well in order to select
the qualified contractors with reasonable prices, to organize the procurement of materials
and equipment immediately after the approved investment projects, shorten the bidding
time, enhance the management of supplier contracts and ensure the quality and quantity
of goods so that material supplying synchronizes with construction progress. For the too-
low bidding cases, it is needed to check the abnormal price factors before contract award



                                            44
in order to avoid the risk of quality construction or the contractor cannot complete
construction due to losses.
(NPT TA) The TA should be implemented earlier (i) to reserve sufficient time to apply
TA outcomes to the actual operation of NPT; and (ii) to accommodate the time-
consuming procedure for Vietnam’s approval process.
Comments on Draft ICR
(NPT) The report just focused on the technical efficiency of Quang Ninh - Hiep Hoa 500
kV TL. The efficiency of other subprojects should be additionally mentioned (as
discussed in the NPT's Final ICR).
(NPT) Benefit of TA Activity 2 (by PPA consultant): At the time of implementation,
only the methodology and model for financial - economic analysis of generation projects
(prepared by MOIT) and of distribution projects (by WB) are available. No model for
transmission projects. This is the first model for such a project. NPT will apply, fine tune
(if necessary) and recommend the MOIT to officially issue for nationwide use.
