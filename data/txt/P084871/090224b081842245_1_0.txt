                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to meeting its development objectives of supporting the efficient development of Vietnam's transmission and distribution system that will be demonstrated by
                         the amount of power generation capacity connected to the electricity grid through transmission links financed by the project; the reduced number and duration of power interruptions
                         in the transmission and distribution systems; and the level of minimum voltages during peak times at the system weak points.
                         The project finances a total of 15 sub-projects under original credit and 8 sub-projects under additional financing, including the construction of power transmission and distribution
                         lines and substations of 500kV, 220kV and 110kV. Among the 15 sub-projects, 7 sub-projects are completed and fully operational and the remaining 8 sub-projects are in advanced
                         stage of implementation. Project commitments are currently 95% for the original credit and 60% for the AF respectively. Total disbursements are at 54% of total project funds. Most
