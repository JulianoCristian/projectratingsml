                         The project's objective of supporting the efficient development of Vietnam's transmission and distribution system will be demonstrated by the amount of power generation capacity
                         connected to the electricity grid through transmission links financed by the project; the reduced number and duration of power interruptions in the transmission and distribution
                         systems; and the level of minimum voltages during peak times at the system weak points.

                         From the original credit, the project finances a total of 14 sub-projects, including the construction of power transmission and distribution lines and substations. Among the 14 sub-
                         projects, 4 sub-projects are completed and fully operational since August 2010. These include two 500kV substations and transmission lines and two 110kV substations. The physical

                         works for 5 sub-projects of 500kV and 5 sub-projects of 220kV substations and transmission lines are about 70% completed. The procurement of the SCADA/EMS system is under
                         final stage after being delayed by 3 months.

                         The completion rates for the construction of transmission and distribution lines are intermediate outcome indicators and are on track to being achieved and overall progress towards
