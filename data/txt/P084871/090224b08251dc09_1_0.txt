                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to meeting most of its development objectives of supporting the efficient development of Vietnam's transmission and distribution system. There is a high
                         likelihood that the PDO will be achieved by the project closing date with significant contributions already made to improvements to the efficiency of the transmission and distribution
                         system and with the accomplishment of the structural and institutional goals of unbundling and establishing the transmission business in a separate subsidiary. There will likely be
                         some shortfalls in that the objective of replacing the SCADA system in NLDC which is intended to improve system dispatch efficiency will only be achieved when the related
                         investments are completed after the project closing date and so will two transmission and distribution sub projects. The project finances a total of 24 sub-projects including the
                         construction of power transmission and distribution lines and substations of 500kV, 220kV and 110kV. 22 sub-projects out of 24 sub-projects are either completed or will be

                         completed by June 30, 2014 and the remaining 2 sub-projects are in advanced stage of implementation, but will be completed only after the project has closed. Key performance
                         indicators for the PDO remain relevant and useful in assessing progress towards achieving the PDO. The majority of the indicators have already been achieved and/or exceeded the
                         targets. These confirm that the project has contributed to increasing the overall system efficiency and to improvement of reliability and quality of transmission and distribution service,
                         as demonstrated by: (i) increased new generation capacity (2,250MW compared to target of 1,200MW) connected via 500kV transmission system links financed by the project; (iii)
