"8026", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Second Transmission and Distribution\n            Project for Vietnam received a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome rating with moderate risk to development outcome.\n            Both the Bank and Borrower received moderately satisfactory\n            performance ratings. No components were revised although\n            several subprojects in Component 1 of the original financing\n            were dropped or replaced by similar subprojects, while seven\n            new projects were added in the Additional Financing (AF).\n            Also, a new technical assistance: \u0091capacity building to\n            enhance National Power Transmission Corporation\u0092s (NPT)\n            capabilities in the critical areas of investment planning\n            and financing, debt management, and the management of\n            regulatory affairs\u0092 was included in Component 3. The closing\n            date was extended by six months in the first restricting, to\n            allow adequate time for processing the AF. Secondly,\n            following the approval of the AF on March 29, 2011, the\n            closing date was extended another three months to provide\n            enough time for implementing newly added subprojects. The\n            following five lessons were learned through this project:\n            (1) Flexibility is important when a project has a large\n            number of subprojects that are implemented over a long\n            period of time. This approach helps to better select\n            important T&D subprojects, leading to efficient use of\n            funds and better achievement of the PDO. (2) Project design\n            needs to consider readiness of subprojects so as to realize\n            smooth implementation and timely disbursement. (3) The\n            previous approach described in \u00912\u0092 is far more critical for\n            implementing subprojects that introduce technologies where\n            implementing agencies has limited experience. (4) In a\n            transmission and distribution project, key performance\n            indicators should be designed to capture impacts that are\n            brought by specific investments. (5) Project financial\n            covenants turned out to be ineffective and the financial\n            challenges need to be addressed more holistically at the\n            overall sector level."}, "docdt": "2014-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
