                                      SECTION 1
                                    INTRODUCTION
A.    The Project

1.    The overall development objective of the VN TD 2 projects is to:
      • To alleviate power shortages and improve the quality of power supplies by improving
            transmission and distribution network capacity;
      • Raise transmission and dispatch efficiency and improve power system reliability; and
      • Promote and support the reform and restructuring of the electricity sector.

2.    The project will include three Project Components:


Component 1: Transmission and distribution expansion and reinforcement

This component will support investments at the 500 kV transmission level as well as in the
220 kV and 110 kV sub-transmission levels to alleviate power shortages and reduce
equipment overloads, and improve system reliability and efficiency by upgrading and
modernizing the transmission and distribution system. At the 500kV level, about 540 km
transmission lines and 1500 MV A of new transformers will be built to enable the evacuation
of power from the planned major generation centers at 0 Mon in the South and at Quang Ninh
in the north. Substation reinforcements will be made at 500 kV and 220 kV levels to meet
increased demand in Ho Chi Minh city. Additional measures will also be taken to strengthen
transmission system control, protection and reactive capability so as to improve the quality
and stability of the bulk power system. At the 220 kV level, the Project consists of two GIS
substation constructed in Southern Vietnam. The capacity of the Binh Tan and Hiep Binh
Phuoc 220 kV substations is 1000 MV A.

At the 110kV level, about 50 km of lines and 80 MVA to new transformer capacity will be
built to improve network capacity, remove bottlenecks and meet growing demand from
smaller load centers in Central Vietnam. Additional subcomponents may be substituted for
proposed investments beyond the first year based on criteria set out in the project pre-
feasibility study, and joint agreement between IDA and the Government of Vietnam.

Implementing agencies of the component are EVN Central and Southern Project Management
Boards, Hochiminh City Power Company and Power Company 3 (EVN PMBs). Other
implementing agencies under EVN may be added at later stages upon agreement with IDA.


Components 2 and 3: Strengthening of the NLDC and integration with Commercial
Metering, Technical Assistance and Capacity Building

To implement for the first project component, land acquisition will be required. According to
the project design, three (03) separate RPs will be prepared prior to the appraisal of the
project. These include the RPs for the Cai Lay to Nha Be line / 0 Mon substation, and for the
two GIS substations at the Binh Tan and Hiep Binh Phuoc.

RPs of remaining project phases will be prepared later based on the proposed project
implementation schedule and this Resettlement Policy Framework (one RP for each
sUbcomponent).

B.   Definition of Key Terms

     i)Displaced Persons (DPs)

     The DPs include the person or persons, household, firm, or a private or public
     institution to be identified by the baseline information collected for each of the
     Inventories and Resettlement Plans (RPs) as specified in E, Surveys and
     Documentation, Para. (iii), who, on account of the execution of the Project, has
     experienced or would experience direct economic and social impacts caused by:

     (a)    the involuntary taking of land, resulting in:

            •     relocation or loss of shelter;

            •     loss of assets or access to assets; or

            •     loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not such person
                  must move to another location; or

     (b)    the involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and protected
            areas, resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihood of such person.

     "Displaced Persons" means, collectively, all such Displaced Persons.

     ii)    Compensation

     Compensation includes the process of financial or material reimbursement of DPs who
     lost partial or the absolute value of their assets as a result of the Project. Compensation
     also includes the valuation and reimbursement in monetary terms or in kind of financial
     and physical losses as a result of impacts of the Project.

     iii)   Cut-off date

     The cut-off-date is the last day of the survey when all DPs have been accounted for.
     After the cut-off date, no other DPs may be included in the inventory of DPs. The
     inventory lists all potential DPs, including their baseline information. People who move
     residences or business assets into or within the marked right of way after the cut-off
     date are not entitled to compensation under this policy framework.

     iv)    Rehabilitation

     Rehabilitation means providing assistance to DPs severely affected due to the
     substantial or entire loss of productive assets, incomes, employment or sources of
     living, to supplement payment of compensation for acquired assets in order to improve,
     or at least achieve full restoration of incomes and living standards to the pre-project
     levels.

v)    Replacement Cost

With regard to land and structures, "Replacement Cost" is defined as follows:

      (a) For agricultural land: it is the pre-project or pre-displacement, whichever is
            higher, market value of land of equal productive potential or use located in
            the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of preparing the land to levels
            similar to those of the affected land, plus the cost of any registration and
            transfer taxes.

      (b) For land in urban areas: it is the pre-displacement market value of land of
            equal size and use, with similar or improved public infrastructure facilities
            and services and located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of
            any registration and transfer taxes.

      (c) For houses and other structures, it is provided by the Provincial People's
            Committee based on the market cost (at the time of compensation) of the
            materials to build a replacement structure with an area and quality similar to
            or better than those of the affected structure, or to repair a partially affected
            structure, plus the cost of transporting building materials to the construction
            site, plus the cost of any labor and contractors' fees, plus the cost of any
            registration and transfer taxes. In determining the replacement cost,
            depreciation of the asset and the value of salvage materials are not taken
            into account, nor is the value of benefits to be derived from the project
            deducted from the valuation of an affected asset.

      (d) Crops, trees and other perennials based on current market value

            1.    Compensation for annual crops is equivalent to the production over the
                   last three years multiplied by the market price for agricultural products
                   at the time of the calculation of the compensation.

            11.   Compensation for trees includes total investment cost plus production
                   cost from the time of its planting to the expropriation. In case this cost
                   cannot be determined: the compensation will be calculated on the
                   basis of the type, age and productive value.

         Other assets (i.e .• income, cultural, aesthetic) based on replacement cost or cost
      of mitigating measures. For example, compensation for the removal of graves
      includes all expenditures for exhumation, removal and reconstruction to its
      original state.

vi)   Resettlement

Resettlement refers to all measures tal<:en by the Project Proponent to mitigate any and
all adverse social impacts of a project on the DPs, including compensation for lost
assets and incomes and the provision of other entitlements, income rehabilitation
assistance, and relocation, as needed.

vii)    Righ t of Way

For this Policy Framework, Right of Way (ROW) is determined as a safety corridor
along a power line or substation with width, length and height specified in the Decree
54/1 9991ND-CP dated July 8,1999 (Gov. Decree 106/2005IND-CP, Aug.l7'\ 2005 at
present)on Protection of Safety for High Voltage Power System.

viii) Vulnerable Groups

Vulnerable groups include those distinct groups of people who might suffer
disproportionately or face the risk of being marginalized by the effects of resettlement,
and specifically include:
(a)        Poor and very poor communes as identified by the 1999 national survey results.

(b)     Ethnic minorities (see Policy Framework and Guidelines for Ethnic Minority
Development Plan).

(c)        Mentally and physically handicapped people or people in poor physical health.

(d)        Infants, children and women.

(e)        Households without security of tenure or with tenure status.

ix)     DPs Without Legal Title

DPs without legal title are occupants of land and housing without legal ownership rights
and individuals or groups of people with shops conducting business in the immediate
project areas without official registration and will be adversely impacted by the Project
through displacement. DPs without legal title are entitled to compensation provided
their assets affected by the project were documented in the pre-project census prior to
the cut off date.
  47.

x)      Ethnic I Indigenous People

Ethniciindigenous People are defined as"persons who belong to a minority tribal group
affected in part or in total (temporarily or permanently) by the Project due to acquisition
of their lands, dWellings, disturbance of their place of work, and other Project-related
adverse impacts.

xi)     Land Use Registration Certificate (LURC)

LURC is similar to a title granted to DPs that legalize their use of the lands and/or
houses they occupy.

xii)    Relocation Site

The relocation site is defined as the area allocated for the resettlement of DPs living in
the areas of TD2 sub-projects that are severely affected and who choose relocation over
cash compensation.

C.    Policy Framework

This resettlement policy framework prepared based on the OP 4.12 of the World Bank on
involuntary resettlement (December, 2001). The principle objective of the Policy Framework is
to ensure that all displaced persons (DPs) will be compensated for their losses at replacement
cost and provided with rehabilitation measures to assist them to improve, or at least maintain,
their pre-project living standards and income earning capacity.

The Policy Framework lays down the principles and objectives, eligibility criteria of DP's,
entitlements, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation,
people participation features and grievances procedures that will guide the compensation,
resettlement and rehabilitation of the DPs.

D.   Principles and Objectives

The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Policies 4.12 (OP 4.12) have been
adopted in preparing this Policy Framework. In this regard the following principles and
objectives would be applied:

     (a)   Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized
           as much as possible.

     (b)   All DP's residing, working, doing business or cultivating land in right of way
           (ROW) of transmission line (TIL), surrounding areas of tower foundation, the
           substation areas, in the service roads under the project as of the date of the
           baseline surveys are entitled to be provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient
           to assist them to improve or at least maintain their pre-project living standards,
           income earning capacity and production levels. Lack of/egal rights to the assets
           lost should not bar the DPs from entitlement to such rehabilitation measures.

     (c)   The rehabilitation measures to be provided are: (i) compensation at replacement

E.     Resettlement Plan (RP)


The scope and level of detail of the resettlement plan vary with the magnitude and complexity
of resettlement.

Abbreviated Resettlement Plan

In case impacts on the entire displaced population are minor 1, or fewer than 200 people are
affected, an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan (ARP) will be prepared by the respective Project
Management Board (PMB) and consolidated by EVN for any given year, and furnished to the
World Bank for its concurrence.

Each Abbreviated Resettlement Plan will cover the following minimum elements: (1) a
census survey of displaced persons, and valuation of assets; (2) description of compensation
and other resettlement assistance to be provided: (3) consultation with displaced persons
about acceptable alternatives; (4) institutional responsibility for implementation and
procedures for grievances redress;: and (5) a timetable and budget. In the case some displaced
persons, lose more than 20% of their productive assets or require physical relocation, the plan
also covers a socioeconomic survey and income restoration measures.

The Abbreviated Resettlement Plan will be completed by no later than tour months prior to the
estimated date tor commencement of the works under the project. Each Abbreviated
Resettlement Plan will be furnished to the World Bank tor consideration no later than three
months prior to the actual initiation of/he works under the Project. Compensation, resettlement
and rehabilitation activities will only commence after the World Bank has found acceptable the
respective Abbreviated Resettlement Plan and EVN has approved it The compensation,

                INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A.    Institutional Framework

The responsibility for preparing and implementing the Policy Framework and RPs are as
follows:

      (a)   The overall responsibility for enforcement of the Policy Framework and for
            planning and implementing RPs rests with PMBs and Power Companies in charge
            of EVN (EVN PMB). EVN PMB is responsible for preparing Inventories and RPs
            and for the day-to-day implementation thereof within their respective jurisdiction.
            The peoples committees at the commune level will ensure the active and effective
            participation of the DPs in the preparation and implementation of RPs. In order to
            have RPs acceptable to the World Bank to implement the RP smoothly, EVN PMB
            is responsible for i) hiring qualified consultants to prepare RPs; ii) appointing
            qualified social safeguard staff at each PMB.

      (b)   Funds for implementing RPs will be from EVN funds, established in consultation
            with local governments (provincial, district and commune peoples committees) and
            the DPs.

B.   Legal Framework

This section reviews the legal framework and policies of the Government of Vietnam and
IDA policies related to land acquisition, compensation and resettlement. It then compares the
two approaches. Since there are differences between the WB's policy and the Vietnamese's,
the Project requires a waiver of the Vietnamese Government articles of decrees and
regulations concerning compensation and resettlement. Subsequently, compensation and
resettlement plans will be implemented according to the project policies.

This Resettlement Policy Framework will apply the various laws, degrees, and circular
regulating use ofland in Vietnam as well as the World Bank policy.

                                                 Con'ected Resettlement Policy Framework August 2007
1/1   The 2003 Land Law enacted by the National Assembly of Viet Nam on November 26,
          2003, provides that: "the persons with land to be recovered shall be compensated
          with the assignment of new land of the same use purposes; if having no land for
          compensation, shall be compensated with the land use right value at the time of
          issuance of the recovery decisions. The People's Committees of the provinces and
          centrally-run cities shall elaborate and execute resettlement projects before the
          land recovery for compensations with dwelling houses, residential land for
          persons having residential land recovered and having to move their places of
          residence. The resettlement zones must have development conditions being equal
          to or better than the conditions in the former places of residence. In cases of
          having no resettlement zones, the persons having land recovered shall be
          compensated with money and given priority to purchase or lease dwelling houses
          under the State's ownership, for urban areas; be compensated with residential
          land, for rural areas. In case of recovering land of households and/or individuals,
          that are directly engaged in production, but having no land for compensation for
          continued production, apart from pecuniary compensations, the persons having
          land recovered shall be supported by the State to stabilize their lives, with training
          for change of their production and/or business lines, with the arrangement of new
         jobs." (Article 42)

World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)

18.1     The primary objective of the World Bank policy is to explore all alternatives to
avoid or at least minimize involuntary resettlement. Where resettlement is unavoidable,
the living standards of displaced persons should be restored or improved relative to
those conditions that prevailed prior to the Project. The policy applies to the taking of
land and other assets when land acquisition results in the loss of shelter, the loss of all or
part of productive assets, or access to them, and the loss of income sources or other
means of livelihood.

18.2     Measures required to ensure that resettlement has a positive outcome include:
         •    Consulting with potential DPs on feasible measures for resettlement and
              rehabilitation;
                                            A-lO
                                                        Second Transmission and Distribution Project
                                               Corrected Resettlement Policy Framework August 2007
         •      Providing DPs with options for resettlement and rehabilitation;
         •      Enabling their participation in planning and selecting these options;
         •      Providing compensation at full replacement cost for losses;
         •      Choosing relocation sites that provide, at a minimum, the same benefits and
                services as the sites they replace;
         •      Providing allowances, training and income support to assist in making a
                smooth transition;
         •      Identifying vulnerable groups and providing special assistance to these groups;
                and,
          •     Establishing an institutional and organizational structure that supports this
                process to a successful end.

18.3     Eligibility Criteria and Compensation and or assistance:

       18.3.1   The displaced or project-affected people eligible for compensation and or
                assistance will include: (a) those who have formal legal rights to land or
                other assets; (b) those who initially do not have formal legal rights to land
                or other assets but have a claim to legal rights based upon the laws of the
                country; upon the possession of documents such as land tax receipts and
                residence certificates; or upon the permission of local authorities to occupy
                or use the project affected plots; and (c) those who have no recognizable
                legal right or claim to the land they are occupying.


       18.3.2   Persons covered under (a) and (b) are provided compensation for the land
                they lose, and other assistance. Persons covered under (c) are provided
                resettlement assistance, in lieu 0/ compensation for the land they occupy, and
                other assistance, as necessary, to achieve tlte objectives set Ollt in this policy,
                if they occupy the project area prior to a cut-off dates defined in RPs.
                Persons who encroach on the areas after the cut~off date defined in RPs
                are not entitled to compensation or any other form of resettlement
                assistance.

Valuation of and Compensation for Losses: T!:te methodology to be used in the valuation of
losses for Bank-associated Projects is based on their replacement cost. In this Project, losses
comprise land, structures and other assets. Replacement cost for land include the value of land
at market price plus the cost taxes and fees to get Land Use Right Certificate (LURC). For
houses and other structures, the market cost of the materials should be used to calculate the
replacement cost to build a replacement structure with an area and the quality should be at
least as good as those affected. For both totally and partially affected structures, compensation
includes market cost of material, plus the costs of material transport, labor and contractor fees,
registration and transfer taxes. Depreciation of the asset and amount saved in materials will
not form a part of replacement cost.

Comparison between Government of Vietnam and World Bank Approaches

There are a number of ways in which the approaches of the Vietnam Government -
either in policy or practice - are compatible with World Bank guidelines. The most
important compatibilities are:

                                               A-Ii
                                                          Second Transmission and Distribution Project
                                                 Corrected Resettlement Policy Framework August 2007
      Vietnam has a process whereby most people without legal land rights may meet
      conditions of legalization and receive compensation for losses.
•     Permanent residents are provided with options that include relocation to an improved
      site, or cash, or a combination of the two.
•     Resettlement sites offer not only better improved infrastructure and services but
      represent a higher standard of living.
•     Allowances are provided to help the DPs in the transition period and there is an
      institutional structure through which people are informed, can negotiate compensation,
      and can appeal.
•     Differences between the approaches and measures that need to be addressed within the
      program also exist. However, in this context, procedures exist within national and City
      governments that allow the granting of waivers of domestic law on specific projects that .
      may be in conflict with that of the funding agency.
•     On the issue of land tenure and the legal right to compensation, the Government and
      World Bank approaches are compatible. The government has its -own process in place
      whereby land occupied without legal documentation can be legalized; this land,
      however, is compensated for at a rate equal to 100% of land price minus the taxes and
      fee for land use right registration from 15 October 1993 (Article 6, 7, 9, 10 of Decree
      38/2000 ND-CP on the payment for the Land Use Right).

c.    Required Waivers

In order to meet the requirements of the World Bank OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement a
number of articles in various Vietnamese laws and regulations which do not ensure
compensation at replacement cost or set eligibility provisions which do not extend the right to
rehabilitation and or assistance to households without proper land paper, will be waived.
The articles of law and regulations that will be waived are mentioned below:

Eligibility to Compensation and or assistance - Decree 197

Article 7 of Decree 197 (Cases where land is recovered without compensation) stipulates that
any person whose land is recovered and who has not met one of the conditions of Article 8 of
this Decree, or who has violated the plan, or who violates the protecting corridor work, or
who illegally occupies land shall not receive compensation when the state recovers the land.
In case of necessity, the Provincial People's Committee shall consider and decide on a case-
by-case basis.

Article 18,19,20 of Decree 197:
         •    Houses and structures on non-eligible-for-compensation land, which have not
              violated announced land use plans or the right of way will be assisted at 80%
              of replacement cost
        •     Houses and structures on non-eligible-for-compensation land, which have
              violated announced land use plans or the right of way will not be assisted. If
              necessary, the PPC will consider on the case by case basis.

                                               Corrected Resettlement Policy Framework August 2007
Article 28, 29 of Decree 197: DPs losing more than 30% of productive land will be entitled to
living stabilization and training/job creation assistance

To ensure that the objectives of this resettlement policy are met, a special decision of the
Government waiving Article 7, 18, 19,20,28,29 of Decree 197 is needed to permit assistance
and rehabilitation measures for illegal users ofland as proposed in the policy.

Price of Land for Calculation of Compensation

Article 9 of Decree 197: The compensation rates for land shall be determined by the PPC for
the type of land which has been used for at the time of land acquisition

To ensure that the objectives of the project resettlement policy are met, unit price for land
compensation established by the Project Provincial/City People's Committees will be adjusted
to meet the replacement costs.

Assistance Policy for DPs who Rent State-owned dwelling houses - Decree 197

Article 21 of Decree I 97/20041ND-CP states that DPs who rent State-owned dwelling houses
shall be provided with monetary supports equal to 60% of the land value and 60% of the value
of currently rented houses, in cases where there are no resettlement houses to be arranged for
them.

To ensure that the objectives of the policy are met, a special decision of the Government of
Vietnam regarding waiver of Article 21 of Decree 197/2004IND-CP is needed to permit
assistance and rehabilitation measures for DPs who share State-owned dwelling houses as
proposed in this policy.

Article 2 of Decree 188/2004IND-CP states that the land price shall be defined by the
provincial People's Committees andlor cities directly under the central government. To ensure
that the objectives of the project resettlement policy are met, unit prices for land
compensation established by the project related provincial/city People's Committees shall be
adjusted to meet the replacement costs.

The Item 4, Article 2 of Decree 17/20011ND-CP dated May 04,2001 to guide on the ODA
management stipulates that "in the case of the international agreements on ODA have been
signed between GOV and sponsor stipUlates other contents, then that international agreements
will be followed"
                                   SECTION 3
                              ENTITLEMENT POLICY

DPs will be entitled to the following types of rehabilitation and assistance measures, for
instance:

     (a)   DP's losing agriCUltural/productive land and crops:

           (i) if the portion of the land to be lost represents 20% or less of the total area of
                 the landholding, and the remaining land is still a viable economic holding,
                 cash compensation, at full replacement cost for the acquired area may be
                 provided to the DP.
