as\n            follows: The project outcome is satisfactory, project\n            sustainability is likely, the institutional development\n            impact is substantial, and the overall performance of the\n            World Bank and the Borrower is satisfactory. The principal\n            lessons learned from this program can be summarized as\n            follows: In designing the project, if reform needs are\n            substantial, it may be more effective to have a series of\n            one-tranche loans rather than one operation involving all\n            reforms. This will allow for faster implementation as the\n            number of actors and agencies involved and the amount of\n            coordination required is reduced. If one of the loan\n            components is not as relevant as the others, it might be\n            more effective to have a separate more focused sectoral\n            operation. It must be recognized however, that although the\n            social component was relatively small, it was very well\n            received by stakeholders. Gradualism in implementation of\n            measures proved the right approach, although planned\n            differently, for the liberalization of utility prices. At\n            the national level, having an active technical and political\n            advice team to ensure project success and catalyze the\n            preparation by identifying action plans taking into account\n            the political economy of the country is desirable. The\n            advice of this team is particularly critical in projects\n            like the Structural Adjustment Loan that required\n            Congressional approval of several laws as conditionality.\n            This team would coordinate actions, seek consensus and\n            analyze the opportunity and advantages of the modalities for\n            the Executive Branch to send law proposals to National\n            Congress. Allowing room for program adjustments and\n            involving key stakeholders during project preparation would\n            catalyze project implementation. Failure to do this delayed\n            implementation of actions in the telecommunication sector\n            and made implementation of the Intergrated System of\n            Financial Management (SIGEF) difficult. The Executing Unit\n            must monitor loan conditionality compliance, as well as\n            alert authorities on the technical and/or political\n            bottlenecks hampering compliance. The participation of\n            various multilateral organizations should be better\n            coordinated. It is troublesome for the different\n            stakeholders and the implementing agency to prepare for\n            different missions with different entities regarding\n            compliance of similar action plans and objectives. The\n            Bank's close supervision of the loan proved very\n            effective, in light of frequent authority changes."}, "docdt": "2003-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
