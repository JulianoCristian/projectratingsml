Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Governance Assistance Project is a multi-component project that has been under implementation since 2007, with the project closing on December
 31, 2014. The major achievements of the project have been:

 1.          The successful development of the Tax Administration Information System (TAIS), which was operationally accepted by the General
             Department of Taxation in November 2014. The TAIS has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and transparency of tax administration
             in Mongolia thereby helping address a major area of weak governance in the country;
 2.          The implementation of a computerized mining cadastre system, which increases the efficiency and transparency of the mining licensing
             system;
 3.          The roll-out of the treasury's Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) to all local governments, thereby significantly
             improving expenditure controls (the development of the treasury system in the Ministry of Finance and roll-out in the central government was
             done under another project);
 4.          Capacity building of the Mongolia anti-corruption agency (the Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC)) in implementing assets,
             income, and conflict of interest declarations, particularly through the use of a web-based portal; and the development of a new survey-based
             corruption perception index to regularly measure the progress in the government’s anti-corruption efforts;
 5.         The completion of the new Household Socioeconomic Survey in 2008/09 and increased data dissemination and transparency by the National
            Statistical Office;
 6.         Passage of the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia (PPLM) and notification of procurement regulations to implement the PPLM, and
            improved procurement monitoring through a web-based procurement monitoring system
 Less success was achieved in the project component related to human resource expenditure management and debt management. The excessive use
 of direct contracting for projects funded by the Development Bank of Mongolia (roughly equivalent to the procurement done under the state budget) also
 weakened the PPLM and the transparency of public procurement. In part these less than satisfactory results were due to factors external to, and beyond
 the control of, the project and in part due to limited follow-on activity by the concerned agency.

         This indicator is based on the Mongolia Corruption Index that was developed by the IAAC based on household, enterprise, and expert
         perception surveys. Three rounds of the survey were done with reports produced in 2010, 2012, and 2014. The values for these three years
         are:
         i) The proportion of transactions (e.g. tender awards, settlement of claims, tax exemptions, tax payment) spent to
         corruption and bribery: 10.4% (2010);11% (2012);6.8% (2014)
         ii) The proportion of businessman who report paying bribes to public servants within the last twelve months: 15%
         (2010);13% (2012);13% (2014)
