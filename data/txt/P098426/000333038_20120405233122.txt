Currently the debt management department operates the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) software version 5.2 for debt management and recording purposes. The project will support up-gradation of DFMAS to version 5.3 and 6.0 in
succession, as well as training to MoF staff in effectively using the software. DMFAS is a proprietary software of UNCTAD and therefore it is not possible to obtain the software upgrade and associated training from other sources. Therefore there will be need to single source staff from UNCTAD to upgrade the software, as well as
provide training to MoF staff.
