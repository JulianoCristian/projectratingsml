                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Governance Assistance Project is a multi-component project that has been under implementation since 2007. The major achievements of the project to date are:

                         -- The development of the Computerized Mining Cadastre System (CMCS) which, coupled with relevant training and organizational changes, improved the quality and speed of the
                         license processing, reducing discretionary actions within the cadastre office and eliminating overlaps with other licenses and protected areas.

                         target of 50 soums. The project financed the first 50 soums, with the rest financed by the state budget, underlining government commitment and the sustainability of the GFMIS. The
                         GFMIS has significantly improved payment processing and budget execution.

                         and enterprise perception surveys, as well as agency risk assessments. The baseline survey was completed in December 2009. The follow-up survey, financed by the government,
                         was conducted in December 2011. The third survey is currently under preparation.
                         -- Tax administration reforms, including the introduction of a regular strategic planning process, introducing risk management procedures, improving taxpayer services and
                         information, and strengthening transparency and integrity.
                         -- Capacity building of the Procurement Policy Department (PPD) of the Ministry of Finance, in particular on procurement monitoring.

                         The development of an integrated tax administration information system (TAIS) is the main remaining activity in the project. TAIS is currently under implementation; it has faced
                         some difficulties and delays.
