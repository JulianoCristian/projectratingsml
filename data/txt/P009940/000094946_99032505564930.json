The key lessons learned include: 1) It is\n            necessary to have flexibility in project design to match the\n            varying requirements and capacities of the individual\n            project states. 2) It is critical to limit the project scope\n            and focus on key interventions, particularly in low capacity\n            settings. 3) It is imperative to give top priority to\n            monitoring and evaluation. Even more crucial is the creation\n            of a culture for using service data as a proactive\n            management tool for timely feedback and corrective actions.\n            4) The project experience reiterates the problem of\n            under-utilization of certain physical facilities constructed\n            under the project, in particular Female Multi-purpose Worker\n            residential accommodation. 5) There are chronic operational\n            problems that adversely affect implementation of all Family\n            Welfare Projects in weaker states. Unless resolved at a more\n            macro level, they continue to constrain implementation and\n            create problems of long range sustainability. 6) An\n            important lesson is the need for the government to create\n            incentives to the states through performance-based financing\n            during project implementation. 7) This project demonstrates\n            effective use of the lower cost supervision mechanisms based\n            on a strengthened Bank field office presence."}, "docdt": "1999-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
