                         The Development Policy Objective of the proposed operation is to improve public sector management, and expand access to quality public services and economic
                         opportunities for the extremely poor in the State of Sergipe.

                         The proposed operation is fully consistentwith the overarching objective of the CPS 2012-2015, and with the strategic objectives of enhancing the efficiency of public
                         investments, improving quality and expand provision of public services, and promoting regional economic development. It is also fully aligned with the Government of
                         Sergipe’s goal to eradicate poverty, as outlined in the Multiyear Participatory Plan (PPA-P) 2012-2015.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The operation is effectively supporting the State of Sergipe to improve public sector management, and expand access to quality public services and economic opportunities for the
                         extremely poor. For instance, the Project has contributed to: (i) improving public sector management by increasing responsiveness to citizen complaints; (ii) expanding quality
                         services by increasing the number of state maternity hospitals implementing risk classification for admissions and state schools selecting directors by merit; and (iii) expanding
                         economic opportunity for the poor by increasing the number of trained small producers accessing markets to sell their products. It is also aligned with the the Government of Sergipe’s
                         goal to eradicate poverty, as outlined in the Multiyear Participatory Plan (PPA-P) 2012-2015.
