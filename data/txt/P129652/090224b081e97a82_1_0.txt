                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The Development Policy Objective of the proposed operation is to improve public sector management, and expand access to quality public services and economic
                         opportunities for the extremely poor in the State of Sergipe.

                         The proposed operation is fully consistent with the overarching objective of the CPS 2012-2015, and with the strategic objectives of enhancing the efficiency of public
                         investments, improving quality and expand provision of public services, and promoting regional economic development. It is also fully aligned with the Government of
                         Sergipe’s goal to eradicate poverty, as outlined in the Multiyear Participatory Plan (PPA-P) 2012-2015.
