       outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: reform\n            processes require a long-term commitment and have a steep\n            learning curve, especially at their onset. The experience of\n            the State of Sergipe indicates that there is no unique\n            template of processes and institutions for a successful\n            management model. Actions that depend on the coordination\n            with other levels of the government require special\n            attention. The challenge will be for the Bank to find an\n            appropriate manner to disseminate the case of Sergipe more\n            broadly and replicate this experience effectively elsewhere,\n            taking into account the dissimilarities between the states\n            as they relate to size, economic profile, and population."}, "docdt": "2015-12-24T23:49:03Z"}
