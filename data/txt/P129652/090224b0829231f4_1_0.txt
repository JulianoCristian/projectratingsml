Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The operation is effectively supporting the State of Sergipe to improve public sector management, and expand access to quality public services and
 economic opportunities for the extremely poor. Specifically, the Project has contributed to: (i) improving public sector management by increasing
 responsiveness to citizen complaints; (ii) expanding quality services by increasing the number of state maternity hospitals implementing risk
 classification for admissions and state schools selecting directors by merit; and (iii) expanding economic opportunity for the poor by increasing the
 number of trained small producers accessing markets to sell their products. It is also aligned with the the Government of Sergipe’s goal to eradicate
 poverty, as outlined in the Multiyear Participatory Plan (PPA-P) 2012-2015.

 The loan is fully disbursed having fully achieved its development objectives by the original closing date of December 31, 2014.
