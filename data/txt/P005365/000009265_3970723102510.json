Overall,\n            second Sebou presents a mixed picture of achievements and\n            failures. The Sebou National Sugarcane Factory Company\n            (SUNACAS) sugarcane factory was built and started up on\n            schedule and has made good progress in improving factory\n            operations, largely as a result of a comprehensive and\n            effective training program. However, the factory has\n            experienced much lost time for lack of cane, caused by the\n            combination of frost in 1976, lower-than-projected average\n            sugarcane yields in all years, lagging efforts to improve\n            the sugarcane harvesting-transport operations, and the\n            start-up of sugar production at the nearby new Sucrerie\n            raffinerie de canne du Gharb (SURAC) sugarcane factory in\n            1981. As a result of these factors and an annually fixed\n            sales price set too low by the Government, SUNACAS lost\n            money in each of its first nine years of operation, and its\n            financial structure became greatly weakened. Shortfalls in\n            sugar production, caused mainly by inadequate supply of\n            sugarcane, taken together with sharply reduced world sugar\n            prices and a poor price outlook, have resulted in a\n            recalculated economic rate of return (ERR) of 3.7 percent."}, "docdt": "1985-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
