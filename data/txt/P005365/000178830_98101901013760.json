agriculture under the\n            Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project and to confine flood\n            overspill from the Sebou river to three flood escape\n            channels; resettlement of families

supervision of construction of the flood\n            protection works; (d) the construction of a sugarcane\n            factory at Mechra bel Ksiri; (e) a study of existing\n            industrial pollution of the lower Sebou river and, if\n            justified by such study, construction of an effluent\n            treatment plant to prevent pollution of the Sebou river; (f)\n            improvements to about 100 km of primary and secondary roads,\n            bituminous surfacing of about 100 km of tertiary and\n            unclassified access roads and construction of a new bridge\n
