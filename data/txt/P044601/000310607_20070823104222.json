development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) improved transport conditions of rural roads\n            can translate into better access to social services (health,\n            education) and to income-generating opportunities; 2)\n            participatory planning and inclusion can ensure better\n            targeting of resources while better responding to community\n            needs; 3) maintenance strategy for transport infrastructure\n            can act as a catalyst for developing private sector and\n            entrepreneurial attitudes; and 4) women's involvement\n            in road project design and maintenance activities can result\n            in social outcomes commonly ignored by traditional road upgrading."}, "docdt": "2007-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
