Peru,\n            will increase access to basic social services, and to\n            economic, and income-generating activities, to help\n            alleviate rural poverty. The components will: 1) finance\n            roads rehabilitation, to improve accessibility to rural\n            areas, and restore operating conditions along regional\n            economic corridors. Unpaved primary, and secondary roads\n            will be selected for rehabilitation, to be integrated into\n            the consolidated road network; 2) routine, and periodic\n            maintenance of rural roads, and connecting primary, and\n            secondary roads will be strengthened, based on a\n            co-financing arrangement between the central government, and\n            benefited local governments; 3) improve the non-motorized\n            rural transport, by providing technical assistance for\n            village-level infrastructure management, to include\n            community participation in the planning, and implementation\n            of works; 4) pilot an institutional model for managing the\n            rural road network at the provincial level, whose municipal\n            authorities will jointly assume responsibility over the\n            development of a core provincial road network. This will\n            avoid current institutional, and financial segmentation,\n            that prevents municipalities from undertaking integrated\n            initiatives, or responsibilities; 5) pilot the development\n            of strategic frameworks for improving rural accessibility in\n            the Selva region. The pilot will ascertain technical,\n            institutional, environmental, and economic guidelines to set\n            an inter-modal transportation system along rivers; and, 6)\n            further develop the institutional building program, already\n            underway, to improve rural transport policy, and strategies;\n            to improve planning, and management of rural roads; and, to\n            develop community-based micro-enterprises for road maintenance."}, "docdt": "2001-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
