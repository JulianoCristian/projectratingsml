 SYNOPSIS
   A little over 10 years ago, only slightly more than one quarter of Peruvians living in rural areas had ac-
   cess to a road in good condition, hampering their efforts to get to markets, send their children to school,
   or reach health clinics. IBRD joined Peru’s government on a program that has rehabilitated 15,000kms
   of roads, creating 6,000 permanent jobs and 500 microenterprises working on road maintenance.

Good Practices
Developed/Replicated
The Peru Rural Roads program has become a benchmark
and best practice for other rural transport operations in the
Latin America region. The successful experience of the Pe-
ruvian microenterprises has been repeated in countries like
Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras. It was
even introduced on a pilot basis in a rural road program fi-
nanced by the World Bank in China. A toolkit explaining
how a microenterprise program can be designed and imple-
mented was also prepared.

The gender dimension of the Peru Rural Roads Program
was also presented as a best practice in a WB/Asian Devel-
opment Bank workshop on gender and infrastructure, held
in Manila in 2008. The local governance aspects of this pro-
gram were presented at a World Bank conference organized
in 2009 in New Delhi.


Next Steps
The program initially operated in the twelve poorest re-
gions of Peru, representing half of the country. Since 2007,
the project’s scope has been expanded to encompass the en-
tire country.

Under its third phase, the Peru Rural Roads Program is now
trying to promote sound participatory planning practices
