1.     I submit the folloiring report and recom.endations on a proposed
loan of $3.2 mrllion or its equivalent in other currencies to Autoridad
Portuaria de Corinto, iicaragua, (heroinafter sometimqes referred to as
the Port Authority) to finance a port rehabilitation and improvement
project i
PI.T I -   HI3OS;ICEI.
2,     in August l195, the Governmcnt of Nicaragua asked the Bank to con-
sider a loan of about   3.6 million to finance the rehabilitation and im-
provement of the port of Corinto according to a prelimainary design iwhich
had been prepared by a finni of engineering consultants.
3.     A Bank mission visited Nicaragua in September-October 1955 to study
the project.   As a result of suggostions made by the mission, the Govern-
ment, with the approval of the engineering consultants, modified the pro-
ject so as to reduce its estinmiated cost.
4e     In January 1956, in accordance with a suggestion from thae Bank, a
law r,as passed creating a Port Authority of Corinto to takce over the owner-
ship and operation of thie port from tlhe Pacific Railroad of Nicaragua.
5.     In a letter dated Ma.:rch 16, 1°56 (see R-952) the management of the
Bank infonred tlhe Goverrnment that it v.ould be prepared to enter iatO
negotiations for a loan to finance the foreign exclange costs of the pro-
ject as soon as the preliminary plans and cost estimates had been reviewed
by a nevr firm of engineering consultants to which the Government proposes
to entrust the detailed design and supervision of construction.    This
review Yas made in April 1956.
6.     Formal negotiations for a loan began in l.ashington on April 30, 1956.
1r. Modesto Armijo, ,Iinister of Leveloprient and Public VNork., represented
thae Government and also, in his capacity of Chairman of the Board, the Fort
Authority of Corinto.
7.     If the proposed loan vere made, it vould increase the total amount
of Bank loans to Nicaragua to $21,400,000.    The loans already made are
as follovs:

PAJ'-T III - APPRIOSAL OF TTE- PROPOSSED LOAN
18.     A detailed appraisal of the project (T.O. 104-b) is attached
(No. 4).   A report entitled "Ciurent Lconomic Position and Prospects of
Nicaragua" (v.H. 35-a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
February 1, 1955 (Secretary's Mv`emorand%un 1-201).
Justification of the Project
19.    Corinto is the only good hiarbor on Nicaragua's Pacific Coast.
The greater part of Nicaragua's external trade passes through it, and is
likely to do so for many years to come.    In recent years, as a result
of' the expansion of exports,especially of cotton and cottonseed, Corinto
has been seriously congested.   The resulting delays in shinpc-nt have
harmed Nicaraguals relations with foreign buyers and also li-th thle shio-
ping companies, wllich recently placed a surcnarge of 20% on freighlt rates
to obtain somiie compensation for losses resulting from slovw turn-arounds.
20.     An expansion of port facilities is urgently needed, not only to
enable Corinto to handle present traffic, but also future increases.
Even alloving for the apparent end of the cotton boom, it seems probable
that over the long run traffic through Corinto vill gror at the rate of
about 3% per annum.   The expansion no.,w proposed would provide for the
estimated grovith of traffic over a period of about 20 years.
21.     To ensure that the port is efficiently operated, not only wvhen
the new facilities become available, but also during the construction
period, which is likely to be one of operational difficulty, the effec-
tiveness of the proposed loan would be conditional upon the appointment
of a suitable port manager, iho would in the first instance probably have
to come from ouLtside Nicaraguia  In the course of a few years, howrever,
he should be able to train pote-ntial Nicaraguan successors.
22.     The separation of the port from the railroad which has hitherto
owned and operated it, and the establishment of a Corinto Port Authority
as an autonomous goverment agency, should help to ensure efficient
operation.   I am pleased to note that the Government has arranged that
representatives of private enterprise in agriculture, commerce and ship-
ping respectively should sit on the Board of Directors of the Port
Authority.

lActetho(e of Fro-cureon'ent
23.     The purchase of all equi-jrnent for t'.: project, and tlh,e award of
contracts for constructio;i ot:ler than thl4oe for -'-nor orerations *.;which
could best be nerformed by local contractors, would be subject to inter-
natiornal competitive bidJingC
Economic Situaiicn
24,    T'he last ecornomic report on iNicaragua, dated Febr-ary 15, 1255,
described the rapid increase in Ji\cara2Uals produhction and ex;ports since
1950, and Iheld cut good prospects of continued economic  pro-ress, al-
though at a slomer pace.   !-.t the sa.e time, the report pointed out that
in 1953 and 1954 inflationary bank credit e2mansion had imposed a strain
on the balance of payments.    In addition, e:port volume appeared to be
reaching a neak, and the prices of the country's main export crops, cotton
and coffee, v.ere likely to fall in thIe near future.  Th.e report stressed
that, in order to meet this situation, credit e-:ansion would have to be
lim.lited, government deficits avoided, and that the Government shlould ex-
tend its fiscal reform.;s and revie-:r its invcstanent proeram.
2",      ;.'hen thlis economic report was bein; w,ritten, Nicaragua was har-
vestinn record crops of cotton and coffee uhi-ich raised exports and national
income to unprecedentcd levels in 1955.   These high exports brought about
only a srmall increase in foreign excha-nge  reserves, hovever, because
bank credit continued to e%ipand anid imports rose to new heights.  The
boom crops of 1954/55 were followed by serious crop failures in lq-/56%
largely due to heavy rainse   Cotton production was reduced by 15% in
spite of a considerable increase in acreage; the coffee crop was at least
one-fourth below normal, and much of the corn crop was lost.    Happily,
prices kept un, but a fa'l in botl cotton and coffee prices is likIely to
take place before the next harvest.
26.     Nicaragua is therefore faced -ith a serious fall in e:rnort volume
and value in 1956 and has to reckon with tlhe likelihood thact next year
falling prices T,ill offset better crops.   -nfortunately, the country's
foreign exclhange reserves are not adequate to provide a satisfactory
cushion.
27,     The Go-vernment and monetar- authlorities of N.;icaragua are plan-
ning to 3m-nalinize the balance of payments deficit in 1956 by restricting
ban'k credit and avoiding a government deficit,   This will not be easy,
since several projects involving increased expenditures are under way,
and since it is feared that too drastic a restriction of bank credit
might seriously reduce production.    Over the lon-er run, hoi-ever,
Nlicaraguals prospects for economic progress are satisfactory.
28l e    n a leuter to the President of iNicaragua, dated February 15,
195, I drew his attention to the sizeable obligations Nicaragua had
incurred in the for:.- of medium and short term credits in 193 and 1954.
In his reply, the President elxpressed his a..areness of the problems



- 6 -
connected with the excessive ut-ilization of medium and short term
credits.   Since this exchange of views took place, there has been no
significant increase in NEcaraguaIs medi:um and short termi indebtedness,
and the country's external debt situation remains bas-cally the same
as presented in the Economic heport onf lebruary 1955.  Dtring 1956-
1957 payments on mediumxl term credits, contracted principally in 1953 and
1954, vill raise the country's external debtv service to the higih ]evel
of above    million annually.   This ;ill aggrava-te the balance of pay-
ments problem which Micaragua will have to face during these years.   On
the other hand, the service of long-termi1 external debt will remlin at the
moderate level of betwreeln 42 and ,2.5 million and below 5%Z of prospective
export earnings.   The proposed loan for tihe Port of Corirto will not add
significantl-y to this debt burden.
ProsTects of Ful--it of G ligations
29,     Under the supervision of e-:p-rienced consultants the project
should be efficiently executed.   ? ere is gYood reason to sunpose that,
under the no-naper:-ent described in paragra-phs 21 and 22 above,  tihe newir
facilities vrou d be operated efficient -r so as to justifyr the estina4tes
presented in tle technical report, according to -rvich the Port Authority's
earnings should be adequate to provide the local currency needed at pre-
sent exchange rates to purchase the foreign currency needed to service
the loan.
30.     Nicaragua shiould be able to miake available Ivithout undue strain
the foreign exchange needed to mieet the service of the loan in addition
to its other obligations.
PART IV -   CCJIp2Kr;CE _TH Ah2TICLES OF A(F7FI- ET
31.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the 2ank.
PART V -   flFOPllr!'.- IOI S
32.     I recommend that the Bank at this tine make to Autoridad Portuaria
de Corinto (with the guarantee of the Iepublic of Nicaragua) a loan of
$3,200,000, or the eqauivalent thereof in other currencies, for a term of
20 years, with interest (including conmmission) at the rate of 4 3/h% per
annum, and on such other terms as are specified in the draft Loan and
Guarantee Agreements attached, and that the Lxecutive Directors adopt a
resolution to that effect in the attached form (No. 5).
