THE AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMAN PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS AND
                     RESPONSE PROJECT (P100451)
                         IDA GRANT H-244-TJ
                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER

   A. SUMMARY

1.      This Paper seeks the Country Director's approval for a Level Two restructuring of the
Tajikistan Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project.
The proposed changes include: (i) re-allocation of the IDA Grant proceeds (Grant H-244-TJ);
and (ii) a 2-month extension of the Closing Date for the mentioned IDA Grant from June 30,
2010 to August 31, 2010.

2.     The Government of Tajikistan has formally requested the above-mentioned changes in
their Letter to the Bank dated June 10, 2010. Since there have been no Avian Influenza
outbreaks in the country and in view of the imminent Closing Date of the project, the
Government of Tajikistan has requested to re-allocate the undisbursed amount of SDR 60,925.83
(SDR 68,259.21 after processing of the refund received in amount of USD 99,815.45 on June 14,
2010. This difference occurred due to SDR/USD exchange rate fluctuation) in the Compensation
Fund disbursement category. In case of epidemic, the Government is assuring the Bank that
required funds will be provided for the compensation to the owners of infected poultry.
3.      The Government previously requested to re-allocate the full amount of SDR 204,000
budgeted for the Compensation Fund in its formal letter dated December 28, 2009 to the Bank.
However, the Bank responded that it would be possible to re-allocate only SDR 143,074.17 as
the amount of SDR 60,925.83 had been already disbursed by the Government in 2008 to
establish the Compensation Fund. These funds had been kept in a separate account with the
"Tajprombank" commercial bank.            Soon after the Government received the formal
communication from the Bank, the disbursed amount of the Compensation Fund has been
refunded back to the Bank. In addition, the Government has requested to re-allocate other Grant
proceeds in the amount of SDR 145,000 remaining in the Operating Costs disbursement
category. The re-allocated funds will be used for procurement of priority equipment and other
goods under the Animal Health and Human Health Components. The project team fully supports
the request as the proposed re-allocation and extension would provide the Government with
sufficient time and resources to successfully finalize the implementation of the project.


   B. PROJECT STATUS
4.      Overall, the project has been making satisfactory progress for the past 12 months. The
progress towards achieving its project development objective also remains satisfactory. Almost
all activities envisaged under the project have been completed and all PDO indicators are either
have been achieved or expected to be achieved prior the Closing Date of June 30, 2010. The
project successfully contributed to minimizing the threat posed to humans by HPAI infection by
preparing a framework to deal with a potential AI outbreak, and to prepare for pandemics.
Under the project, the Government managed to procure most critical items such as seasonal
                                               4
influenza vaccines, PPEs, laboratory equipment, basic equipment for Intensive Care Units of the
Infectious Diseases Hospitals, disinfectants, computers, vehicles, and others items to respond to
the H1N1 pandemic. Noteworthy, are the completely rehabilitated and fully functional SSESS
Virology Laboratory (Health Diagnostic Laboratory) and Laboratory at the "Biochemicals"
Scientific Production Facility (Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory). The Government, in
close coordination with the UN Agencies responsible for their respective components, has also
provided various hands-on training programs and overseas study tours for the national
communications, veterinary and health specialists. Finally, the Government has carried out an
extensive communication campaign to inform the public about prevention measures to limit
potential spread of AI and the effects of the H1N1 pandemic in Tajikistan.
5.     Notably, the total amount disbursed under the IDA Grant is SDR 3,108,354 or 91.4% of
the IDA Grant of SDR 3,400,000 (as of June 17, 2010). It is also noteworthy that the remaining
procurement packages have all been prepared and finalized by the PMU in coordination with all
concerned counterparts and have also been cleared by the Bank.
6.      Financial Management: The financial management arrangements at the PMU, including
accounting and reporting, internal control procedures, planning and budgeting, external audits,
funds flow, organization and staffing arrangements are considered moderately satisfactory,
mainly because of delays in implementation of the 1C modernization and following up on
recommendations. The internal control system at the PMU continues to be overall acceptable to
the Bank and is capable of providing timely information and reporting on the project. The
internal controls are generally functioning adequately. The audit report of FY2008 with
unqualified (clean) opinion was received on time and was acceptable to the Bank.

   C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project, Grant No H-244-TJ (P100451) will be

8.      Closing Date: It is proposed to extend the Closing Date for the IDA Grant from June 30,
2010 to August 31, 2010. This would be the second extension of the IDA Grant and would bring
the total extension period to 9 months. The 2 month extension of the Closing Date is very
critical for the Government to be able to finalize procurement of the additional laboratory
equipment for the Animal Health and Human Health National Diagnostic Laboratories,
laboratory equipment for the regional veterinary laboratories, and oxygen generators for the
infectious diseases hospitals. Both national diagnostic laboratories are already fully functional,
but the procurement of the required equipment would allow the laboratories to operate at more
enhanced capacity in future. In addition, since the laboratories have started operating very
recently, the laboratory specialists have realized that some pieces of equipment do not match to
each other; hence some pieces of the equipment should be replaced. Further, the State
Veterinary Department has recently decided to use the unutilized resources of the Compensation
Fund to procure laboratory equipment for the regional veterinary laboratories to improve the
diagnostic capacity of the regional veterinary institutions. Finally, after the Intensive Care Unit
(ICU) equipment was delivered to the infectious diseases hospitals a few months ago, the
management of the hospitals realized that the procured ICU equipment required oxygen
generators to become functional. The technical specifications for all required equipment and
other items have been prepared by the Government and cleared by the Bank.

9.      The Government expected to use funds from the re-allocated Compensation Fund for the
procurement of the required goods. However, the full amount (SDR 204,000) could not be fully
re-allocated at the Government's previous request, as the amount of SDR 60,925.83 had been
already disbursed in 2008 to establish the Compensation Fund and had been kept in a separate
account with the "Tajprombank" commercial bank. Consequently, this amount had to be
refunded back to the Bank and only then to be re-allocated as necessary. In addition, closer to
completion of the project, the PMU realized that the amount of SDR 145,000 in the Operating
Costs category remained undisbursed. The Government has decided to wait until the amount of
SDR 60,925.83 is returned back to the Bank (as explained earlier) and put the request for re-
allocation of the unutilized amount under the Operating Costs category along with the
undisbursed amount of the Compensation Fund.
