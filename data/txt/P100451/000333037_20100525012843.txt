2.       Summary of project implementation progress: Overall, the project has been making
satisfactory progress. Most of major activities envisaged under the project have been completed
so far. Notably, the total amount disbursed under the IDA Grant is US$4,471,855 or 87.6% of
the IDA Grant of US$5,104,964 (as of May 4, 2010). The IDA Grant in USD increased from the
initial amount of US$5 million to US$5,15 million due to an appreciation of XDR against the
USD; the IDA Grant amounts to XDR3,40 million. It is also noteworthy that the remaining
procurement packages have all been prepared and finalized by the PMU in coordination with all
concerned counterparts and have also been cleared by the Bank.

3.      Substantial progress has been made under all project components. Major achievements in
the past year included:




                                                   4
   ·   Endorsement to the National Avian Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan and
       National Pandemic Preparedness plan by the Government of Tajikistan on August 31,
       2009 and October 1, 2009 correspondingly;
   ·   Establishment of the Hotline at the Committee for Emergency and Civil Defense (CECD)
       on November 30, 2009 (the hotline equipment has been delivered, installed, and tested;
       and 8 CECD hotline officers have been trained by UNICEF to operate the hotline
       equipment);
   ·   SSESS Virology Laboratory (Health Diagnostic Laboratory) has been made functional
       during June 2009 and has started performing its tests. By December 7, 2009 14 tests have
       been confirmed to be H1N1 positive out of over 300 samples tested. Furthermore, several
       specimens have been sent to the Central Reference Laboratory, Weybridge, UK for the
       re-confirmation of the identified viruses;
   ·   Completion of the final Report on Health Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) by
       UNICEF on October 27, 2009;
   ·   Procurement of emergency items such as basic equipment for Intensive Care Units of the
       Infectious Disease Hospitals, personal protective equipment (PPEs), disinfectants, and
       other items to respond to the H1N1 Pandemic (procurement of these emergency items
       was possible after the reallocation of the Compensation Fund in the amount of
       US$500,000 at the Government Request on June 23, 2009);
   ·   The PCR laboratory equipment has been delivered and installed in the "Biochemicals"
       laboratory and FAO has hired an international consultant to deliver on-site training to the
       specialists of this laboratory;
   ·   Laboratory equipment has been delivered to all regional veterinary laboratories;
   ·   Finally, the project provided various training programs and overseas study tours for the
       national communications, veterinary and health specialists.

4.      Financial Management: The financial management arrangements at the PMU, including
accounting and reporting, internal control procedures, planning and budgeting, external audits,
funds flow, organization and staffing arrangements are considered moderately satisfactory and
overall acceptable to the Bank. This is mainly because of delays with the implementation of 1C
modernization and delays with recommendations follow up. The internal control system at the
PMU continues to be overall acceptable to the Bank and was assessed to be capable of providing
timely information and reporting on the project. The internal controls are generally functioning
adequate, as a limited control review of sample transactions during the supervision mission in
December 2009 revealed no deficiencies. The audit report of FY2008 with unqualified (clean)
opinion was received on time and was acceptable to the Bank.

5.      Summary of the reasons for the proposed reallocation: Since there have been no Avian
Influenza outbreaks in the country and in view of the imminent Closing Date of the project (30
June 2010), the Government of Tajikistan has formally requested to re-allocate the full amount
allocated for the establishment of the Compensation Fund. In case of epidemic, the Government
is assuring the Bank that required funds will be provided for the compensation to the owners of
infected poultry. However, since disbursement in the amount of SDR60,925.83 has already
taken place under this category, it cannot be re-allocated unless the Government re-funds it back
to the Bank. This amount has been disbursed by the Government for the establishment of the
Compensation Fund and is being kept in a separate account with the "Tajprombank" commercial

                                                5
bank. The appropriate explanation will be provided in the Amendment Letter to the Financing
Agreement.

6.      The remaining funds from the Compensation Fund Category are proposed to be re-
allocated as follows:

   (i) Procurement of laboratory equipment for three regional veterinary laboratories Khatlon,
           GBAO and Sughd to support diseases surveillance and monitoring in high risk areas;
   (ii) Procurement of oxygen generators in addition to the ICU emergency equipment that was
           already provided to the infectious diseases hospitals;
   (iii)Rehabilitation of two additional rooms for the hotline operators in the CECD.
