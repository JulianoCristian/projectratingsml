Overall, the\n            project has been making satisfactory progress. Most of major\n            activities envisaged under the project have been completed\n            so far. Notably, the total amount disbursed under the\n            International Development Association (IDA) grant is\n            US$4,471,855 or 87.6 percent of the International\n            Development Association IDA grant of US$5,104,964 (as of May\n            4, 2010). The IDA grant in USD increased from the initial\n            amount of US$5 million to US$5,15 million due to an\n            appreciation of XDR against the USD; the IDA grant amounts\n            to XDR3,40 million. It is also noteworthy that the remaining\n            procurement packages have all been prepared and finalized by\n            the Project Management Unit (PMU) in coordination with all\n            concerned counterparts and have also been cleared by the Bank."}, "docdt": "2010-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
