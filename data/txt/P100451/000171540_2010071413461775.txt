Dear Mr. Nadjmiddinov: 
 
Re: 
Restructuring of the Tajikistan the Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response Project 
(Grant Number H-244-TJ) 
 
We refer to the Financing Agreement between the Republic of Tajikistan (the 
“Recipient”) 
and the International Development Association (“Association”), for the Avian Influenza Control and 
Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (“the Project”), dated July 27, 2006.  Further 
reference is made to the letter of the Minister of Finance for the Recipient, dated December
 28, 2009, 
requesting a restructuring of the Project.  
 
We are pleased to inform you that the Association has agreed to the following changes: 
1. 
Please be advised that it is not possible to re-allocate the full amount of the 
disbursement category “Compensation Fund” as requested in your letter.  Since disbursement in 
the amount of SDR60,925.83 has already taken place under this category, it cannot be re-
allocated unless the Government will re-fund this amount back to the World Bank.  In the 
meantime, the amount disbursed should remain as already disbursed.  As a result thereof, the 
table appearing in paragraph A.2 of Section IV of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement is 
amended to read as follows: 
 
Category 
Amount of the 
Financing Allocated 
(expressed in SDR) 
%
of Expenditures to be 
Financed 
(1)  Goods, works and 
consultants’ services for the 
Project 
2,667,074.17 100% 
(2)  Compensation Fund under 
the Part II of the Project 
60,925.83 100% 
(3)  Eligible Imported Goods 
and Commodities listed in 
Section III C of Schedule 2 
400,000 
100% 
 
(4)  Operating Costs 
272,000 
100%

Total amount 
3,400,000 
 
All sections of the Financing Agreement that have not been amended hereby shall remain 
unchanged and in full force and effect. 
 
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the confirmation 
on the enclosed copy of this Amendment Letter and returning it to the Association.  This 
Amendment Letter shall become effective upon the date of its countersignature. 
 
Very truly yours, 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
