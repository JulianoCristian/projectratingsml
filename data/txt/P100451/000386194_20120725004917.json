risk to development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            the lessons emerging from the experience of the project\n            focus around the challenges going forward, of turning a\n            promising beginning of good cross-sector work, into\n            institutionalized sustained approaches, recognizing that the\n            threat of avian influenza remains, albeit not necessarily in\n            the immediate neighborhood of the country. Firstly, the\n            project was designed as an emergency response to a perceived\n            threat, but one which had not actually materialized in\n            Tajikistan at the time that the project was appraised.\n            Secondly, the project was designed in a low institutional\n            and human resource capacity environment, where the\n            prevailing systems for surveillance and detection, as well\n            the regulatory environment in the context of managing animal\n            diseases, were old and had not changed much from the Soviet\n            times. Emergency responses run the risk of low\n            sustainability. The preparedness built by this emergency\n            operation will be rapidly eroded in the absence of a program\n            (externally or internally funded) that goes beyond the life\n            of the project, for securing the sustainability of\n            preparedness to deal with future outbreaks. The use of a\n            Project Management Unit (PMU) that is not fully integrated\n            into the main ministries or operational departments runs the\n            risk of compromising country ownership and sustainability.\n            Clearly the need to get implementation underway quickly\n            weighed heavily on the minds of the appraisal team, given\n            the risks that were clearly there; the use of an existing\n            PMU with the necessary capacity on procurement and financial\n            management did facilitate start up of implementation. The\n            engagement of international organizations to support\n            implementation of the emergency project had benefits in\n            terms of technical rigor, but also potential consequences in\n            terms of reduced ownership. These agencies provide good\n            cross country links in situations where an issue straddles\n            national boundaries, and where it is necessary to link up\n            with technical institutions internationally. However,\n            execution responsibilities for components need to be\n            embedded within a government agency. Where a project is\n            aimed at mitigating a disease threat with an uncertain\n            probability of occurring, the results framework should cover\n            both scenarios when the disease strikes and when it does\n            not. Intermediate outcomes need to be monitored to assess\n            whether capacity is improving, and whether there are\n            sustainable changes in preparedness, irrespective of whether\n            the threat materializes. The use of a horizontal Adaptable\n            Program Loan (APL) did not pose a problem in the case of\n            Tajikistan, with regard to the choice of component and the\n            use of a common template. However, that template was geared\n            toward emergency measures for preparedness."}, "docdt": "2012-07-13T00:00:00Z"}
