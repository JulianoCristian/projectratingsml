generating units\n            in Serbia; (c) introduce a systematic air-quality monitoring\n            and study program in the Kolubara area; and (d) improve the\n            financial performance of Elektroprivreda of Serbia (EPS) and\n            Elektroprivreda (EP) and strengthen their capacities in\n            financial management/accounting.  The project comprises: (a)\n            construction of a 7 million tons per year lignite mine at\n            Tamnava West in Serbia; (b) construction of a 700 MW\n            minehead Thermal Power Plant and auxiliary facilities at\n            Kolubara B site located at the north end of Tamnava West\n            mine field; (c) urgent maintenance/rehabilitation of Thermal\n            Power Plants in Serbia; and (d) technical assistance for:\n            (i) an eight year Power Plant rehabilitation action plan in\n            Serbia aimed at extending the life span and improving the\n            efficiency of power plants including the air quality control\n            facilities; (ii) financial management, accounting and\n            relevant training and cost of service studies for tariff\n            determination and monitoring; (iii) a diagnostic study based\n            development plan and implementation program for the Kolubara\n            area; (iv) restructuring of Serbia's underground mines;\n            and (v) long-term regional air quality monitoring program\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1991-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
