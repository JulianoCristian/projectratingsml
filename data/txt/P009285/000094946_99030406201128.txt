PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
FORMER SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
KOLUBARA B THERMAL POWER AND LIGNITE PROJECT
(LOAN 3361-YU)
This is the Project Completion Note on the Former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia Kolubara B thermal Power and Lignite Project (Loan 3361-YU).
This Note is in lieu of an Implementation Completion Report because the loan for
the project lapsed prior to effectiveness due to sanctions by the UN Security Council on
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
A. Background, Objectives and Description
1 .    The project was appraised in October 1990 with a view to supporting the ongoing
economic reform program of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It
received Board approval on June 25, 1991. The objectives were to: (i) meet the growth in
demand for electricity in Serbia most economically, and supply electricity to other
republics; (ii) facilitate rehabilitation of aging thermal generating units in Serbia; (iii)
introduce a systematic air quality monitoring and study program in the Kolubara area; and
(iv) improve the financial performance of the Elektroprivreda of Serbia and the Electricity
Generation Company of Serbia.
2.    The project comprised: (i) construction of a 7 million ton per year lignite mine at
Tamnava West in Serbia; (ii) construction of a 700 MW (2X350 MW) mine-head thermal
power plant and auxiliary facilities at the Kolubara B site located at the north end of the
Tamnava West mine site; (iii) urgent maintenance/rehabilitation of thermal power plants in
Serbia; and (iv) technical assistance
B. Lessons Learned
3.    The outbreak of war and the consequent inability to carry out the project could not
have been anticipated at the time of project approval.
