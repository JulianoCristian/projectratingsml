KOLUBARA 'B' THERMAL POWER AND LIGNITE MINE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Bornower           :    Elektroprivreda of Serbia
Guarantor         :    Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
Beneficiary             Electricity Generation Company of Serbia
Amount             :    US$300 million equivalent
Terms                    15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Project Objectives      The project objectives are to: (i) meet the growth in
demand for electricity in Serbia most economically,
Including its supplies to other republics in the late-
nineties; (ii) facilitate rehabilitation of aging
thermal generating units in Serbia; (iii) introduce a
systematic air-quality monitoring and study program in
the  Kolubara  area;  (iv)  improve  the  financial
performance of EPS/EP(S) and strengthen their capacities
in financial management/accounting.
ProjectDeription  :    The Project comprises:   (i) construction of a 7.0
million tons per year lignite mine at Tamnava West in
Serbia; (ii) construction of a 700 NW (2 x '   4W mine-
head Thermal Power Plant and auxiliary ;a -..cies at
Kolubara B site located at the north end of Tamnava west
mine field; (iii) urgent maintenance/rehabilitation of
Thermal Power Plants in Serbia; (iv) technical
assistance  for:    (a)  an  eight  year  Power  Plant
rehabilitation action plan in Serbia aimed at extending
the life span and improving the efficiency of power
plants including the air quality control facilities
resulting in better dust emission control; (b) financial
management, accounting and relevant training and cost
of service studies for tariff determination and
monitoring; (c) a diagnostic study based development
plan and implementation program for the Kolubara area
to avoid potential conflicts between the existing and
planned land use under the project and due to possible
future mining expansion; and for the restructuring of
Serbia's uneconomic and unsafe underground mines; and
(d) long-term regional air quality monitoring and study
programs providing critical information on environmental



- ii -
implications to ensure appropriate future lignite based
power develoment policies with necessary actions.
Projec Benefits         This project would provide about 4,000 IWh of energy
annually to overcome energy shortages in Serbia and
maintain its supplies to other republics in the late
nineties. The eight-year power station rehabilitation
action program, environment related studies, and the
long-term Kolubara mine development and underground mine
restructuring studies are important project components
which address key issues in the power sub-sector. Also
the EPS and EP(S) performance is expected to improve due
to strengthening of selected institutional areas
including financial management and accounting.
Project Risks           No significant technical risks are anticipated in view
cf the borrower's past experience in construction and
operatior of lignite mines and chermal power plants.
The proposed project meets the requirements of
prevailing Serbian and Bank environmental guidelines,
policies, and procedures and no major environmental
project risks are anticipated. Provisions made in the
project design will also enable the plant to meet even
more stringent emission standards if they are required
in  the  future.    The  financial  situation  of  the
enterprises may be affected by (a) possible future
financial difficulties of their clients and (b) pressure
from the federal/republican authorities to oppose future
electricity  price  increases  if  needed.    Specific
financial covenants included will minimize this risk.

ROLUBARA B THERMAL POWER AK. LIGNITE MINE PRO.TECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      During the 1960s and 1970s Yugoslavia's economy grew rapidly, with
the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaging about 6% p.a. This
performance, however, was supported by large investments where irsufficient
attention was paid to quality or cost. Moreover, the economy's ability to
adjust to external shocks was reduced by an excessively accommodating credit
policy ind by rigidit,es and distortions, including low mobility of capital
and labor, negative real interest rates, increasingly overvalued exchange
rates and highly protected domestic industries. In addition, the growth of
wages exceeded the growth of labor productivity in the late 1970s. Yugoslavia
absorbed the second oil shock through additional foreign borrowings. However,
economic growth stagnated during the 1980s, unemployment increased and
inflation accelerated to 60% per month by late 1989.
1.2      In January 1990, the Yugoslav Government launched a stabilization and
restructuring program supported by the 1990 IMF Standby and SAL II. The
program combined a currency reform, a wage freeze, a convertible currency, an
exchange freeze, and a partial price freeze with a tight monetary and fiscal
policy. It also included comprehensive measures to restructure and privatize
the banking system and the enterprise sector. The results during the first
half of 1990 showed that the program was successful in reducing inflation and
restoring confidence, specifically in the country's currency and, more
generally, in the economy and in the Government's new approach to economic
management. During the second half of 1990 the program's results were more
modest. For the year 1990 as a whole, industrial production declined by over
10% and gross social product by 7.2%. Inflation registered a 118% increase
from December 1989 to December 1990.
1.3      Yugoslavia's energy sector, and in particular the electricity sub-
sector, has been substantially affected by the economic downturn. Investments
were reduced, price did not keep up with inflation and left enterprises
severely short of cash even to meet operating needs, let alone sustain any
sizeable expansion program.
1.4      This $ 1.3 billion Kolubara 'B' Thermal Power and Lignite Mine
Project - the subject of this report - involves development of a large lignite
mine (7 million tons per year) and a 700 MW thermal power station at the mine
head. It is the largest and most crucially important energy investment
project under implementation in the country. It is located in Serbia, the
country's only net energy exporting republic. The Project is environmentally
acceptable and is needed to meet anticipated electricity needs of Serbia and
its supplies to other republics in the late nineties. The least cost
expansion studies for the Yugoslav power system, as well as the Serbian power
system, confirm the economic merit of the proposed project and the optimum
timing of its commissioning.



1.5      The Project was prepared after a pre-appraisal mission during July-
August 1989, an appraisal during October-November 1990, and a post-appraisal
mission in January 1991.

II.  THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Oyerview
2.       The energy sector provides vital input to the industrial sector which
contributes 44% of the Gross Social Product (GSP) in 1989. Yugoslavia's
energy intensity is about 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) per US$ thousand
of GSP which is significantly lower than that of Eaet European countriea (0.6
toe) but somewhat higher than average OECD Europe (0.3 toe). Industrial
restructuring and energy conservation measures could reduce Yugoslavia's
energy intensity further. In 1989 energy imports were valued at current US$
2.6 billion, representing 17% of the country's total imports or 4% of GSP. In
the past the supply of energy has generally kept pace with increases in
demand.
B. Resources and Status of Development
2.02     Yugoslavia's energy resources consist mainly of coal, oil, gas,
hydropower and uranium, with coal accounting for about 90%. Their
distribution, by republic/province, is highly uneven as indicated in
Annex 2.1. Joint development of natural resources is therefore crucial in
future for economic development of the country.
2.03     The exploitable coal reserves are estimated at about 15 billion tons
of coal equivalent, of which about 81% is lignite, 18% is brown coal and less
than 1% is hard coal. Although abundant and easily exploitable for the most
part through low-cost open-pit mining, lignite has a large content of moisture
(40 to 55%) and ash (15 to 25%) and a low calorific value (1400 to 1800
kcal/kg). As these properties make transportation beyond a radius of about 50
km uneconomic, mine based power generation is the principal economic use for
lignite. Coal fired power plants generated about 47 TWh during 1989 or 57% of
the country's total electricity supply. Brown coal is partly exploitable by
open-pit mining; however, in comparison with lignite, its resource base is
much smaller, mining cost is higher and use for power generation is limited by
the competing demand of industrial boilers. Hard coal is exploited in high-
cost underground mines. Its economic use is very limited. Underground mines
have an average production cost about twice that of the cost of imported steam
coal and are not economical. They also constitute a safety problem. In
Serbia two of them were closed during 1990 and there are plans for additional
closures in the next few years in Slovenia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia
(also see para 3.07). Open-pit minable lignite reserves are mainly located in
Serbia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Serbia has the largest and most economic
reserves of lignite (80% of the total).
2.04     Yugoslavia's commercially exploitable hydropower potential is
estimated at about 55 TWh/year of which 30 TWh/year has been developed. The
share of hydroelectric generation cources has declined from 63% of the total
electricity production in 1969 to about 30% in 1990. Most of the remaining
sites are relatively small. Nevertheless for those which may have economic
justification for inclusion in the medium and the long term development plan,
necessary technical economic studies and evaluation are needed. For most of
the sites, these have not been completed.



-4-
2.05     Proven oil and gas reserves are limited, each being about 70 million
toe. In 1988, crude oil production was about 3.9 million toe and gas about
2.5 million toe. Recoverable reserves of uranium are about 2,700 tons. There
is one mine presently in production which provides about 50% of the fucl, for
the 664 MW, Krsko nuclear power plant in Slovenia.
2.06     Gross primary energy supply increased from 35.2 million toe in 1980
to 44.4 million toe in 1989 (2.6% per year) and average annual growth of GSP
being only about 1%. Oil's share fell from 44% of the total supply in 1980 to
34% in 1989 and hydro's share from 8% to 6%. The shares of coal and natural
gas rose from 39% and 9% to 43% and 15% respectively. Nuclear power accounted
for 2% of the total supply in 1989. Net energy imports increased from 36.5%
of gross supply in 1980 to 39.5% in 1989. Industry was the major energy
consumer during this period accounting for 56% of total consumption, followed
by transport (19%) and households (18%). Details are at Annex 2.2.
C. Energy Sector Institutions
2.07     In keeping with the national policy of decentralization of economic
management and moves to a market economy since 1989 the role of the Federal
Government in the energy sector has changed and is basically limited to
formulating broad policy guidelines and strategy. Five-year planning has been
abandoned and federal level agencies have limited executive authority. All
detailed planning and implementation, including price setting, is left to the
initiative of republican enterprises. However, in the interim period of
economic reform, the Federal Government maintains the responsibility for
setting oil and domestic natural gas prices and exercises control of
electricity price. (para. 2.10). Communities of Interest (CoIs) --
organizations of producers and users, which in the past had a role in setting
prices, and in mobilizing and allocating resources for investments -- have
been abolished in Sezbia, Croatia and Slovenia and are being phased out in
other republics. In the power sub-sector, republican enterprises - called
Electroprivredas (EPs) - have gradually developed into strong power supply
entities and their organizations are beirg further strengthened (see paras.
3.01, 3.12-3.15).
2.08     Currently, there are three main agencies concerned with the energy
sector at the federal level. The Federal Secretariat for Energy and Industry
(FSEI), is responsible for formulating the Federal Government's broad policy
and strategy for the sector, and for coordinating the energy and industrial
sectors' activities. The Federal Secretariat for Internal Trade (FSIT),
through its Bureau for Prices, is responsible for monitoring compliance with
the law and guidelines on pricing of energy and energy raw materials. The
Federal Secretariat for Development through its responsibility of
environmental protection formulates policy guidelines and laws for that
purpose. In addition, there are the following national associations of sector
enterprises: (i) the Union of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (JUGEL), (ii)
the Association of Oil and Gas Producers - OUNP, and (iii) the Association of
Coal Producers - OURU. Except in regard tc specific delegated
responsibilities - e.g. JUGEL has the operational responsibility for the
national 400 kV grid, including control of international power exchanges



-5-
between Yugoslavia and neighboring countries - these are generally weak
organizations with neither executive authority nor financial resources of
their own. Their role is extremely limited in national or republican
investment decisions. These institutions, including JUGEL, however, have key
roles in regard to negotiations (between the member enterprises and the
Federal Government) for price adjustments in accordance with prevailing laws.
2.09     JUGEL has a staff of about 160, 40 of whom are engaged on operations
of the national grid, a task which it performs efficiently. This role will be
further strengthened on completion of the Third Power Transmission Project
(supported by Loan 2338-YU) in 1995. Although JUGEL does have experienced and
competent staff, reluctance of republican enterprises to delogate appropriate
authority severely constrains its ability to effectively contributs in other
areas which are crucial for planning in the power sub-sector. These ares
(i) long-term national demand forecasting, (ii) national investment planning,
and (iii) promotion of inter-republican (joint venture) generation expansion
projects. There are no scientifically estimated long term demand forecasts
for the country or national investment programs in the field of electric
power. There are strong indications of movement towards self-sufficiency in
republican power planning rather than choice of expansion projects based on
national least cost solutions (see para 2.20).
D. Energv Pricing
2.10     Policy and Reaulation.  The Federal Government continues to have a
dominant role in pricing of all forms of energy. Prices are now governed by
the Law on the System of Social Price Control (LSSPC) of September 1989, which
sets out Common Criteria (CC) for calculating a ceilina on prices, which
enterprises are allowed to charge to final consumers, leaving the enterprises
notionally free to set their prices, independently, within the ceiling. In
the electricity sub-sector, CC is based on: (a) prevailing industrial and
household prices in Austria, Greece, Switzerland, Italy and Germany; and (b)
prices of Yugoslavia's electricity exports and imports. Government continues
to closely monitor adherence to the law. Under prevailing law the Federal
Government retaina the power to intervene and set prices whenever macro
economic conditions so warrant. At present the Federal Government exercises
direct control on electricity prices by requiring that price adjustments be in
conforn:Zty with its anti-inflation program.  It also sets prices of crude and
oil derivates and domestic natural gas. The pricing situation in each sub-
sector is summarized in the following paragraphs.
2.11     Coal anad Licnite Pricing.  About 85% of lignite and brown coal is
produced and used by enterprises in their own power plants and is not traded.
In a few cases in Slovenia and Croatia where power and coal enterprises are
separate, coal is priced at financial costs. The balance, used by industry
and households, is a byproduct of power plant ligni'_ and coal. It is sold at
cost, after adding the costs of washing and drying.
2.12     Electricity Price Levels.  Under the First Structural Adjustment Loan
(SAL I) and the Third Power Transmission Project Loan Agreement (Loan 2338-
YU) the Federal Government and the republican power enterprises agreed in 1S83



-6-
to set electricity price levels on the basis of Long Run Marginal Costs
(LRMC). This was not enforced because of difficulties in evolving a national
least cost development program which would have served as a basis of
calculating the LRMC. The 1985 law on the system of social price control,
which introduced Common Elements (CE) as target price; based on the
combination of local cost of production, comparable foreign costs and energy
export/import prices, became effective in 1986, with Bank agreement, to effect
urgently neaded price adjustments which were expected to raise prices to at
least the Bank's rough estimates of LRMC levels. During 1987-89, when
inflation soared, price adjustments were generally late and below the levels
needed to achieve the CE targets. As a result, the financial situation of all
power enterprises seriously deteriorated. The introduction of CC in 1990
(para. 2.10), with its provisions for: (i) automatic adjustment to counter
inflation, and (ii) freedom for enterprises to set their own prices (within
the legal ceiling), promised financial relief. This did not materialize,
however, as federal authorities limited price increases by EPs during much of
1990.
2.13     Under the Bank's Second Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL II), as a
condition of release of the second tranche, the Federal Government undertook
to:
(i) raise electricity prices in real terms to reach by November 1,
1990, on the average, at least 60% of the January 1990 CC
ceiling price; and
(ii) have as a basis for future price adjustments a program (to be
agreed with the Bank) to meet set financial targets for power
entities, together with measures necessary to improve their
operational efficiencies.
2.14     It has been estimated that the CC ceiling price in the first quarter
of 1990 was Din. 1.217/kWh equivalent, while the actual electricity prices in
Yugoslavia were about Din. 0.596/kWh (or 46% of the CC ceiling price). In
Serbia, the average price was even lower, about Din. 0.571/kWh. As part of
the anti-inflation measures, the Federal Government froze electricity prices
at the beginning of 1990. However, in April 1990 it increased the rates by
about 20%; in August 1990 by 24% and in December 1990 by another 8. It is
estimated that with these adjustments average electricity tariff is at about
74% of the CC ceiling price, which is not far from the estimated LRMC in
Serbia (regarding (ii) above see para 6.19).
2.15     In addition to the electricity tariffs, in the Republics of Slovenia,
Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, additional charges are levied as percentages
of the monthly bills as consumer contributions to the enterprises investment
program. These are temporary arrangements and are expected to be removed when
the notified tariffs are adequate to meet enterprise financial requirements.
2.16     The Electricity Tariff Structure.  The tariff structure distinguishes
between prices for electricity supplies by voltage levels, time of day
(peak/off-peak), winter and summer, active and reactive power and energy. It



. 7
is uniform throughout the country, but prices differ among power entities.
Higher demand and energy charges in winter have been in effect since 1964.
Changes were made in 1984 to: (a) extend winter rates from 4 months earlier
to 6 months, and (b) reduce the winter rates from twice the summer rates to
1.5 times. These were due to the steadily increasing proportion of thermal
generation and the need to increase revenues. The tariff structure is
supported by a sophisticated metering system which enables consumers to manage
their demand. The Borrower under the proposed project, the Electroprivreda of
Serbia (EPS), recognizing the importance of reviewing tariff structure and
levels on a regular basis has commenced as a first step to review, with
consultant's assistance, the load characteristics of end users in Serbia.
This work is expected to be ready by the end of 1991. Based on the
consultant's findings, which will be discussed with the Bank, a cost of
service study, reflecting market characteristics will be prepared. The cost
of service study will be undertaken by consultants selected according to the
Bank's Guidelines and financed from the technical assistance component of this
loan. With the consumer characteristics and the cost of service studies -
both of which would be amenable to regular updating - EPS will have in hand
the necessary elements for periodic tariff revisions. The work will utilize
the results from the ongoing energy pricing study being carried out by the
Federal Government with assistance from the European Community (EC) (para.
2.21). During negotiations EPS agreed to exchange views with the Bank in
regard to the consumer characteristics study's findings and recommendations by
January 31. 1992 and based on that carry out the cost of service study.
2.17     Pricing of Crude Oil and Refined Oil Products.  Since 1983,
indigenous crude oil which meets about one-third of the country's requirements
is priced at parity with the international price of the imported crude.
Retail prices of refined products are set to at least reflect international
levels.
2.18     Pricing of Natural Gas.  Domestic natural gas meets about half of the
country's current requirements and the rest is imported mainly from the Soviet
Union. The price of domestic natural gas was raised in early 1987 to parity
with the price of imported natural gas. However, due to the subsequent high
inflation and delayed price increases, the domestic price is now about 35%
below the price of imported gas. Imported natural gas is priced to Yugoslavia
at parity with the weighted average of the prices of heavy fuel and heating
oils. In republics where both domestic and imported natural gas is consumed,
the prices are weighted averages of domestic and imported natural gas.
E. Sector Issues and Strategy
2.19     Issues.  The main issues in the energy sector are:  (i) the need to
set prices, particularly of electric power entities, to meet their objectives
of economic efficiency and financial viability; (ii) appropriate choice of
electricity generation expansion projects and promotion of inter-republican
joint development projects and trade in electricity to the extent possible;
(iii) more effective control of air pollution caused by older coal, lignite
and oil burning thermal power plants (TPPs) with insufficient environmental
controls; (iv) rehabilitation/retirement of inefficient TPPs, associated



-8-
mines (including closure of uneconomic and hazardous underground mines);
(v) appropriate measures to improve energy conservation, especially through
restructuring of industry; (vi) increasing the use of natural gas, especially
for its environmental advantages; and (vii) orienting the role of federal and
republican energy sector institutions to implement macroeconomic reforms more
effectively in the energy sector. The resolution of these issues is
complicated by recent political upheavals affecting the future constitution of
the Federal Government, the Gulf crisis, and the Soviet Union's (Yugoslavia's
main oil/gas supplier) change to convertible currency payments for its energy
exports.
2.20     Status and Strategy.  The Government's energy strategy hitherto has
been to rely on: (a) economic energy pricing; (b) domestic energy resources;
and (c) energy conservation. Economic pricing was implemented for oil but not
in the electricity sub-sector (see para. 2.12). Under SAL II electricity
pricing covenants have been introduced to partially remedy the situation and
prepare a sounder basis of pricing for the future. The Yugoslav Program of
Long-Term Measures for Energy Rationalization, Substitution and Generation was
adopted in June 1980 but, because of legal and other limitations on the
exercise of federal powers, its implementation was left largely to the RAPs.
on the whole, this program and a 1987 update were not successful as the ratio
of energy consumption to GDP rose slightly during the 1980s. The lack of
success was in large part due to the stagnation of the economy during the
1980s and the fall in energy prices after 1986 which reduced industries'
resources and incentives to save energy. These considerations also explain
largely why industries have made only limited use of the line of credit
offered under the Industrial Energy Conservation Project (Loan 2790-YU). The
factors most likely to bring about energy savings in the future are increased
real energy prices and restructuring of energy intensive industries. There
has been good progress in inter-republican collaboration in operating its
existing power systems on an efficient national basis though not in the area
of future joint planning. Some 33% of electricity generated flows across
republican boundaries. More could be done in this regard in view of the very
uneven distribution of the country's natural energy resources. Although
adoption of national least-cost expansion programs may not be consistent with
the recent decentralization policies, the Bank would continue to, encourage
JUGEL to: (a) prepare a reference national least-cost expansion program for
the electricity sector against which deviations of republican plans could be
studied, and (b) develop a basis for pricing of inter-republican power
exchanges which would promote future joint-venture development projects.
These recommendations will be included in a Bank energy strategy paper now
under preparation (para 2.21). In regard to the environment impact of TPPs,
newer lignite fired TPPs are being developed with due regard to environmerntal
requirements. At the government's request, the Bank has prepared a draft
Environment Strategy Paper in January 1991, containing, inter-alia,
recommendations for the energy sector.



-9-
2.21     The Federal Government has been working for several years on a new
energy strategy to deal with issues outlined above but delays have occurred
due to the decision during 1989 to undertake basic macroeconomic reforms. The
Government has recently requested Bank aesistance in updating the energy
strategy to bring it in line with the 1989-1990 macro-economic reforms. The
Bank is currently also finishing an energy strategy paper which will provide
guidelines and define areas of further collaborative work. The Federal
Government is concurrently carrying out an energy pricing study, focusing on
electricity and natural gae with the assistance of EC.

III. THE COAL AND POWER SUB-SECTORS
Background
3.01     The institutional structure of the coal and power sub-sectors changed
substantially during 1990 when, am a part of a set of actions to expedite
economic reforms, the Federal Government took a number of important
legislative and institutional measures to accelerate enterprise reforms. This
included the Law on Enterprises (LOE) passed by the federal Assembly in 1989
which required existing self-management institutions to be reorganized into
the form of enterprises prevailing in Western European economies. The LOE
also provided that, in the case of utilities of special social interest, they
should be reconstituted as public enterprises with representatives of
republican governments playing an important role. Concurrently the republican
governments have also strengthened their legislations governing the power sub-
sector. In Serbia, the organizational changes resulting from LOE were further
reinforced by changes introduced by the Serbian Electricity Act of December
1989, which provided for reorganization of the existing institutions in
Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo, unifying their interconnected power systems, and
enabling rational and efficient use of their resources and coordinated
development of electric power facilities.
The Coal Sub-Sector
A. Oraanization
3.02     Prior to 1990, individual coal mines of Yugoslavia formed BOALs
grouped together as local composite work organizations (COALs), and were then
styled "kombinats". With the exception of those in Slovenia, Croatia, and
partially in Bosnia-Hercegovina, coal mines were members of the same composite
organization together with the local power plants to which they supplied the
bulk of their output and services. Since the LOE in early 1990, the local
"kombinats" have been incorporated with the new republican electric power
enterprises (the Elektroprivredas, or EPs) (see paras 3.14 and 3.15). These
new organizations also cover the other mine-related services and activities,
such as central workshops and services, mining machinery manufacturing and
civil construction. There are now seven such regional enterprises, one for
each of the six republics and one for Kosovo. The EPs of Slovenia and Croatia
do not include the coal mines. EP Bosnia-Hercegovina includes only a part of
the coal mines.
3.03     Matters of common interest to all Yugoslavian coal and other mines
such as geological and metallurgical research, feasibility studies, mine
design and engineering on behalf of the mines, are dealt with by the Belgrade
Mining Institute and the Coal Department of the federal Chamber of Energy.
The Mining Institute is a highly qualified institution with considerable
experience in development of open-pit lignite mining. A data bank on
Yugoslavia's coal reserves is kept by the federal Secretariat for Energy and
Industry. Regulations concerning safety and approval of operations of mines
are issued and supervised by the republics.



X 11 -
B. Existing Mines
3.04     In 1989, Yugoslavia produced 74.3 million tons of coal and lignite
from 38 mines. The share of lignite was 61.9 million tons from 15 mines. The
annual output of a typical lignite mine exceeds significantly the average for
all coals 4.1 million tons per mine, as compared to the coal industry's
average of 2.0 million tons per mine. While more than 80% of tie lignite is
mined in open-pits, this share is only about 50% for brown coal and zero for
hard coal. Lignite production has been growing at about 6% per year over the
last 10 years (Annex 3.1), while production of hard and brown coal has been
virtually stagnant.
3.05          In 1988 the average costs of production from existing mines,
calculated in principle in line with international practice, were 1.7 $/GJ for
lignite, 2.6 $/GJ for brown coal and 2.0 $/GJ for hard coal. The lignite
mines of EP(S) at Kolubara and Kostolac in 1988 produced at a cost of 1.4
$/GJ. In comparison, the opportunity cost of imported steam coal in 1988 would
have been 2.4 S/GJ at the Yugoslavian border. After the introduction of new
Yugoslavian currency in 1990, the historic cost advantage of domestically
produced coal over imports reduced. Many hard and brown coal mines and some
of the lignite mines are now producing at costs higher than import parity.
However, the large lignite open-pit mines, in particular those of EP(S) still
have a significant cost advantage over imports.
3.06     Kolubara is by far the largest and among the most economical coal
producers in Yugoslavia. Its present production is 26 million tons of lignite
per year from 3 mines, contributing 43% to the country's lignite production
and 36% to its total coal and lignite production. The reported cost of
production from Kolubara's existing mines in 1988 was 1.4 S/GJ, or 20% lower
than the national average for lignite. It is estimated that the economic cost
of production of lignite from the proposed Tamnava West mine delivered at the
proposed Kolubara B power plant will be 2.4 $/GJ, which is lower than the cost
of imported coal delivered to the inteiior site (2.6S/GJ).
3.07     Kolubara mines - Yugoslavia's largest lignite producer - employing
continuous mining technology and modern equipment, has steadily increased its
annual operating time of a production unit (comprising excavators, conveyors
and stackers) from 4,000 hrs in 1979 to 5,200 hrs last year. This is
comparable to the best world standards. Yugoslavia loses heavily on its
underground mines. In Serbia, a study of its underground mines by the
Belgrade Mining Institute and the Belgrade Institute for Economic Efficiency
is now ongoing and will be completed around December 1991. After the results
of the study are available, a draft action program will be prepared by
July 31, 1992 by its owners and the Borrower of the proposeA loan (see para
4.01). Both the results of the study and the action program will be submitted
to the Bank for comments. For finalization of the action program and its
implementation, technical assistance by foreign experts will be needed and is
provided for in the Bank loan. Durina negotiations, both EPS and EP(S1 agreed
to develop and imolement an action orogram for restructurina the underground
mines. The orooram will be submitted for Bank comments by March 31, 1992.



- 12 -
C. Coal SuvRlY and Demand
3.08     The coal supply situation has been outlined at para 3.04.
Practically all domestic coal is of steam coal quality. In 1989, electric
power generation accounted for 85% of the end-use of domestic coal, industry
for 7% and other consumption (mainly by households) for 8%. Export of coal is
negligible, less than 0.1%. There are some imports of coking coal for the
metallurgical industry in the order of 4% of the country's total coal
consumption. Except for these coking coal imports, domestic supply and demand
is balance'. There are no reported cases of major production losses to
consumers due to coal shortages.
3.09     Future trends of supply and demand will mainly depend on development
of the power industry. In the past, new mining capacity has been developed in
step with increased pcwer demands. The larger lignite mines have normally a
well developed reserve base allowing continuation at present production levels
over the next 30 years or more. Lignite reserves in the Serbian province of
Kosovo by far exceed this level, and there is potential for significant
production increases.
D. Coal Investment Proaram
3.10     Yugoslavia has maintained high levels of investments in its coal
mining industry. Over the last 5 years, annual investments amounted to about
$300 million per year, equivalent to 5 S/t, or 0.5 $/GJ, or about 35% of the
production cost over that period. About 60% of the investments were used for
lignite - a relatively low share, considering the high reserves, the
production share of lignite and its potential for economic development.
3.11     In future, the shift towards open-pit lignite mines is expected to
continue, in line with the power development program which emphasizes
development of new lignite-based thermal generating capacity with proper
environmental impact control.
The Power Sub-Sector
A. Oroanization at the Federal and Republican Levels
3.12     Prior to December 1989, the power enterprises in the RAPs consisted
of about 620 individual units such as power and transmission plants,
distribution enterprises, and supporting technical institutes. These were
generally constituted as BOALs which were separate legal entities, each with
its own management and accounts, and which then associated themselves, on the
basis of joint agreements (called Self-Management Agreements) into
successively higher levels of organization, namely the Work Organization (WO)
or the COAL. The generation and transmission WOs (themselves composed of
several constituent BOALs) were members of a single COAL which, for each RAP,
represented the principal EP in that RAP. In some cases, the COALs also
included the distribution enterprises in the RAP. Because of the multi-level



- 13 -
management decision-making involved in this organizational structure
consisting of several units, the EPs were unable to take timely and effective
management decisions.
3.13     Major organizational changes are still ongoing in the power
subsector. While different models are followed for the reorganization of the
enterprises, the main thrust in most RAPs has been towards consolidating the
operations of the power enterprises including electricity distribution.
3.14     In Seroia, Vojvodina and Kosovo prior to 1990, the power industry was
represented as follows: (i) the Serbian power industry consisted of a
composite organization (ZEP) that was responsible for power generation and
transmission and some coal/lignite mines (while the largest lignite mines and
one thermal power plant were simultaneously members of another composite
organization REIKX), and distribution enterprises which were not members of
the composite organization; (ii) in Vojvodina, the composite organization was
responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution; and (iii) in
Kosovo, the composite organization included coal/lignite mines and generation
and transmission of power. The distribution enterprises were separate
entities.
3.15     The Serbian power organizations have now been reconstituted giving
the responsibility for lignite production, power generation and transmission
to three new enterprises as follows: (i) Elektroprivreda of Serbia (EPS) is
responsible in Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo for power transmission as well as
for coordination activities such as the formulation of common development
plans, joint construction of power facilities and their financing, pricing,
and formulation of RAP power balances; (ii) Elektroprivreda - EP(S) - is
responsible for lignite production and power generation in Serbia and
Vojvodina; and (iii) Elektroprivreda Kosovo - EP(K) - is responsible for
lignite production and power generation in Kosovo. Distribution of power at
voltages below 110 kV will be the responsibility of separate distribution
enterprises in each of the three RAPs. The power generation ente: ises -
EP(S) and EP(K) - sell their output to EPS which, in turn, sells power to the
distribution enterprises, directly to certain large consumers, to other RAPs,
and exports to other countrLes.
B. Existina Power Facilities and their Operations
3.16     The total Lnstalled generating capacity of Yugoslavia increased from
14,069 MW in 1980 to 21,489 MW in 1989 (Annex 3.2). Of the total in 1989,
20,594 MW was operated by the seven republican enterprlses and 895 MW by
autoproducers. Hydroelectric installations accounted for 8,385 MW or about
40%; the balance was thermal/nuclear. During 1989 the total generation was 83
TWh of which 57 TWh (68%) was from thermal/nuclear sources and the balance,
from hydro statLons. The maximum demand on the power stations was 11,918 MW
during wlnter and the annual system load factor 70.4%. Further information on
existing electric power facilities and their operations is given in Annex 3.3.

3.17     Yugoslavia hao a good interconnected system (Map No. 21858) which
covers 3,915 km of 400 kV, 5,434 km of 220 kV and 17,252 km of 110 kV lines
and is tied to several countries in both Western and Eastern Europe. It is
operated, by law, as a single technological unit entity. Reservoir operation
is well coordinated to avoid spillage of water; there was practically none
during the past six years. Scheduled maintenance of generating plant is
concentrated as muca as possible during spring and summer when river flows are
generally high and the demand is low. Despite this, the system reserve margin
during winter has consistently dropped to critical levels below 10% and
arrangements made to import electricity from neighboring countries in Europe.
During four out of the past five years, Yugoslavia has imported electricity
during winter.
3.18     This situation described above has arisen despite the large total
installed generating capacity because (a) low river flows in winter have been
observed to limit effective use of hydro capacity to about 4,000-5,000 KW and
(b) the availability of many thermal generating units, especially those with
unit sizes of 300 MW and below, has deteriorated due to operating beyond their
design lives and/or burning poorer quality fuels than their boilers were
designed for, thus resulting in high forced-outage rates on most of the older,
generating units and longer periods of scheduled maintenance. In this
context, the imperatives for the power sub-sector clearly are: (a) when
selecting new generation expansion projects to give priority to those projects
with adequate firm energy potential (as distinct from hydro peaking capacity,
which the system presently has); and (b) developing and implementing an
economically justifiable rehabilitation program of thermal generating units,
with significant unexpired or renewable service lives. The Bank as part of
the project addresses this area in the Republic of Serbia.
3.19     The Bank also noted in 1989 that the prevailing Yugoslav approach of
planning rehabilitation of entire TPPs was not sufficiently cost-effective.
It proposed instead a two-phase program with a one-year, first-phase involving
a country-wide study to identify rehabilitation measures on a generating unit-
by-unit basis and the second phase covering the rehabilitation work spread
over a period depending on the results of the first phase. The program would
be implemented by Yugoslav enterprises with the assistance of experienced
consultants. Terms of reference for the study prepared by the Bank were
forwarded to JUGEL and EPS, and there is agreement with the Bank approach.
The situation of TPPs in Serbia has been reviewed. It was noted that besides
major rehabilitation, some critical maintenance work, postponed by financial
constraints, also required immediate attention in Serbia. It was therefore
agreed that the Bank will include in the proposed loan a component covering
both critical maintenance work and an eight year rehabilitation action plan
for Serbia. Necessary technical assistance will be included. Under
subsequent energy loans this work could be extended to the other republics.

C. The Electricity Demand
National
3.20     Past Consumption.  The growth of electricity consumption in
Yugoslavia and the Gross Social Product (GSP) from 1975 to 1989 is given in
Annex 3.4. Until 1980, electricity consumption in Yugoslavia grew at an
annual average rate of about 8.4% mainly due to the expansion of large energy
intensive industries.  .he economy also grew rapidly with the growth rate of
GSP averaging about 5.6% per year. Although in the subsequent five years GSP
growth rate averaged about 0,7% per year, electricity consumption growth
averaged about 4.5% only. With further slow-down of the economy in 1985-89 -
GSP growth rate averaging about 0.3% - electricity consumption growth
averaged about 2.2%. Growth of consumption by industry and mining, which
accounts for about 60% of the total, wad households (for about 30%), increased
at the same rate as the national aggregate. The share of transport declined
and was compensated by sharp increases in agriculture. Throughout 1975-1989
electricity consumption has grown at a higher rate than GSP implying a GSP
elasticity higher than 1.0.
3.21     Future Electricity Demand.  Forecasts of future electricity demand
have been prepared to verify the need and the timing of the proposed project.
The future growth of electricity consumption would be influenced by the rate
at which the economy pulls out of the current recession and the combined
effects of macro-economic reform and industrial restructuring on increasing
efficiency of electricity use. In 1990, GSP is expected to decline by 7%
compared to 1989. Electricity consumption in 1990 is estimated to be equal to
the 1989 level. For the subsequent years, consumption growth rate would, at
least, equal GSP growth rate. Improvements in efficiency of energy (including
electricity) use would begin to be realized after 1995. Therefore,
electricity consumption is projected to grow at about 1t in 1991, 2% in 1992
and 3% each year thereafter up to 1995 and about 2.5% per year till year 2000
and 2% per year till 2005. These estimates are realistic. Summary of the
forecast is provided in Table 3.1 below.
Table 3.1: Summary Forecast Future Electricity Demand
1990    1991    1995    2000    2005
Energy (GWh)             73,360  74,093  82,582  93,433  103,157
Max. Demand (MW)         11,920  12,039  13,418  15,180   16,760
3.22     The above forecasts assume a GSP elasticity of 1.0 and GSP growth
rates in line with the Federal Government's enid 1990 projections (1% in 1991,
2% in 1992 and 3% thereafter) up to 1995. The lower electricity growth rates
of 2.5% per year up to 2000 and 2.0% per year up to 2005 are based on
anticipations of improvements in efficiency due to industrial restructuring

Exports to other countries                      946      1,460     1,783
3.24     Demand in Serbia is forecasted to grow at an annual average of about
3.2% during 1990-95, and about 3% each year thereafter up to the year 2000.
The lower growth rate after 1995 assumes improvements in efficiency of
electricity use.
3.25     EPS has assumed that power supplies to other republics and exports
overseas will remain at their 1990 levels throughout the forecast period.
This apparently reflects the prevailing intentions, but may be co,nservative
due to the large energy deficits at the other republics and to '.he lack of any
major new source of energy generation emerging in those republics in the near
future. Further, there is the prospect of an early shutdown in the operation
of the country's only nuclear power generating unit at Krsko. If it
transpires, this would seriously aggravate the country's electricity supply
deficits.
3.26     On the basis of the above, the maximum demand on the EPS power supply
system is forecast to grow from 5,317 MW in 1990 to 6,166 MW in 1995 and
6,935 MW in the year 2000. The summary of the demand forecast is shown in
Table 3.3.

D.  Electricity Investment Program
National
3.27        Efforts were made by the Bank during 1983-86 to have the
government develop a national least cost electricity generation expansion
program. These have not succeeded as the republics continued to place greater
emphasis on self sufficiency in electricity generation. However, there were
signs of progress until 1989 through: (i) increases in the number of planned
joint-venture schemes among the enterprises; (ii) preparation during 1988/89
of a draft social compact among the power entities to better define principles
of pooling finances for joint projects; and (iii) the appointment of an
independent local consulting firm, Energoprojekt, by JUGEL, to prepare a
national long-term least cost generation expansion program up to the year
2010. The study has not progressed, inter-alia, because of the lack of an
agreed national electricity demand forecast beyond 1995 and conflicting inter-
republican priorities. An ambitious US$5.9 billion Joint-Development Program
was announced in 1989 for the period 1991-1995 aiming at adding 5,414 MW of
generating capacity. It was no more than an aggregation of investment
programs of the individual enterprises and a far cry from a national least
cost program. In any case, financial constraints have severely curtailed
implementation of this program. No more than 74 MW of new generating capacity
is actually expected to be added during 1991-1995, not enough even to replace
the 193 MW of planned plant retirement. This would result in net energy
shortages appearing in most republics from 1993 onwards.



_ 18 _
Serbia
3.28        EPS has prepared a detailed eight year development program for
1991-1998 (Annex 7.3, Table 2). It is a realistic program, involving an
outlay of about US$2 billion on development of power plants, associated coal
mines, transmission systems, rehabilitation, environmental protection and
related activities. The major projects in the near term are the 700 KW
Kolubara extensions with the associated lignite mine (the subject project of
this report) and rehabilitation of thermal plants.
E. Bank Strateav and Role in the Power and Coal Sub-sectors
3.29        Bank lending to the energy sector started in 1961.  It has
totalled US$884.9 million through 14 loans of which 8, (about US$594.0
million) were to the power subsector (Annex 3.5). The power loans
concentrated on: (a) new hydro projects, and (b) completing the extra high
voltage (EHV) national grid at 400 kV and modernizing its control. They
attempted to strengthen JUGEL and introduce economic (long-run marginal cost-
LRMC) pricing in energy (see para 2.12). Except for Loan 2338, all loans were
implemented as planned with slight delays. Despite the extended and
substantial Bank assistance to the sector, JUGEL remains weak. Substantial
energy shortages are expected in most republics from 1993. There is little
national planning. On the positive side, the projects executed by individual
power utilities were carried out efficiently and on time, adding valuable
hydro resources to the grid. The first and second power transmission loans
helped build up the national 400 kV grid - an invaluable asset to the country
at this stage.
3.30        The multi-republic Third Power Transmission Project (Loan 2338-
YU; US$115.0 million) has run into serious delays and implementation problems
arising from its technical/financial complexities and the increasingly
difficult institutional environment. These risks were foreseen, though
underestimated. There was practically no procurement action on the main
project items until 1987 (five years after appraisal) due to: (a) delay in
meeting the condition for loan effectiveness (tariff increase), and (b) delay
by the borrowers in establishing a central project implementation agency
following protracted local procedures of 620 basic work organizations. To
reflect this delay in January 1988, the Bank amended the loan amortization
schedule and extended the closing date. Serious procurement difficulties
arose by end 1989 on contract awards for the main control equipments for which
bids were invited during 1987/1988. Rapid technological developments rendered
much of this equipment - designed in the early eighties - obsolete and costly.
These bids had to be cancelled. The Bank advised the borrowers to redesign
the project. The borrowers agreed in April 1990, reducing costs (by about
US$28 million) but inevitably postponing project completion to December 1995.
Engineering work is now progressing well and the remaining procurement actions
have been expedited. There ia confidence therefore that the project, as
redesigned, will be completed to the revised schedule and provide commensurate
benefits.



- 19 -
3.31        Important lessons that have been learnt are that:  (a) when
implementing multi-republican projects in the future special care should be
taken to ensure that the necessary institutional arrangements, including
delegation of appropriate authority, are properly instituted prior to making
the loan effective, and (b) special care is taken to improve procurement
efficiency. These are being applied to projects included in the Bank'.
pipeline. Future Bank lending in the power sector would continue to support
thermal and hydro projects capable ef supplying the Yugoslav grid with large
blocks of energy economically and also measures to strengthen the high voltage
grids. This assistance would be considered, however, only in the context of
an updated and mutually agreed energy sector strategy. The Yugoslav
Government has been informed that projects to be supported by the Bank must,
in any case, have a demonstrable high national priority and be environmantally
acceptable. The Bank would continue to focus on strengthening JUGEL's role in
national planning and on the promotion of joint-venture projects between
republics (para 2.20).
3.32        The Bank's principal strategy for the coal sub-sector would be to
assist in developing efficient, environmentally acceptable, and economic open-
pit lignite mining in the framework of a least-cost power development program.
Although in the past the Bank has not had a lending operation in the coal
sector, previous Bank missions have discussed speciflc projects and sector
issues with Yugoslav authorities and this work was helpful in the selection
and preparation of the proposed project.

IV. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
A. Overview
4.01      Since its establishment in 1990, EPS - the bulk power supply agency
for Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo - has the statutory responsibility for
organizing the construction of all new generating stations, coal and lignite
mines and the transmission system in Serbia. Therefore, EPS will be
responsible for implementation of the project; upon completion, EP(S) - the
electricity generation enterprise in Serbia and Vojvodina - will become the
owner and operator of the facilities. EPS will be the Borrower for the
proposed Bank loan and EP(S), which operates all mines and generating stations
in Serbia (excep- those in Kosovo), will be the beneficiary of the loan (also
see paras 6.11 and 6.14). EPS and EP(S) have entered into a contractual
arrangement for the implementation and related financial responsibilities of
the project on the basis described above. The objectives, functions,
organization and managements and operations of the two organizations are
summarized below.
B. ElektroRrivreda Serbia (EPS1
4.02      EPS was established in 1990 with the objectives of ensuring, in the
whole of Serbia (including the provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo): (i)
operation and unified management of the interconnected power supply system as
a single technological unit; (ii) harmonized development of the power
industry; (iii) rational and efficient exploitation of the natural resources;
and (iv) balanced development of power supply facilities. Its principal
functions consist of: (i) preparing a common, jointly adopted, development
plan for EPS, EP(S) and (EP(K); and the power supply balance for Serbia; (ii)
establishing criteria for rational and efficient operations of all power
supply facilities; (iii) coordinating electricity exchanges within Serbia and
supplies to other republics; (iv) setting criteria for pricing, general
conditions of power supply and the tariff system; (v) setting criteria for
rational and efficient construction of power and mining facilities;
(vi) establishing common plans for rehabilitation of power supply facilities;
and (vii) carrying out research, investigations and preliminary work on new
projects for power generation, mining, transmission and research. The
organizational structures (with historical development) are shown in Annexes
4.1, 4.2.
4.03      EPS is a public enterprise with the Republic of Serbia as its sole
founder.   EPS's management structure consists of a Workers' Council, a
Supervisory Board, and operational management. The Workers' Council is the
highest decision-making body in the enterprise. To safeguard the social
interest, representatives of the RAP Assemblies also participate in making key
decisions, such as establishment of prices of power and coal/lignite; and in
appointing the General and Deputy General Directors. There is a Supervisory
Board with 15 members to carry out functions delegated to it by the Workers'
Council. Operational management is headed by the General Director, assisted
by Deputy General Directors, selected by the Workers Council through open
competition and appointed on renewable four-year terms.



- 21 -
4.04      EPS has the following eLght Directorates, each headed by a Directors
energy management; marketing; transmission and telecommunication; research and
development; investments; consultancy and design; economics, finance, and
accounting; and, administration and legal affairs. EPS's organizational
structure has been reviewed and found to be satisfactory to the Bank.
4.05      The investment plans of EPS and the two power/ligiite producers in
Serbia (EP(S) and EP(K), consist of (a) investments that fall under a jointly
agreed Common Development Plan, and (b) own investments. Decisions on
investments included in the Common Development Plan are made at the level of
EPS. Local currency financing of such investments is met primarily from
pooled internally generated funds of both power and specified non-power
enterprises that are collected under a republican Law on Compulsory Pooling of
Funds (LCPF) for the power industry. Investment plans are made at the
beginning of each five year plan period, and are revised and implemented
through annual decisions of EPS's Workers' Council. Current regulations
require the updating of investment cost estimates at least twice a year. Cost
overruns and their financing require the approval of the Workers' Council.
4.06      As required under Yugoslav accounting and auditing regulations in
force until January 1989, detailed basic accounts were kept at the level of
the BOALs. These regulations did not require conso.idated financial
statements for the higher level organizations like the Work Organization or
the Composite Organization. Similarly external auditing, by independent
auditors, was not a requirement. As a result of these, and due to local
accounting regulations, until recently the Yugoslav accounting system
generally differed significantly from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP). While a substantial amount of information is being collected and
processed, the emphasis has generally been on meeting external reporting
requirements under various local, republican and federal regulations. There
has been less emphasis on developing a basis for management decision-making,
e.g., in budget preparation, monitoring, and control; comparing actual and
planned performance analysis of variances; monitoring performance of
cost/profit centers; short term and medium term financial planning, including
the preparation of appropriate financial and cash flow forecasts; and
financial management including management of working capital. There is
considerable room for improvements, particularly in the fields of internal
audit and making it independent of operational management. Also, all the
accounting and financial functions are spread among various units (e.g., the
economic and planning departments, the investment department, etc.). The
coordination between the units needs to be strengthened. EPS and EP(S)
management have agreed that an appropriate study be undertaken to identify
actions needed to improve their accounting and financial management systems.
Draft terms of reference (TORs, Annex 4.3) was discussed with both EPS and
EP(S). The work will be undertaken with the assistance of institutes/
consultants acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations aareement has been
reached with both EPS and EPMS} regarding the imolementation of the necessary
actions to be undertaken according to a schedule to be agreed with the Bank
after joint review of the diagnostic phase of the study which is expected to
take olace not later than June 1992.

C.  lkrivreda I3PIS
4.07      EP(S) was also established in 1990.  Its principal functions ares
(i) hydro and thermal power generation, including construction, maintenance
and rehabilitation, and (ii) coal/lignite production and transport. These
activities are limited to the territories of Serbia and Vojvodina; the
corresponding functions in Kosovo are handled by a separate (new) agency viz
Electroprivreda (Kosovo) - EP(K). In addition to these EP(S) also has
associated activities such as production of spares for mining and power
equipment; rubber conveyor belting and related rubber products; construction
materials based on by-products from the mines; and catering services for their
staff.
4.08      EP(S) is a public enterprise.  Details of its organizational and
management structure are given in Annex 4.4. As in the case of EPS, EP(S)
management structure consists of a Workers' Council, a Supervisory Board, and
operational management, headed by a General Director. The distribution of
functions and authorities among various management bodies is similar to that
in EPS. EP(S)'s Supervisory Board consists of 15 members of whom nine are
appointed by the concerned RAP Assemblies (six from Serbia and three from
Vojvodina) and the remaining six by the Workers' Council.
4.09      EP(S) has six departments responsible for electric power production;
open pit lignite production; underground lignite production; investment and
rehabilitation; economics, financial affairs and accounting; and
administrative and legal affairs. The new lignite mine and thermal power
plant to be set up under the Project will be parts of EP(S)'s power production
and lignite mine departments.
4.10      Investments included under the Common Development Plan have to be
coordinated at the level of EPS. EP(S) can make other investments on its own
account which do not qualify for assistance from the jointly pooled funds.
Other considerations in regard to investment planning and financing are
similar to those discussed for EPS.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Obiectives
5.01   The objectives of the Project are to:  (i) meet the growth in demand
for electricity in Serbia, including its supplies to other republics, most
economically in the late nineties; (ii) facilitate rehabilitation of aging
thermal generating units in Serbia; (iii) introduce a systematic air-quality
monitoring and study program in the Kolubara area; and (iv) improve the
financial performance of EPS and EP(S) and strengthen their capacities in
financial management/accounting.
B. Project DescriDtion
5.02   The project comprises:
(i) construction of a 7.0 million tons per year lignite mine at
Tamnava West in Serbia;
(ii) construction of a 700 MW (2 x 350 MW) mine-head Thermal Power
Plant and auxiliary facilities at Kolubara B site located at the
north end of Tamnava west mine field;
(iii) urgent maintenance/rehabilitation of Thermal Power Plants in
Serbia;
(iv) technical assistance for: (a) an eight year Power Plant
rehabilitation action plan in Serbia; (b) financial management,
accounting and relevant training and cost of service studies for
tariff determination and monitoring; (c) long-term mining
development plan for the Kolubara area, (d) restructuring of
Serbia's underground mines; and (e) long-term regional air
quality monitoring program and training.
Details of the project are given in Annex 5.1. Its location is shown on IBRD
Map Nos. 21857 and 21858. The project constitutes the first phase of
development of the resources of Tamnava West Mine. In the second phase, it is
expected that production at this mine will be increased to 10.5 mtpy and the
installed generating capacity at Kolubara B station will be increased to 1050
MW (see para 5.12).
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.03   The main thrust of the Bank's assistance strategy in Yugoslavia is _
support the country's ongoing economic reform drive. Since the early 1980s,
Yugoslavia has embarked on a long-term economic adjustment and restructuring
program intended to give the economy a greater market-based orientation, with
a view to the Europe of 1992 and beyond. This effort was supported in FY83 by
the Bank's first SAL to Yugoslavia, as a part of an international financial
support package which included two IMF standby arrangements and rescheduling
agreements with official and commercial creditors. Following some policy
slippage in the mid-1980s, the reform efforts were reactivated in 1988 and, by
early 1990, a new stabilization and adjustment program was being implemented.



- 24 -
This ongoing effort was also supported by a Fund standby and a second SAL from
the Bank in FY90. In order to deepen the supply response of the adjustment,
the proposed country assistance program includes lending operations in support
of: the further restructuring of the financial and enterprise sectors; the
development of small and medium enterprises, particularly in the rapidly
growing private sector; the development of private agriculture; and the
further strengthening of the social safety net. Sector and project investment
operations in the transport, energy, water supply and environment sectors aim
at supporting the country's efforts to improve broad sectoral policies,
primarily in the areas oft pricing and cost recovery, investment choice,
operational efficiency, strengthening maintenance capacities, and achieving an
appropriate balance between maintenance and new investments. The project
proposed in this document falls in this category of Bank support.
5.04   The project would be the Bank's first involvement in the coal and
thermal power sub-sectors. There is already power shortage in the country and
in five years time it is expected to become an acute problem. The urgent need
to rehabilitate the aging thermal power plants in Serbia would further
intensify the problem. Lignite is the country's largest and only known major
indigenous source of electricity generation for the future as: (a) most of
the sizable hydro resources have already been developed; (b) the oil and gas
reserves are very limited; and (c) a moratorium has been placed on new nuclear
plants until the year 2000. Consequently, the proposed project is in line
with the energy policy of Yugoslavia to develop lignite-fired thermal units in
association with the domestic lignite mine development. Implementation of the
project started in 1985 and stopped not long after that due to foreign
exchange shortages. The Bank support for the project will ensure its
recommencement and the timely implementation of needed power generating
facilities and mining development, all which would have to resolve the future
energy shortage. Furthermore the proposed loan would assist in the
rationalizing of the institutions in the energy sector and enhance their
capabilities to deal with major policy issues.
D. Project Preparation
5.05   The feasibility study for the Tamnava West mine was prepared in 1984
by EPS with the help of the Belgrade Mining Institute. The terms of reference
for the study were prepared in consultation with the Bank. It is based on
detailed studies and preparatory work, including 28,000 m of drilling and
considerable experience in designing and operating similar mines. The
feasibility report on the TPP component was also prepared in 1984 by EPS and
Energoprojekt. After detailed technical studies it was decided to incorporate
features in the design of the turbines (at a cost of about $0.2 million) to
enable future operation of the TPP as a combined heat and power facility.
This is appropriate as the additional cost is insignificant and it leaves
flexibility in future options. Implementation of the project commenced in
1985 against the expectation at that time of rapid economic growth and a high
demand forecast. In 1987-1989 the entire power sector experienced
considerable liquidity problems, and as a result construction work slowed down
during 1987-89 and virtually stopped during 1990. Subsequently, the
Government approached the Bank to provide assistance for this project. The



- 25 -
feasibility study war updated in 1989 by EPS and reviewed by the Bank. The
design concept and plant and site layout. are sound.
E. Environmental Aspects
5.06   General.  Kolubara is located about 50 km southeast of Belgrade.  The
region is defined by a 2,500 million ton, low sulfur (about 0.5 percent),
lignite deposit which currently supplies three TPPs -- Kolubara "A" (270 MW)
at the mine head, Nikola Tesla "A" (1640 MW) and Nikola Tesla "B" (1240 MW).
When the proposed Kolubara "B" (700 MW) project is operating, total regional
capacity would be about 3850 MW. At present, lignite production is about 29
mtpy, increasing to 36 mtpy in 1997 with project implementation. Fuel for
Kolubara "B" will be supplied from the new Tamnava West mine. This mine has
reserves of 360 million tons overlain by about 20-30 m of overburden on an
area of about 2000 ha. The plant site extends over an additional 600 ha.
Population in this area is about 1600. Winds are generally from E-SE and
West-Northwest and the area is primarily flat farmland. Thus any emissions
are likely to be easily and rapidly dispersed. The point of maximum impact in
the East-South direction is approximately 15 km from the Kolubara B power
station and falls off rapidly thereafter. Even in this direction winds are
experienced only 16% of the time during the year. Thus any adverse effect of
the Kolubara B power station upon the Belgrade air quality is extremely
unlikely.
5.07   Environmental Assessment.  World Bank involvement with this project
predates O.D. 4.00 concerning environmental assessment. Nonetheless
environmental assessments for the power station and dam have been prepared in
compliance with federal and republic of Serbia procedures. These assessments
were reviewed by the Bank and found to be completed to a level that satisfies
World Bank requirements. All three components (power station, mine and water
supply dam) were reviewed and approved by responsible Serbian authorities.
Copies of all environmental documents and official approval notifications are
available in the project file.
5.08   The main issues addressed are:  (a) resettlement of families at power
station, mine and water supply dam sites, (b) mine reclamation and
recultivation, (c) existing and projected air quality, (d) atmospheric
emissions and standards compliance, (e) effluent treatment and control, and
water quality, (f) fly and bottom ash disposal, (g) water supply, and
(h) noise. These issues are discussed in paras 5.09-5.27 below.
5.09   Resettlement.  Plant Site and Tamnava West Mine: Resettlement involves
a total of 411 families (about 1600 people) of which 64 families are located
at the plant site and the remainder at the mine. Families at the mine site
will be resettled gradually as the mine face advances southward. The program
started in 1985 and will continue throughout the project life. Resettlement
procedures, practices and regulations were reviewed with the Serbian Minister
for Urban Affairs and are considered to be in compliance with World Bank
requirements. Families were offered three alternatives: (a) cash
compensation; (b) a house with the remaining value in cash; and (c) a rental
apartment and the remaining value in cash. Additionally families are given



- 26 -
employment opportunities at either mine or power station including any
training which might be necessary. To date, 36 families have been resettled
in accordance with Serbian procedures. Individual discussions with several of
these families indicated complete satisfaction with the manner in which the
program was implemented and their new accommodations.
5.10   Stuborovni Dam Site:  The need for this water supply reservoir is
explained at para 5.25.  Resettlement will ultimately involve 62 families of
which 30 have already been physically relocated. The resettlement program at
this site is in compliance with World Bank requirements and relocated families
are satisfied with both program implementation and their new accommodations.
In addition to families, the site of Gracanica church on the Susica River
(built between XIV and XV centuries) would be affected by the dam project.
Accordingly, the church is to be relocated to another site approved by the
Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments, the church Chairman and local
people utilizing the church. Adequate funds for the relocation have been
included in the project budget.  Resettlement and relocation are the chief
responsibility of the city of Valjevo the main owner of the dam. EPS'
ownership constitutes 28%.
5.11   Mine Reclamation and Recultivation.  EPS has a good ongoing mine
reclamation program at Tamnava. After lignite is fully excavated, mined out
areas are filled with overburden from the active sites, covered with topsoil,
then recultivated with grass, trees or utilized for certain agricultural
purposes.  Over the years, EPS has established a well trained staff and
nurseries to successfully manage recultivation and reforestation of mined out
areas.
5.12   Although reclamation and recultivation is coaducted in a manner
completely satisfactory to the Bank, there is still a need for a long term
mine development plan to avoid potential conflicts between existing and
planned land use and mine expansion. EPS recognizes this issue and is
preparing a plan in agreement with local communities. An immediate plan
objective is to define design and sequencing of future mining operations,
resettlement requirements, environmental impact, and operating cost
assessments for two scenarios: with and without Kolubara "B", Phase 2. This
would establish the framework for Kolubara's short and medium term planning of
mining and further expansion of regional power production. Plan preparation
would be implemented by the Belgrade Mining Institute which is well qualified
for such an effort. Terms of reference for preparation of a long term mining
development plan for the Kolubara area have been discussed and are at Annex
5.2. At negotiations. EPS agreed: (i} to carry out a long-term mining
development plan at Kolubara on the basis of terms of reference and the
timetable agreed with the Bank: and (ii) discussions of study results with the
Bank before implementing Phase 2 of the Kolubara B power plant and associated
mine exPansions or the development or exDansion of other existing mines to
suoolv that olant.
5.13   Existing and Proiected Air Quality.  Air quality measurements for
sulfur dioxide and dust are collected in the Kolubara region with an extensive
network of monitoring stations. Most equipment for sulfur dioxide monitoring



- 27 -
is older, based upon wet chemical methods. A limited number of modern x-ray
fluorescence automatic continuous monitoring devices of French manufacture are
in the vicinity of Nikola Teula A. Annex 5.3, Part A indicates air quality
standards of the World Bank, European Community, Germany (typifying a strict
Western European country) and Serbia. Part B of Annex 5.3 provides monitoring
results near the proposed project site (noted as "Tamnava A"), near the
existing Nikola Tesla A power station (1640 MW) and the Kolubara A power
station (270 MW). Additionally a sophisticated meteorological monitoring
station is also operating at the "Tamnava A" site.
5.14   Based upon the data collected, it can reasonably be concluded that air
quality in the region with respect to sulfur dioxide complies with
internationally recognized standards. More limited data on dust measurements
also indicate a similar conclusion is more than likely. Air quality estimates
made under the most conservative assumptions possible (highest elevated
background levels observed, 1989 Tamnava A background data), after project
implementation are provided in Annex 5.3, Part D. These estimates indicate
that the project would comply with sulfur dioxide standards of the World Bank
and EC criteria for annual average and winter average (a most critical
criteria). The EC 98 percentile criteria would probably be met, but a precise
determination could only be made with the additional data to be collected as
part of the regional air quality study (see para 5.18). At present, the
Federal Government is seeking to establish air quality standards and the
Bank's recommendation is that those of the EC should be adopted. It is likely
Serbia would follow those adopted by the Federal Government. Should Serbia
adopt EC air quality standards, it is extremely unlikely that the proposed
project would result in anv violations.
5.15   There are several reasons for confidence in the above conclusions
concerning air quality:
(a)   Detailed meteorological data is collected on-site.
(b)   Dispersion models for the simple terrain are most trustworthy.
(c)   Estimates of source strengths (flue gas composition) (see Annex
5.4 and following discussion) appear reasonable and consistent
with flue analyses of existing units utilizing the same fuel.
5.16   Air Emissions.  Annex 5.3, Part C compares World Bank, EC, and German
emission standards for sulfur dioxide, dust, and nitrogen oxides (at present,
neither Serbia nor the Federal Government have established emission standards
for thermal power stations) with estimated levels anticipated from Kolubara B.
Annex 5.4 provides results of emission measurements for several power stations
in the region utilizing similar fuel. From these data, it can be readily
concluded that Kolubara "B" will meet all standards with respect to dust and
nitrogen oxides and easily meet the World Bank sulfur dioxide emission
standard. Furthermore, estimates of Kolubara "B" stack emissions for sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxides are consistent with results from existing power
stations firing similar fuels and dust emissions while somewhat stricter than



x 28 -
current operations are nonetheless readily achievable with existing
technology.
5.17   Currently, the Federal Government is considering phase-in of EC
emission standards. Serbia possesses 77% of the countries' lignite resources
and these resources are an integral part of Yugoslavia's overall development
plans in energy/power sectors. Thus the proposed study (para 5.18), although
regional in character, will nonetheless provide a critical planning tool for
both the Republic of Serbia and the country as a whole to determine prospects
of additional lignite development and associated costs while phasing-in
compliance with EC emission standards for power generation facilities. At the
Bank's request a study was done by EPS on the cost for phase-in of EC sulfur
dioxide emission standards for Kolubara B. This study indicated that an
additional US$133 million would be required in order to include a flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) unit into the Kolubara B design. The Bank was informed
by both Federal and Serbian Ministers of Environment that a phase-in of EC
sulfur dioxide emission standards would be gradual and require further study.
In particular, for Kolubara B specific provisions have been made to include
FGD when necessary. Indications are that this is not likely to take place for
at least 10 to 15 years after plant commissioning. All parties agreed that
provisions of appropriate land area at the plant site for possible future
construction of an FGD unit would be a sufficient consideration in the
proposed project design. Accordingly an area of 11,000 m2 has been set aside;
this is adequate.
5.18   Measuren.ents from the existing regional air quality system have
brought out a limited number of cases where the overly restrictive Serbian
ambient standards (for example, sulphur dioxide) have been exceeded. The
substantial level of energy related activities in the Kolubara region that
could develop further in the future, suggest that a comprehensive and
consistent characterization of regional air quality should be developed. At
loan negotiations agreement was reached that EPS will initiate a maior long-
term action oriented vrogram of air crualitv monitorina/energy development
plannina accordina to the terms of reference and the timetable (Annex 5.5L
acreed with the Bank. Both the mine development plan (para 5.12) and air
quality/energy development study will provide critical information on
environmental implications and costs of Yugoslavia's future energy development
policies with respect to adoption of EC standards and practices.
5.19   Effluent Treatment, Control and Water Quality.  Wastewaters at
Kolubara B will be generated from sewage, runoff, and process operations
(cooling system drainage, backwash from boiler feedwater purification column,
boiler tube cleaning, water treatment and condensate plants). Mine
wastewaters will collect in the pit.
5.20   Sewage wastewaters will receive secondary (biological) treatment to a
level within Serbian standards and well within World Bank guidelines - runoff
waters will be discharged without treatment. Indications are that water
quality of effluents are substantially super.or to water quality of the
Kladnica river which is to receive these discharges.



- 29 -
5.21   All process wastewaters will be used as slurry medium for the
hydraulic ash transport system. No wastewaters are to be discharged and,
thus, no environmental impacts are anticipated.
5.22   Collected mine wastewaters will both infiltrate the groundwater and
overflow into the Kladnica river. Since river water quality is substantially
below that of the pit overflow, no negative influence is expected from this
discharge. Groundwaters will, in part, be affected. A study entitled
"Remarks on the Groundwater Regime and the open Pit Mine Tamnava Exploitation
(January 15, 1991)" indicated five separate aquifers in the region of
interest: two near the surface underlain by three others. The bottom-most
three are virtually isolated in a geologic sense from the upper-most two. The
surface aquifers are currently utilized by surrounding farmhouses and the
deeper aquifers by local municipalities and industries.
5.23   The project mining component is only likely to have an adverse affect
on water quality of the surface aquifers. The borrower has, therefore,
drilled wells to the underlying aquifers as an alternative supply for current
users identified above (para 5.22). EPS is also investigating possible reuse
of pit wastewaters within their processes as a further means of minimizing any
influences on the aquifers near the surface.
5.24   All measures and practices adopted to protect surface and groundwaters
are within Serbian standards and World Bank guidelines and are considered
satisfactory.
5.25   Fly and Bottom Ash Disposal.  Annual ash generation is anticipated to
be about 1.36 million tons. For Kolubara "B", a disposal site at the Tamnava
East mine will be prepared that will virtually isolate the ash from its
surroundings and assure negligible impacts on any groundwaters. A study
entitled, "Influence of Ash Deposits on Water Quality of the Kolubara Basin
(January 15,1991)" indicated the proposed technique will result in a
permeability through the site of less than 10.12 m/s.  Permeabilitiek  4n this
range are considered acceptable even for disposal of hazardous waste.
5.26   Water SuDPlV. Kolubara B TPP will require an average of 1127 m3/h of
fresh water. At peak hours this can increase to 2718 m3/h. To insure this
supply and a better quality of raw water, EPS will participate with the City
of Valjevo and other republican authorities in construction of the 75 m high
dam at Stuborovni on the Jablanica river. The reservoir will have a storage
capacity of 49.5 million O3.  Kolubara "B" TPP will utilize 8-9 million m3 and
the remainder will be used as a potable water supply to surrounding villages
and cities. General construction started in 1987. Access roads and river
diversion works have been completed.
5.27   Main dam construction will start in the spring of 1992 and will take
two years. Reservoir filling will start in 1994 and require another year.
Currently, this activity is not critical, but if delays in some crucial
contracts continue, it could become an element on the critical path. During
loan negotiations the Reoublic of Serbia agreed to take all steos necessary
(includina provision of finances) to ensure completion of the Stuborovni water



_30 -
suoRlv dam by 1994. to initiate operation during that year. to assure water
supplies for the Kolubara B thermal Rower station.
5.28   Noise.  Noise sources from the project originate at the mine
(excavation, lignite crushing and open conveyor lignite transport to the power
station) and at Kolubara "B" TPP (boiler, turbo generator, cooling tower,
draft fans, coal/ash transport and electrostatic precipitators). World Bank
guidelines for noise will be included as a minimum requirement for any
equipment used. Additionally, the entire area will be surrounded by a
greenbelt to further insulate surrounding communities from any noise impacts.
5.29   Occupational Health and Safety.  The power station and mine will be
constructed and operated in accordance with Western standards of safety. No
polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs') will be utilized in any of the equipment
associated with the physical project facilities.
5.30   Complete fire protection/emergency response systems designed to
Western standards are to be included in both mine and power station
facilities.
F. Proiect Implementation
5.31   Imolementation Agencv.  As explained in Chapter IV, since 1990 EPS has
the responsibility for continuing the implementation of the Kolubara B TPP
and Tamnava West Mine development project. The antecedent organizations which
initiated the project have now been incorporated in EP(S). EPS and EP(S) have
entered into a contract to define both technical and financial implementation
related arrangements and responsibilities. EPS will carry out its
construction responsibilities in close cooperation with the relevant mining
and TPP divisions of EP(S). The organization chart of the construction unit
is set out in Annex 5.6. Management and staff have been drawn from the more
experienced personnel of EP(S)'s power and lignite mine departments. The
staffing is satisfactory for a project of this magnitude.
5.32   Status of Imolementation.  Implementation of the Project was started
in 1985 with commissioning of both generating units then planned by 1992.
Equipment contracts were all bid internationally, seeking suppliers credits
and civil works were bid locally. There was good international response for
the main equipment contracts and negotiations thereafter. By 1987, nine
contracts for the TPP component - for preparatory civil works and piling,
boiler island, turbine island, electrical equipment, the electro filters,
water treatment plant, crane and elevator were awarded to reputed
international manufacturers and suppliers at competitive prices.  Credits
totalling US$144 million were arranged. For the mining component, contracts
for the bucket wheel excavators, a stacker and some auxiliary equipment have
been placed. Sixteen contracts remain to be placed for the TPP and six for
the mine.
5.33   Site activities already completed include auxiliary buildings, most of
the site preparation, all the plant piling and part of the foundation work,
with the exception of the turbine-generator foundation. The two boiler drums



- 31 -
(one for each unit) are now being stored on site along with a large part of
the boiler tubing, headers, flues and ducts and other large component parts.
Selection of the project erection contractor has been started. EPS has
started prequalification far this complex $45 million contract. Preparation
of bidding documents is under way.
5.34   The implementation schedule of the project is presented in Annex 5.7.
Key dates of project implementation are given in Annex 5.8. Site preparation
for power plant will be completed by June 1991, and construction of turbine-
generator pedestal will follow in July 1991. Commissioning of the first unit
will be targeted for December 1995; the second unit will follow 12 months
later, in December 1996.
5.35   TPP Rehabilitation.  As stated at para 3.19 EPS has agreed to prepare
and implement a two-phase TPP rehabilitation program for Serbia on the lines
suggested by the Bank in August 1989. In view of its complexity and the large
scale of financing required, both local and foreign, the major items of work
have to be spread over a number of years - realistically about seven - and it
must start with the most urgent requirements to maintain existing plants in
good operating condition. A review during appraisal of EPS/EP(S)'s program of
regular maintenance of TPPs indicated that while the program was adequate,
recent shortages of finances have left some very urgent work in arrears and
these generating units are consequently in a state of complete disrepair.
Some of the older units are becoming obsolete and it is necessary to procure
their essential spare parts before they become unavailable. The TPP
rehabilitation component of the project would therefore include:
(a)   purchase of $4.0 million of most urgently needed spare parts for
TPPs in Serbia and tools for expediting maintenance of key TPP
equipment as listed (Annex 5.9). This will keep the air-
quality-control systems in reasonable repair and keep the main
plant equipment operable for some more time; and
(b)   a detailed eight-year action plan for rehabilitation of power
plants in Serbia has been agreed with EPS in January 1991.
Details of this action program are at Annex 5.10. During
negotiations. aareement was reached that EPS will imRlement the
agreed Serbian Power Plant Rehabilitation Action Plan on the
time schedule indicated therein,
G. Project Cost Estimates
5.36   The total project cost, excluding interest during construction, is
eutii'ated at US$989.2 million equivalent. The base cost estimate for both
local and foreign components are in US dollars reflecting end-1990 prices.
The estimates are based on contract prices for equipments ordered and
experiences gained from a similar power plant in Yugoslavia. The foreign
exchange cost (excluding interest during construction) of the project is
estimated at US$398.6 million. Physical contingencies are calculated at 3%
for the foreign costs of plant and mining equipment already contracted, 5% for
the foreign costs of the plant and mining equipment to be procured, 10% for



- 32 -
the foreign costs for erection and civil works, 10% for the local cost of the
plant and mining equipment to be procured, and 10% for site preparation, civil
works and other local costs. This is acceptable. Price escalation is
calculated according to anticipated international price movements of 3.6% p.a.
for 1991 and thereafter. The project cost including base cost, contingencies
and interest during construction is summarized at Table 5.1. The detailed
cost estimate is at Annex 5.11(a). The annual expenditures are at Annex
5.11(b).

I. Procurement
5.40 Goods and services financed under the proposed Bank loan will be
procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank's
Procurement and Consultants Guidelines. The list of procurement packages is
at Annex 5.12. For goods, bids offering domestically manufactured plant,
equipment and other components will receive a preference in bid evaluation of
15 percent of the c.i.f. price or the import duty, whichever is lower.
International shopping (IS) will be restricted to imported specialized
equipment manufactured in a small number of companies, such as laboratory
instruments, measuring and testing apparatus for water treatment and
environmental mon''oring, and spare parts for thermal power plants
rehabilitation program estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract up
to an aggregate amount of $6.0 million. Direct contracting (DC) will be used
for procuring a portion of urgently needed spare parts for thermal plants
rehabilitation which must be procured from the original manufacturer (such as
spare parts for electrostatic precipitator and turbine spare blades) estimated
to cost less than US$200,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$1.5
million (about 38% of the total c,omponent cost - $4 million). Locally
financed goods and services will be procured under prevailing local procedures
which involve competitive bidding and are judged satisfactory. The selection
and employment of consultants for the Technical Assistance programs will be
carried out in accordance with the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. The
procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.3 below.

5.41 All procurement documents pertaining to bidding packages for goods
financed by the Bank and estimated to cost wore than $1.0 million equivalent
will be subject to the Bank's prior review; this covers the procurement of all
eighteen major packages to be financed out of the Bank loan (Annex 5.12), and
represent 96 percent of the Bank loan available after excluding interest
during construction.
J. Disbursement
5.42 The Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of the foreign
expenditures for directly imported equipment quoted on CIF basis; (b) 100% of
local expenditures ex-factory for local manufactured items; (c) 75% of the
cost of other items procured locally; (d) 92% of the total expenditures on the
erection contract; and (e) 100% of the foreign costs of expenditure for civil
works consulting services and training. For expenditures relating to training
and contracts for goods and services valued at less than US$200,000
equivalent, reimbursement will be made on the basis of statements of
expenditures. Supporting documentation for statements of expenditures would
be retained by EPS and made available to the Bank staff for review during
supervision mission. To facilitate disbursements under this project, a
Special Account, with an authorized allocation of US$15 million, will be
established in a bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. EPS
will use these funds to finance the Bank's share of eligible expenditures.
Annex 5.13 presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan as
well as a Bank-wide standard profile for power sector in EMENA Region.  Since
project implementation has already been started (para. 5.32), the
implementation period is expected to be shorter than normal for such projects.
The disbursements therefore are expected to be faster. It is scheduled for
five and a half years instead of the Bankwide profile of seven years. The
Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1996. The loan
closing date is June 30, 1997.
K. Monitorina and ReDortina
5.43 EPS will furnish to the Bank regular half yearly project progress
reports by July 31 and January 31 of each year supplemented by brief reports
to be submitted by April 30 and October 31 each year covering technical
progress, financial and other relevant matters. Furthermore, a Project
Completion Report will be submitted by EPS to the Bank no later than six
months after completion of the project. The timely implementation of the
project critically depends on adequate financial resources being made
available when needed. For this reason, an annual financing plan for the
project will be furnished to the Bank no later than the third quarter of the
previous year (para 6.17). The scope and content of the project progress
reports has been discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.

VI. FINANCE
A. Accounting and Auditing Framework
6.01    Due to the specific characteristics (e.g., self-management) of the
Yugoslav system, accounting in Yugoslavia differs significantly from
international norms (para. 4.06). Generally, accounting principles and
practices have aimed more at external reporting for regulatory and statistical
purposes rather than on provision of adequate financial information for
investors and creditors and for decision-making that would be required from
enterprise managements. Consequently, managers and staff are not experienced
and adequately trained in accounting and financial management. Both internal
and external auditing have been restricted to compliance audits for statutory
and tax purposes which is more of a verification process. Financial and
management audits by independent external auditors of the type found in most
Western economies were not mandatory and have been carried out only in
specific cases, e.g., where required by foreign investors (including under
Bank loans). External verification of compliance with regulatory requirements
is compulsory and is carried out only by the Social Accountancy Service (SDK)
which reports directly to the federal and RAP Assemblies.
6.02    The Government has recognized that achievement of international
standards in accounting and auditing legislation, institutions and practices
are vital for meeting the objectives of its economic reform efforts. Starting
with amendments since 1986, and more recently through a new Accounting Law
introduced in January 1989, considerable progress has been made in moving
towards internationally accepted principles. Specifically, significant
forward steps have been made by requiring accounting at the level of
enterprises rather than of basic organizations, mandatory consolidation of
accounts of composite enterprises, and the introduction of important
internationally accepted principles such as the matching of revenues and costs
on an accrual basis. The 1989 Law also provides for mandatory auditing by SDK
of all medium and large-sized enterprises. SDK has been accepted in the past
as independent auditor for Bank power projects. It is noted that in the power
sector there is a general compliance with the audit requirements. The
Government's economic reform package includes steps to further strengthen the
accounting law and to enhance domestic auditing capabilities, including
enabling foreign audit firms to establish offices in Yugoslavia.
6.03    As a result of the organizational changes pursuant to the changes in
federal- and republican-level enterprise-related legislation referred to
earlier, the power enterprises in the republics have undergone major
reorganizations. The groupings and hierarchial structures of the production,
service and purely administrative entities in the sector changed drastically.
One of the effects of the changes is that the enterprise activity profiles
were altered, destroying the possibility of comparing historically, physical,
institutional or financial performance. In addition, given the frequent and
significant changes that have occurred in the accounting legislation since
1986, it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct historical statements
for any power enterprise in a meaningful way on comparable basis. Even if
this could be achieved, the usefulness of such information for analyzing
current and future performances would be substantially mitigated by the high
and rapid inflation in the late 1980s that culminated in the hyperinflationary



- 38 -
situation in 1989 (over 2,000%). Even ignoring the different organizational
basLe, the 1989 and subsequent accounts are essentLally non-comparable wLth
those of earlier years.
B. Electricity PrcinoL and Sharinq of Revenues
6.04    Under the Electricity Act of serbia of 1989, EPS has been given the
responsiblilty of coordLnating the preparation of electricity tariff proposals
for approval by the RAP Assembly. The tariff proposals are prepared by a
Joint Tariff Committee consisting of representatives of EPS, EP(S), EP(K) and
the Distribution CompanLes in Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo. In preparing the
tariff proposals, the Commlttee generally follows guidelines established under
the voluntary framework agreement jointly agreed to by the EPs of the
different RAPs under the aegis of JUGEL, although each RAP can establish its
own tariff structure as it determines appropriate.
6.05    The tariff levels are established taking into account the limitations
imposed by the governing federal-level restrictions (under the Common CriterLa
at present, para 2.12), the cost recovery requirements of the power
enterprises including the distribution companies, and government
interventions. The distribution of the resulting revenues from sales to end-
users between the enterprises is established through annual contracts between
EPS and the distribution enterprises, and between EPS and EP(S), EP(K). Under
the current revenue sharing arrangements, the distribution enterprises retain
about 30% of the revenues from sales to end-users and pass on the balance to
BPS. The distribution of revenues between EPS and EP(S), EP(K) is on the
basis of internal agreements. Under these agreements, transfer prices are
determined at the beginning of every year. These are to be paid by EPS to
EP(S) and EP(K) for electricity generated by them during the year as
determined on the basis of a model that optimizes generation taking into
account demand patterns and production costs. The basis and the operational
principle of the model is acceptable. The agreements provide for compensation
to be paid to EP(S) in respect of any imposed reductions in generation due to
involuntary factors (e.g., lower than anticipated demand) and also for
penalties for non-performance by the two generating enterprises for reasons
within their control. Under current revenue sharing arrangements, EPS retains
about 8% of the revenues it obtains from its sales and pays the balance to
EP(S) (80%) and EP(K) (12%). During loan neaotiations agreement was reached
both with EPS and EP(S) that the Bank will be aiven the opportunitv to review
and comment on the revenue sharing agreements each year. startina with the
agreement for 1992. in sufficient time to enable the oower entities to take
into account the Bank's comments.  This will give the Bank an opportunity to
participate (indirectly) in tarlff developments and to ensure appropriate cost
recoveries.
C. FinancLal Performance
6.06    The organizational changes referred to above have been extremely
pronounced both for EPS and EP(S). Therefore, as stated earlier, development
of pre-1989 fLnancLal Lnformation on a comparable basis with that of the
current and projected ones would have virtually no value and relevance for



- 39 -
analyzing future financial performance or to provide direct comparisons.
Nevertheless an overview of the pre-1989 financial situation is presented in
Annex 6.1. It is noted that neither EPS nor EP(S) inherited long-term
financial problems from their predecessors.
6.07    Over the period 1985-1988 the financial performance of the enterprises
progressively deteriorated, as earlier stated, primarily due to low
electricity prices whose adjustments lagged considerably behind rapidly
increasing inflation. In 1989, electricity prices remained at a low level and
due to this and to the difficult macroeconomic situation which resulted in
deteriorating collections from consumers, both EPS and EP(S) had to face very
serious cash shortages. In the first quarter of 1990 the situation further
deteriorated when electricity prices were frozen at December 1989 levels under
the Federal Government's stabilization program and the average collection
rates deteriorated to about 45%. The retail-level electricity prices in
Serbia, on average, were very low, about Din 0.571 per kWh (US¢ 4.8 per kWh),
and the liquidity problems of the power enterprises remained serious.
6.08    In addition to low electricity tariffs and difficult macroeconomic
situation the poor condition of older, smaller size, thermal generating units,
with higher than necessary production costs also adversely effected the
financial situation. Further, EP(S) underground coal mines also posed serious
financial and safety problems. EP(S) management is well aware of the
importance of securing further operational efficiency improvements by reducing
such costs and improving financial performance. In respect of underground
mines, EP(S) management is already taking steps to close two of them and
intends to prepare an action program to progressively phase out the remaining
problem mines (para 3.07).
6.09    As a result of price increases in April, August and December 1990 (see
para 2.14) average retail prices reached about 74% of the CC ceiling level and
average collection rates also improved substantially. The retail tariff
increases, on the basis of the revenue sharing agreements with the
distribution companies, benefited EPS and EP(S); the financial performance for
the year 1990 as a whole and particularly the liquidity improved compared to
the first six months of 1990. For example, in the second half of 1990 the
working ratio of EP(S) was 56% better than in the first six months.
D. Financial Proiections
General
6.10    One of the primary objectives of the project is to increase the power
ge--Ating capacity of Serbia while ensuring the commercial and financial
stability of the power generating and transmission companies. The problems of
the past, when the cost of expansion programs and inflationary or real cost
increases without concurrent tariff adjustments led to increased reliance on
infusion of government funds, must be guarded against in the future. This
will be achieved by assuring for the companies adequate operating margins and
cash generating capabilities, independent from Government assistance.



- 40 -
6.11    In Serbia electricity is generated by EP(S) and EP(K).  EPS, purchases
electricity from EP(S) and EP(K), and transmits i.t over its system to
distribution companies, large users, other republics and to some other
countries. Over 70% of electricity goes to distribution companies who supply
both domestic and large consumers. Based on the supply contracts and revenue
sharing agreements, it is estimated that about 50% of the revenues from end-
users of electricity flows to EP(S). In relation to the proposed project,
only EPS and EP(S) have direct responsibilities. EPS will be responsible for
the implementation of the project on behalf of EP(S), the eventual owner and
operator of the facilities. In line with their project related role, the
financial objectives focus on generation of sufficient funds to ensure
problem-free implementation of the project in the short run, and on continued
financial viability of the enterprises on the longer run.
6.12        Based upon the projected power generation and transmission levels
for the next 7 years, financial forecasts were prepared for EPS and EP(S) in
constant (1990) values. The projections reflect the results of future
operations, including those stemming from the proposed project as well as from
other investment programs, operational action plans, and renewals all aiming
at further efficiency improvements. It is noted that the forecasted financial
situation is markedly better than that of the last few years. The basic
reasons for these are the recent tariff increases and also the basis for the
recent and future tariff adjustments. As it was mentioned earlier (paras 2.12
to 2.16) in establishing electricity prices in Yugoslavia, the Common Criteria
(CC) has a dominant role; CC is based on the prevailing electricity prices in
five foreign countries where the cost structure and levels for electricity
supply, that the prices should reflect, are generally different and higher
than in Serbia. Consequently by moving towards the CC level (para 2.14) the
revenue cost relationship is markedly improving in the Serbian electricity
sector. In order to assess the extent of fund generation and the various
actions that may be needed to ensure commercial and financial stability,
projected revenues were based on the published December 1990 tariffs. Costs,
while varying with the power generating mix, are also based on December 1990
values. The sensitivity of the forecast performance to changes in operation
levels and costs has also been tested (para 6.18). Summary of forecast
assumptions are in Annex 6.2.
EPS
6.13    During the next 7 years, EPS's operating revenues are expected to grow
by some 49% with increasing focus on supplying the distribution companies.
Revenues from distribution companies are expected to increase by some 63%
representing about 82% of the total sales in 1997 compared to 75% in 1990.
Sales to large industrial and commercial customers, although increasing, would
still represent less than 5% of the 1997 sales. Supplies to other republics
and exports to other countries are anticipated to reduce by about 6%
representing about 13% of the 1997 sales. Operating expenses are forecast to
grow at a slightly lower rate than the operating revenues; the largest single
cost item would remain the purchase of electricity (about 93% of the total)
from EP(S) and EP(K). The marked cost increase between 1990 and 1991 (about
28%) is basically due to the higher purchase cost of electricity calculated



- 41 -
according to the revenue sharing arrangements (para 6.05) taking into account
the three tariff increases of 1990.  The subsequent increases are primarily
due to higher volumes of electricity purchased from EP(S) and EP(K) and to a
lesser extent to the declining share of the cheaper hydro generated power.
During the next seven years the company can expect to have net operating
incomes, equal to about 3% of its annual operating revenues with .97 and .95
operating and working ratios respectively. Taking into account non-operating
revenues and expenses, taxes and obligatory contributions, EPS during the next
7 years would regularly have net profits, and as for its liquidity, the
company will generate regularly from its operations, funds equal to about 5-
6% of its total revenues. Details of EPS' projected financial statements are
shown in Annexes 6.3-6.5.
6.14    From point of view of operation the forecast cash generation indicated
in para 6.13 is considered satisfactory. On account of the proposed project
EPS would not need to increase its own cash generation since EP(S) would
provide the necessary (counterpart) funds. As EPS collects the revenues for
electricity sold from distribution companies and other end users and in turn
pays EP(S) for the electricity produced, it is in the position to retain the
funds required for the pcojects execution. To establish their project related
obligations and rights, including those related to funding, a contract
satisfactory to the Bank, has been signed between the two companies.
Nevertheless to ensure the timely availability of funds, to provide a cushion
for any possible delays in fund flow and to ensure continued financial
stability, during negotiation agreement was reached that EPS would take all
steRs necessary to maintain (i) annual ratios cash oRerating costs to
operating revenues not more than .95: and (ii) annual ratios of the sum of
oRerating exRenses (excluding depreciation) taxes. financial expenses and debt
service, in relation to total revenues of no more than .97.  Progress towards
achieving the annual target would monitored on a guarterly basis and if in any
guarter it appears. using a combination of actual and projected data. that
achievement of the annual target would fall short by more than 5%. EPS would
immediately take all necessary remedial actions to ensure achievement of the
annual target. In addition EPS agreed that: (i) the average revenue
collection period for electricity sold will not exceed 60 days in 1992 and
1993. 45 days in 1994 and 30 days thereafter: (ii) for accounts outstanding
more than the stipulated days. EPS shall immediately:  (a) institute the
appropriate legal actions to ensure collection: (b) provide a provision as
doubtful debt in its accounts: and (c) serve notice of disconnection if
payments will not be received within 30 days of the date of such notice: and
(iii) for electricity purchased. to pay the accounts within 60 days in 1992
and 1993. 45 days in 1994 and within 30 days thereafter. The financial
targets are cash generation oriented, rather than rate of return on assets, to
provide more immediate protection, particularly under inflationary conditions,
and to ensure future financial equilibriums. In addition the Republic of
Serbia agreed to contribute as necessary sufficient funds for the project's
implementation in a timely manner should counterpart shortage arise for any
reason.



- 42 
EP (S)
6.15    The operating revenues of EP(S) are expected to grow by some 40%
between 1990-1997. About 80% of the total revenues is expected from sales of
electricity and the rest from selling lignite, coal and heat. Until 1995,
total operating expenses are expected to grow by about 2% less than revenues
but in the following two years, due to the higher depreciation costs they
would increase at a somewhat higher rate (about 3%). The largest single item
expected to remain is the cost related to coal mines (lignite) which would
represent some 40% of the total operating costs in 1997; by 1997 salaries and
wages would grow 29% and would represent 27% of the operating expenses.
Depreciation, mainly due to commissioning of new facilities would grow by more
than 80%, increasing its share of total cost from 25% in 1990 to 31% in 1997.
The operating ratios, between 1990 and 1995 would gradually reduce from .90 to
.89 and then during the next two years again increase to .92. The working
ratios reduce from .52 (in 1990) to .49 by 1997. Annual profits until 1995
would about double; however in 1996 and 1997 profits would reduce due to the
higher operating costs and due to increased financial charges (mainly interest
during construction). The higher operating costs are due to the increasing
production share of the more expensive thermal generation. The 1997 net
profit would be equal to about 4% of the gross revenues (compared to 6% in
1990). Beyond 1997, with the increasing power demand and concurrently
increasing utilization of the power generating facilities, EP(S)'
profitability would improve.
6.16   During the next 7 years EP(S) is expected to generate substantial
funds.   Between 1991 and 1997 the internally generated funds would equal to
about 34% of the operating revenues and EP(S) would regularly generate cash
surpluses. The balance sheet position of the company is also forecasted to be
healthy. The long term borrowings are not expected to present unmanageable
problems; the debt/equity ratio would improve from 37:63 (in 1991) to 20:80 in
1997. Details of EP(S)'s financial statements are shown in Annexes 6.6-6.8.
6.17    The continued financial stability of EP(S) is vital both for the
sector and for the successful implementation of the project. Therefore to
safeguard the company's fund generating capacity as well as to ensure that
future borrowings will not lead to unmanageable debt service obligations,
during loan negotiations agreements were reached that EPNS) will maintain:
{   in each fiscal year starting 1992 internal annual cash surpluses of not
less than 35% Lthree years movina average) of capital expenditures incurred:
and (ii! debt service coverage (internallv generated cash surpluses in
relation to servicina long term borrowina) not lower than 2 in 1992. 2.5 in
1993 and 3 thereafter. In addition. acreement was reached both with EPS and
EPMS) that they will forward to the Bank each year not later than five months
after the end of their financial year their annual financial statements
audited by indeRendent auditors acceotable to the Bank. together with the
auditors reRort on, inter al.a: (a) the financial statements: (b) the
ODeration of all accounts includina the Special Account and Statements of
Expenditure (SOE): and Ic) the eligibility of withdrawals made on the basis of
SOEs for reimbursement by the Bank Grou2: and with EP(S) to forward to the



- 43 -
Bank every year by October 31 thq _annual caRital inyestment oroorams together
with the flnancina plan covering the next five years.
6.18    The major financial risk that could adversely effect (EP(S)'
capability to support the proposed project and maintain its own fLnancial
viability is expected to be macro economic condition related, Should, for
example, tariff adjustments required to maintain revenue levels in real terms
be delayed and/or be insufficient to match inflationary cost increases, EP(S)'
financial strength would erode. For example a 10% increase in cash operating
costs would reduce EP(S)' annual profits by about 70%, with the exception of
1997 when it actually would turn it into losses. To offset such a negative
impact on the financial results, electricity tariffs would have to be
increased by about 6%. Similarly if revenues from electricity sales would be
about 15% lower than forecasted, without commensurate cost reductions, EP(S)
annual profits would turn into annual losses equal to about 7%-9% of the gross
revenues and the company, instead of accumulating cash surpluses would have to
rely on increased borrowing (by about 12%). However it is noted that even in
this case EP(S) would be able to meet both the debt service coverage and the
cash generating covenants.
6.19    The greatest risk is that tariff values would be permitted to erode.
However, the policy framework to maintain tariffs in real terms are in place
and the Government, in 1990, has used it to introduce substantial price
increases, which in fact went beyond the particular conditionality level for
releasing the second tranche of SAL II. The accounting basis for developing
future tariff adjustment programs permitting the power entities to meet their
financial targets (another condition for the tranche release) is only
partially met for the whole country (and the Bank intends to pursue this on a
regular basis with the Government); however in the Republic of Serbia, which
will be served by the project, for all practical purposes this basis has been
developed covering the generating and transmission segments of the sector. In
any case, if due to erosion of tariff values EP(S) would not be able to
generate sufficient counterpart funds for the project, as a special condition
of this loan, the Republic of Serbia would have to inject the needed funds in
a timely manner (para 6.14). Also should the revenue/cost relationship
deteriorate, compliance with the financial targets of EPS and EP(S) would
require tariff and/or cost saving actions, for which the Federal Government's
Guarantee Agreement provides the legal commitment.

VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFXCATIOi
A. Growth Of Demand
7.01 Recent trends and forecasts of the growth of demand for Yugoslavia have
been dealt with in paras 3.20 - 3.22. The demand forecast for Serbia and its
contracted supplies to other Republics/exports was discussed in paras 3.23 -
3.26. These have been used for the Bank's studies reported in the following
paras.
B. Least Cost Expansion Studies
7.02 The Bank carried out a national least-cost power expansion study for the
period 1990-2000 to update and improve the economic analysis in the Kolubara
'B' feasibility report. The following data was used for the Bank study:
(a) operational data on the JUGEL system for the year 1990; (b) the list of
new hydro projects given in the feasibility report ranked on the basis of firm
energy, secondary energy, and dependable capacity added to the system; and
(c) results of hydro outputs from the Valoragua model provided by JUGEL. Gas
for power generation in a combined cycle mode has been considered as aa
alternative in the study starting from 1998 even though the availabi .ty of
gas and the associated costs and timing are uncertain at this stage. Oil fired
units burning imported oil have also been included for comparison purposes.
Wherever it is realistically feasible, thermal plants using low sulphur
imported coal have been considered instead of high cost, high sulphur local
coal. Detailed discussions of the methodology are presented in Annex 7.1.
7.03 The results of the optimization studies made with the WASP program
demonstrates the economic merit and the optimum timing of units 1 and 2 of the
Kolubara 'B' TPP in the national context. Kolubara 'B' would add about 2,000
GWh starting from its commissioning in 1996 and 4000 GWh in 1997. The Bank has
also carried out a least-cost power expansion study for the Serbian system
considering only its firmly contracted supplies to other Republics. This study
also confirmed the priority and timing of the first two units of Kolubara 'B'
TPP. Projected (1990-2000) capacity and energy balances from WASP output for
the JUGEL system are given in Annex 7-2.
C. Risk Analysis
7.04 The main uncertainty, external to the project and associated with the
economlc merit and optimum timing of the Kolubara 'B' units, is the demand
forecast with the probability of lower than anticipated growth rates. To
assess the robustness of the decision to commit resources to build and
commission the units 1 and 2 of the Kolubara 'B' TPP in 1996 and 1997
respectively, a strategic risk tradeoff analysis was therefore carried out
under three demand growth scenarios: (a) base case: no growth between 1989 and
1990; (b) no growth between 1989 and 1991; and (c) no growth between 1989 and
1992. Details of the analysis are given in Annex 7.1. Results of the analysis
confirmed the high energy deficiency of the JUGEL system, and the priority of
the Kolubara 'B' TPP starting from 1996 regardless of the demand scenario
considered.

D. Economic Rate of Return Analysis
7.05 Since the Kolubara 'B' thermal plant forms a key component of EPS
investment program, the economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated both
(a) for the project and (b) for a time slice of EPS investment program.
(a) Economic Rate of Return of the Proiect
7.06 The Kolubara 'B' project includes both the thermal plant and the lignite
mine. The costs include all direct costs of construction of the project, and
those required for its operation and maintenance. Extensions of the
transmission system to connect the power plant to the grid, and reinforcement
of the subtransmisuion and distribution to meet incremental demand for
electricity have been allowed for in the estimates of costs. The benefits,
measured by consumers' willingness to pay and approximated by power revenues,
have been assessed at the distribution level. Revenues are based on a weighted
average price of US 9.03 cents/kWh at distribution level.
7.07 Details of the cost and benefit streams and ERR calculation are provided
in Table 1 of Annex 7.3. The ERR is 14.5%. Sensitivity analysis has been
carried out and is presented in Table 1.
TABLE1
Seitsitivitv Anahysis For Te Proj2t Economic Rate fRtr
Scmiio                         ERR
1.   Base case                      14.5%
2.   10% cost overmn                13.7%
3.  lastallation of FGDs on both units  11.6%
4.   One year delay for both units  12.8%
S.   All the above                  93%
(b) ERR of EPS Investment Program
7.08 The economic rate of return was also calculated for a time slice of
EPS's overall investment program corresponding to the period 1991-98 as it
covers the project implementation and full utilization.
7.09 Power revenues at distribution level at the average price of US 9.03
cents/kWh (para 7.06) were used as a proxy for the benefits. Benefits are
limited to the incremental electricity sales revenues until 1998, and
thereafter kept constant.
7.10 The time slice of EPS investment program is presented in Table 2 of
Annex 7.3. It shows the capital costs needed to meet additional demand over
the period 1991-98 and includes: (a) new hydro/thermal power and open-pit
mines capacities; (b) rehabilitation of existing hydro/thermal power and open-
pit mines facilities; (c) transmission and distribution; and (d) other
investments. Investments in underground mines have been eliminated from this
program because they are uneconomic.



- 46 -
7.11  Non-fuel operatlng and maintenance (06M) costa were taken as percentage
of the cumulative value of the capital investments. Variable O&M costs were
estimated based on the incremental output from new mines and as a percent of
capital costs for investments in thermal plants.
7.12 Benefit and cost streams and ERR calculation are shown in Table 3 of
Annex 7.3. The ERR on EPS investment program is somewhat below the estimated
opportunity cost of capital for Yugoslavia. The lower ERR of the EPS program
can be explained by: (a) a heavy rehabilitation program (about 21% of EPS
investment program) whose full benefits are not captured wlthln the time alice
considered; and (b) the exclusion of intangible benefits related to
investments such as protection of environment, research works and EMS
(representing about 13% of BPS investment program).
7.13 In both calculations, the benefits have been understated, inter alia, by
ignoring consumers' surpluses. The ERRs of the project and EPS investment
program given above are therefore conservative.
E.  Other Benefits
7.14 Other benefits are to: (a) facilitate rehabilitation of aging thermal
power plants in Serbia; (b) introduce systematic air quality monitoring
program and study in the Kolubara area; (c) improve financial management;
(d) prepare an underground-mine restructuring program in Serbia; (e) reduced
sulfur dioxide emissions resulting from eliminating uneconomic underground
mines producing high sulfur coal; and (f) reduced sulfur dioxide and dust
emission resulting from shutdown of smaller, aging and less efficient power
plants.
F. Other Risks
7.15 OneratLonal Risk. The Kolubara 'B' project is a baseload generating
facility. Plant operational reliability is an important consideration in
assessing it. risk. The plant will burn the same quality of lignite as is
presently mined in the area for the Kolubara A and Nicola Tesla A and B
generating units. The beneficiary and operator of the project, EP(S), has
proven expertise in mining and operation of thermal power plants. EPS is the
agency implementing the project and will also be the marketing agency. In view
of EP(S)'s extensive experience in maintaining and successfully operating
similar lignite mines and TPP plants in Serbia, the project is risk free and
will be highly reliable in its operations.
7.16  Environmental Risk.      The proposed project meets the requirements of
prevailing Serbian and Bank environmental guidelines, policies, and procedures
and no major environmental project risks are anticipated. Provisions made in
the project design will also enable the plant to meet even more stringent
emission standards if they are required in the future.



- 47 -
7.17  Local Financing Risk.   In the face of a continuing difficult macro and
micro economic situation, particularly the re-emerging inflation, the
financial situation of the enterprises may be affected by (a) the financial
difficulties of their clients and (b) pressure from the federal/republican
authorities to oppose increases in electricity prices as in the past. Specific
covenants indicated in the financial section have been included to minimize
this risk.



- 48 -
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(A) with the Republic of Serbia,
(i) to take all steps necessary (including provision of funds) to

covering the next five years (para. 6.17).
Recommendation
8.02      With the above assurances, agreement and conditions, the proposed
project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent, to be
repaid over a period of 15 years, including five years of grace at the Bank
standard variable interest rate, to the Elektroprivreda of Serbia, with the
guarantee of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

EXISTING ELECTRIC POWER FACILITIES AND THsIR OPERATIONS
Plant Capacitv
1.    Table 3.3 (1) shows the installed generation capacity owned and operated
by the various power enterprises and the industrial sector during 1989.
2.    All industrial (i.e., self-generation) plants are thermal power plants
run on fuel oil. They accounted for 4.2% of capacity. Many power plants
are jointly owned by more than one enterprise although the plant itself
is located in one of the republics. The Kroko nuclear power plant, jointly
owned by HE and EGS, is located in Slovenia. In 1989, the total installed
capacity owned by power enterprises was 20,594 MW. The total installed
capacity in the country was 21,489 MW.
Power Generation
3.    The total electricity generation from all plants in Yugoslavia in 1989 was
83,054 GWh. Table 3.3 (21 shows the generation of individual systems and
from each type of plant. Energy sales at the transmission level totaled
73,497 GWh and peak demand of the Yugoslav interconnected system was 11,918
KW. The load factor of the Yugoslav system was 70.4%.
4.    Power enterprises in Yugoslavia do not produce electricity from oil and
gas unless it is absolutely necessary.  During 1989, the overall plant
factor!/ of the oil and gas plants was about 25.0% compared to
coal/lignite-fired plants at 56.6%.  Table 3.3 13? shows the hours of
operation and the capacity factors by type of plant for the JUGEL system
in 1989. Thermal power plants consumed about 63.4 million tons of coal
and lignite, 1.1 million tons of oil and 700 million m3 of gas to produce
50,644 GWh.
5.    Yugoslavia also exchanged power with the neighboring countries.  In 1989,
net exports amounted to 1966 GWh respectively. Total imports of 2188 GWh
were as follows: Bulgaria 107 GWh, Czechoslovakia 541 GWh, Greece 59 GWh,
Italy 368 GWh, Hungary 58 GWh, USSR 552 GWh, Austria 40 GWh, Romania 196
GWh, Switzerland 196 GWh, Albania 184 GWh. Total export of 2596 GWh were
as follows: Bulgaria 312 GWh, Greece 57 GWh, Italy 1456 GWh, Hungary 19
GWh, Austria 87 GWh, Romania 35 GWh, Switzerland 630 GWh.
Plant factor = (Energy Produced by the Power Plant in GWh) / (Plant installed Capacity in MW*8.76).

Operational Status of Existing Facilities
Thermal System
6.    Table 3.3 f4) shows the monthly capacity balance for the JUGEL system
during the year 1988.V  In 1988, JUGEL's gross reserve marginy was 72
percent. However, primarily due to unusable hydro capacity, high forced
outages of some thermal generating units and prolonged annual maintenance
periods, the reserve margin dropped to 7.2 percent in October 1988. During
September to November reserve margin averaged 10%.
7.    In 1988, the overall availability of thermal units in the JUGEL system
with sizes less than 400 MW was 70% or higher. This compares with Nicola
Tesla B (two 620 MW units) power plant's 88% availability.
8.    In 1988, a total of 1,253 MW of generating capacity (coal -- 749 KW,
lignite -- 317 MW, and oil and gas -- 187 MW) was over 21 years old with
poor plant performance (total maintenance and forced outages higher than
31%).   These units need investigation for retirement and/or urgent
rehabilitation.
Hydro Schemes
9.    Table 3.3 (5) shows the historical peak hydro capacity utilization during
the period 1984 to 1988. The margin between the total installed generating
capacity and that used during the time of system peaks varied from 1,752
MW in 1986 to 2,305 MW in 1985. This represents 22.4% and 30% of the
installed capacity respectively. This excess is due to low river flows
and high system load factors. It indicates that the system has an excess
of peaking capacity.  During 1988, hydro energy production was 82.2% of
the 40 year average.
Transmission and Distribution
10.   Transmission and distribution facilities as end of year 1989 are shown in
Table 3.3 (6).
a/    Complete information for 1989 is not yet available. It Is expected that the situation in 1989 wouLd
be simitar to that during 1988.
Gross reserve margin a (Installed Capacity - Peak Demand)/(Peak Demand).

Past and Current Organizational Structures
Organizational Structure Prior to January 1990
1.          Prior to January 1990, the composition of the power industries in
Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo was as follows:
(a)   Serbia
2.          The principal organizations in the Serbian power industry were
Zajednica Elektroprivreda Beograd (ZEP); Rudarsko Industrije i Energetiski
Kombinat Kolubara (REIKK); and a number of electricity distribution
organizations.
(i) ZEP. ZEP, a composite enterprise (COAL) formed in 1974, consisted
of about 15 constituent organizations, including hydro, thermal
power plants, lignite/coal mines, a transmission organization, and
supporting institutes. ZEP was a Borrower under previous Bank
loans for the Second and Third Power Transmission projects.
(ii) REIKK. REIKK, a composite enterprise, was formed in 1974, and
included lignite mines, a lignite drying and processing plant, a
thermal power plant (Kolubara A), and various other organizations
that were largely dependent upon the lignite mines either as
purchasers of equipment and services (e.g., workshops producing
spares) or as providers of raw materials (e.g., mine by-products
used as inputs for construction materials). While most of these
organizations were wholly dependent on the mines to start with, in
some cases, e.g., production of spares, rubber belting and related
products, erection services, etc., they were later expanded to
sell a part of their output outside REIKK. REIKK's lignite mines
and Kolubara A thermal power plant were simultaneously members of
the ZEP composite organization and major investments in them were
part of ZEP's joint investment program that was financed from
mutually pooled funds from ZEP's constituent organizations.
(iii) Distribution Organizations. The distrLbution organizations in
Serbia were not members of either ZEP or REIKK; they existed as
separate organizations.

Page 2 of 2
(b)   Voivodina
3.          The power industry in Vojvodina was represented by a single
composite enterprise, Elektrovojvodina Novi Sad, consisting of three power
generation organizations, one transmission organization and 10 distribution
organizations. Elektrovojvodina Novi Sad was a Borrower under earlier Bank
loans (the Second and Third Power Transmission projects).
(C)   Kosovo
4.          The power industry in Kosovo consisted of a Composite
organization, Elektroprivreda Kosovo, consisting of generation, transmission
organizations and lignite mines. The distribution organizations were not
members of Elektroprivreda Kosovo (a Borrower under previous Bank loans for
the Second and Third Power Transmission projects).
Current Organizational Structure
5.          As a result of organizational changes pursuant to the requirements
of the Federal-level Law on Enterprises (LOE) of January 1989 and the
Electricity Act of Serbia of December 1989, the power sector organizations in
Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo were reorganized as follows:
(i) Elektroprivreda Srbiji (EPS), whose functions were described in
para 4.--, consists of the three former transmission organizations
in Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo as well as parts of the research,
plar.ning and developmental departments of the erstwhile composite
organizations.
(ii) Elektroprivreda (EP(S)), consists of the lignite/coal mines and
the hydro/thermal power generation organizations formerly under
ZEP, REIKK and Elektrovojvodina Novi Sad. It also includes
supporting workshops and other service organizations formerly
under REIKK.
(iii) Elektroprivreda Kosovo (EP(K)) consists of the lignite mines and
power generation plants formerly under the composite power
enterprise in Kosovo.
6.          The distribution organizations in Serbia, Vojvodina and Kosovo are
now organized as separate organizations.

Draft Terms of Reference for Accounting and
Financial Management Information Systems Study
Obiective.
1.    As a result of the new laws on enterprises and accounting regulations
introduced in 1989, Yugoslav enterprises will have to carry out changes in
their organization. This will result also in changes in the organization and
content of the accounting and financial functions. EPS and EP(S) therefore
wish to commission a study with the objective of identifying the actions to be
taken to carry out the appropriate changes in the organization of its
accounting and financial management functions and to improve the accounting
and financial management information systems.
Sco2e of Work
2.    The study should cover the EPS and EP(S) organization.  It should cover,
in particular, the following areas:
(i) general and cost accounting;
(ii) project cost estimation, monitoring and control;
(iii) annual capital and operating budget preparation;
(iv) budget monitoring, control, and analysis of variances between
actual and planned performance;
(v) cost/profit center performance monitoring;
(vi) short-term (up to 1 year) and medium-term (up to 3 years)
financial planning and management including preparation of
detailed revenue and expenditure forecasts, cash flow forecasts
(monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual);
(vii) medium and long term receivables and payables management;
(viii) working capital management; and
(lx) internal audit and control.
3.    The study is expected to include 3 phases consisting of diagnostice,

7.    The consultants will be expected to submit to EPS and EP(S) a work plan
for the study which should be reviewed with the Bank prior to commencement of
the substantive work on Phase I. The consultants will be expected to provide
periodic oral and written reports of the progress of the work. A draft report
will be submitted at the end of Phase I. During Phase II, an interim report
will be provided in mid-Phase and a draft report at the end. Translations in
English of all these reports will be sent to the World Bank for its review and
comments. A final report will be prepared at the end of Phase II taking into
account the comments of the World Bank. During the preparation of the study,
brief monthly reports will also be sent to the Bank to report progress.

B. KOLUBARA "B" TPP
The Kolubara B project site is located adjacent to the Tamnava West
lignite mine site which will supply lignite to the plant (Map IBRD 21858).
The mine already supplies coal to Kolubara A plant located at the mine and to
Nikola Tesla A and B plants located about 30 kilometers away on the Bank of
the Sava River. The plant will transmit energy into the Serbian 400 KV
transmission network. The plant initially will comprise 2 x 350 MW units, the
first of which is scheduled for commercial service in December 1995 and the
second, one year later. The layout provides for expansion with two 350 MW
units.
The 350 MW turbines will be furnished by Asea Brown Boveri and are to be
tandem compound, reheat units with seven feedwater heater stages. The turbine
is designed to accommodate, at a later stage, three heater extraction steam
load, to furnish heat to hot water heat exchangers for the Belgrade heating
district. A decision for the installation of this heating system has not yet
been taken.
The steam turbines are designed for a 279.4 kg/sec steam flow at a 175
Bar pressure at 535 C steam temperature. The reheat section is designed for
257.7 kg/sec flow at 39.9 Bar pressure and 535 C. The generator is rated at
441,000 kVA with 0.85 power factor. The unit will generate 350,010 MW at
rated output. When in the district heating mode, the generator will produce
271,067 MW and the thermal load will be 338 MWt. The circulating water-
condenser heat rejection system is by means of two unitized natural draft
cooling towers; however, after bids, a single tower for two units may be
selected.
The boilers are Combustion Engineering Canada units rated at 292 kg/sec
continuous output at a superheater outlet pressure of 180 Bars and 540 C steam
temperature. The reheater output is 269.0 kg/sec at 40 Bar pressure and 540 C
temperature. The coal milling system is made up of eight fan type
pulverizers, six of which will be required to carry full load with the
guarantee coal. The 250 meter stack is to be a two unit installation. The
electrofilters are rated at 99.93% and will be furnished by Min/Lurgi.
The salient features of the plant are as follows:
Fuel: Lignite coal will be conveyed by belt conveyor to the plant. It
is estimated that 6,000,000 tons of fuel will be consumed annually by
the first two units. The design or guarantee coal as a lower heating
value of 6,700 kj/kg, a moisture content of 47.8% and an ash content of
19.0%. The sulfur content is in the range of 0.5% The boiler is
designed to function at full rating with coal with heating values as low
as 5,443 kJ/kg.

Annex 5.1
Page 4 of 4
TransRort of Coal: Since the coal mine is adjacent to the plant, the
transport of the fuel is to be by conveyor belt. The system is capable
of delivering 6.5 million tons of coal per year for the first two units.
The conveyors can transport at a rate of 2,500 tons per hour.
Cooling System: The cooling system consists of double flow steam
condenser with a heating surface of 1,400 i2. The natural draft cooling
towers will cool 6,200 m3/hr. of water at a 12 C cooling range.
Ash Disposal: Flyash and bottom ash (slag), will be hydraulically
conveyed to an indoor ash pool in the excavator station. A hydzomix
slurry of flyash, slag and water will be pumped from the pool to the
Tamnava East mine pit where it will be stored in specially designed ash
pits which will minimize the damage to the environment. The ash
productio,. is estimated at 115 tons per hour.
Instruments and Control: The instrumentation system for measurement,
regulation and control is to be an MOD 300 unit consisting of two unit
control and one plant monitoring (data acquisition) system. The systems
can be programmed, centralized spatially, and decentralized
functionally.
The plant control management and supervision are carried out from a
central and from the unit control rooms. The main power equipment and
the auxiliary systems control hierarchy have been designed to enable the
operator to select lower level of control thereby securing process
control in event of faults of sensors on key components and equipment.
Environmental Systems: The electrostatic precipitator (ESP), efficiency
selected for the first two units is to remove 99.93% of the ash entering
the ESP.  The expected particulate content in the stack discharge is 50
mg/Nme. This can be compared to the World Bank standard of 100 mg/Nm3.
As mentioned earlier, the requirement for SO2 scrubbers can be added, if
necessary, at a later date.

YUGOSLAVIA
KOLUBARA "B" THERMAL POWER AND LIGNITE MINE PROJECT
Terms-of-reference
for the preRaration of a
Long-Term Mining DeveloRment Plan for the Kolubara Area
A. Backaround
1.        The Kolubara group of mines presently produces 32
million tons per year from 3 open pits: 3 million tons from Polje
B, 16 million tons from Polje D and 13 million tons from Tamnava
East. The present production is utilized as follows: 26 million
tons are supplied to the Nikolai Tesla power plant at Obrenovac,
and 6 million tons are consumed on-site (Kolubara A power plant,
lignite drying and heating plants) and sold to the public. A new
power plant, Kolubara B, together with a new open pit, Tamnava
West (production capacity 7 million tons per year), is now being
developed. Commissioning is scheduled for 1995. There are plans
for a possible future duplication of the capacity of Kolubara B
in a second phase. Lignite production capacity is expected to
increase to 39 million tons per year without Kolubara B Phase 2,
and to 46 million tons per year with Kolubara B Phase 2.
2.        At present production rates, the lignite reserves in
the existing open pits will last as follows: 8 years in Polje B,
10 years in Tamnava East, and 19 years in Polje D. There will be
the following new mining fields available for replacing existing
mines and providing additional production capacity: (i) Polje C ,
which will replace Polje B; (ii) Tamnava West, which will provide
capacity for Kolubara B Phase 1 and replace Tamnava East; and
(iii) Polje E and Radjevo, which will replace Polje D and provide
capacity for Kolubara B Phase 2. No decision has yet been made
about scope and sequencing of mining in Polje E and Radjevo.
While the northern part of Radjevo has the most favorable
geological conditions, Polje E in total has probably more
favorable conditions than Radjevo in total.
3.        Given the uncertainty about size and sequencing of
future mining operations, EPS wishes to appoint the Belgrade
Mining Institute, in cooperation with the Belgrade Institute for
Architecture and Urban Developme..t, to prepare a long-term mining
development plan for the Kolubara area in two variants: (a)
Kolubara B Phase 2 will not be implemented; and (b) this Phase
will be implemented.

B. objectives
4.        The objectives of the assignment are to define the
future design and sequencing of mining operations, the
requirements for resettlement, the impact on environment, and the
development of operating cost of the two scenarios, with and
without Kolubara B Phase 2. This will set the framework for
Kolubara's short- and medium-term planning of mine operations and
provide at the same time an input for EPS's decision-making with
regard to the next power plant and mine expansion.
C. ScoRe of Services
5.        The time frame to be studied is limited to the next 25
years, i.e. to the end of the year 2015. This period covers the
replacement of all existing Kolubara mines and the startup and
full production of Phase 2 of Rolubara B.
6.        ihe Development Plan should be prepared in two
variants:
Plan A.   In this case, no Phase 2 of the Kolubara B project
is assumed. In the Tamnava West mine, 7 million
tons per year will be extracted from 1996 until
2001. At that time, the equipment from the
Tamnava East mine will be transferred to Tamnava
West, thus increasing the mine's capacity to 20
million tons per year. Polje B will be replaced
by Polje C. Polje D will be replaced by either
Polje E or Radjevo. The consultant is requested
to propose the more favorable option.
Plan B.   In this case, the Phase 2 of the Kolubara B
project is assumed to go into production 7 years
after Phase 1, i.e. in the year 2002, or one yeir
after replacement of Tamnava East. In comparison
to Plan A, an additional production capacity of 7
million tons per year will have to be provided in
either Pclje D or Radjevo, depending on the
optimal solution for the later following
replacement of Polje D. The consultant is
requested to propose the optimal solution for
replacing Polje D and providing the capacity for
Kolubara B Phase 2.
7.        For both variants, Plan A and Plan B, the following
tasks should be performed:
(.)  The advancement of all Kolubara mines should be
calculated and illustrated. In time intervals of 5



- 77 -
Annex 5.2
Page 3 of 4
years, starting 1995 and ending 2015, the position of
the excavators, conveyor routes and waste stackers
should be shown. Existing equipment should continue to
be used as far as possible.  If major replacements or
modifications are required, these should be clearly
defined, and their cost estimated. The configuration
of mine dumps should be carefully planned, based on a
concept for optimum future use of recultivated land.
(b) The resettlement requirements should be determined for
each 5-year interval. The number of households and the
number of persons affected should be determined. The
needs for reconstruction of roads, railway lines, water
courses, power and telephone lines, and townships
should be identified, and environmentally acceptable
concepts should be developed for this work.
(c) A concept for optimum future use of recultivated land
should be developed for each mine, to guide future
operations. To prepare this concept, discussions
should be held with the local population,
municipalities and Serbian and Yugoslav authorities and
institutions involved. Experience and current practice
of foreign lignite mines should also be taken into
account. Based on the proposed concepts, the planned
status of recultivation should be shown in 5-year
intervals.
(d) The development of production cost, in constant 1991
US$, should be calculated in 5-year intervals for each
mine separately as we'.l as for all Kolubara mines in
total. The calculations should be based on Kolubara's
actual costs, the expected changes in geological
conditions and trarnsport distance changes (more
equipment may have to be added as overburden to lignite
ratios increase and coal seams are splitting up), and
on environmental requirements.
D. InRuts
8.        The following data and studies exist and will be made
available and utilized for the preparation of the Development
Plan: historic and actual performance and cost data on Kolubara
mines, results of exploration drilling (geological cross
sections), pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for individual
Kolubara mines. To help developing recultivation concepts, a few
Yugoslav experts will visit foreign lignite operations to
investigate their recultivation practices.

9.        After an initial period of about 6 months, during which
the consultant will evaluate all available data and analyze
advantages and disadvantages of sub-variants of his choice, a
decision will be made, jointly with EPS, on the two variants
(Plan A and Plan B) to be retained for detailed study.
10.       A report should be presented at the completion of the
assignment. Attached to the report should be a set of
geographical maps, showing in 5-year intervals and separately for
Plan A and Plan B the status of mines and dumps and environmental
information, such as recultivated areas and reconstruction of
roads and houses. The report should also contain in tabular form
the development of production costs for individual mines and the
total of all mines in 5-year intervals.
F. Timing
11.       The following approximate time schedule for the
execution of the assignment is expected:
Start of work:                 April 15, 1991
Completion of work:            December 31, 1992
G. Estimated Manmonths
12.       It is preliminarily estimated that about 80 manmonths
are required to complete the assignment.

KOLUBARA "B" THERMAL POWER AND LIGNITE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Long Term Air Quality monitoring and study
1.          Background:  Rich  lignite deposits  in Serbia have resulted  in
development of substantial power generation capability within a reasonably
defined area, not too distant from Belgrade. Currently, mines in the Kolubara
area provide 29 million tons of fuel annually to local power stations with
capacity in excess of 3000 MW. The proposed project will further expand both
lignite mining and power capacity by 7 million tons per year and 700 MW
respectively.   Plans for additional fuel and power development are under
consideration.
2.          The very low sulfur levels in the fuel (generally less than 0.5
percent), good regional ventilation characteristics and maintenance of power
station dust collection equipment, yield relatively low emission levels (sulfur
dioxide, dust, and nitrogen oxides) from existing facilities and indications are
that air quality is, in general, in compliance with both local and
internationally recognized standards (Serbian, World Bank, WHO, and United
States).
3.          Nonetheless, the existing air quality monitoring network has several
limitations:
(a)   Up-to-date monitoring capability is only available at two or
three sites and again, only for sulfur dioxide--remaining
monitoring stations are antiquated and inaccurate, providing
positively biased results of limited value.
(b)   There are no capabilities for monitoring suspended dust and
nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, source monitoring is conducted
on such a limited basis (once per year) as to yield nothing
more than isolated estimates of power station environmental
performance.
4.          Study Obiectives: The situation described identifies need for a study
to meet the following objectives:
(a)   Fully characterize existing air quality patterns in the area
of interest and define those emission sources primarily
responsible for these patterns.
(b)   Develop appropriate decision making tools to analyze how future
energy development schemes for the region best be implemented
in a manner that assures cost-effective compliance with all
reasonable measures of air quality.

Annex 5.5
Page 2 of 12
(C)   Create an environmental management system that will assure
activities operate in such a fashion that acceptable levels
of air quality are maintained.
5.          It is envisioned that a program to meet these objectives would
consist of the following tasks:
(a)   Define and Establish Management System
(b)   Design Monitoring Program
(C)   Implement Monitoring Program
(d)   Data Analysis, Model Development and Verification
(e)   Maintenance of Air Quality Management Program
6.          A more complete description of key elements to be included in each
of these tasks is presented below.

TASK I. Define and Establish Mangaement System
Subobiective:
7.          Identify  specific  organizational  responsibilities  for  task
implementation, coordination, and reporting to Serbian and Federal Ministries
of Environment and the World Bank.
Description:
8.          A management system is to be presented for World Bank review and
comment by negotiations. The system will specify organizational responsibilities
for all tasks involved. Key personnel and associated numbers of staff should
also be specified. As a minimum, the system should address responsibilities for
the following tasks:
(a)   Coordination and liaising with World Bank, Serbian and Federal
Ministries of Environment.
(b)   Development of monitoring program.
(C)   Select, purchase, install, operate and maintain all monitoring
equipment.
(d)   Data collection.
(e)   Data analysis, model development/testing/verification
(f)   Maintenance of regional air quality management program.
9.          Each organizational subunit will prepare regular progress reports,
and an overall summary report (incorporating individual subunit progress reports)
would be incorporated by EPS as part of their regular half yearly project
progress report submitted to the World Bank by July 31 and January 31 of each
year.

Task II. Design of Monitoring Proaram
$ubobie2tiyes
10.         Establish a data collection network and monitoring scheme that will
readily characterize air quality, chief emission sources, and local
meteorological patterns.
Descriltion:
11.         A monitoring program is to be prepared that will include air quality,
source missions and appropriate meteorological measurements.
12.         Air quality and emission parameters to be monitored (eg. SO2, dust,
NOx) as well as specific monitoring procedures (batch or continuous sampling),
or specific chemical methodologies, will, as a minimum, be in accordance with
existing Serbian and federal laws, as well as any likely monitoring requirements
to be imposed in the near future.
13.         To the extent regulations do not specify parameters, or sampling and
analytic procedures, the monitoring program will include the following:
(a)   Air Quality: A network will include at least four points at
each major source, including Kolubara "B"--two points downwind
in each major seasonal wind direction (the distance being
determined by dispersion calculations as the point of maximum
ground level concentration and two points normal to those
directions. At ash disposal sites and at several locations
near the mine, monitoring stations should also be located.
Stations should be ir"luded at "sensitive receptors" deemed
critical, eg. hospitals, schools, major population centers,
sensitive ecological or agricultural areas. Other locations
might also be justified.
i)    At the power stations and sensitive receptors, parameters
to be monitored will include at least: sulfur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO,) and total suspended
particulates (TSP).
ii)   At ash sites and mine sites, only TSP will be monitored.
iii)  A mobile van fully equipped for extended air quality
monitoring will also be included to perform special
measurements or respond to local complaints.
iv)  Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are to be monitored
and recorded continuously. TSP will be based upon 24-
hour samples.

Annex 5.5
Page 5 of 12
(b)   Emission  (Source) :4onitorina: Unless otherwise specified,
stack sampling will be conducted at least quarterly' for sulfvr
dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust at all stacks. A mobile van
is to be included in the program for this purpose. Kolubara
"B" will be continuously monitored at the stack, as indicated
in design  specifications.    The  cost  of  the  continuous
monitoring system is not included in this program.
In addition to actual source ronitoring, estimates of daily
average emissions are also to k' made and recorded, based upon
fuel composition, plant load an%. boiler-firing characteristics.
(c)   Meteorological Monitoring: A meteorological monitoring station
will be erected to collect wind speed and direction and any
additional parameters required with appropriate resolution and
intervals so as to be directly compatible with any modelling
requirements anticipated (see Task IV). All parameters will
be automatically recorded and printed. Recording will be on
proper format so as to be used directly in any modelling
effort.
Key factors to be considered will includet
°     determination of station location
e     specification of measurement equipment with major
requirements for price, supply, etc.
*     determination of outlet  signals  and relevant
parameters
It is anticipated that an international consultant will be
required to assist in monitoring network design, equipment and
peripheral  specifications  for  fixed  and mobile  sampling
(ambient, source, and meteorological and assure data
compatibility with modelling input requirements.
(d)   Schedule: Three months (completed: June 30, 1992).
(e)   Resources: Four technical staff, full time;
Consultant 1.5 man-months.
Additional measurements are to be made when there is a significant change
in fuel composition, or subsequent to completion of a major maintenance
program.

TASK IV. Data Analysis. Model Develovment and Verification
Subobiective:
17.         Utilize data collected to select and verify appropriate air quality
model(s) for the region describing spatial and temporal changes to air quality
in terms of existing emission sources and the full range of meteorological
circulation patterns.
Description:
18.         Based upon the nature of meteorological patterns, characteristics
of the source emissions and air quality, existing candidate atmospheric diffusion
models will be selected for further evaluation.   Models will be tested to
identify the one(s) which best predicts measured air quality levels for all
pollutants over all ranges of meteorolosical conditions. It is possible that
no-one model is fully satisfactory in all circumstances.  Should that be the
case, than the final selection of models will specify conditions under which they
are to be used.
19.         Upon completion of this task, a detailed report describing all
aspects of the work will be prepared.

KLARA "B" THEMAL POWER- PLAN -AND LINT   I POJEC
Seba  Power PlAnt Rehabilittadtion
Action Plan
1991-1998
A. Introduction
1.    EPS has a number of aging thermal generating units which are in active
operation. Many of them are in need of urgent rehabilitation to improve their
operations and extend their service lives as long as practical. Additionally,
the quality of the lignite fuels at some sites have been deteriorating as the
mines are developed into lower quality areas resulting in lower plant
efficiency and availability. Air and water quality control equipment and
systems have also deteriorated at a few sites contributing to an increase in
pollution levels in the vicinity of the thermal stationM. These conditions
must be corrected urgently to ensure economy, efficiency and environmentally
safe operation of Serbian power stations.
2.    EPS has prepared and embarked on an overall system wide rehabilitation
program which covers both their thermal plants and hydroelectric generating
stations. This action plan has been drawn up through a system approach on the
basis of suggestions and terms of reference provided to EPS by the Bank in
1989 (the terms of reference are available in the Project File).
3.    The action plan covers rehabilitation of the generating units, their
auxiliary systems and, in particular, the environmental quality control
systems. The direct result of these actions would be increases in
availability, capacity and efficiency of the generating units. In addition,
there would be life extension benefits, extensions of up to 100,000 hours
beyond the original design life.
4.    Environmental quality control improvements would be achieved through
upgrading the electrostatic precipitators and ash systems performance which
will reduce dust emission. These would improve overall environmental quality
in the vicin'ty of the thermal plants.
5.    EPS's eight year rehabilitation action plan covers five thermal power
stations with a total capacity of 1915 MW generated by 15 units. Two
hydroelectric stations with a total installed capacity of 982 MW from six
units are also included. Two of these units, with a total capacity of 614 MW,
are pumped storage units. Rehabilitation of the hydro generating units will
be financed entirely by EPS.

7.    Total financing required is estimated at $353.9 million over the eight
year period. EPS will provide about 99%, including bilaterally arranged
financing. The balance of about $4 million for urgently needed spare parts,
will be covered by the proposed Bank loan.
C. Proaram Organization
8.    Overall management of the rehabilitation program will be carried out by
EPS who will be responsible for its execution, pro2ram supervision,
management, coordination, and disbursement of funds. EPS will al advise the
Bank periodically on the progress of the program. The plant level program
activities will be managed, planned, coordinated and executed by each
participating plant organization involved in the program.
9.    EPS nas retained the services of the University of Belgrade to assist
them in drawing up the rehabilatation program. Its experts will participate
in the research, testing and inspection program tasks as outlined in Phases I
and II sections of the terms of reference of the rehabilitation referred to in
paragraph A.2 above. The University is already involved in this program.
10.   Energoprojekt - an independent consultant - will assisc in data
collection and analysis and in the physical inspections and the production of
specifications, drawings, schedules, evaluations and material supply lists
required to implement the scheme of rehabilitation evolved.
11.   EPS plant supervisors, engineers and workers will also play a key role
in the program implementation. Their familiarity with existing conditions,



- 104 -
Annex 5.10
Page 3 of 5
operating data, plant history, maintenance requirements and problems, fuel
quality and supply and aoh disposal shortcomings, etc. requires that this
grcup should become deeply involved and committed tc the program.
D. Technical Assistance
12.   EPS, together with Energoprojekt and the experts of the Belgrade
University, would be able to carry out the rehabilitation program. However,
it would be necessary to review their work and final recommendations in some
of the crucial stages. These include, the reports on the condition of the
main equipment and results of inspection and analysis of auxiliary systems and
equipment not supplied by the main equipment suppliers. This review will be
carried out by individual experts whose visits will be arranged to coincide
with the needs of the program. It is expected that a total of about 8 man-
months of work may be involved. An amount of $100,000 has been provided in
the estimate for this special technical assistance.
13.   Reports, conclusions and recommendations would be required for submittal
by Energoprojekt and the Belgrade University to EPS for their consideration
and decisions as to the final rehabilitation work to be carried out for each
unit and common plant facility. This would include replacement programs
required for items which no longer can be maintained due to the inability to
supply spare parts. This is especially serious for instrumentation and
controls which have changed dramatically over the past 25 years.
E. Rehabilitation Program
(i) Thermal Plants
(a) Kolubara A - Units 1. 2. 3 and 4.
14.   The total capacity of this station is 161 MW.  Unit 4 is rated at 65 MW
while the others are rated at 32 MW. The units are to be upgraded to permit
them to supply steam to the local town district heating system and install a
new pipeline to the existing town district heating plant. Additional work
plans include installing turbine blades in the L.P. turbine sections,
repairing L.P. casing crocks in the No. 3 turbine, and upgrading the
electrostatic precipitators, repairing key instrument systems, turbine
controls and the turbine by-pass systems. The action plan calls for this work
to be started in 1991.
(b) Nicola Tesla - Units 1 and 2 - 210 MW each
15.   These units were installed in 1970, designed for 100,000 hours service
life. The action plan calls for a single year (1991) work program.
Rehabilitation work includes installing facilities to permit these units to
extract steam to a district heating system, retubing the selected superheater
and reheater tube sections, upgrading the electrostatic precipitators to a 99%
efficiency level, and improving ash storage pond ecological conditions. The
benefits anticipated are (i) a 1% unit efficiency increase, and (ii) environ-
mental improvement.

This plant has just completed a very comprehensive rehabilitation inspection
program. The station has been derated by about 200 MW - 150 MW at Units 3, 4
and 5.  It also suffers from aerious environmental pollution.  Unit 3 is now
being prepared for rehabilitation. Bilateral funding is being negotiated.
Complete rehabilitation of the plant would cost about $300 million. The
current action plan up to 1998 covers $250.2 million of the most urgent
requirements.
17.   The principal tasks include very major overhaul to the boilers which do
not operate well on the present quality of lignite mined at Kosovo.
Additional work includes the precipitators, mills, ash handling and storage
facilities, main steam line replacement on two of the units, an auxiliary
boiler addition, rewinding of selected generators, a new water treatment plant
and other unit specific rehabilitation tasks.
(d) Kostolac - Unit 2
18.   This non-reheat 100 MW unit was installed in 1967 and has already
operated 150,000 hours, well in excess of its design life of 100,000 hours.
Expected remaining life after rehabilitation would be in the range of 50,000
hours or an equivalent of about eight years service. The unit is derated to
90 MW and cannot absorb load variations due to poor controls and the quality
of boiler equipment. The three year rehabilitation program is planned for
1992-1994. The improvements expected are (i) a 1% increase in unit efficiency
(to 27%), (ii) a 99.8% ash removal rate with a new electrostatic precipitator
installation, and (iii) improved availability. It will also be able to absorb
load variations when required. The program includes major retubing of the
boiler and economizer, new coal and oil burners, upgraded coal mills, new
boiler feed pump rotors, turbine blading, governor and instruments and
controls. The capability of the unit to produce steam for district will be
added and the existing coal, ash and water treating plant systems will be
upgraded.

Page 5 of 5
(e) Morava - Unit 1 - 125 MW
19.   This unit is used for peaking due to the high cost of the anthracite and
brown coal burned in the boiler. The unit is derated by 10 MW and has only
been used half of the time since its commissioning in 1969. The action plan
calls for the work to be performed over a two year period during 1995-96.
Improvements are expected to increase efficiency by 4% with a 15 year life
exteneion.
20.   Rehabilitation work includes evaluation of the condition of the boiler
tubes, and installation of rew coal burners, insulation and refractory.
Turbine work includes IP cylinder casing repairs, HP bypass pipe work, and a
new condenser tube cleaning system installation. The generator exciter is to
be replaced with a static exciter and a new governor and turbine supervisory
controls are to be installed.
(ii) Hydroelectric Plants
Baiina Basta
21.   The original Bajina Basta Station comprised 4 x 92 MW Francis type
turbines installed in 1968. The 2 x 307 MW Francis turbine pumped storage
plant was erected in 1982. Like all hydro plants, the units are expected to
operate for at least 50 years. Repairs and rehabilitation of these two
integrated plants is being implemented under two programs shown above. The
present program, indicated on the second line, shows $5.6 million remaining
expenditures to be spent and the work completed by 1992.
22.   The action plan for this phase of the program includes the installation
of new auxiliary system power cables in both plants, the replacement of the
existing exciters with static exciters on the 92 MW units, new 220 kV circuit
breakers, a new generator stator (domestic), a r-are transformer for each
plant, a telecommunications system, installation, and general civil site and
plant system work (e.g. dam, penstocks, etc.).
23.   The second phase of the rehabilitation program is scheduled for
execution over the years 1991-1995. This work is also to include work in both
these stations and is budgeted for $11.5 million.
24.   The work envisioned for this program includes the supply and
installation of a two plant computer monitoring and control system, the
installation of an electrodynamic unit braking systems to replace the air
braking system on the 92 MW units, and the installation of a new 90 MW turbine
runner on one unit for environmental reasons. The new runner will permit
passing a minimum water flow through the plant to maintain downstream plant
and fish life during low flow operation.

Financial Performance of the Main Predecessor
Enternrises to EPS and EP(S) Ouxing 1985 to 1988
1.          Details of the historical and current composition and
organizational structures of the power industries in Serbia, Vojvodina and
Kosovo were given earlier in Annex 4.1. The historical financial performance
of the main predecessor enterprises to EPS and EP(S), namely Zajednica
Elektroprivreda Beograd (ZEP) and Elektrovojvodina Novi Sad (ENS) during the
period 1985 to 1988 is briefly discussed below. Historical financial
statements (income statements and summarized balance sheets) are given at the
end of this Annex and the main financial indicators are summarized in Tables 1
to 3 attached.
2.          As seen from the summary indicators, the financial performance of
both ZEP and ENS progressively deteriorated over the period as reflected in
rising operating ratios, and declining ratios of net income to revenues. The
rates of return on revalued assets declined steeply in each case. The
liquidity position of both enterprises continued to remain weak in the period
with low and declining current ratios. Self-financing ratios, i.e. the
proportion of investments financed from internally generated funds tends to
overstate performance since actual investments were lower than planned or
would have been warranted if funds were available.
3.          The worsening financial situation of both enterprises was largely
due to the low levels of (retail) electricity prices which continued to be
regulated by the Federal Government. ENS's average prices during the period
were about US cents 4.3 equivalent per kwh or less than half of the
corresponding levels of about US cents 9 equivalent per kwh in other Western
European countries (e.g. Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Greece) with
which Yugoslavia has trade in electricity. Average prices obtained by ZEP
(which consisted of generation and transmission enterprises and did not
include distribution enterprises) were about US cents 2.7 equivalent per kwh,
also much below the corresponding prices in the comparator countries.
4.          The financial situation of the power enterprises was further
exacerbated in 1989 when electricity price adjustments regulated by the
Federal Government continued to lag substantially behind the hyperinflationary
general price increases that occurred that year. In parallel, the financial
situation of most Yugoslav enterprises, the main clients of the power
indus_ry, continued to worsen as a result of the rapidly deteriorating
macroeconomic situation. The combined effect of the low electricity prices as
well as the increasing collection difficulties faced by the power enterprises
was largely responsible for the major losses incurred by the power enterprises
in 1989 for EPS and EP(S) - the successor enterprises to ZEP, ENS and the
other organizations referred to in Annex 4.1 that were formed in 1989 as a
result of the major reorganization of the power industries in Serbia,
Vojvodina and Kosovo).

YUGOSLAVIA
Kolubara "B" Thermal Power and Lignite Mine Prolect
Notes and Assumptions for Financial 9roiectionj
General
1.          As the project is concerned only with the activity of EPS and
EP(S), i.e. with power generation and transmission in Serbia, the historical
and forecast financial statements exclude data referring to the activities of
the distribution companies and that of EP(K) Kosovo. the projections are
based on actual figures for 1989 and for the first six months of 1990. For
t1he second six months of 1990 preliminary data was used. Also the projections
took into account costs based on the power generation mix and assumptions
which were used in the Kolubara "B" Feasibility Study. The projected figures
of EP(S) include forecast cost related to the lignite mining. In addition
some (relatively minor) assumptions were developed during appraisal with the
staff of EP(S). All the projections are in 1990 year end constant dinars.
Notes on specific assumptions are provided below, further details are in the
Project files.
2.          Revenues.   The forecast quantities of electricity generated and
sold are based on the Feasibility Study's projection (about 2-3% annual
increase). The revenues from sales of electricity were determined on the
basis of the revenue sharing agreement for 1990, between the generating,
transmission and distribution companies, taking into account tariff increases
until the end of 1990. It has been estimated that as of end of August 1990
with the tariff increases the retail tariffs reached about 80% of the CC level
and by the end of the year, with an additional 8% tariff increase, this level
went somewhat higher. It is noted however that in January 1991 with the
devaluation of the dinar, the average retail tariff level for Yugoslavia was
equal to some 75% of the CC level. The following short table summarizes the
average tariffs charged by the various power entities in Serbia:
Yearlv Average
1990        1991
CO                             O/KWh
EP(S)                    4.11         5.03
EPS                      4.88        6.21
Distribution C's          na          9.87
CC (approximate)          na        12.3
Revenues from sale of coal, heat, steam and other products, were calculated on
the basis of prices prevailing in November 1990. For the projections, until
1997, the present revenue sharing arrangements (i.e. 12% to EP(K), 80% to
EP(S) and 12% to EPS) were considered to remain the same. The average
collection rate from customers which was very low (about 45%) in the first

Page 2 of 3
quarter of 1990, was forecast to improve slightly over the 1990 fourth quarter
level (about 6 weeks outstanding).
3.          The operating cost projections, basically reflect the current cost
structure, with adjustment to depict the changes in the thermal to hydro power
generation mix. Allowances for the more costly thermal generation permitted
to keep the cost projection on the conservative basis. Operating costs,
variable with the volume of electricity generated and sold were forecasted to
increase concurrent with 'he volumes. Depreciation was calculated on the
basis of existing, (regulatory) rates and applied to assets once those were
commissioned. Taxes an obligatory contributions were forecasted in accordance
to the current legal requirements in Yugoslavia and in the Republic of Serbia.
No new taxes or increase in existing taxes were assumed. The same assumptions
were applied to the obligatory contributions, which for all practical purposes
are appropriation of part of the net profits. Usually these obligatory
contributions represent social benefit oriented larger expenditures such as
workers' dwellings, schools, health core facilities, etc. As the current
costing and the general accounting systems of EP(S) does not permit a
meaningful separation of information according to cost or profit centres, the
operating costs of the mines (i.e. the cost of producing lignite/coal for
power generation) are included in EP(S) various costs. For this reason e.g.
the projected salary figures of EP(S) include the recommendations belonging to
the mining operations. The "other" operating costs, both in the case of EPS
and EP(S) include mostly insurance premiums, transportation and operation-
related miscellaneous expenses. The long term provisions in EPS Balance Sheet
represent reserves earmarked basically for maintenance of the transmission
lines. In the Balance Sheet of EP(S) the other assets basically represent
obligatory loans given to municipal authorities, local cooperatives or to
entities where own employees are operators, owners or beneficiaries. The
loans largely represent financing housing, education, health etc. facilities.
Non-operating costs include past losses from investments and other non-
operating expenses such as profit or loss made on asset sales.
4.          Financial incomes in the projections represent revenues from
short-term investments; their relative importance in the forecast is
diminishing. Interest payments include both short and long-term debt related
interests. In 1996 and 1997 the interest payments forecasted interest for
EP(S) assumes ("accelerated" repayment of) interest during construction.
5.          Investment levels were projected on the basis of the program
reviewed by the Bank and accepted for the next 7 years (see annex 3.5).
In forecasting the values of fixed assets, no allowance was made for
revaluation on techno/commercial basis or for inflation although as part of
the accounting/management improvement technical assistance component of the
project, regular asset revaluation on replacement basis (taking into account
technical considerations of the future life of the assets) would be
introduced. Depreciation is provided for on a straight line basis at rates
based on the currently estimated useful life of the asset and consistently
with the Yugoslav legislations.

ANNEX 6.2
Page 3 of 3
6.          Both long- and short-term borrowing were projected on the basis of
existing contracts and on the basis of the historical "corporate objectives"
of EPS and EP(S), trying to rely as much as possible on internally generated
funds.  The only sizeable new loans that were were considered during the next
seven years will be those related to the project.
7.          Financial Targets.   Considering the inflationary conditions and
changing accounting system (part of the Yugoslav accounting reform) which is
not capable as yet to cope with problems such as constant value accounting or
establishment of appropriate asset values, cash generation oriented financial
targets were considered appropriate for EPS and EP(S). These targets
particularly on the short run would provide reasonable protection to the
enterprises against possible future inflationary pressures or institutional
interventions which may not be based on economic consideration. Also they
would give more incentive for cost reductions and improved efficiencies than
rate-of-return type of targets, again on the short and medium term. It was
considered more prudent, to wait until the new accounting systems are in place
and the reorganization related corporate problems are resolved; after that
proper asset revaluation would provide a reliable basis for rate-of-return
type of financial target calculations. Also, by that time a critical revision
of the tariff structure would be carried out, identifying, inter alia, the
relative weight and the need for, "life line" type of tariffs (which could
distort rate of return calculations); having this information in hand a
meaningful rate-of-return level could be developed and the er.tities
performance could be measured against them.

KOLUBARA 'B' THERMAL POWER AND LIGNITE MINE PROJECT
Least Cost Power ExRansion Studies - Risk Analysis
1.    The Bank's principal assistance strategy in the Yugoslav energy sector,
particularly in regard to the implementation for national least-cost planning
and integrated efficient operations, is in line with the Yugoslav legislation
itself which requires operation of the existing facilities as a unified
system. Past and ongoing bank projects had aimed to fully support this concept
of integrated planning and joint operation of the power system. The Third
Power Transmission Project (EMS, Loan 2338-YUG), in fact, provides the tocls
to implement this strategy. Future lending program will include those projects
which are demonstrably in the national least-cost expansion program.
A. National Least-Cost Power Expansion Study
2.    The Bank carried out a national least-cost expansion svudy for the
period 1990-2000 on the following basis: (1) 1990 data information on the
JUCEL system; (2) a list of hydro projects from EPS's 1989 Kolubara 'B'
feasibility study and their ranking based on a system approach and specific
technical parameters (such as firm and secondary energy, dependable capacity)
which better describe the operation of a HPP within the system; and (3) the
use of hydro output results from Valoragua model as input to WASP program. The
assumptions and results are summarized in the following paras.
3.    Existing System.  The operational details of the existing system are
given in Annex 3.3 which indicates the low reserve margins during September-
November in recent years. System reliability depends on continued operation of
existing generating facilities, unit retirements and timely installation of
new generating facilities. This is needed also to provide reserves to shut-
down TPPs for major rehabilitation requiring 1-2 years. After commissioning of
the second 350 MW unit of TPP Drmno in 1990, only 74 MW capacity consisting of
small hydro schemes will be added to the system during the period 1991 to
1995. During the period 1990 to 1997, about 289 MW of small, inefficient TPPs
are due to be retired. Of this, 195 MW are to be retired during 1991-95. The
incremental national energy demand at the power house end during the period
1990-95 is expected to be about 9,220 GWh, corresponding to about 1,500 MW.
This clearly demonstrates the energy requirement of the system (load factor on
the incremental demand is about 70%).
4.    Expansion Candidates.   Only those candidates that can be realistically
implemented have been included in the expansion plan during the 10-year study
period 1990-2000. Existing and future gas supplies from the USSR, Yugoslavia's
main source, are uncertain because of technical and contractual problems.
However, gas supply from Algeria through the transmediterraneen pipeline to
Italy is presently being considered jointly by Slovenia and Italy. Although

associated costs/timing will be highly uncertain at this stage, it has been
considered as an alternative for power generation starting from 1998. An oil
fired unit burning imported oil has been included for comparison purposes.
Table 1 shows the expansion candidates with their respective capital and fuel
costs.

5.    Basic Assumptions.      In order to guide the WASP in the dynamic
expansion optimization process, criteria such as availability of financing,
technical preparation, procurement stage were used to decide about the
realistic availability of different expansion candidates as shown in Table 1.
Five different hydro conditions and 12 periods per year were assumed for the
simulation. For planning purposes, the reliability criteria used in the study
is the loss-of-load probability (LOLP); future value of LOLP to be met by the
system configuration is set at 1%, equivalent to less than 4 days per year.
The capacity allocated for spinning reserve is mainly hydro and is distributed
as follows: 5X from hydro storage capacity (including pumped storage) and 3Y
from run-of-river capacity; these values reflect the present operation of the
JUGEL system. Uynder these major assumptions/constraints, the simulation /
optimization process minimized an objective function (cost function) which
includes capital costs, salvage value of investment costs, fuel and fuel
inventory costs, non-fuel operating and maintenance costs and costs of energy
not served.
6.   National Least-Cost ExRansion Solution.   The timing of alternative
candidates is presented i-i Table 2.

Kolubara B would add about 2,000 GWh to partially meet the energy shortage
starting from 1996 and 4000 GWh in 1997. Historical (1987-1989) and projected
(1990-2000) capacity and energy balances from WASP output for the JUGEL system
are at Atnexes 7-2 and 7-3. They have been prepared on the basis of Bank
forecasts of demand and capacity additions.
7.    The results of the least-cost program have clearly demonstrated the
economic merit and timing of units 1 and 2 of the Kolubara 'B' TPP in the
national context. The option of installing flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) on
the two units of Kolubara 'B' TPP does not alter their timing as shown in
Table 2. This results from the high energy requirement of the system as
indicated in the energy balance and the urgent need for a baseload plant
starting from 1996. Cost estimates for FGD used in the study were as follows:
(1) US$ 270 per kW (or US$ 189 million total) for capital costs; and (2) US $
450 per ton of S02 removed (or US$ 37 million total per year) for operating
and maintenance costs. At the exception of the two units of Kolubara, any
change in the availability of the other expansion candidates (such as one year
delay for Plomin 2) will affect their relative commissioning.
B. Serbian Least-Cost Power Expansion Study
8.    The Bank also carried out a least-cost power expansion study for the
Serbian system considering only its firmly contracted supplies to other
Republics. This study confirmed the priority and sequence of commissioning of
alternative candidates for Serbia, as shown in Table 2 above.
C. Risk Analysis
9.    The main uncertainty, external to the project and associated with the
economic merit and optimum timing of the Kolubara 'B' units, is the demand
forecast with the probability of lower than anticipated growth rates.
Incorporating such uncertainty in power system planning for Yugoslavia will
assess the robustness of the decision to commit resources to build and
commission the units 1 and 2 of the Kolubara 'B' TPP in 1996 and 1997
respectively.
10.   A strategic risk tradeoff analysis was carried out. The following three
demand growth scenarios have been considered: (a) base case: no growth between
1989 and 1990; (b) no growth between 1989 and 1991; and (c) no growth between



- 127 -
Annex 7.1
Page 4 of 5
1989 and 1992. For each demand scenario, various least-cost power expansion
plans were determined on the basis of the following attributes: (a) one
reliability criteria such as the system's loss-of-load probability (LOLP)
which measures the plan's risk of insufficient generating capacity; and (b)
the plan's cumulative objective function as defined in para 5. These
attributes characterize the value of the plan for possible commissioning of
Kolubara 'B' units in the period 1996 -2000.
11.   Figures 1, 2 and 3 present the tradeoff curve sets. The points on these
curves represent all those plans that satisfy the decision as stated in para
9. The plans correspondit:g to the best risk/cost tradeoff are those at the
limit of the areas of diminishing returns for the attributes. Regardless of
the three demand forecast scenarios considered, the decision as stated in
para 9 is robust and confirms the high energy deficiency of the JUGEL system
and the urgent need for corresponding base-load generating capacity. In other
words, postponing the decision on Kolubara 'B' first stage by one or two years
for gathering information to provide a more solid basis for the demand
forecast will not alter the priority of the Kolubara 'B' project, stage I.
12.   In this analysis, the impact of the inevitable continuous decline in the
availability of aging TPPs with time has not been taken into account. Its
inclusion in the risk analysis will only strengthen the decision on expediting
the commissioning of Kolubara 'B' project.

Important: The WASP model optimizes the electricity generation without constraints on luel supply quantities. This explains the
high plant factors for oil and gas fired units (higher than the actual 22%). This result will Imply either Increased Import
of oil and gas for power generation, or higher electricity Imports, or Increased electrIcIty supply from coal fired units.

(b)   Assuming full operation of the first unit of Kolubara B In 1996 and the second unit in 1997.
Notes:               (1)   Investments In transmission (Tn) are negligible because of the present excess capacity of the 400 kV transmission grid.
Investments In subtransmission:  10.0%  of total capital costs of the TPPs.
(2)   Distribution Investments (Dn):   20.0%  of total capital costs of the TPPs.

Assumptions:
(a) All benefits and costs are on December 1990 prices and expressed In US$ Million.
(b) Assuming full operation of the first unit of Kolubara B In 1996 and the second unit In 1997.
(1) DistributIon investments are estimated as 20% of the cumulative capital costs of new generating capacities.
(2) Annual incremental OM costs are estimated as percent of the cumulative value for capital costs and are as follows:
Fixed VarIable
Hydro   1.0j t    O
TPP     2.5"    0.5°
Mine    7.104   n.a.

Other   1.0%    0.0%
Average variable O&M cost for mine in Serbia was estimated at:  3.44 US$/ton, assuming an average calorific value of
1650 kcal/kg.
(3) The weighted average price at distribution level for Serbia Is used as a measure of consumers' willingness to pay
and is equal to 9.03 cents/KWh.
