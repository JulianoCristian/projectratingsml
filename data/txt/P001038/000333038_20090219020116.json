The project achieved most of its objectives,\n            institutional development has been partially achieved,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was marginally satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, greater\n            attention must be paid to the selection and performance of\n            technical assistance. Second, the hierarchy of project\n            management should include an overseeing body that can review\n            project planning and progress from the viewpoint of\n            regional, administrative, and national interests. Third,\n            careful planning and adequate staffing are necessary before\n            the introduction of a credit system. Fourth, Government must\n            seek ways to reduce the need for imported inputs and should\n            actively encourage research into cropping systems which can\n            bring this about. Fifth, there is still a lot to be learned\n            about farmers' roles in and attitudes towards the\n            production and sale of upland rice seed. Finally, now that\n            there is a more cohesive approach and appreciation of the\n            value of monitoring and evaluation, it is essential for this\n            activity to be well planned and staff trained and provided\n            early in the implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "1993-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
