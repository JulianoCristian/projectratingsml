Production\n            increases would result partly from the development of nearly\n            20,000 acres of presently unused arable land, but to a more\n            significant extent from the adoption by farmers of improved\n            cultural practices of which the use of sprayers and\n            insecticides for pest control are the most important. The\n            necessary techniques would have to be demonstrated to the\n            farmers by the extension services. The project would be\n            complemented by an integrated package of infrastructural\n            improvements (water supply, access roads, markets) and the\n            provision of credit facilities. The purchase of sprayers and\n            insecticides by farmers will be facilitated by a credit\n            scheme, which will be administered by the Farmer Marketing\n            Board (FMB). About one fourth of the proposed credit would\n            be directed towards the financing of extension staff.\n            Specific provision has been made for in-service training of\n            local staff to replace gradually the non-Malawian extension\n            staff needed initially."}, "docdt": "1968-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
