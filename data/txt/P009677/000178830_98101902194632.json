The expansion project\n            would provide capacity for producing an additional 152,000\n            tons per year of nitrogen in the form of urea, now the most\n            popular fertilizer in India and in most other countries. It\n            would also replace the power-intensive electrolysis section\n            of the existing, fully depreciated ammonia plant, thus\n            permitting release of a large amount of hydroelectric power\n            for more economic uses in the area; the manufacture of heavy\n            water would be discontinued but other existing production\n            (CAN) and off-site facilities would be retained. The\n            feedstock for the fertilizer production facilities would be\n            heavy fuel oil, of which in present circumstances India has\n            relatively large quantities, but crude oil could be used as\n            an alternative."}, "docdt": "1973-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
