levels. In addition to increasing rural mobility\n            through rehabilitation and improvement of roads and bridges,\n            the project's objectives are to improve highway\n            maintenance through the establishment of an efficient\n            management system and to assist in developing the road\n            transport and construction industries. The project also aims\n            to assist in establishing a strategy for transport sector\n            development leading to policy action plans and associated\n            investment programs. The project includes: (a)\n            rehabilitation or improvement of about 15 provincial road\n            segments; (b) rehabilitation or replacement of about 32\n            bridges on national roads; (c) improvement of two sections\n            of the Highlands Highway and the first section of the Enga\n            Highway; (d) consulting services for project implementation,\n            for transport policy studies and for preparation of related\n            transport investment programs; and (e) technical assistance\n            in transport planning, highway maintenance, training and\n            improvement of the domestic road construction industry.\n            Funds to enable DME to carry out a survey of hydropower\n            resources are also included in the loan amount."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
