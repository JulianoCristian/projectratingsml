MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR
A PETROLEUM REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to the Republic
of Ghana for SDR 11.7 million (US$15 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval.  The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance
a petroleum refining and distribution project.
2.       Background.  Ghana is well-endowed with energy resources, of which
fuelwood and hydropower are the most important. Net energy consumption in
1985 is estimated at 3.1 million tons oil equivalent, the bulk of which is
fuelwood (70%) followed by petroleum products (22Z), agricultural residues
(5%) and electricity (3%). Per capita petroleum consumption of around 51
kilograms oil equivalent, currently met entirely from imports, is less than
half that of other African countries with similar per capita incomes.
Consumption amounted to 0.9-1.0 million tons per year in 1984 to 1986.
Petroleum imports claimed about 25 percent of the country's total export
earnings in 1984-85, and 12 percent in 1986 after the recent drop in oil
prices.
3.       With IDA assistance (through the Energy Project, Credit 1373-GH
approved in May 1983), the Government revised the petroleum laws to promote
exploration by foreign oil companies with reasonable success. But the
immediate possibilities of reducing the overall cost of petroleum supply are
through more efficient crude oil procurement and improved efficiency of the
refinery and the distribution system. To this end, the crude procurement
function will be transferred from Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC)
to Ghana Italian Petroleum Company (GHAIP) to coordinate procurement and
refining. GHAIP's Tema refinery facilities are currently being rehabilitated
under the IDA-financed Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 1446-CH). After some initial delays these projects are
progressing satisfactorily. Consultant studies carried out under the ongoing
Refinery Project concluded that additional improvements in the operating
efficiency of the refinery could be achieved through energy conservation and
maximization of LPG (liquid petroleum gas) production. In the distribution
and marketing subsector, the main problems are the lack and/or poor condition
of the infrastructure to bring essential fuels (diesel and kerosene) to
outlying areas for the benefit of the farming community.
4.       The Ministry of Fuel and Power (MFP) is in overall charge of the
energy sector. It supervises GNPC which is responsible for petroleum
exploration, development and production; GRAIP for petroleum refining; and
Ghana Oil Company (GOIL) which has a 33% share of petroleum products
distribution and marketing and attempts to ensure supply to less accessible
areas. Subsidiaries of BP, Mobil, and Shell have a 67% share of the
distribution market and operate under the monitoring of MFP. The private oil
marketing companies have access to foreign exchange through the auction system
for their rehabilitation and investment requirements. MFP sets petroleum
products prices which have been revised upwards substantially over the past
three yeers and are currently in line with international levels.



5.       Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
are: (i) to rationalize the investment plan in the petroleum refining and
distribution subsector; (ii) to increase the reliability and reduce the cost
of petroleum products supplies in the country, by improving the operating
efficiency of the refinery and distribution system; (iii) to reduce oil
pollution from Tema refinery operations; (iv) to improve the supply of
agricultural products in the remote areas by bringing diesel and kerosene to
such areas; (v) to counter deforestation with the increased availability of
LPG and kerosene; and (vi) to strengthen the organization, management and
operating practices of CHAIP and GOIL and to ensure that they operate on a
commercial basis.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project comprises:  (i) completion
of the ongoing rehabilitation of GHAIP's Tema Refinery, particularly offsite
facilities, utility systems, LPG handling, product shipping facilities and
improvement of energy efficiency (ii) rehabilitation of GOIL's bulk petroleum
storage depots at Takoradi and Kumasi and its network of retail outlets;
(iii) expansion of the infrastructure and increased availability of LPG
bottles and stoves to market additional LPG that would be made available from
the Tema refinery; (iv) provision of storage tanks and transfer facilities at
Akosombo and Buipe to transport petroleum products on the Volta Lake towards
the northern parts of the country; (vi) provision of oil jetties at Akosombo
and Buipe, petroleum barges and a tug boat; (vii) provision of vehicles to
move LPG and other petroleum products and for the project management;
(viii) provision of facilities for farmers' service reseller outlets; and
(ix) training of GOIL's managerial and operational personnel.
7.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$36.3 million, with
US$28.2 million (78X) in foreign exchange. The European Investment Bank will
provide US$6.5 million equivalent for GHAIP and the Federal Republic of
Cermany through Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau will provide US$8.7 million
equivalent for the Volta Lake petroleum transport system. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and a disbursement sctedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events, and the status of
Bank Group operations in Ghana, are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
A map (IBRD No. 20017) showing existing and proposed petroleum supply and
distribution facilities in Ghana is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (No.
6628-GH dated May 20, 1987), is also attached.
8.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The propcsed project is a result of
long discussions with the Government on the petroleum procurement, refining
and distribution subsector, covering the institutional aspects including the
roles of the state-owned sector entities, investment plans and petroleum
pricing. IDA would help improve the efficiency and commercial orientation of
CHAIP's operations, by restructuring its operating/earning basis away from the
hitherto cost-plus basis and transferring to it the function of bulk
procurement of crude and bulk marketing of products, as well as improve those
of GOIL. IDA would ensure that a management improvement study for GHAIP and
COIL is completed and its recommendations implemented. IDA has agreed with
the Government on the highest priority investment program for the refining and
distribution subsector. IDA and the Government will jointly review annually
the rolling three-year investment program. The proposed project would confirm
the Government's commitment to maintain petroleum prices at or above



- 3 -
international levels. It would also ensure that the pricing structure would
provide appropriate refinery processing margins and distribution margins to
make CHAIP and GOIL more efficient and commercially oriented. Finally, the
proposed project would generate cofinancing from KfW and EIB (para. 7).
9.       The project supports the Government's policy for accelerating
economic development in the regions by bringing much-needed diesel fuel to the
remote areas to facilitate the movement of agricultural products, and by
establishing a new and economical supply route via Volta Lake to northern
regions, which would form the backbone of a transport system that could also
supply petroleum products economically to neighboring countries. Finally, IDA
would help reduce oil pollution from Tema refinery operations to normal
industry standards.
10.      Actions Agreed.  The following key agreements have been reached with
the Government, CHAIP and GOIL:
(a) With the Government that it will: (i) agree on a pricing system for
petroleum products before credit effectiveness, and implement such system by
December 31, 1987; (ii) maintain petroleum products prices at or above
international levels; (iii) make an arrangement satisfactory to IDA for bulk
procurement of crude oil and bulk marketing of petroleum products before
credit effectiveness, and put it into effect by January 1, 1988; (iv) appoint
a Managing Director for GOIL before credit effectiveness; (v) complete a
management improvement study for GHAIP and COIL and agree on a plan of action
for implementing the recommendations by December 31, 1987; and (vi) introduce
GHAIP's new processing margin concept from beginning January 1, 1988.
(b) With GHAIP that it will: (i) prepare a corporate plan for 1988-90 by
December 31, 1987 and conclude a performance agreement with the Government by
June 30, 1988 and implement it thereafter; (ii) review its investment programs
with IDA; and (iii) measure oil content and BOD regularly and maintain them as
per US Environmental Protectior Agency Standard or its equivalent;
(c) With GOIL that it will: (i) prepare a corporate plan for 1988-90 by
December 31, 1987 and conclude a performance agreement with the Government by
June 30, 1988 and implement it thereafter; and (ii) review its investment
programs with IDA.
11.      Justification.  The proposed project would rehabilitate the
facilities of GHAIP and COIL. It would ensure that they operate on a
commercial basis by trensferring to CHAIP the function of crude procurement
and by setting the processing margin at CHAIP in a manner that would encourage
it to operate at maximum efficiency and, at -he same time, ensure that GHAIP
maintains sufficient financial strength to maintain and modernize its
facilities. The proposed project would remedy the present dilapidated
condition of GOIL's supply and distribution facilities which threatens to
disrupt the vital supply of petroleum products to end users, and assure that
future maintenance work would be carried out as part of the company's normal
operation. The proposed project would also establish a new economic petroleum
transport mode via Volta Lake to Ghana's northern regions and potentially to
its neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and northern Togo. Finally,
the proposed project would reduce oil pollution. Economic returns of the
various project components, where benefits are quantifiable, range from 18% to
26%.

12.      Risks.  No major risk is anticipated in the implementation of the
proposed project. However, the project component concerning farmers' reseller
outlets is associated with a certain amount of risk since the potential owners
(farmers' co-operatives, private investors etc.) have to be attracted to
invest in and operate such facilities. This risk is minimized by the support
of regional and local authorities for this project component. Furthermore,
this component would be implemented on a pilot basis under the proposed
project and would only be expanded if the scheme proved to be successful.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
