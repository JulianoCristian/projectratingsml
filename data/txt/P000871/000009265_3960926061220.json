It intends to also open a new route\n            of transport (Volta Lake) of petroleum products to the north\n            and enable the distribution of diesel and kerosene to\n            outlying/remote areas mainly to facilitate movement of\n            agricultural products. The proposed project comprises\n            several components including (a) completion of the ongoing\n            rehabilitation of the Tema Refinery of GHAIP; (b)\n            rehabilitation of GHOIL's bulk petroleum storage depots\n            located at Takoradi and Kumasi; (c) rehabilitation of\n            GOIL's existing network of retail outlets; and (d)\n            expansion of infrastructure. Further to this, the project\n            involves (e) provision of storage tanks and transfer\n            facilities at Akosombo and Buipe; (f) provision of oil\n            jetties; (g) provision of transport vehicles; and (h)\n            provision of facilites for farmers' services reseller\n            outlets.
