Some lessons learned included: it is\n            important to obtain fulfillment of critical project\n            conditionalities for sector policy and development either\n            before Board presentation or at least by the effectiveness\n            date of the credit. Otherwise, there is a greater risk of\n            losing sight of them in the process of supervising project\n            components which are mainly technical in nature. An annual\n            review of corporate investment planning is often necessary\n            to avoid duplication of project investments or additional\n            investments outside agreed upon priorities with the\n            Borrower. In order to avoid major delays in the procurement\n            process, the project implementation unit of a new\n            beneficiary should receive specialized training in\n            procurement practices and demonstrate that it is thoroughly\n            familiar with the Bank's procurement policy. In\n            technical projects with important development and financial\n            policy components, it is important to ensure the staffing of\n            missions with appropriate related skills in addition to\n            technical staff."}, "docdt": "1995-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
