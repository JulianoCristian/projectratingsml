Distribution\n            Project aims to increase the reliability and reduce the cost\n            of supply and distribution of petroleum products throughout\n            the country by further improving the operating efficiency of\n            the Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Company's (GHAIP)\n            refinery and by rehabilitating and improving the Ghana Oil\n            Company's (GHOIL) existing oil distribution and\n            marketing facilities.  It intends to also open a new route\n            of transport (Volta Lake) of petroleum products to the north\n            and enable the distribution of diesel and kerosene to\n            outlying/remote areas mainly to facilitate movement of\n            agricultural products. The proposed project comprises\n            several components including (a) completion of the ongoing\n            rehabilitation of the Tema Refinery of GHAIP; (b)\n            rehabilitation of GHOIL's bulk petroleum storage depots\n            located at Takoradi and Kumasi; (c) rehabilitation of\n            GOIL's existing network of retail outlets; and (d)\n            expansion of infrastructure. Further to this, the project\n            involves (e) provision of storage tanks and transfer\n            facilities at Akosombo and Buipe; (f) provision of oil\n            jetties; (g) provision of transport vehicles; and (h)\n            provision of facilites for farmers' services reseller\n            outlets. Lastly, the project provides (i) project\n            engineering and management assistance, a computer facility\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1987-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
