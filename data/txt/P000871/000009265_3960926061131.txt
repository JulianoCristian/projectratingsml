1/  A dual exchange rate system was established on September 19, 1986 when a
foreign exchange auction was instituted for specified transactions. A t90
rate applied to the first window (cocoa and residual oil exports,
petroleum and essential drugs imports, and central government debt service
contracted before January 1, 1986); the rate on the second window was
established at the weekly auction. The two rates were unified with effect
from February 20, 1987; all transactions are now valued at the rate
emerging in the weekly auction. In the week ending May 8, 1987, the
marginal rate at the auction was ¢159 = US$1.

CHANA
PETROLEUM REFINING AMD DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Ghana
Beneficiaries:        Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Company Ltd. (GHAIP) and
Ghana Oil Company Ltd. (COIL)
Amount:               SDR 11.7 million (US$15 million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard IDA
Onlending Terms:      The Government would onlend the full amount of the
Credit to GRAIP (SDR 1.3 million or US$1.7 million
equivalent) and COIL (SDR 10.4 million or US$13.3
million equivalent) at 1.1 times the prevailing
(currently 7.92X) Bank interest rate for 15 years
including 3 years of grace. GHAIP and COIL would bear
the foreign exchange risk on the Credit.
Colenders:            SIB is expected to provide US$6.5 million equivalent
towards .he financing of GHAIP's Tema refinery
rehabilitation. The Federal Republic of Germany,
through KfW, would provide DM 16 million (US$8.7 million
equivalent) to Vofta Lake Transportation Company (VLTC)
to finance on a parallel basis the waterside facilities
of the Volta Lake petroleum transport system.
Project Description:  The proposed project would increase the reliability and
reduce the cost of supply and distribution of petroleum
products throughout the country by further improving the
operating efficiency of CHAIP's refinery and by rehabi-
litating and improving COIL's existing o4tl distribution
and marketing facilities. It would also open a new
route of transport (Volta Lake) of petroleum products to
the north and enable the distribution of diesel and
keroser.e to outlying/remote areas mainly to facilitate
movemont of agricultural products. The proposed project
comprises the following components:
(a) Completion of the ongoing rehabilitation of the
Tema Refinery of GCAIP (under Credit 1446-GH)
particularly offsite facilities, utility systems,
LPC handling, product shipping facilities and
energy efficiency improvement of the existing
distillation unit, and acquisition of vehicles;



(b) rehabilitation of GOIL's bulk petroleum storage
depots located at Takoradi and Kumasi;
(c) rehabilitation of GOIL's existing network of retail
outlets;
(d) expansion of the infrastructure and increased
availability of LPG bottles and stoves to market
additional LPG that could be made available from
the Tema refinery;
(e) provision of storage tanks and transfer facilities
(i.e. land side facilities) at Akoaombo and Buipe
to transport petroleum products on the Volta Lake
towards the northern parts of the country;
(f) provision of oil jetties at Akosombo and Buipe,
petroleum barges and tug boat (i.e. water side
facilities);
(g) provision of transport vehicles to move LPG and
other petroleum products;
(h) provision of facilities for farmers' service
reseller outlets to make essential petroleum
products (mainly kerosene and diesel) available to
the farmers in remote areas; and
(i) project engineering and management assistance for
CHAIP and COIL, computer facility for COIL and
training of GOIL's managerial and operational
personnel.
Project Benefits
and Risks:     The main benefits of the proposed project would be:
increased reliability and reduction of cost in the
supply and distribution of petroleum products throughout
the country; increased access to petroleum products in
the northern regions and the outlying/remote areas to
support their economic development; slowing down
deforestation with f rther distribution of LPG readily
available from the Tema refinery; restructuring the
operating and earning basis of CRAIP and strengthening
the commercially-oriented operations of CHAIP and COIL;
and further reducing oil pollution from Tema refinery
operations to normal industry standards. There are no
unusual risks associated with the proposed project.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Bank Group involvement in the petroleum sector in Ghana began with
IDA credits of SDR 10.2 million in May 1983 for the Energy Project (Credit
1373-GH) and of SDR 6.6 million in March 1984 for the Petroleum Refinery
Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1446-GE). Through
these operations, IDA focussed and assisted in strengthening the capabilities
and operations of the sectoral institutions, including the newly created
National Energy Board (NEB) responsible for energy policy formulation and
planning; addressed the key policy issues of energy pricing and investment
programing; and accelerated the exploration and development of indigenous
hydrocarbon resources, through the revision of petroleum laws and acquisition
of seismic data and basin studies for promotion to foreign oil comapnies.
1.02     The Government of Ghana has requested IDA assistance to finance a
project that would reduce the cost and increase the reliability of supply and
distribution of petroleum products in the country. The proposed project is an
outgrowth of studies by the French consultants, BEICIP, financed under the
ongoing Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project. It is a
result of long discussions with the Government on the petroleum sector and is
part of the Government's "core" capital investment program reviewed and
supported by the various Bank's Public Expenditures Reviews and the Energy
Assessment Mission in November 1985.
1.03     The proposed project has served as an important vehicle for
continuous dialogues with the Government on a number of important policy
issues, namely the rationalization of the investment program in public and/or
private petroleum refining and distribution, the roles of the state-owned
sectoral entities and of private sector investment in the marketing
subsector. With regard to the investment prograam, the Government, through
discussions with IDA, agreed to postpone a major investment for a refinery
secondary conversion project (US$85-130 million) in view of the uncertainties
in the crude and finished product prices in the international market and the
need to Teduce the public sector investment program. With respect to the
state-owned sectoral entities including the Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Company
Ltd. (CHAIP) and the Ghana Oil Company Ltd. (COIL) responsible respectively
for the refinery and distribution operations, it was agreed that they would
operate strictly on a commercial basis, and be as efficient as private sector
organizations. On the issue of inducing investments by the private oil
companies operating in Ghana, which together market nearly two-thirds of
petroleum products in the country, the Government recognized that, to remove
present impediments to such investments, all companies in the sector would
have to be allowed to repatriate dividends, In view of the complexities of
this issue as well as foreign exchange constraints, a resolut:ion would take a
long time to emerge. However, prior to the commencement of the foreign
exchange auction in September 1986, the Government had decided, on IDA's
suggestions, to release certain amount of foreign exchange through normal
budgetary appropriation to the private oil companies for spare parts and
materials to rehabilitate their distribution facilities particularly in
outlying areas. Currently foreign exchange for purchasing essential spare
parts and materials is released through the auction system. This arrangement
would achieve the objective of rehabilitating the distribution sector as a
whole, with the private oil companies maintaining their shares of the market.



- 2 -
1.04     The proposed project consists mainly of:  (i) completing the ongoing
rehabilitation of the Tema refinery of GRAIP and improving the efficiency of
its operations through increased energy conservation and production of
liquified petroleum gas (LPG); (ii rehabilitating the oil depots at Kumasi
and Takoradi and the network of retail outlets of COIL; (iii) establishing a
new and economic mode for bulk transport of petroleum products -- via Volta
Lake -- to northern regions; (iv) supporting a pilot scheme for bringing
diesel and kerosene to the remote areas essentially aimed at improving the
movement of agricultural productsl and (v) providing operational and
managerial training to COIL personnel. The Volta Lake petroleum transport,
which would be cofinanced by the Federal Republic of Germany through
Kreditanstalt fiur Wiederaufbau (Kf), would be the backbone of a transport
system that in the future could also reduce the cost cf supplying petroleum
products to neighboring countries such as Burkina Paso and northern Togo.
1.05      The total project cost exclusive of interest auring construction is
estimated at US$36.3 million equivalent including US$28.2 million in foreign
exchange. The proposed IDA credit of US$15 million equivalent would finance
53 percent of the foreign exchange requirement or 41 percent of the total
project cost. The balance of the project cost would be provided by the
European Investment Bank (RIB) (US$6.5 million equivalent or 18 percent), KfW
(US$8.7 million equivalent or 24 percent), COIL (US$5.0 million equivalent or
14 percent) and the Volta Lake Transportation Conpany Ltd. (VLTC) and its
parent company Volta Lake Authority SVRA) (US$1.1 million equivalent or 3
percent). VLTC is the owner and operator of the port and navigation system on
Volta Lake.
1.06     The proposed project was init4ally identified in early 1985 based on
BRICIP's reports (para. 1.02). Subsequent IDA preparation missions visited
Ghana to help the Government and the entities involved define the scope and
cost of the project, as well as to discuss cofinancing possibilities with a
number of bilateral and multilaterial aid agencies. The project was appraised
by Messrs. T. Nayar and N. Tin in April/May 1986. Follow-up discussions were
held with the Government and relevant entities in November 1986.
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources, Supply and Demand
2.01     Ghana is well-endowed with energy resources, of which fuelwood and
hydropower are the most important. Wood-based energy supplies are abundant in
the two main forested areas -- the high forest zone in the southwest and the
savanna woodland zone in the northern part of the country - which together
cover about 17.8 million ha or two-thirds of the total land area. Hydropower
resources are also abundant particularly in the central and western regions
which are drained by three major areas with over twenty tributaries and
streams. The usable Lydropower potential is estimated at about 2,000 MW,
about twice the presently installed capacity. Two hydropower plants,
constructed with the financial assistance of the Bank, with respective
installed capacity of 912 NW (Akosombo) and 160MW (Kpong) are located on the
Volta River. Tapping the remaining hydropower potential is likely to be
costlier than thermal alternatives.



- 3 -
2.02     Proven petroleum reserves amount to less than 2.5 million barrels,
but the petroleum potential is considered much larger, in the offshore Tano
and Cape Three Points structures where hydrocarbon deposits have been
identified. There are no known coal, lignite or peat deposits. The resources
of biomass other than woodfuels comprise mainly crop residues, the extent of
which may be considerable. Solar energy is plentiful, while wind energy is of
limited potential.
2.03     Domestic energy output consists primarily of wood, hydropower, crop
residue and, to a very minor extent, petroleum. It is estimated at 3.9
million tons of oil equivalent (TOE) in 1985 and covered 87% of Ghana's
overall energy requirements. The balance was met by imported petroleum. Of
the 1985 energy output, firewood accounts for 76%, hydropower for 20%. crop
residue for 3.6%, and domestic petroleum for 0.4%. During 1976-85, the
increase in domestic energy output averaged less than 2% per annum, with a
considerable drop in 1982-84 due to substantially reduced hydropower
generation caused by a severe drought.
2.04     Ghana's net energy consumption in 1985 is estimated at 3.1 million
TOE, or about 232 kgOE per capita, which is low even by African standards
given the favorable energy resource endowment and the relatively advanced
degree of industrialization. As shown in the tabie below, about 70% is met
from fuelwood and charcoal mainly for urban and rural household consumption,
followed by petroleum products (22%), agricultural residues (4.6%) and
electricity (3.4%). Net per capita consumption of commercial energy (i.e.,
petroleum products and electricity) estimated at 59 kgOE in 1985, also is low
compared to other Sub-Saharan countries such as Ivory Coast (136 kgOE in 1982)
and Senegal (102 kgOE in 1981). Commercial energy consumption increased
throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, spurred by subsidized prices of
petroleum products and electricity, but declined sharply in 1982 as the supply
of petroleum and electricity was drastically reduced due to short_ge of
foreign exchange and drought. An energy supply/demand balance for 1985 is
shown in Aniuex 2-1.

B. Sector Organization
2.05     The Ministry of Fuel and Power (MPP) is charged with the overall
respensibility for the energy sector. It supervises the Ghana National
Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) which is responsible for petroleum exploration,
development and production (which have been carried out by foreign oil
companies); GRAIP for petroleum refining; and GOIL for petroleum products
distribution and marketing. In the power sector, MPP supervises the Volta
River Authority (VRA), which is responsible for hydroelectric power
generation, transmission and bulk distribution, and the Electricity
Corporation of Ghana (ECG) which essentially distributes power to the
consumers throughout the country. Aside from the aforementioned Government-
owned entities, there are four private oil companies which are wholly-owned
local subsi'taries of the major international oil companies (BP, Mobil, Shell,
and Texaco _T). Their responsibilities are limited to the storage,
distribution and marketing of petroleum products alloted to them. Although
their activities are monitored and controlled by NIP, they enjoy a fair amount
of freedom in the actual distribution and marketing of petroleum products.
2.06     There have been serious institutional weaknesses facing the sector,
resulting in the inadequacy especially in energy planning and in the
coordination among the various subsectors and entities. To alleviate these
weaknesses, the Government formally established in late 1983 the MEB (para.
1.01) which serves mainly as a policy analysis and advisory body to MFP. NEB
is responsible for formulating recommendations of overall energy policies;
1/ In West Africa including Ghana, Texaco was sold to Shell in December 1986.

directing demonstration and development projects in renewable energy;
monitoring/inspection of petroleum exploration, development, production,
refining and distribution; and enforcing the terms and conditions of
exploration and production agreements. NEB commenced its operations in 1985
with the appointment of its Board of Directors and Executive Director. It
receives technical assistance from IDA, through the Energy Project (Credit
1373-CH), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
C. The Renewable Energy Sector
2.07     More than 95% of Ghanaian households depend on wood or charcoal for
cooking fuel. Forest based products also meet a substantial proportion of
energy needs in activities such as food processing, and beverage making.
Fuelwood consumption in 1985 is estimated as 8.6 million MT or about 802 of
total wood use. While there is no overall lack of forest resources and
vegetative growth, and the supply still exceeds woodtree demand, the gap is
narrowing. In fact, wood consumption might exceed the natural forest
increment in the 1990s if the present trend of deforestation and range
degradation continues. To arrest them, the government may increase the
woodfuel supply through improved forest management, expanded tree planting,
higher efficiency of charcoal production and increased use of wood waste and,
at the same time, improve the end-use efficiency of stoves and develop
woodfuel substitutes.   These issues would be addressed in a Forestry Sector
Review currently under preparation.
2.08     Although Ghana's hydroelectric potential has been well studied with a
view to identifying large scale projects, efforts have been only recently to
assess the small scale hydroelectirc potential on a country-wide basis. In
fact, the surveys by NEB with the assistance of UNDP and IDA have identified
some 40 mini-hydro sites with a total potential capacity of 20 NW. It may be
economically feasible to supply electricity from these sites to isolated rural
areas. NEB is preparing a program for investment in renewable energy with the
technical assistance provided under the Energy Project (Credit 1373-GC).
D. The Petroleum Sector
1.   Hydrocarbon Potential
2.09     Ghana's hydrocarbon prospects are located in three onshore
sedimentary basins, the large Volta Basin (104,000 sq km) in the north, the
Tano basin on the southwest coast, and the Keta basin in the southeastern
coastal area - and one offshore basin of about 70,000 sq km, including the
deep offshore. The offshore basin has attracted most of the exploration. To
date, some 56 exploration wells (36 were offshore wells) have been drilled by
foreign companies resulting in few commercial discoveries. Only the
marginally economic offshore Saltpond field was developed in the early 1980s
but its operators decided to return the field to the Government after
production had dropped to 650 B/D in mid-1985, down from 4,000 BID around



- 6 -
1980.11 More recently, two offshore wells drilled in the Tano basin by
PetroCanada International Assistance Corporation (PCIAC) of Carada identified
promising prospectt which are being further evaluated.
2.10     With exploration by foreign companies tapering off in the early
19809, and with the objective of reducing dependence on petroleum imports, the
Government, with the assistance of the Bank/IDA took steps to rekindle and
accelerate hydrocarbon exploration. For this purpose, GNPC (para. 2.05) was
created as an autonomous body responsible for exploration and fleld
development, including the negotiation of contracts with foreign companies.
Through the Energy Project, the Bank/IDA assisted in the revision of the
petroleum legislation and the formulation of a draft model agreement as part
of the Government's concerted efforts to attract foreign companies to explore
and develop hydrocarbon resources. This project also finances the collection
and processing of available geological and geophysical data on the offshore
basin to better establish and promote Ghana's hydrocarbon potential;
assistance in preparing promotional packages, contract negotiations and
monitoring the companies' activities; and training of GNPC staff in geology,
geophysics, engineering, economics and law. The Government's promotional
efforts and invitation to bids for 17 offshore blocks in 1985 generated some
interest by the industry. However, thus far, only one exploration contract
was concluded, i.e. with Diamond Shamrock, a U.S. independent company,
covering one onshore block in the Keta basin and IFC later participated in
this deal. Negotiations with other international oil companies are in
progress.
2.   Petroleum Consumption
2.11     By international standards, Ghana is not a petroleum intensive
economy. Per capita petroleum consumption of around 51 kilograms (kg) of oil
equivalent is less than half that of other African countries with similar per
capita incomes, such as Angola, Kenya and Sudan. Consumption was limited to
0.5 million MT of crude oil in 1983 through strict rationing due to foreign
exchange shortages, but increased to around 0.9-1.0 million MT per year in
1984 to 1986. As shown below, although Ghana's net petroleum imports have
fallen from US$248 million in 1980 to US$165 million in 1985, they still
claimed about 25X of the country's total export earnings in 1985. With the
drastic reduction in oil prices beginning January 1986, Ghana's net petroleum
imports decreased to US$98 million in 1986, representing 12 percent of total
export earnings for the year.
1/ Production from Saltpond commenced in 1978 and met nearly 5S of Ghana's
crude requirements. Production started to decline in 1982 and by the time the
field was shut-in in mid-1985, about 3.5 million barrels had been recovered.

2.12      Ghana's petroleum consumption profile, as in most other developing
countries, is dominated by middle distillates (kerosene and diesel oil).
Kerosene is used primarily in rural areas for lighting while diesel is used
for mass and freight transportation and fishing boats.  Middle distillate
consumption in 1986 was around 60 percent of total domestic petroleum product
consumption. Light and middle distillate consumption increased slightly from
about 90 percent of the domestic market, to 92 percent in 1986. This trend
towards increasing distillate demand and decreasing fuel oil demand is
expected to continue into the future. The past consumption of petroleum
products is given in the following table:

2.13     During the period 1982-84, consumption of kerosene and diesel oil
declined substantially as a result of Government rationing. In the future,
opportunities to reduce petroleum consumption without seriously hurting
economic activity appear limited. The transport sector, the largest petroleum
consumer with 65 percent of the total consumption, has only limited energy
efficiency improvement possibilities in the near future. Industrial and
comercial sectors also have limited scope for reducing petroleum consumption
since their petroleum use is comparatively low (22 percent). Price increases
and frequent shortages have already driven some private sector industries to
improve efficiency and/or shift to wood or electricity to meet their energy
needs. Petroleum use in the residential sector (11 percent) consists almost
entirely of illuminating kerosene used in the rural areas, and could only be
reduced through substitution of other energy forms (electricity or LPG), which
does not, however, appear immediately feasible.
2.14     In view of limited potential for reducing petroleum consumption
through conservation, it appears that reduction in the total petroleum bill
can best be achieved through more efficient crude/product procurement,
optimization of the refinery operation to reduce cost and match the refined
products to domestic requirements and increased efficiency of an improved
distribution system.

3.   Petroleum Refining
2.15     Ghana has a 28OOO barrels per stream day (bpsd) or 1.25 million MT
per annum refinery located at Tems, near Accra. The facilities in the
refinery consist of a crude oil distillation, catalytic reforming and treating
units for light naphtha and kerosene/jet fuel (ATK). The refinery also has
tho necessary offaite facilities and an oil jetty (32 feet draft) connected to
the refinery crude tank-farm through an 8-kilometer 24/16 inch pipeline. From
the tanker, crude oil is unloaded into the pipeline through two 8-inch
diameter unloading arms, with a similar-size unloading arm as a standby.
2.16     The refinery facilities were commissioned in 1963 by Snamprogetti for
GHAIP, then owned by Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI) of Italy. In November
1977, SNI transferred its 100l ownership of GRAIP to the Government as part of
a negotiated settlement. The refinery was designed for Iraqi Kirkuk crude
oil. However, in order to maximize distillate products to meet the market
requirements and minimize fuel oil production, the refinery has been
processing light crude oils from Wigeria during the past few years. In spite
of the lighter crudes being processed, excess fuel oil continued to be
produced, and had to be exported invariably at depressed prices. In the
absence of any secondary conversion facilities, the refinery is unable to
further reduce the fuel oil production. Quantities of crude oil processed and
the products produced from 1981 to 1986 are shown in the sable below.

2.17     In addition to the problem of excess fuel oil (para 2.16), the
refinery, due to its design limitations and shortage of maintenance parts,
incurs an unusually high fuel consumption and loss of over 6% against a norm
of 4.0X of crude throughput for refineries of similar size and
configuration. This problem is being partially rectified under the ongoing
Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1446-GH) by
providing adequate spare parts, repairing leaking storage tanks and improving



- 10 -
the efficiency of the existing boilers. There are also some institutional
problems, most notably the lack of coordination and accountability in crude
oil procurement (para. 3.05).
2.18     Prior to IDA involvement with the Tema refinery, oil leakages from
corroded and worn out facilities (especially the oil jetties and loading arms,
crutde and product pieplines, storage tanks, truck loading arms and pumps) have
resulted in oil spills. IDA has assisted GNAIP in alleviating these problems
by either replacing or repairing such facilities through the ongoing first
phase refinery rehabilitation. Additional provisions under the proposed
project, in particular the installation of a ne,w API oil separator to remove
the oil from the refinery effluent water, would reduce oil pollution of the
environment to normal industry standards (paras. 4.04 and 4.25).
2.19     Tema refinery, operating exclusively for the domestic consumption of
petroleum products and situated near a large crude oil (light and low sulfur)
producing country (Nigeria) and away from the surplus markets in Western
Europe/Mediterranean, enjoys certain operating advantage, mainly in the
differential of crude and product transport cost, that makes it economically
viable as compared to import of finished products. The crude and product
freight advantage, on an average, amounts to US$12.50 per MT (US$1.68 per
batrel). Currently operating at aboeit 21,000 barrels per day capacity using
Bonny Light crude from Nigeria, the refinery is able to produce all the
products required in the country with minimum of surplus residual fuel oil.
Since the crude is extremely low in sulfur and other metal content, the
surplus fuel oil also has a ready market outside as cracking feedstock at
premium prices. With these specific advantages, the Tema refinery has an
annual savings ranging from US$11.6 million in October 1985, to US$6.7 million
in December 1986 as shown on page 2 of Annex 5-2. By implementing additional
energy conservation measures envisaged in the proposed project, the refinery's
operating cost would be further reduced by about US$1.0 million at curtent
fuel oil price.
2.20     Since the main advantage for the Ghana refinery is in the crude and
product freight differential, it is important to note that the West Africa
region as a whole is a net importer of petroleum products of about 7 million
MT per year (equivalent to approximately 150,000 barrels/day refinery
capacity).  Western Europe/Mediterranean is the main source for these imj.orts,
so that this is the pricing base for the region (e.g. surplus products from
the Abidjan refinery are exported on the basis of North West Europe/Medi-
terranean FOB prices plus freight to the region). Current information on the
fifteen refineries in the West Africa region (Mauritania to Angola) is given
in Annex 5-2.
2.21     Under the ongoing refinery rehabilitation project, the consultants
studied various options for secondary conversion in the refinery and concluded
that thermal cracker (TC) or fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) would be the most
suitable options with investment costs ranging from US$85 million to US$130
million for TC and FCC respectively. In view of the prevailing uncertainties
in crude and finished product prices in the international market and the need
to reduce the public sector investment program, the Government, on IDA's
suggestion, decided to postpone the secondary conversion in the Tema refinery
and removed it from the "core" investment program for the energy sector (para.
1.03).



4. Petroleum Product Distribution and MarketinA
2.22     All products, except lubricants and bitumen, come from the Tema
refinery finished product tankage; about SO of the products goes by road
tanker directly to retail outlets, reseller points and large "volume"
customers, mostly in the Accra-Tema area (see the Map of Ghana at the end of
the report). Most of the remaining product is transhipped from Tema to
distribution tankage in Takoradi (15) to serve the Western Region and parts
of the Central Region, and Kumasi (35X) to serve the Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, and
the Northern and Upper Regions. Two tankage depots exist in Takoradi - one
owned and operated by COIL and the other by BP, with Mobil and Shell/Texaco
making use of the BP facilities. Ocean tankers of 18,000-25,000 DiT vessels
from Tema supply these depots which have a total tankage capacity for all
products of about 33,000 MT. In Kumasi, Shell, BP, COIL and Mobil own tankage
totalling 5,000 MT. The depot in Kumasi is supplied from Tema mostly by large
road tankers, with very limited volumes supplied by rail tank wagons due to
the unreliability of the rail system. The approximate market shares of the
distributors and the number of their retailing outlets are shown below. It is
noted from this table that while COIL and Shell currently have about equal
market shares, COIL has almost twice as many retail outlets as Shell. This
reflects, to a large extent, the fact that COIL, as a Government-owned
company, is bcund to distribute throughout the country, while the private
companies operate where financial viability is optimized.

2.23     The main problems faced in the distribution and marketing of refined
products are the lack and/or the poor conditions of the infrastructures
including those necessary to bring fuels especially diesel and kerosene to
reote/outlying areas as veil as the lack of financial incentive to distribute
products to those areas. In particular, GOIL's depots at Takoradi and Kumasi
are in poor condition for lack of spare parts, poor maintenance and worn out
machinery; the product-transfer pipelines from the refinery to Tema harbor are
badly corroded; the retail outlet pumps, underground storage tanks and support
facilities are in poor condition due to corrosion and wear; and the road tank
cars which constitute the main transport system for the whole country partly
are in poor condition due to lack of spare parts and partly due to the
extremely bad conditions of the road. These problems, which threaten to
disrupt the supply and distribution of petroleum products in the country,
would be remedied under the proposed project. The necessary incentive, i.e.
marketing/distribution margin, to induce the distribution of products to the
remote/outlying areas would be part of an appropriate pricing structure
currently being studied with UNIDO assistance (para. 2.27).
5. Petroleum Product Transport via Volta Lake
2.24     As an alternative to the long distance movement of products to the
northern region by road tank cars, Volta Lake could be used for transporting
products from Akosombo to Buipe by barges (a distance of about 385 km,, see Map
IBRD-20017 at the end of this report). At present drr cargos are moved by
barges from Akosombo to various points along the lake in the North. VRA/VLTC
have already signed contracts for the development of jetty facilities at Buipe
for dry cargo handling with financial assistance from the Federal Republic of
Germany (through KfW). The Government and VRA/VLTC are very keen to build
facilities for petroleum products transportation from Akosombo to Buipe, which
will reduce overall transportation cost, as part of the port development at
Akosombo and _Ape. Because of the very poor conditions of the existing road,
particularly from Kumasi to the North, the life of the road trucks is greatly
reduced, and operating and maintenance costs increased. Even if the road is
rehabilitated in the future, bulk transportation by barges over the lake is
found to be more cost effective. Lake transportation from Akosombo to Buipe
would avoid the road transportation to the North by about 500 km, and would
increase the reliability of supply to the interior locations in the North and,
at a later stage, to the neighboring Burkina Faso. At present, supplies of
petroleum products to these areas are often interrupted.
6. Distribution in the Rural Areas
2.25     While the number of retailing outlets, if rehabilitated, would meet
the needs of the urban areas, the facilities for distributing essential
petroleum products (mostly kerosene and diesel) for the agricultural community
in the rural areas are inadequate due to lack of infrastructure and inadequate
marketing margins. The four private oil marketing companies and GOIL are not
willing to extend such facilities due to the small volume of trade and
comparatively higher cost of transportation involved. Local private
entrepreneurs, if at all interested, invariably expect prices associated with
black market conditions. The Government attaches high priority to extend
basic minimum facilities to such areas, especially to ameliorate the movement
of agricultural products in the North. The Government encourages the local
administration authorities to form farmers' cooperatives to distribute



- 13 -
essential fuels. As a pilot scheme, the Government has proposed to establish
initially 125 such outlets all over the interior locations at a cost of about
US$5.0 million. This pilot scheme is included in the proposed project.
7. LPG Distribution Facilities
2.26     The five oil marketing companies together currently market about
6,000 MT per year of LPCt produced in the Tema Refinery. The refinery has a
potential production capacity of 12,000 MT per year at the current crude
throughput level (20,000 bpd) without requiring any additional investment.
The major constraints to increased marketing of LPC are insufficient storage
and bottle filling plant, LPG bottles, table-top cooking stoves, and LPG bulk
transport vehicles. Marketing of another 6,000 MT per year of LPG would
enhance the refinery's operating economies and would lead to a substitution of
about 24,000 MT per year of wood fuel and charcoal. The marketing companies
are confident that the domestic market would be capable of absorbing this
additional volume of LPG within a relatively short period of time.
8. Petroleum Product Pricing
2.27     Petroleum product prices are fixed by the Government at the ex-
refinery, wholesale and retail levels. Ex-refinery prices are currently based
on an allocation of total crude cost and refinery processing fee. The
refinery fee is paid to the refinery (GRAIP) to cover operating and
administrative expenses and earn a certain returft on its share capital.
Retail (ex-pump) prices are obtained by adding the following items to the ex-
refinery prices: dealer's margin, marketer's margin, transportation costs,
special fund and energy fund contribution. A table showing the build-up of
ex-pump prices from the ex-refinery prices is shown in Annex 2-2. Petroleum
product as well as distribution margins are currently applied contrywide. In
order to induce the companies to distribute the products in the outlying aras,
the Government recognized that, in addition to providing the necessary
infrastructure which is the primary constraint, the pricing system may need to
be modified to allow varying distribution margins. This issue is being
addressed in the ongoing petroleum products pricing study discussed in the
following paragraph.
2.28     Petroleum product prices have been revised upwards substantially over
the past three years, as shown in the table below, in line with the
Government's policy of maintaining prices that generally reflect international
levels. It is noted that, in consultation with the IMF, the Government
instituted a second window auction system in September 1986 which covers all
imports except for petroleum and consumer goods. Thus oil imports were
temporarily excluded from the auction rate and continued at exchange rate of
Cedi 90 per US$1.0. This exclusion was, however, terminated in late February
1987 and since that time oil imports are based on the auction rate.
Concurrent with the unifying of the exchange rate, petroleum prices were
raised substantially as shown in the table below. It is noted from this table
that the exchange rate of Cedi 158 per US$1.0, retail prices of petroleum are
above CIF prices.

2.29      Under the Energy Project (Credit 1373-GH), the Government agreed to
carry out a petroleum product pricing study which would address, among other
things, the various refinery and marketing/distribution margins. Although
consultants were identified for the study, the Government subsequently decided
that the study would be carried out with technical assistance to be obtained
through bilateral assistance (grant money). UNIDO approved in late 1986 the
Government's request for such technical assistance and the study is
underway. The Government has agreed to establish a pricing system based on
the recommendations of this study before credit effectiveness, and to
implement such an agreed system by December 31, 1987. Furthermore, the
Government has confirmed that it will in principle maintain petroleum prices
at or above international levels. The Government intends to review with IDA
the progress/status of product distribution by June 30, 1989 to ascertain
whether there would be a need to institute a differential distribution margin
upon completion of the Volta Lake petroleum transport system and take
appropriate action accordingly.

9. Private Sector Activities
2.30     Petroleum operations in Ghana, from exploration to marketing/distri-
bution, were entirely in the hand of the private sector until the early 1970s
when the Italian Companies (ENI, Agip s.p.a. and SNAM s.p.a.) decided to leave
Ghana and turned over their operations to the Government. As a result of this
transfer, the Government, through GHAIP and GOIL, handles the refinery
operation and distributed about one-third of the petroleum products, i.e. the
market share of Agip in Ghana. The Government's policy continues to put
strong emphasis on private sector investment. With regard to hydrocarbon
exploration, as mentioned in para. 2.10, the Government, with the assistance
of the Bank/IDA, revised the petroleum laws and established a legal framework
suitable for the purpose of promoting foreign investments. As a result of
these promotional efforts, Diamond Shamrock of the US signed a contract for an
acreage in the Keta basin in late 1985 and negotiations are ongoing with two
major international oil companies (para. 2.10). Recently, the IFC entered
into a joint-venture with Diamond Shamrock to further accelerate the work
program on its blocks.
2.31     With regard to the marketing/distribution sector, three private oil
companies are currently distributing two-thirds of the petroleum products.
The issues faced in this area are mainly the lack of incentives to invest in
the expansion, or even rehabilitation of their storage and distribution system
apparently due to the question of repatriation of profits and to distribute
petroleum products to outlying/remote areas. The Government is obviously
concerned about these issues; following suggestions of the Bank/IDA during the
preparation of the proposed project, the Government was willing to provide
private sector companies with foreign exchange for their rehabilitation
requirements although this course of action was no longer necessary when the
auction system was introduced in September 1986 (para. 1.03). The issue of
regional distribution and the related marketing margin would be addressed in
an appropriate pricing system being studied with the assistance of UNIDO. The
Government, through a component of the proposed project (farmer's service
reseller outlets), attempts to further promote private sector investment in
the distribution of petroleum products in the outlying/remote areas. The
Government, following the review of the petroleum sector investment program
with the Bank/IDA, has also decided to earmark a viable lube oil blending
project for investment by the private sector.
E. Government's Sector Objectives and DeveLopment Plans
2.32     The Government's overall objectives for the energy sector are:
(a) to improve the availability of long-term security of supply of energy at
reasonable cost to sustain the development of all geographic regions and
economic sectors of the country; (ii) to reduce the country's vulnerability to
short-term supply disruptions, particularly for petroleum products and
hydroelectric power; (iii) to rationalize the development of indigenous energy
sources to meet the growing needs of the economy and to substitute for
imported fuels; and (iv) to promote more efficient use of energy throuigh
appropriate pricing and demand policies.
2.33     During the past three years, the Government has made important
progress in a number of areas, most notably, in securing arrangements for
crude oil imports from Nigeria, in reactivating hydrocarbon exploration and



- 16 -
development activities through private sector investment as well as bilateral
assistance, in initiating long overdue rehabilitation of energy sector
infrastructure, and in rationalizing the organizational framework of the
energy sector including the establishment of two new statutory entities, GNPC
and NEB. The Government's strategy for the next few years is to expand on
these initiatives, especially to complete the ongoing rehabilitation of all
existing energy sector infrastructure/facilities, to complete the appraisal of
hydrocarbon deposits at Tano basin and initiate their development, to
strengthen and expand the capacity and flexibility of petroleum refining and
distribution facilities and to increase access to electricity of different
geogr&phic regions. On the institutional aspects, further work still needs to
be done to better define the functions of the sectoral organizations and the
relative roles of Government and public entities operating on a commercial
basis. The management improvement study for GHAIP and COIL (para. 3.04) and
the rationalization of the crude procurement/bulk product sales
responsibilities (para. 3.05) would be important steps in this direction.
F. Role of the Bank Group
2.34     The Bank/IDA have been closely involved in the development of the
energy sector in Ghana. In the power sector, the Bank/IDA have approved over
the past twenty-five years seven projects with total financing of US$150
million for power generation, distribution and rehabilitation of the power
systems. Another project, the Northern Grid Extension Project, approved by
IDA in February 1987, would bring hydro-based grid to the northern regions and
further strengthen the power sector entities. The Bank/IDA involvement in the
petroleum sector began recently, with IDA Credits of SDR 10.2 million for the
Energy Project in May 1983 and af SDR 6.6 million for the Petroleum Refinery
Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project in February 1984.   Both of
these projects are under implementation. Through the Energy Project IDA
supports the Government's promotion of the exploration and development of
indigenous hydrocarbon resources and the strengthening of sector
institutions. It also attempts to address the petroleum products pricing and
energy planning issues through the financing of a pricing study and a gas
utilization study, both of which are currently under preparation. Through the
Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project, IDA financed the
first phase rehabilitation of the Tema refinery and studies to review the
petroleum supply and distribution sector and the management of the sector
organization. The implementation of the management study, however, has been
delayed as explained in para. 3.04.
2.35     The proposed project is a result of long discussions with the
Government on the petroleum refining and distribution subsector covering a
number of important sectoral issues on institutional aspects including the
roles of the state-owned sector entities, on development/investment plans and
petroleum pricing. With regard to the institutional aspects, the Bank/IDA
would help improve the efficiency and commercial orientation of CHAIP's and
GOIL's operations, by restructuring the operating/earnings basis for GHAIP
away from the hitherto cost-plus basis and transferring to it the
responsibility of bulk procurement of crude/bulk marketing of products, and by
exposing their senior personnel, especially GOIL's to international operating
practices and standards. The Bank/IDA would also ensure that the management
improvement study for GHAIP and GOIL be completed and that a plan of action
would be agreed for the implementation of the recommendations. With respect



- 17 -
to the development/investment plans, the Bank/IDA have critically reviewed
these plans with the Government and have persuaded the Government to drop a
major investment (US$8S-130 million) for refinery secondary conversion and
adopt a least-cost investment plan for the refining and distribution
subsector. Such decision was justified in view of the uncertainties in the
prices of crude oil and finished products in the international markets and the
need to reduce the size of the public sector investment program. On petroleum
product prices, which are currently above international levels, the ongoing
pricing study with UNIDO assistance (para. 2.26) would also focus on an
appropriate structure that would provide incentives for the private sector to
distribute petroleum products to the outlying regions and remote areas to
support their economic development efforts.
2.36     In financing the proposed project, the Bank/IDA would directly
support the Government's policy for accelerating economic development in the
regions. The proposed project would increase the reliability and reduce the
cost of supply of petroleum products throughout the country. It would bring
the much needed diesel fuel to the remote areas to facilitate especially the
movement of agricultural products. It woula also double the amount of
distributed LPG readily available from the refinery to counter the
deforestation problems in the country. In addition, the proposed project
would open a new and economical supply route via Volts Lake to northern
regions, which would form the backbone of a transport system that could supply
petroleum products economically to neighboring countries in the north.
Finally, the proposed project would reduce the oil pollution resultiag from
Tema refinery operations to normal industry standards.
III. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Introduction
3.01     The proposed credit would be made to the Government of Ghana and on-
lent to the Ghanaian-Italian Petroleum Company Limited (GEiAIP) and the Ghana
Oil Company Limited (COIL), which are responsible for the implementation of
their respective components of the proposed project. GRAIP and GOIL were set
up in the early 1960s by ENI/Agip/Snam of Italy and were transferred to the
Government when the Italian companies left Ghana in the mid-1970s. With a
view to strengthening the organization and management of the petroleum sector,
a study was included in the IDA-financed Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical
Assistance Project to review the organizational structures, financial
managment and accounting systems of all the sectoral entities. This study,
however, has been delayed due to a reorganization of the sector (creation of
GNPC) and the Government's insistence in finding grant money for the study.
Although UNDP has financed the study for GNPC, no grant funds have been
obtained for GHAIP/GOIL study. The proposed credit would support the
completion of this management improvement study for GHAIP/GOIL and formulation
of a plan of action for implementation of the recommended changes (paras. 3.04
and 3.23).



- 18 -
B. The Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Company Limited
1 Organization
3.02     GHAIP was incorporated in 1963 as a private company under the
Companies Code to construct, own and operate the Tema refinery. The company
was wholly-owned by ZVI of Italy until 1977 when, as originally provided for
in the company's regulations, all the company's shares were acquired by the
Government of Ghana. In a transfer agreement between ENI and the company, ENI
provided a teem of 14 experts to assist GHAIP's Ghanaian managerial and
technical personnel in gradually assuming the responsibility for the
management and operation of the refinery. This technical assistance program
proved to be successful and was gradually phased out with the last Italian
technical expert leaving GHAIP in 1983.
3.03     According to GHAIP's .-egulations, the general direction of the
company is vested in a Board of Directors, which in turn delegates the
responsibility for the day-to-day operations to a Managing Director. However,
since 1983, a Joint Consultative Committee was appointed to act in lieu of the
Board of Directors. This Committee, which meets once a month, comprises only
GHAIP's personnel (including the Managing Director, Re!inery Manager, Chief
Accountant, one representative of the middle management and two staff
representing the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, and one
representing the local workers' union) and, therefore, would not benefit from
advices from outside Board or Committee members. CHAIP's decision making
process would be strengthened with the reappointment of a proper Board of
Directors. As shown in the organization structure in Annex 3-1, GHAIP has ten
departments/offices, of which four (Technical, Maintenance, Production and
Production Planning and Control), are directly responsible for the refinery
operations and report to the Managing Director through a Refinery Manager, and
the remainder (Personnel, Commercial, Accounts, Solicitor/Secretary, Medical
Resources, and Refinery Rehabilitation Projects Office) report directly to the
Managing Director. CHAIP's organization structure including the role and
composition of its Board of Directors will be reviewed in the management
improvement study discussed below.
3.04     Under the Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 1446-GH), approved by IDA in March 1984, it was agreed that studies
would be carried out for the im,rovement of the organization and management of
the petroleum refinery sector, including CHAIP, GOIL and the former Petroleum
Department of MFPP (The Petroleum Departmentt which was then responsible for
the bulk purchase of crude oil as well as bulk sales of products to the oil
marketing companies, was subsequently abolished and partially absorbed into
the newly created GNPC.) These studies were to focus on the organizational
structures, financial management and accounting systems, auditing, refinery's
profitability and staff development and training. The implementation of these
studies was delayed due to the aforementioned changes in the sectoral
organization (namely, the abolishment of the Petroleum Department and the
creation of GNPC) and to the Government's general decision to request
assistance on a grant basis from bilateral and multilateral Aid agencies to
carry out such studies. While UNDP subsequently provided assistance to GNPC
for the organization and management study carried out by Braspetro (Brazil),
no assistance has been obtained for GHAIP and COIL. The Government has now
selected the consultants as agreed under Credit 1446-CH (based on the terms of



- 19 -
reference already agreed with MPP) to carry out the management improvement
study for OHAIP and COIL. The Government has agreed that the consultants'
report will be jointly reviewed with IDA and that a plan of action for
implementing the recommendations will be agreed with IDA by December 31, 1987.
3.05     Although GRAIP's regulations allow the company to engage in petroleum
refining as well as supply and distribution of petroleum products, it has
operated to date essentially as a toll processing refinery. GHAIP basically
processes the crude oil procured and delivered to the refinery by GNPC and
turns over the refined products to GNPC from the storage tanks at Tema.
CHAIP's services are compensated for by GNPC through a processing fee which
covers all operating and maintenance cost plus a 12.5 percent return on its
share capital, as further elaborated in para 3.10. In an attempt to improve
the efficiency of the refinery operation and the coordination of bulk
procurement of crude, discussions have been held within the Government to
transfer the bulk procurement of crude oil and bulk marketing of finished
products and re-export of fuel oil from GNPC, which is mainly involved in
petroleum exploration and development, to GHAIP, and to change the processing
fee basis to convert the refinery operation into a commercial operation. This
would enable GHAIP to procure the appropriate types and volumes of crude at
the right time as required by its refinery operations. This arrangement would
also bring about a measure of accountability and control by GRAIP for the
quantity of crude oil purchased and received, and any losses thereafter, from
the loading ports, through the unloading port at Tema and the processing at
the refinery, to the storage tanks of finished products. The Government has
agreed that its final decision on this bulk procurement/marketing arrangement
satisfactory to IDA will be made before credit effectiveness and that such
final arrangements will be put into effect by January 1, 1988. As an interim
measure, GNPC is expected to enter into an agency agreement with GRAIP to be
effective not later than June 30, 1987, whereby GRAIP will be responsible for
the operational aspects of bulk procurement of crude oil and bulk marketing of
petroleum products (i.e. decisions with regard to quantity/quality of oil
products to be procured, tanker scheduling, measurement and oil accounting).
With respect to the processing fee as discussed in para. 3.12, the government
and OHAIP have agreed on a system that will periodically adjust the processing
margin for GRAIP taking into consideration the prevailing comparable
international levels, international market prices for crude and products and
the financial viability of GHAIP. Furthermore, this system will be applied to
GHAIP beginning with financial year 1988.
2. Management and Staff
3.06     CHAIP has an experienced top management team, most of whom started
their careers with the company when the refinery came into operation. The
current Managing Director has held this positicn since 1978. He is an able
and competent manager. GHAIP's total staff numbers around 650. Staff
turnover is low. The technical staff, particularly those dealing with the
refinery operation, are competent as evidenced by their successful assumption
of the responsibility for the running of the refinery with the gradual phasing
out of ENI technical assistance (para. 3.02). They clearly had benefited from
the various training programs over the past years, both on-and off-the-job.
Recently, as part of the Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 1446-GH), a staff development/training program was prepared
by BEICIP for the technical staff. This program has been approved by IDA for



- 20 -
implementation. On the financial management and accounting side, there is
room for improvement, in terms of filling vacancies as well as upgrading
qualifications. CHAIP has initiated action to fill the vacancies. The
development and training of finance and accounting scaff would be dealt with
as part of the pending management improvement study (para. 3.04).
3. Accounts and Audit
3.07     GHAIP's accounting and management information systems, which were
adopted since the early years of the refinery operations, could be improved
particularly with regard to cost accounting, financial planning and control.
In addition, a comprehensive system of oil accounting should be developed to
monitor the actual and permissible losses of oil at each stage (transfer,
storage, processing, etc.) and identify potential problem areas for remedial
actions. This oil accounting system would be essential especially when the
responsibility for bulk procurement of crude oil is transfered to GHAIP. The
accounting system is partly computerized at present; it is expected to be
fully computerized with the computer equipment being purchased under the
ongoing Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project. The above
accounting and financial management aspects are to be dealt with in the afore-
mentioned management improvement study (para. 3.04).
3.08     GHAIP is making good progress in keeping its accounts up-to-date.
While the 1984 accounts were not audited until eighteen months after the close
of the years, due to shortage of qualified staff and machine breakdown, the
1985 accounts were audited within eleven months after year-end and the 1986
accounts are expected to be audited within six months after year end as agreed
under Credit 1446-GH. CHAIP's accounts have been audited by Pannell, Kerr and
Forster Chartered Accountants, a private auditing firm. The quality of the
audit is good. CHAIP has agreed that the audited accounts, together with the
auditor's report, will be submitted to IDA not later than six months after the
close of the year.
4. GHAIP's Finances
(a) Past Operating Results and Financial Position
3.09     GHAIP's operating results and financial position for the period 1981-
1985 are shown in the audited Income Statements and Balance Sheets in Annexes
3-2 and 3-3 and summarized below:

3.10     The financial results of CHAIP are largely determined by the
processing fee established in the "Processing Agreement" dated June 18, 1965
between CHAIP and the Government. This agreement, which is still in force
between CHAIP and GNPC, provides for CHAIP to be paid a fee covering all
refining expenditures (operating costs, general and administrative expenses,
amortization of the refinery assets, interests on loans, and taxes) plus a
return (dividends) on the paid-up capital not exceeding 12.5% per annum.
Thus, with paid-up share capital remaining unchanged at Cedi 16.8 million (or
US$0.10 million at current auction exchange rate) as shown in the above table,
CHAIP earned a net income after taxes of only Cedi 2.1 million every year
during 1981-1985. This resulted in extremely low and declining profitability
ratios. Furthermore, CHAIP's earnings have been drastically reduced in real
terms as the Cedi was steadily devalued during this period from Cedi 2.75 per
US$1.0 in 1981 to Cedi 54.0 per US$1.0 in 1985, and no provision was made for
the revaluation of GHAIP's assets and equity base. The net result was that
CHAIP was unable to build up any reserves for its rehabilitation needs. The
rise of the total liabilities-equity ratio from 56/44 at end-1981 to 96/4 at
end-1985 reflects the effects of inflation on assets and liabilities, but
should not cause great concern as CHAIP in fact had no outstanding long-term
debt' and had been able to maintain a current ratio of 1.0 to 1.3 during this
period.
3.11     It is noted from the summary table in para. 3.09 that, in 1985, the
refinery earned a processing fee of US$6.8/MT or US$0.95 per barrel (with the
Cedi being converted at Cedi 54.0/US$1.0 during that year). Although this fee
is net of internal fuel consumption which, under the existing "Processing
Agreement" is charged directly to the Covernment/GNPC, it is a rather low
margin, reflecting the fact that CHAIP's fixed assets had almost been fully
amortized and that the return on equity had not been adjusted for inflation.
(b) Financial Projections
3.12     Under the "Processing Agreement" as described in para. 3.10, which is
essentially a cost-plus fee arrangement, CHAIP does not have any incentive to
improve its operational efficiency and profitability. Furthermore, since
interests on loans and amortization of assets are apart of the processing fee,
GRAIP normally would not be encouraged to incur any expenditures beyond the
bare minimum to keep the refinery running. This has led to the accumulated
deterioration of the refinery facilities as well as the inadequacy of its
safety and environmental protection equipment which are being addressed under
the onging Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project and the
proposed project. For the above reasons, IDA has recommended and the
Government has agreed that the refinery should be allowed to operate as a
commercially/financially viable entity, with a processing margin delinked from
share capital and sufficient for GHAIP to meet operating requirements and to
contribute towards investment requirements. Furthermore, this margin should
be reviewed from time to time to ensure increased efficiency/ competitiveness
of the refinery operation. Along these lines, the processing agreement should
be discontinued and the refinery operation converted into a commercial
operation with value addition to the crude oil imported in line with
international product prices and with operational efficiency comparable to
international standards for similar refineries. A mechanism to achieve this
objective is expected to emerge as a result of the ongoing petroleum product
pricing study financed by UNIDO (para. 2.29). The management of GHAIP would



- 23 -
also be improved through the recommendations of the management study (para.
3.04). A processing margin established through negotiations with the
Government taking into account the prevailing comparable international
refining margins, international market prices for p'oducts and the financial
viability of CHAIP (para. 3.05) would be the main features of the proposed
mechanism. Financial projections presented below on a processing fee of Cedis
420 (US$2.55 equivalent) per barrel, including about Cedis 150 (US$0.90
equivalent) per barrel to cover internal fuel consumption, indicate that CHAIP
would be able to maintain satisfactory financial conditions. Of this fee, the
Aet margin to CHAIP would be about Cedis 270 (US$1.65 aquivalent) per barrel
which is in line with the levels for comparable refineries in Kenya, Costa
Rica, and Jamaica, etc.
3.13      CHAIP's projected operating results and financial position for 1986-
1992 are shown in the projected income statements, balance sheets and funds
flow statements in Annexes 3-4, 3-5 and 3-6 and summarized below. The notes

3.14     Processing Revenues.  GCAIP's future production is projected on a
growth rate of 2.8 percent until 1989 and 5.2 percent from 1990 onwards. It
has been assumed that the "Processing Agreement" would be discontinued at the
end of 1987 and, beginning in 1988, GRAIP would be paid a processing fee of
Cedis 420 (US$2.55 equivalent) per barrel in real terms including Cedis 150
(US$0.9 equivalent) per barrel to cover internal fuel consumption (para.
3.12). While the processing fee will be the key element to improving GHAIP's
profitablilty, internal fuel consumption which is expected to drop, as a
result of the first phase refinery rehabilitation and the proposed project,
from its current level of 6.0 percent of total throughput to 5.0 percent upon
project completion in 1990 would also result in substantial savings.
3.15     Liquidity.  The projections show a relatively high level of short-
term indebtedness in the form of accounts payable which result in a current
ratio of 0.8 in 1987. However, liquidity is expected to improve gradually as
a result of the new processing margin ag*eement to be applied beginning in
1988. Current ratios will rise gradually from 1.0 in 1988 to 2.0 in 1992.
Such a liquidity position is satisfactory since fuel inventories for internal
consumption purposes would be held by the Government.
3.16     Leverage.  The projected processing margin will allow GHAIP to
rebuild its equity base and improve its leverage ratios provided that it
pursues a reasonable dividend policy. The projections assume that GRAIP will
pay no dividends during the construction period and thereafter retain 20
percent of its net income as a legal reserve and distribute 25 percent of the
remainder in the form of dividends to Government. The balance will be held as
a supplementary reserve to strengthen its equity base. Under such conditions,
the resulting equity/debt ratio would improve from 2/98 in 1986 to 26/74 upon
project completion in 1990 and 40/60 in 1992.
3.17     Cash Generation.  CHAIP is expected to improve its operating margins
once it is granted a more realistic processing fee. The projections indicate
a ratio of operating income/sales of about 37 percent on average during the
construction period, riking gradually to 41 percent in 1992. Likewise, the
net income/sales is expexted to rise from 12 percent to 17 percent over the
same period. GRAIP should be able to generate sufficient funds from
operations to finance its working capital needs. Total projected cash
generation by 1990 is Cedi 1,770 million (US$10.7 million) of which Cedi 850
million (US$5.1 million) will serve to retire long-term debt and the balance
Cedis 920 million (US$5.6 million) to finance net working capital increases.
3.18     Debt Servicing.  Assuming that the new processing fee would take
effect from 1988 onwards, GHAIP's debt servicing ratios will remain at
acceptable levels. Debt service coverage is projected to improve from 1.0 in
1987 to 1.4 in 1988 and 2.4 in 1992.
(c) Financial Covenants for GHAIP
3.19     CHAIP has agreed that it will (a) maintain a debt service coverage of
at least 1.4 in 1988 and 1.5 in 1989 and onward; (b) maintain a current ratio
of at least 1.0 in 1988 and at least 1.1 thereafter; and (c) pay no dividends
during the project construction period. In addition, it will review with IDA
every year beginning 1988 its rolling three-year investment program. As
stated in para 3.05, the Government and GHAIP have agreed that, beginning in



- 25 -
1988, the refinery processing margin will be adjusted periodically taking into
consideration the financial viability of CHAIP, the prevailing comparable
international levels, and international market prices for crude and petroleum
products.
C. The Ghana Oil CoIpany Limited
1. Organization
3.20     COIL was established in 1960 under The Company Code as Agip Ghana
Company Ltd., with share capital wholly-owned by AGIP s.p.a. and SNAM s.p.a.
Its main business is marketing of petroleum products in Ghana. In 1974, the
Government concluded negotiations with AGIP and SNAM for the purchase of all
the company's share-, and COIL became wholly-owned by the Government.
3.21     The general direction of the Company's operations is set by the Board
of Directors, which comprises of not more than nine members. The Board
delegates the responsibility for the day-to-day operations to a Managing
Director. As in the case of GAIP (para. 3.03), its Board was abolished in
1983 and a Joint Consultative Committee was appointed to act in lieu of the
Board. This committee, which consists of seven members including the General
Manager, two department managers, two senior satff and two junior staff, meets
once every two months. The Committee consists entirely of COIL staff, and
thus lacks outside views and advice. COIL's decision making process would be
strengthened with the reappointment of a proper Board of Directors. This
aspect, among others, will be examined in the management improvement study
elaborated in para. 3.04.
3.22     The Managing Director is assisted by six department managers for
operations, commercial, fianuce, personnel, solicitor/secretary, and internal
auditing. Under the commercial department, there are four regional offices
responsible for the commercial operations in their respective geographical
areas. The organization structure of COIL is shown in Annex 3-8.
3.23     As discussed in para. 3.04, the organization structure and staffing
of COIL is being reviewed as part of the management improvement study to be
carried out in connection with the Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical
Assistance Project. The Government has agreed that the study report will be
jointly reviewed with IDA and that a plan of action for implementing the
recommendations will be agreed with IDA by December 31, 1987.
2. Management and Staff
3.24     COIL's top management was apparently welL experienced.  However, the
Managing Director's position recently became vacant. Agreement would be
sought during the negotiations that the Government will appoint before credit
effectiveness a Managing Director with the necessary qualifications and
experience in oil marketing.
3.25     COIL has a total staff of about 400 including some 70 at supervising
levels. The staff seem well motivated. The turnover rate is low at around
5%. Although the COIL's managers and staff seem to perform their work well in
accordance with the company's practices which were established in early years
under Agip management, they need to be exposed to the more modern practices of



- 26 -
the leading oil marketing companies elsewhere in the world. The proposed
project includes provision for a training program particularly for COIL
managers to attend short courses overseas preferably with international oil
marketing companies (para. 4.10). COIL has prepared the details of the
proposed training program satisfactory to IDA.
3. Accounts and Audit
3.26     COIL's accounting and management information systems, which were
originally implemented by Agip, are acceptable; nevertheless, they could be
improved especially with regards to cost accounting, financial planning and
control. The accounting system is partially computerized and would be fully
automated with the computing facilities to be provided under the proposed
project. Improvements with regard to the accounting and financial management
aspects are to be dealt with in the management improvement study (para. 3.04)
3.27     GOIL's accounts are normally up-to-date except for 1984 when the
financial manager's position was vacant. The annual accounts are audited by
Pannell, Kerr and Forster, a private auditing firm, and are of satisfactory
quality. COIL has agreed that its annual accounts will continue to be audited
by qualified external auditors and that the audited accounts, together with
the auditors' report, will be submitted to IDA not later than six months after
the cloie of the year.
'f.. GOIL's Finances
(a) Past Operating Results and Financial Position
3.28     GOIL's operating results and financial position for the period 1981-

3.29     In the face of rising prices and the successive devaluations of the
Cedi, GOIL has been able to maintain comfortable distribution margins of over
5 of sales from 1981 to 1983. This margin was substantially higher in 1984
due to a twofold increase of petroleum products retail prices in line with the
Government policy of maintaining prices in relations to international levels,
and GOIL's high inventories purchased at lower prices the year before. This
however was accompanied by more than a proportional increase of accounts
receivable which were about 900 million Cedis due by several Government
agencies at the end of 1985. The Government has initiated discussions
involving MFP and the Central Bank to resolve this issue '--solution of this
issue is part of the ongoing structural adjustment credi: * .-ration.  The
Government has confirmed under this project that it will ensure that all
arrears between COIL and other state-owned enterprises will be settled with a
timetable acceptable to IDA.

3.31     Sales Revenue.   GOIL's total sales volume for all products in 1986
is estimated to reach 175,000 MT, about 4% higher than in 1985. Sales are
expected to increase at an average annual rate of 6.5Z approximately over the
next 10 years. In line with the Government policy of concentrating on diesel
transport vehiclesp diesel consumption has been assumed to increase by 10%
annually while other products except gasoline to increase by 2.51 annually.
3.32     Liquidity.  GOIL's liquidity position will remain within acceptable
levels with a current ratio of over 1.0 during 1987-92 even with a dividend
payout ratio of 60% of net income after providing for a 201 reserve assumed in
the projections.
3.33     Leverage.  While GOIL has been able to maintain its margins in the
face of rising inflation, the value of its fixed assets which were still
carried at book value until the end of 1985 have been eroded. This has
resulted in an undervalued equity position and high leverage ratios. COIL's
management has decided to revalue certain fixed assets; as at December 1986,
land property with a book value of Cedis 6.9 million was written up to Cedis
372.3 million and plant and machinery with a book value of Cedis 3.8 million
was written up to Cedis 656.2 million. As a result of new long-term
borrowing, the equity/debt ratio will fall from 44/56 in 1986 to 24/66 upon
Dorier ;et elat,;nn ; n 1 qn-



- 29 -
3.34     Cash Generation.  It is expected that GOIL will maintain relatively
high margins with a ratio of operating income/sales of 7.0% on average from
1987 onwards. Net income/sales will remain above 2*7% even upon project
start-up when it will have to face high interest payments on its new long-term
commitments. The projections indicate that COIL would be able to generate
sufficient funds from operations to finance the local cost component of the
project and increased working capital needs. Total cash generation by 1990 is
projected at Cedi 2,070 million (US$12.6 million) of which Cedi 730 million
(US$4.5 million) would cover the capital expenditures while the balance would
finance increases in net working capital amounting to Cedis 600 million
(US$3.6 million) and dividends totalling Cedi 740 million (US$4.5 million).
3.35     Debt Servicing.  Since COIL is currently free from long-term debt,
its debt servicing ratios are projected to remain at very satisfactory
levels. Debt service coverage is projected to be 10.1 in 1988 declining to
2.3 in 1991, but increasing to 2.6 in 1992 and onwards.
(c) Financial Covenants for COIL
3.36     COIL has agreed that it will maintain a debt service coverage of at
least 1.5 and a current ratio of at least 1.1 in 1988 and thereafter. In
addition, it will review with IDA every year beginning 1988, its rolling
three-year investment program.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Genesis
4.01     The proposed project is the result of continuous discussions with the
Government on the petroleum sector. Its preparation has served as an
important vehicle for dialogue with the Government on certain key policy
issues such as the rationalization of the investment program in petroleum
refining and distribution, the strengthening of the commercial orientation of
the state-owned GUAIP's and COIL's operations and promotion of the private
sector investment in the marketing subsector. A Bank mission that visited
Ghana for the Public Expenditures Review in June 1985, reviewed with the
Government all investment options studied by the consultants, BEICIP, under
the ongoing Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project (Credit
1446-GH), in the petroleum refining, supply and distribution sector in order
to identify their relative priorities. As a result of these discussions, the
Government agreed to postpone a large investment for secondary conversion
facilities (US$85-130 million) in the Tema refinery. The rehabilitation of
the facilities for product storage, distribution, and marketing was recognized
as urgently required and of high priotity for investment. Other priority
investments also identified were facilities for marketing all the LPG that can
be produced without additional investment in the refinery; for marketing
essential petroleum products in the remote locations of the country; and for
transportation of products via Volta Lake to the northern regions. Subsequent
IDA missions assisted the Government and the entities concerned (MFP, CHAIP,
GOIL, VRA,VLTC) in defining the detailed scope and costs of the proposed
project.

B. Project Objectives
4.02     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(i)   to rationalize the investment plan in the petroleum refining
and distribution subsector which results in least cost to the
economy;
(ii)   to increase the reliability and reduce the cost of supply and
distribution of petroleum products in the country by
improving the operating efficiency of the Tema refinery
through additional LPG recovery and energy conservation
measures, and rehabilitating/ameliorating the existing oil
distribution and marketing facilities;
(iii)   to further reduce oil pollution related to Tema refinery
operations to normal industry standards through installation
of an API separator (to separate and collect traces of oil
from refinery effluent water);
( iv)   to establish a new and economic mode and a backbone for bulk
transport of petroleum products -- via Volta lake -- to the
northern regions of Ghana and potentially to its neighboring
countries;
(v)   to improve the movement of agriculturil products in the
remote areas by bringing diesel and kerosene to such areas;
(vi)   to counter deforestation with the increased availability of
LPG and kerosene;
(vii)   to restructure the operating/earning basis of the Tema
refinery that would encourage it to operate more efficiently
and to rationalize the responsibility for bulk crude
procurement/bulk marketing of petroleum products; and
(viii)  to strengthen the organization, management and operating
practices of the sectoral entities involved (GHAIP and GOIL)
and to ensure rhat they operate on commercial basis.
C. Project Description
4.03     The proposed project comprises the following components:
(i) Completion of the ongoing rehabilication of the Tera Refinery
of GHAIP (under Credit 1446-GH) particularly offsite
facilities, utility systems, LPG handling, product shipping
facilities and energy efficiency improvement of the existing
distillation unit, and acquisition of vehicles;
(ii) rehabilitation of GOIL's bulk petroleum storage depots
located at Takoradi and Kumasi;
(iii)  rehabilitation of GOIL's existing network of retail outlets;



- 31 -
(iv) expansion of the infrastructure and increase availability of
LPG bottles and stoves to market additional LPG that could be
made available from the Tema refinery;
(v) provision of storage tanks and transfer facilities at
Akosombo and Buipe (i.e. land side facilities) to transport
petroleum products on the Volta Lake towards the northern
parts of the country;
(vi) provision of oil jetties at Akosombo and Buipe, petroleum
barges and tug boat (i.e. water side facilities);
(vii) provision of transport vehicles to move LPG avd other
petroleum products and for the project management;
(viii) provision of facilities for farmer's service reseller outlets
to make essential petroleum products (mainly kerosene and
diesel) to the farmers in remote areas; and
(ix) training of GOIL's managerial and operational personnel and
computer facility for COIL.
These projects components are further elaborated in the following paragraphs.
1.   Rehabilitation of GHAIP's Tema Refinery Facilities
4.04     The ongoing Refinery Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Project
jointly financed by IDA (Credit 1446-GH) and EIB is expected to be completed
by December 1987. Due to the limited financing available at that time,
certain items recommended for rehabilitation and energy conservation by the
consultants (BEICIP) had to be postponed; these items would be implemente4
under the proposed project, including:
(a)  Improvements in LPG treatment, storage and transfer facilities:
The existing LPG treating facilities do not have caustic
coalescer or sand filter resulting in high carry over of caustic
soda to the storage tanks. A number of fittings in the LPG
storage tanks and truck and marine loading facilities need
replacement and/or improvement in order to maintain good safety
requirements. Existing LPG transfer lines to COIL depot and
jetty require repairs and replacement. Under the proposed
project, necessary hardware required to rectify these
shortcomings will be procured and installed;
(b) API oil separator: A new API separator with air floatation
facilities will be installed to improve environmental protection
facilities in the refinery (para. 4.25);
(c) Improvement in furnace efficiency: The flue gas leaving the
furnace of the crude distillation unit has temperatures above
450°C causing high energy loss from the furnace. To rectify
this deficiency, the furnace will be provided with new efficient
burners, and its convection section will be modified to transfer
additional heat to the crude oil.



- 32 -
(d) Product vigelines: Existing crude and product pipelines from
the refinery to jetty are corroded at places where they are
buried0 These corroded portions will be replaced, and the pipes
will be laid overground to prevent such corrosion in the future;
(e) Jet fuel tankst Three existing jet fuel tanks will be repaired
and provided with cone roof with internal floating screens to
reduce vaporizatiots losses;
(f) Boiler improvement: The three existing boiler drums will be
provided with mist eliminators to prevent carry over of water
from the steam drums that was causing super heater tube rupture,
premature shutdowns and increased maintenance costs;
(g) Fire alarm sz8tem: As a safety precaution, a fire alarm system
will be provided in the refinery;
(h) Chlorination system: In order to reduce seawater fouling of
plpes and exchanger tubes, chlorination facility, which includes
chlorine generation, and continuous and shock chlorine
injection, will be provided;
5i) Crane: In order to facilitate removal and repairs of heat-
exchangers, condensers, etc. and to reduce overall maintenance
time, a 27-ton crane will be provided; and
(j) Laboratory Instruments: Certain urgently required laboratory
equipment instrument for sampling and measurement of
environmental pollutants in the wastewater leaviLng the refinery,
and instrument workshop items are also included in the project
scope.
2.   Rehabilitation of GOIL's Bulk Petroleum Depots at Takoradi and
Kumasi
4.05     GOIL's facilities over the years, like those of other public sector
companies, have been badly maintained due to serious shortages of foreign
exchange. The proposed project would thus provide funds for the accumulated
backlog rehabilitation and maintenance requirements. In the Takoradi denot,
replacement of firefighting water pumps with drives, product shipment pumps
with drives and motor control centers, truck loading arms, new facilities for
collection and safe disposal of oil and oil contaminated wastes, and repairs
of the rail loading gantry with suitable arrangements for collecting oil
spillage are required. In the Kumasi depot, replacement of firefighting water
pumps with drives; product shipment pumps with drives and motor control
center, truck loading arms, safety precautionary measures for the LPC storage
and filling areas, and new facilities for collection and safe disposal of oil
and oil contaminated wastes are required.
3.    Rehabilitation of Retail Outlets
4.06     As mentioned in para. 4.05, the proposed project would provide funds
mainly to cover GOIL's accumulated rehabilitation requirements. Specifically,



- 33 -
replacement/repairs of dispensang pump meters; replacement of air compressors,
pneumatic hoists, lubrication facilities, and, in a few cases, replacement of
underground storage tanks are required for the rehabilitation of the GOIL's
retail outlets. Foreign exchange provided under this project (about US$2.2
millio.') for the distribution outlets is intended to cover the overhang of
accumulated maintenance requirements and improve GOIL's operating and
maintenance systems and procedures. For the recurring maintenance, GOIL would
buy the foreign exchange from the auction market out of its operation cash
flow in the same way as any private oil company would. To prevent
deterioration of the facilities in the future, the project provides for
training GOIL management and personnel, establishment of an operation and
mainteaance programs and procedures, and appropriate monitoring system to
ensure that COIL's maintenance needs are met. In order to maintain a well-
balanced distribution network throughout the country after the rehabilitation,
it is also necessary to provide spares and materials for the facilities of the
private oil companies at specified locations. The Government has provided the
required foreign exchange for this purpose through the foreign exchange
auction so that the private oil companies could purchase the spares and
materials for rehabilitating their facilities.
4.    Expansion of LPG Marketing Facilities
4.07     Safety relief valves and facilities for fire protection in the
existing LPG storage and filling plants of COIL are not adequate. Necessary
equipment and materials to rectify this deficiency are included in this
component. In order to market the additional 6,000 MT per year of LPG readily
available from the refinery, three filling plants at Accra, Takoradi and
Kumasi would be installed and additional LPG bottles, regulators and table top
stoves would be provided. For the safe operation of the filling plant and
maintaining safety of the LPG bottles, necessary spares and equipment for
testing and repairs are also included. Additional bulk transport vehicles and
pick-up trucks are provided for the bulk transportation of LPG and
distribution of LPG bottles.
5.    Petroleum Product Transportation on Volta Lake
4.08     Tank truck unloading facilities and storage depot consisting of one
tank each for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel; interconnecting pipes and pipe
fittings; safety equipment; and oil spill collection and disposal facilities,
are required at Akosombo. A similar storage depot, truck loading facilities,
interconnecting pipes and pipe fittings, safety e4uipment, oil spill
collection and disposal facilities are required at Buipe. Essential utilities
such as electricity, and water will be purchased from VLTC/VRA facilities.
VL1C/VRA will also provide, with financial assistance from KfW (para. 4.11),
separate oil jetty facilities at Akosombo and Buipe, and separate petroleum
barges for carrying the products over the Volta Lake. The works at Akosombo
and Buipe are shown in the Maps (IBRD-20018 and 20019) at the end of this
report.
4.09     VLTC/VRA with financial assistance from the Federal Republic of
Germany through KfW has developed jetty facilities and navigational aids for
general cargo movement over the Volta Lake from Akosombo to Buipe. For the
petroleum product movement, VLTC/VRA will provide separate oil jetties, two
petroleum barges and one pusher tug (i.e. water-side facilities) for which the



- 34 -
foreign exchange cost of US$8.7 million will be financed by KfW, and VLTC/VRA
will provide the local cost of US$1.1 million. The Government has confirmed
that the water-side facilities will be provided for the Volta Lake petroleum
transport system by December 31, 1989, and that an agreement between VLTC and
GOIL for the bulk transport of petroleum products will be finaiized by
December 31, 1987.
6.    Farmers' Service Reseller Outlets
4.10     Two small overground storage tanks mounted with hand pumps for
kerosene and diesel, essential safety equipment and a small office facilities
are required for each of the farmers' service reseller outlets. The outlets
would be constructed by COIL and would be owned and operated by local
agricultural cooperatives or private individuals. Each outlet is estimated to
cost about US$8,000 according to standard design prepared by COIL and
acceptable to IDA. IDA funds are required only for the purchase of steel
plates, pipes, hand pumps and safety equipment. The socio-economic impact of
these facilities is expected to be substantial since they are intended to
provide the most essential requirement of the farmers in the rural areas. The
proposed project includes about 125 pilot stations in different regions for
the time being. The program would be expanded if this pilot scheme proves
successful. The Government has agreed to evaluate the socio-economic impact
of this pitot scheme and prepare an evaluation report for review with IDA not
later than two menths after its completion but not later than June 30, 1989.
7.    Training for COIL Personnel and Computer Facilities
4.11     Being a Government-owned entity without external assistance, GOIL's
personnel in charge of supply and distribution are not exposed to modern
techniques used elsewhere in the industry. Courses covering up to date
practices in petroleum marketing; operation and maintenance of facilities used
in the industry; safety regulations and environmental protection measures used
in the industry, and petroleum measurements and accounting practices will be
organized by experienced agencies. A few key personnel will be given on-the-
job training and exposure in well established petroleum installations abroad
as part of the training scheme (para. 3.25). For the purpose of GOIL's
managment improvement, a suitable computer and essential peripherals will be
provided under the proposed project.
D. Project Management and Implementation
4.12     GRAIP would be responsible for the implementation of the
rehabilitation of its Tema refinery facilities (project component (i) in para.
4.03). The implementation of other project components, items (ii) through
(ix) except for (vi) in para 4.03, would be handled by COIL. With regard to
the Volta Lake transport system, while the land-side facilities (storage tanks
and transfer facilities) are implemented by COIL, the water-side facilities
(item (vi) in para. 4.03), as elaborated in paras. 4.08 and 4.09 at Akosombo
and Buipe would be implemented by VLTC/VRA as an addition to its ongoing
co;-struction of Akosombo/Buipe port facilities.
4.13     GRAIP will implement its portion of the proposed project through an
existing Project Unit which was established in connection with the ongoing
first phase refinery rehabilitation (Credit 1446-CH) and with the assistance



- 35 -
of engineering consultants provided under the proposed project. CIAIP has
agreed to maintain the Project Unit at least until the completion of the
proposed second phase refinery rehabilitation. It will also retain
engineering consultants (around 33 man-months) on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA to assist in the implementation of.this project component.
GHAIP intends to employ BEICIP, the engineering consultant currently working
on the first phase refinery rehabilitation, for the necessary design,
preparation of bid documents and evaluation as well as project supervision.
This arrangement is adequate and an addendum to the existing BEICIP contract
would be submitted to IDA for approval.
4.14     As discussed with IDA at the time of appraisal. COIL has set up a
Project Unit to be responsible for the implementation o` its project
components. This Project Unit, which is coriposed of a mechanical engineer, a
civil engineer, a project accountant and a procurement officer, will be
assisted by an experienced engineer consultant (Advisor) for a period of about
two years provided for under the proposed project. The mission was satisfied
that COIL, with this technical assistance to its Project Unit, is sufficiently
equipped to implement the rehabilitation components (project components (ii)
and (iii), para 4.03) which are of relatively routine maintenance nature, as
well as straightforward procurement of other project items including LPG
bottles and stoves, trucks, etc. (components (iv), (vii), (viii), (ix), para
4.03). In fact, COIL has satisfactorily carried out work of this nature in
the past. However, COIL would need technical assistance for the
implementation of the land-side Volta Lake petroleum transport facilities
(project component (v), para 4.03). Thus, COIL has agreed that it will employ
engineering consulting services (around 30 man-months) under terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA for the detailed design, preparation of bid
documents and evaluation and construction supervision for the storage depots
and handling facilities at Akosombo and Buipe. Some of the civil works needed
for the implementation of the water side facilities (project component (vi),
para 4.03) at Akosombo and Buipe carried out by VLTC/VRA with their
engineering consultants and contractors is currently ongoing. COIL and
VLTC/VRA have maintained close coordination in the implementation of the Volta
Lake petroleum transport system.
4.15     Contracting Arrangements.  The rehabilitation of the Tema refinery
facilities would involve a number of contracts including an extension of an
existing BEICIP engineering contract (para. 4.13), a supply and erection
contract for the distillation furnace convection section (para. 4.16) for
which a contractor (Foster Wheeler, France) has been selected on the basis of
international competitive bidding, and various small supply and/or erection
contracts to be tendered internationally or locally as appropriate. With
regard to COIL's facilities at Akosombo and Buipe, in addition to the
engineering consultancy contract mentioned in para. 4.14, GOIL will employ a
contractor for the construction of these facilities. In view of the small
amount and geographical location of the works, this contract would be tendered
among internationally experienced contractors currently engaged in other
projects in Ghana. Rehabilitation of COIL's oil depots and retail outlets
would be implemented by the company's own technical services team
complemented, where necessary, by local contractors to be financed by GOIL and
selected through local competitive bidding. The work involved is mostly
replacement of worn out equipment and parts and minor civil works. Since the
specifications are already available from original suppliers and no design and



- 36 -
engineering is involved, COIL with the assistance of the Advisor provided
under the project (para. 4.14) should be able to organize and implement the
work in an efficient manner.
E. Project Schedule
4.16     Most of the components included in the proposed project involves
procurement of items that require very little engineering and could be
completed within 18 months of credit effectiveness. However, a few items
involve design, engineering and fabrication an4 would take 24 months for
completion. The implementation schedule for various components of the
proposed project is shown in Annex 4-1. CHAIP discovered during its regular
6-week shut down inspection at the time of the appraisal that one item in the
proposed project, namely the rehabilitation/modification of the distillation
furnace convection section, needs to be implemented without delay at the time
of the next scheduled shutdown in October/November 1987. Since the
procurement of hardware takes about nine months, GRAIP has proceeded with
advance implementation of this work in accordance with Bank/IDA procurement
guidelines (para. 4.15); the foreign exchange expenditures estimated at US$0.8
million as from January 1, 1987 but prior to credit signing, would be
retroactively financed from the proposed IDA credit.
F. Project Cost Estimates
4.17     The estimated total cost of the proposed project is about US$36.3
million. This includes US$9.8 million for the water-side facilities (jetties,
petroleum barges and pusher tug) for the Volta Lake petroleum transport
component to be financed by KfW (US$8.7 million equivalent for foreign
exchange cost) and VLTC (US$1.1 million equivalent for local cost). Foreign
exchange costs would be equivalent to about US$28.2 million, or 78 percent of
the total project cost. The cost estimates are detailed in Annex 4-2 and
summarized below:

4.18     The cost estimates are considered to be realistic.  They are
exclusive of duties and taxes. They were prepared by the consultants on the
basis of the contracts awarded by CHAIP under the ongoing project, and the
quotations that CHAIP and GOIL have obtained from potential suppliers. The
estimated cost included a physical contingency of 11 percent and price
escalation for foreign costs based on the international inflation rates in
dollar terms of 3 percent in 1987g 1 percent per annum in 1988 through 1990,
domestic inflation rates of 18 percent in 1987, 15 percent in 1988, 10 percent
in 1989 and 7 percent in 1990, and exchange rates per US$1.0 of Cedi 165 in
1987, Cedi 180 in 1988 and 187 in 1989 and onwards.
G.   Financing Plan
4.19     The proposed IDA credit of US$15 million equivalent would meet
53 percent of the foreign exchange and 41 percent of the total financing
required. The proposed financing plan is summarized in the following table.

4.20     The proposed IDA credit would be made to the Government to be onlent
to GHAIP and GOIL. Of the total IDA credit of US$15 million, US$1.7 million
would be onlent to GHAIP and US$13.3 million to GOIL. The onlending terms
would be for 15 years including a grace period of 3 years at interest rate
equal to 1.1 times the prevailing IBRD interest rate (presently 7.92%). The
foreign exchange risks would be borne by GHAIP and GOIL. The onlending
agreements between the Government and GHAIP/GOIL will be finalized before
credit effectiveness. GOIL would finance local costs of US$5.0 million
equivalent from its internal cash generation. Interests during construction



- 39 -
would be financed by GOIL, but capitalized for CHAIP. The water-side
facilities (jetties, barges ant pusher tug) at Akosombo and Buipe would be
financed by KfW and VLTC/VRA (paras. 4.08 and 4.09).
4.21     EIB has committed to provide US$6.5 million equivalent to bridge the
foreign exchange financing gap for the refinery rehabilitation estimated at
around US$4.5 million equivalent and related local costs amounting to
US$2.0 million equivalent.
H. Procurement
4.22     The procurement of various equipment and materials to be financed by
IDA that are not proprietary items or need not match with existing equipment
(the specific items would be firmed up with EIB before the negotiations) would
be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. The rest would be purchased by direct contracting amounting to
US$0.4 million for the engineering consultants (BEICIP), who are currently
assisting GHAIP in the implementation of the ongoing first phase refinery
rehabilitation; Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) for civil works related to the
refinery and '0IL's land-side facilities at Akosombo and Buipe and for certain
specialized items to match with existing components. Also, small items
(costing up to US$50,000) would be procured under contracts awarded after
obtaining at least three quotations from reputable suppliers (up to a maximum
of US$0.5 million). There will be an advance contracting up to US$1.0 million
equivalent (paras. 4.15 and 4.16). Project items to be financed by
eofinanciers are expected to be procured in accordance with their
guidelines. Procurement arrangements for the over all financing and for the
proposed IDA credit are summarized in the table below.

I. Allocation and Disbursement of IDA credit
4.23     The allocation of the proposed IDA credit is shown in the table
below. The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA
credit, shown in Annex 4-3, has been based on the implementation schedules for
individual project components to be financed under the credit, given that
there is no previous disbursement profile for this type of projects. This
schedule is considered realistic given the advanced status of preparation by
CHAIP for project implementation, and the fact that a substantial amount of
equipment and materials would be purchased off the shelves. To facilitate
project implementation, the Government and IDA have agreed for CHAIP and COIL
to open Special Accounts in respective amounts of US$200,000 and US$750,000 to
be used for expenditures made by them under the proposed project. The
accounts will be held in a commercial bank, and operated on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association. Withdrawal applications will be
submitted with full supporting documents, except for payments against civil
works contracts of less than $100,000 equivalent, owher contracts of less than
$50,000 equivalent, and individual training programs, which will be reimbursed
on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents
related to SOEs will be retained in a central location by CHAIP of GOIL, AnM
made available for review by visiting missions.  Aa part of the annual audit
of each implementing agency, auditors will specifically review accounts and
documents related to amounts withdrawn on the basis of SOEs, and give their
opinion on the adequacy of these records.

J. Environmental and Safety Aspeets
4.24     In general, environmental pollution from petroleum refining could
occur through gaseous effluent and liquid waste. Gaseous effluent consists of
high sulfur gases containing hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans that escape into
the atmosphere and flue gases from process furnaces, boilers and refinery
flare system. Liquid waste released from the refinery, if not treated
properly, could contain traces of oil, phenolic compounds, and derivatives of
chromium, depending on the technical treatment and process configuration
employed in the refinery. Temn refinery, as described in para. 2.15, is a
simple hydro-skimming refinery processing low sulfur Nigerian Bonny light
crude oil without any complicated chemical treatment or cracking unit. Since
the refinery does not process any high sulfur crude, the production of
unacceptable level of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur oxides through the fuel
burned in the furnaces, boilers and flare system does not exist. Therefore,
no treatment for the gaseous effluent from the refinery is required.
Similarly, in the absence of chemical treatment using chromium chemical and
cracking unit, the refinery wastewater does not contain any toxic compounds
such as phenolic chronium deratives, arsonic, etc.
4.25     The only significant pollutant the refinery releases through its
wastewater is traces of oil. The existing oil separation facilities
(generally called API separator) is outmoded and is not effective in
collecting oil from the refinery wastewater at level acceptable to industry
norms. It was noted that Ghana has no regulatory limit for oil content
admissible in the refinery wastewater and that the refinery was not keeping
records of the extent of oil relea"ed through wastewater. Since the water
ultimately flows to the sea near the harbor, the accumulated effect of the oil
over the years potentially could endanger marine life in the area. Since
there are no other refinery or oil processing facilities (petrochemical
plants) in the area, the existing level of pollution is not in an alarming
proportion. Nevertheless, as recommended by the appraisal mission, GHAIP
agreed to install a modern API separator to remove the oil from the refinery
wastewater to levels normally acceptable to industry standard (less than 30
parts per million). This API separator will be designed and constructed as
per standards laid down by the American Petroleum Institute. Biological



- 42 -
oxygen demand (BOD) is another quality that is not being maintained in the
wastewater from the refinery. At the suggestion of the mission, suitable
facilities are included in the proposed project to control the BOD as per
industry norm. The API separator and the equipment to measure/monitor the BOD
in the refinery wastewater are funded under the project (para. 4.04 (b)).
GHAIP has agreed to measure the oil content and BOD in the refinery wastewater
on a regular basis and maintain them at limits as per appropriate US
Environmental Protection Agency standard or its equivalent and to report these
data in the quarterly reports to be submitted to IDA (para. 4.27).
4.26     All the components of the proposed project are planned with
environmental and safety aspects meeting API standards and/or World Bank
environmental guidelines whichever stricter. Replacement of corroded crude
and product lines connecting the oil jetty would reduce oil pollution of the
environment to the normal industry standards. Similarly, rehabilitation of
the Takoradi and Kumasi depots would reduce the oil spills from these depots
to normal industry standards. In designing the Volta Lake transport system
and additional LPG marketing facilities, all necessary precautions would be
taken to limit environmental pollution and maintain safety standards that
would meet normal industry practices. Increased LPG marketing would reduce
deforestation since it would replace about 24,000 MT per year of wood fuel and
charcoal.
K. Project Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
4.27     Various indicators for monitoring project implementation and the
operations of CHAIP and GOIL (Annex 4-4) have been agreed with GHAIP and
COIL. These would be included in the requiremerts for GHAIP's and GOIL's
periodic (quarterly) progress reports to IDA. The Government, CHAIP and GOIL
have also agreed that within three months after the completion of the project,
they will jointly prepare a "Project Completion Report" on the basis of an
outline to be agreed with IDA.
4.28     As part of the Government's strucutral adjustment program, 14
priority SOEs with major budget and fiscal impact will be expected to prepare
corporate plans for review by Government and to negotiate performance
agreements (based on the plans) with Government setting out SOE's objectives,
performance targets, performance incentives, and levels of Government
financing (if any). The pet formance agreements are designed to increase
managerial autonomy in day-to-day operations while also increasing
accountability to Government through setting performance targets and providing
incentives based on actual results. Preparation and implementation of the
corporate plans on an agreed timetable for the 14 priority SOEs is an agreed
action under the structural adjustment program. Satisfactory progress is a
condition of the SAL second tranche release. In accordance with this
timetable, GHAIP and COIL have agreed to prepare corporate plans for 1988-90
by December 31, 1987, and conclude performance agreements with the Government
based on these plans by June 30, 1988 and implement them thereafter.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Project Justification
1. Sectoral and Institutional Objectives
5.01     Prom the sectoral perspective, the proposed project with its various
components represents the most logical and urgently required investment in
Ghana's petroleum supply and distribution sector. The proposed project,
particularly the rehabilitation components, would correct the present
dilapidated conditien of GOIL's supply and distribution facilities which
threatens to disrupt the vital supply of petroleum products to end users.
These rehabilitation requirements have been accumulated over the past years
due to the country's severe shortages of foreign exchange; future maintenance
work would be carried out as part of the companies' normal operation. A
disruption of the petroleum supply most likely would have serious effect
across the sectors of the Ghanaian economy. The proposed project would also
establish and start up a new cost effective petroleum transport mode via Volta
Lake, thus laying a framework for supplying petroleum products to Ghana's
northern regions and potentially to its neighboring countries such as Burkina
Faso, Northern Togot etc.
5.02     The proposed project emerged from fruitful dialogues between the
Government and the Bank on the development strategies and investment plans for
the petroleum supply and distribution sector. It is indeed a part of the
"core" public investment program discussed and supported by the Bank through
public expenditure review and energy assessment exercises (paras. 1.02 and
4.01). In addition, through the development of the project, the Government
recognized the need to promote private sector investment in the petroleum
distribution sector and was prepared to provide foreign exchange through
budgetary allocation to the private oil marketing companies operating in Ghana
to purchase spare parts and materials for their maintenance requirements.
Such provisions were no longer necessary with the institution of the auction
scheme in September 1986, through which these companies can obtain the
required fnreign exchange (paras. 1.03 and 406).
503     Prom the institutional standpoint, the proposed project would enhance
the commercial orientation of the operations of GHAIP and COIL and would
rationalize the responsibiliy of bulk procurement of crude/bulk marketing of
products by transfering it to CHAIP. It would further improve the efficiency
of CHAIP's Tema refinery operations by strengthening the crude oil procurement
function and restructuring the operating/earning basis for the Tema refinery
operation by setting the processing margin on a periodic basis in a manner
that would encourage the refinery to operate at maximum efficiency and, at the
same time, ensure that CHAIP maintain sufficient financial strength to upkeep
and modernize its facilities in the long run. The transfer of bulk crude
procurement responsibility to CHAIP would give the refinery the flexibility of
processing possible crude slates that would yield more economic product
patterns taking into account the country's petroleum product requirements.
The proposed project would expose GOIL's managerial staff to the current
practices of the international oil marketing companies with a view to
improving the management of their own operations.

2. Economic Returns
5.04     The proposed project has components which are mainly intended to
rehabilitate the existing facilities, increase the safety aspects especially
against fire hazards, and effect pollution control. Justification for such
components should be mainly on the basis of safe operating practices and the
needs for environmental protection. Wherever the operational efficiency is
increased to effect improved productivity and reduce cost, it is taken into
account in evaluating the economic viability of the investment. For the
economic evaluation, the project components are regrouped and their economic
returns are estimated as follows:
Project Components                               Economic Return(%)
(i)   Refinery Rehabilitation                               24
(ii)   Rehabilitation of retail outlets,
depots and additional transport vehicles              24
(ii)  Farmer's Service Retail Outlets                        26
(iv)   Volta Lake transportation facilities                  18
(v)   LPG production and distribution                       19
5.05     It has also been calculated that compared to road transport, the
Volta Lake petroleum transport system would result in a net savings of about
US$2 million a year to the economy (assuming an annual cargo of 50,000 MT).
Details of the above economic return calculations are shown in Annex 5-1.
3. CHAIP's Tema Refinery Operating Economics
5.06     The proposed rehabilitation of the Tema Refinery presupposes that the
refinery operation is economic. Assessment of the refinery economics has thus
been carried out as elaborated in Annex 5-2. The economics of the Tema
refinery hinges largely on: (i) the type of crude mix that would best meet
the domestic white product requirement and, at the same time, minimize the
production of .esidual fuel oil (to be re-exported at very low prices); (ii)
the extent that fuel consumption and hydrocarbon losses in the refining
process could be reduced; and (iii) the savings on transport costs, resulting
from lower freight costs for bringing crude oil to Ghana from nearby Nigeria
compared to bringing finished petroleum products from Western Europe. As
shown in Annex 5-2, the operating economics have been assessed under different
historical crude and product prices scenariosp which indicateq that the
refinery operation would be economic at prevailing crude and product prices in
the past even when refinery fuel consumption and hydrocarbon losses were
assumed at the present rate of 6% on crude. Another way to assess the
economic viablity of Tema refinery operation is to compare its refinery margin
per barrel after taking account the transportation advantage (savings
resulting from bringing crude from nearby Nigeria in lieu of finished products
from northwest Europe/Middle East) accrued to the economy with the
differential between crude and product FOB prices (say Rotterdam) per



- 45 -
composite barrel. As shown in Annex 5-2S over the past 12 years except for
the period 1979-81 when the market was destabilized, this differential between
crude and product prices per barrel varied between US$2.28 and US$4.68, which
was above the Tema refinery breakeven margin (including transport savings) of
US$0.95 per barrel. Thus Tema refinery operation has been economically
viable. In the future, while the operating economics of the refinery would
greatly depend on the movements of crude and product prices, it is certain
that the refinery's operational efficiency would improve due to the
rehabilitation and energy conservation improvement achieved under the ongoing
project (Credit 1446-GH) as well as the proposed project, which when
completed, would further reduce the fuel consumption and losses to about 51 on
crude throughput.
B. Project Risks
5.07     Since the project preparation is well-advanced and the project
components are identified with specific details, no major risk is anticipated
in the implementation of the proposed project. Three major components of the
project-rehabilitation of the GHAIP's Tema refinery, GOIL's depots at Takoradi
and Kumasi, and GOIL's retail outlet facilities - are existing facilities in
continuous operation with reasonable economic viability, especially if the
investments in the existing facilities are considered sunk cost. Rehabili-
tation of these facilities would increase the operating efficiency of these
facilities and consequently their economic and financial viability.
5.08.    In view of the currently unmet demand for LPC and high price for
charcoal, no difficulty is expected to market the additional LPG (about 6,000
MT per year) once the proposed facilities are established. Since the
additional production is out of gases burned in the refinery furnaces and
flare stack, there is also no uncertainty about its availability. Investments
proposed for the farmer's service reseller outlets have been scaled down
considerably, and only the bare minimum facilities will be provided. It is
intended for the most essential needs of the farming communities in the remote
areas for which the Government attached very high priority. Since COIL is
fully equipped to organize the manufacture of the tanks and install the
facilities, the only risk associated with this project component would be the
extent that the potential owners (farmers cooperatives, private investors,
etc.) would come forward to invest in and operate such facilities. This risk,
however, is minimized given the support of regional and local authorities for
this oroject component. Furthermore, this component would be implemented on a
pilot basis under the proposed project and would be expanded if the scheme
proved to be successful.
5.09     The other main component of the project - facilities for transpor-
financial assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW. This
KfW-financed system, which includes the main harbor facilities, pusher tugs
and barges, navigational aids, other infrastructure around Volta Lake, and
technical assistance to VLTC, are nearing completion. Only bare minimum
additional facilities are proposed to be added for the transportation of
petroleum products, arnd no specific risk in project implementation is
expected. Coordination arrangements among the VLTC/VRA, COIL and MFP are
adequate and should not pose any special problemso

GCAIP - Notes mnd AeusIptions for Financial Projections
I. General
1.       The financial projections are based on CGHIP's historical accounts,
estimated 1986 accounts and the staff's best judgement on future production
levels and investment program. The following domestic and international
inflation rates and exchange rates hav been used in the projections:
1987     1988      1989     1990    1991    1992
Domestic (Z)            .8.0     15.0      10.0      7.0      5.0     3.5
Foreign  (S)             3.0      1.0       1.0      1.0      3.5     3.5
Exchange rate
(Cedis per US$1.0)    165       180       187      187      187     187
II* Income Statement
2.       Revenues.   For 1986 and 1987, processing fees have been projected on
the basis of the "Processing Agreement" which has been in force since the
beginning of the Tema refinery operation. Accortding to this agreement, the
fee is established to cover:
Operating Costs;
Depreciation of the total cost of the refinery;
General and administrative expenses;
Nunicipal and Income taxes;
Local currency cost component of the investment program; and
Dividends to Government free of Tax not exceeding 12.52 per annum on
the paid up capital of the company.
From 1988 onwards, this processing fee would be established through
negotiations with the Covernment taking into account the prevailing comparable
international refining margins, international market prices for crude and
petroleum products and the financial viability of QUA!P. It has been assumed
that GHAIP would earn a processing fee of US$2.55 equivalent per barrel
including US$0.9 equivalent per barrel to cover internal fuel consumption.
This margin is escalated according to the intenational rate of inflation shown
in para. 1.
3.       Store Sales are sales of chemical products to GNPC and/or commercial
entities. Sales volume is expected to remin constant, prices are escalated
according to the domestic rate of inflation.

ANNEX 3-7
Page 2
4.       Operating Costs:
(a) Operating costs are based on CHAIP's budget for 1986 escalated
by inflation and production levels. They include maintenance
materials, chemicals, industrial costs and store sales of
additives as well as the refinery's fuel consumption which are
escalated at the foreign rate of inflation and adjusted annually
at the prevailing exchange rate. Personnel costs and utilities
are escalated at the domestic inflation rate.
(b) Refinery Fuel Consumption: This represents fuel consumed
internally in refinery operation. For 1986 and 1987, this
amount does not show in the income statements since, under the
existing "Processing Agreement", is covered directly by the
Government/CNPC and not charged to the accounts of CHAIP. Under
the new processing fee arrangement expected to be effective from
1988 onward, such fuel consumption would be charged directly to
CHAIP. It has been assumed that the internal fuel consumption
would be reduced to 6% of total throughput in 1988 as the first
phase rehabilitation program begins to take effect, and decrease
gradually to 5X of total throughput in 1990 and thereafter.
5.       Depreciation of the new assets is calculated according to the
straight line method over 20 years:
6.       Income taxes are 55Z of income.
7.       Dividends.  It has been assumed that no dividends will be paid during
the project construction period, i.e. up through 1989. From 1990 onwards,
dividends are projected at a level of 25% of net income after retaining a
reserve of 20% which will maintain satisfactory liquidity ratios.
III. Balance Sheets and Funds Flow Statement
8.       Cash.  Minimum cash is based on average historical requirements of 21
days of cash operating costs. Extra cash is assumed to be invested in short-
term instruments yielding 10X per annum.
9.       Accounts Receivable rose from 122 days of sales in 1981 to 218 days
in 1984 and 253 days 5- 1985. They are expected to decline to 134 days from
1986 onwards.
10.      Inventories are based on historical requirements of 122 days of
consumables and maintenance materials excluding internal fuel consumption
requirements, the latter being financed by Government.
11.      Plant and Equipment are based on CHAIP's investment program.
12.      Short Term Debt has been assumed to carry an interest rate of 15% per
annum.  CHAIP is projected to incur some short-term debt to finance increases
in working capital requirements since CHAIP's cash generation is limited by
the Processsing Agreement until 1987.

ANNEX 3-7

13.      Accounts Payable rose from 178 days of operating expenses isi 1981 to
407 days in 1985. The latter figure however includes payments due to
contractors and suppliers for capital expenditures. They are expected to
decline gradually fFom 75 days in 1987 to an average of 45 days thereafter.
14.      Financing Plan for the Proposed Project.  It has been assumed that
the proposed IDA credit and EIB loan would be onlent to CKAIP at 1.1 times the
prevailing Bank rate (currently 7.922) over 15 years including 3 years
grace. Interest during construction would be financed by Covernment, and the
local currency portion of the project (about US$2.0 million equivalent) by EIB
and onlent to CRAIP on the same terms and conditions as the foreign loan.
Debt service and increases in working capital would be financed by internal
cash generation from 1988 onwards when the new processing fee would take
effect.

COIL - Notes and Assumptions for Financial Projections
I. General
1.       The financial projections are based oh COIL's historical accounts,
estimated 1986 accounts and the staff's best judgement on future production
levels and inyestment program. The following domestic and international
inflation rates and exchange rates have been used in the projections:
1987    1988    1989    1990    1991    1992
Domestic (X)           18.0    15.0    10.0      7.0      5.0     3.5
Foreign (t)             3.0     1.0      1.0     1.0      3.5     3.5
Exchange rate
(Cedis per US$1.0)   165      180      187     187     187      187
II.  Income Statements
2.       Revenues are based on the net retail sales prices set by the
Government in 1987 and escalated according to the domestic rate of
inflation. Sales volumes for the various oil products is expected to grow at
an average rate of 31 per annum.
3.       Operating costs are based on GOIL's 1986 estimates escalated by sales
volume and the domestic rate of inflation.
4.       Depreciation of the new assets is calculated according to the
following schedule:
(i)depots: straight line method over a period of 20 years; and
(ii)equipment and transport vehicles: straight line method over a
period of 10 years.
5.       Income Taxes are 55X of incume.
6.       Dividends are projected at a level of 60X of net income after
providing for a reserve of 20X.
III. Balance Sheets and Funds Flow Statements
7.       Minimum Cash is based on average historical requirements of 15 days
of cash operating costs.
8.       Extra Cash is the result of reserves built up over the years and
funds generated from operations. These are invested in short term instruments
and yield 10.0% per annum.

9.       Accounts receivable are expected to remain at 70 days of sales from
1986 onwards.
10.      Inventories are based on average historical requirements of 43 days
of oil product costs and maintenance materials.
11.      Plant and Equipment are based on GOIL's investment program.
12.      Accounts Payable are expected to remain constant at 108 days of
operating expenses from 1986 onwards.
13.      Financing Plan for the Proposed Project.  It has been assumed that
IDA and other foreign loans would be onlent to GOIL at 1.1 times the
prevailing Bank rate over 15 years including 3 years grace. The local
currency portion of the project as well as interest during construction will
be financed by internal cash generation.

(LPG).
(v)    Maintaining up-to-date record of pollutants measured,
particularly oil content and biological oxygen demand, at least
once in a week in order to monitor the harmful effect of the
waste water leaving the refinery to internationAlly acceptable
industry standards and maintain their levels in the wastewater
at appropriate US Environmental Protection Agency standard or
its equivalent.
(vi)    Maintain up-to-date record of all technical and financial
information required to assess the refinery processing margin
periodically (such as consumption of fuel, utilities, catalysts

PITROIEUN REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
A. Introduction
An economic analysis and the resulting economic rate of return is
shown below for the following project components which have relevant economic
costs and benefits:
(i) Refinery Rehabilitation
(ii) Volta Lake Transport
iii) LPG Production and Distribution
A financial analysis and the resulting financial rate of retus4 is shown for
the following project components which do not have directly measurable
economic costs and benefits. These will have important qualitative benefits
however, by increasing reliability and generally streamlining the process of
products distribution to the industrial and farming sector.
(i) Rehabilitation of Retail Outlets
(ii) Farmers Service Retail Outlets.
Assumptions and calculations for these components are shown in detail. All
costs and revenues are in constant August 1986 terms and exclusive of duties
and taxes. Local costs and revenues 'nclude a shadow pricing factor of 1.85
for economic rate of return calculation only.
B. Refinery Rehabilitation
This component comprises an API separator with air floatation
facilities, modifications to the distillation heater convection section,
repairs to the jetty pipelines, repairs (;f three jet fuel tanks, mist
eliminators for the existing boilers, a 27-ton maintenance crane and
chlorination system for sea water used for cooling.
Capital cost is US$3.39 million of which US$2.77 million is in
foreign exchange and US$0.62 million is in local cost. The residual value of
assets is 132 after 15 years of operation.
Ooerating Cost. No additional economic costs can be allocated to
these comp%ients as they are being implemented for their cost saving and
production streamlining benefits. The cost of production *v already accounted
for in the existing cost structure of the refinery.

Benefits consist of the following savings:
--    US$0.17 million per year in oil loss due to new efficient API
separator, based on 1,500 tons (0.15% of total throughput) and
an average price of US$112.0 per ton.
--    US$0.28 million per year in fuel savings due to the moderni-
zation of the heater convection section, based on 3,000 ton of
fuel at US$92.28 per ton.
--   JUS$0.26 million per year in oil savings due to repairs of crude
and product pipelines to the jetty, based on 2,000 tons at an
average price of US$130 per ton.
--    US$0.08 million pee year in maintenance cost savings due to the
use of the 27-ton crane.
==    US$0.08 million per year due to savings in cost of chlorine,
based on 335 tons at US$190 per ton plus US$38 for freight.
Cost/Benefits Streams for the base case are shown in the table
below. The economic rate of return is 24.51.

Sensitivity Analysis
This component is equally sensitive to capital cost and prices.
Since no operating costs can be allocated to this component, it is not a
critical variable and has no impact on the economic rate of return. The
results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in the table below:
Change of Critical                        Capital
Variable from Base Case X                    Cost             Prices

-20                               30.9%              19.1%
C. Volta Lake Transport
This component comprises jetty facilities, petroleum barges and
pusher tugs financed through KfW, earthworks, underground and pavement works,
storage tanks and truck/ unloading stations, firefighting and electrical
installations, and miscellaneous equipment. Works will be undertaken both at
the Akosombo and Buipe locations. For the economic evaluation, the cost of
one diesel barge that is included in the ongoing VLTC project is also included
to arrive at the overall cost ard benefits. The cost of the storage tanks and
truck loading facilities at Buipe is excluded from the cost of the Volta Lake
system since it is provided in lieu of the facilities required for building a
supply depot at Tamale, and included in the rehabilitation of retail outlets.
Capital Costs is US$13.89 million of which US$1.31 million equivalent
is local and 12.58 is foreign. The residual value of assets is 10% after 19
years of operation.
Operating Costs of the barges is US$0.30 million per year which
includes cost of labour, fuel, lubricants and spares.
Benefits. Annual average savings would be US$2.75 million for a
movement of 50,000 tons of petroleum products over 500 km from Tema to Buipe
at the esti ated road transport cost (economic cost) of US$0.11 equivalent/
ton/km. The annual movement is expected to be 25,000 tons in 1989, 50,000
tons in 1990 and will grow by 5% per year for five years and 3% subsquently.
Cost/Benefits Streams for the base case are shown in the table
below. The economic rate of return is 18.4%. In an alternative case, if
40,000 tons per year are exported to Burkina-Faso over and above Ghana's own
requirement, the economic rate of return of the Volta Lake transport component
is 27.2%.

Sensitivity Analysis
For this component, the financial rate of return is extremely
sensitive to price and sales volume variations: a 10% drop would lower the
financial rate of return to 15.4% while a 20% drop results in a very low rate
of return of 2.5%. Sensitivity is not very critical to capital and operating
costs which will remain at 21.62 and 18.1% for a 20% increase in capital and
operating costs respectively.

PETROLEUM REFIING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
GHAIP - Tema Refinery Operating Economics
1.       CHAIP's Tema Refinerv is a simple hydroskimming refinery consisting
of 28,000 bpd crude distillation, catalytic reformer, product treating units
and usual auxiliary facilities including electri- power generation.   The
refinery normally operates at around 75% capacity (21,000 bpd) to meet
exclusively the white products requirement of the domestic market. Being a
hydroskimming refinery, it produces considerable quantities of residual fuel
oil which is exported at very low prices. Thus to improve its operating
economics, the refinery should select the right type of crude mix that will
more or less meet the domestic white product requirement and, at the same
time, minimize the production of surplus residual fuel oil. In the absence of
suitable condensates or surplus finished products at the West African crude
oil export points, CHAIP's choices for crude are limited to light crude oils
such as Bonny Light and Brass River from Nigeria. Between these two crudes,
Bonny Light, with its high content of middle distillates, best suits the
requirement of Ghana and the configuration of the Tema Refinery.
2.       In order to further improve the operating economics of the refinery,
the Government relaxed the specifications for diesel and fuel oil which
resulted in additional production of diesel (about 6% on crude) at the expense
of surplus residual fuel oil. In addition, fuel consumption and hydrocarbon
losses are being reduced considerably as a result of the first phase refinery
rehabilitation financed under the ongoing Refinery Rehabilitation and
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1446-GH). These losses will be further
reduced with the second-phase rehabilitation included in the proposed
petroleum refinery and distribution project.
3.       Beside the improved operating efficiency through rehabilitation, the
refinery's operating economics depends greatly on the savings on transport
costs, i.e. lower freight costs for bringing to Ghana crude oil from nearby
Nigeria as compared to bringing finished petroleum products from Western
Europe. On an average, the differential in freight rates amount to about
US$12.50 per ton. With this freight advantage, coupled with the quality
advantage of Nigerian Bonny Light crude oil, the Tema Refinery is able to
generate a respectable profit most of the time in spite of the fluctuating
nature of the international prices for crude and products.
4.       Since the economic viability of the refinery mainly depends on crude
and product freight differential, the possibilities of obtaining finished
products from the West Africa region itself have been considered. The fifteen
refineries in the West Africa region (Mauritania to Angola) have a total
refining capacity of about 567,000 barrels per day (25.0 million MT/year), of
which 254,000 barrels per day (11.5 million MT/year) capacity is in the three
refineries in Nigeria. Due to operational problems and mismatch between
demand and production, only about 180,000 barrels per day (8.0 million

MT/year) capacity is in regular operation, and at present Nigeria is a net
importer of products to the tune of about 4.5 million MT per year. Nigeria's
plans for building a large refinery at Port Hartcourt has not materialized due
to financial consttaints. Outside Nigeria, only the 70,000 barrels per day
Abidjan refinery in Ivory Coast, and the 20,000 barrels per day Gabon refinery
have secondary conversion facilities; all the rest being simple hydroskimming
refineries as in the case of Ghana's Tema refinery. Ivory Coast at present
has a surplus capacity of about 35,000 barrels per day (1.75 million MT/year)
which is being fully utilized for export by international oil companies,
mostly by Chevron. Cabon operates at about 70X capacity for its own domestic
use. Among the remaining refineries in the region, Ghana's Tema refinery is
in the forefront with more than 75% capacity utilization solely for domestic
requirements. Surplus products from other hydroskimming refineries in the
region, even if they are operated at full capacity, would not be competitive
with products from Ghana's own refinery since they are being operated with
costly expatriate assistance and with less operating efficiency than the Tema
refinery. In addition, the crude and product freight advantages that those
refineries enjoy would not be more than the advantage that Tema refinery
enjoys at present. As a result, the West Africa region at present is a net
importer of petroleum products to the tune of about 7.0 million MT per year.
Western Europe/Mediterranean is the main source for these imports.
5.       Regarding prices for products from West Africa refineries, even the
surplus products from Abidjan refinery are exported on the basis of FOB prices
ex Northwest Europe/Mediterranean plus freight. Under those circumstances,
Ghana's choices for petroleum products are limited to direct imports from N.W.
Europe/Mediterranean or refining Bonny Light crude oil in its refinery. As
shown below, the crude refining option is economically more advantageous than
the product import option.
6.       The historic crude and product price differentials (FOB Rotterdam)
during 1974-1986 are presented in page 5. The effect of these price
differentials on the composite barrel produced from the Tema refinery based on
Ghana's domestic consumption pattern of products is shown in a graphical form
on page 6. The price differential required to make the refinery operation
break-even is estimated at US$0.95 per barrel or US$7.06 per ton (page 7 for
details) which is shown in the graph in a dotted line. It is observed that
over the past 12 years, except for the period 1979-82 when the market was
destabilized mainly due to the sudden effect of the breakout of war between
Iran and Iraq, the price differential varied between US$2.28 and IS$4.68 per
barrel which was considerably above the Tema refinery break-even margin of
US$0.95 per barrel. Hence it is safe to assume that the Tema refinery
operation would continue to be economically viable as compared to product
imports under stable market conditions. The energy conservation measures and
management improvement expected under the proposed project would further
improve the economic viability of the refinery.
7.       The operating economics of the Tema Refinery have been assessed under
different historical crude and product prices scenarios. It should be noted
that the product pattern is based on fuel consumption and losses (6%)
currently obtained in the refinery after the completion of some of the
rehabilitation jobs under IDA credit 1446-GH. It is expected to further
reduce to 5-5.5% when the rehabilitation is completed under the proposed
project, The operating economics of the Tema Refinery are summarized below.
Assumptions used in the calculations are shown on page 4 of this Annex.

CHANA - Tema Refinery Operating Economics
Assumptions
-   Crude processed  : Nigerian Bonny Light
-   Crude transportation from Nigeria to Tema  :  50,000 DWT vessels
-   Crude oil freight is estimated at W.S. 100 for 50,0OO DWT vessels.
Product freights are estimated at W.S. 150 for 25,000 DVT vessels from
Northwest Europe.
Prices of crude and products are based on Platt's Oilgram price reports
from October 29, 1985, August 11, 1986 and December 2, 1986. Since Ghana
has entered into long term contract (1 year) with Nigeria on "net-back"
basis, the actual prices of crude oil would be slightty lower than the
going spot market prices.
Insurance and ocean losses are estimated at 0.7X of the FOB + freight cost
for crude and products.
The refinery fuel consumption and losses, product pattern, capacity
'tilization and operating costs are assumed to be the same as currently
experienced after completion of some of the rehabilitation jobs under IDA
Credit 1446-CH. Additional savings would be achieved when the refinery
rehabilitation is completed.
Price of LPG was estimated as per market information at different periods
in the absence of actual postings.
The refinery does not have any long term debts, and the existing plant and
machinery are fully depreciated.
Terminal cost for product import includes cost of persornel, utilities,
chemicals, etc. for operation and maintenance of product storage and
handling facilities.
