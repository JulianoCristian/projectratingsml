IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GHANA
PETROLEUM REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Credit No. 1819-GH)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Petroleum Refining and
Distribution Project in Ghana for which Credit 1819-GH in the amount of SDR 11.7 million
(US$15.0 million equivalent at the time of approval) was approved on June 11, 1987 and made
effective on October 14, 1988.
The Credit closed on December 31, 1994, compared to the original closing date of December
31, 1991. Total disbursements amounted to SDR 11.7 million (US$16.3 million equivalent), and
the last disbursement took place on April 5, 1995. Cofinancing for the project was provided by
the European Investment Bank (EIB) (US$6.2 million) and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW)
of Germany (US$9.4 million).
This ICR was prepared by Mr. T. S. Nayar of the Oil and Gas Division of the Industry and
Energy Department assisted by Mr. P.K. Subramanian, Consultant. It was reviewed by Ms. Mary
Oakes Smith, Division Chief, AF4IE, and Mr. Franz Kaps, Operations Advisor, AF4DR.
The preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission
(March 13-24, 1995). It is based on material in the project files and discussions with staff
involved in the project. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by helping collect
missing data and producing its section as per Appendix A of this report.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GHANA
PETROLEUM REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Credit No. 1819-GH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.   IDA has supported the petroleum sector in Ghana through two Credits: the Energy
Project (Credit 1373-GH) of SDR 10.2 million in 1983, and the Petroleum Refinery Rehabilitation
and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1446-GH) of SDR 6.6 million in 1984. The Petroleum
Refining and Distribution Project (Credit 1819-GH) was designed to reduce the cost, enhance the
reliability and increase the supply of petroleum products.
Project Obiectives
2.    The major project objectives were to (i) rationalize the petroleum sector investment
program, focusing on agreed priority projects; (ii) reduce costs and improve the reliability of
petroleum supply by improving refining, storage and transport infrastructure, as well as logistics;
(ii) increase the access of remote areas to petroleum supplies; (iii) mitigate the adverse effects of
the energy sector on the environment by reducing pollution from the refinery and increasing the
supply of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) production as substitute for woodfuels; and (iv)
strengthen the management and operations of the Ghana Italian Petroleum Company Limited,
which became Tema Oil Refinery Limited (TOR) during project implementation, and Ghana Oa1
Company, Limited (GOIL). These objectives were reasonable and consistent with the
Government's priorities for energy sector development.
3.    To achieve its objectives, the project included components for (i) completion of refinery
rehabilitation work begun under Credit 1446-GH; (ii) rehabilitation work on GOEL's petroleum
storage depots and retail outlets, as well as expansion of infrastructure for LPG marketing; (iii)
storage tanks, transfer facilities, oil jetties, barges, etc. for petroleum product transport via Volta
Lake; (iv) the establishment of farmers service reseller outlets; and (v) the training of GOIL's
personnel. Furthermore, the project included covenants governing petroleum product pricing,
management improvement, investment review and financial performance.
ImDlementation ExDerience and Results
4.    The project substantially achieved its physical objectives and those for the institutional
strengthening of GOIL and TOR. It partially achieved its objectives for petroleum sector
development, environmental control, public enterprise management and financial performance.
The sustainability of the project is uncertain because of : (i) the potential adverse impact of
Government investments in refinery expansion, outside of the project, on the finances of TOR
and the supply costs of petroleum products; (ii) the lack of a satisfactory arrangement, by the
project's closing date for improving the efficiency of bulk procurement of crude oil and bulk



-ii-
marketing of petroleum products; and (iii) concern about the ability of GOIL to retain its market
share in a competitive environment, despite institutional progress the company has made under
the project.
5.    The total project cost was US$ 37 million, very close to the appraisal estimate of US$
36.3 million and there was no major change in financing arrangements. IDA financed US$ 16.2
million of the total. The co-financiers of the project were the European Investment Bank (EIB)
and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) which provided US$ 6.2 million and US$ 9.4 million
respectively. The contribution of the Government was US$ 5.2 million. The implementation
period of the project originally envisaged was about four years but because of implementation
delays actually took six years. The project closed on December 31, 1994.
6.    Delays in the implementation of the project resulted from: (i) slowness of the Government
in taking the necessary actions for Credit effectiveness; and (ii) difficulties in implementing parts
of the project for which GOIL was responsible, including problems which arose in appointing a
qualified project management team; a lack of relevant project experience and knowledge of Bank
guidelines; procurement problems; some changes in the scope of work; and GOIL's shortage of
domestic currency to pay local expenses.
7.    The performance of the Bank during the identification, preparation, preappraisal and
appraisal stages of the project was satisfactory. The Bank's supervision of the technical aspects
of the project was adequate but it was deficient in monitoring financial and institutional objectives.
The performance of the Borrower (the Government of Ghana) was satisfactory in project
preparation and appraisal but deficient in project implementation and compliance with covenants.
8.    The overall project outcome was satisfactory. This rating is based on the fact that GOIL
and TOR substantially achieved their physical and institutional objectives. However, IDA has
given this rating with caution because the project did not achieve its main objective of
rationalizing the investment program for the petroleum sector.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
9.    The principal findings of the project are that: (i) the rehabilitation of the refinery has
reduced operating costs and has significantly reduced pollution; (ii) improvements and additions
to the storage and transport infrastructure have contributed to reducing petroleum supply costs
and expanding access of remote areas to petroleum products; (iii) both GOIL and TOR have
enhanced their operational efficiency and finances through considerable reductions in the number
of staff and training programs to upgrade the skills of the remaining staff (for full details please
refer to para 8 to 10 of the Part I in this report). However, the delay of Government action to
rationalize its investment program, the need for GOIL to develop a greater commercial
orientation, and the lack of a satisfactory arrangement to promote efficiency of bulk crude oil
procurement and bulk marketing of petroleum products have made the sustainability of the
project's achievements uncertain.



-111-
10.   IDA is planning an adjustment credit for fiscal year 1997. This credit will include actions
to promote the deregulation of the petroleum sector and streamline, for greater efficiency, the
functions that remain in the public domain. Successful actions in these areas could enhance the
certainty for the sustainability of project achievements.
11.   There were several key lessons learned from the project:
(i)     It is important to obtain fulfillment of critical project conditionalities for sector
policy and development either before Board presentation or at least by the
effectiveness date of the credit. Otherwise, there is a greater risk of losing sight of
them in the process of supervising project components which are mainly technical
in nature.
(ii)    An annual review of corporate investment planning is often necessary to avoid
duplication of project investments or additional investments outside agreed upon
priorities with the Borrower.
(iii)    With hindsight, it would have been useful to have a specific covenant limiting the
Government's investment program in the petroleum sector, without prior
consultation with IDA.
(iv)    In technical projects with important development and financial policy components,
it is important to ensure the staffing of missions with appropriate related skills in
addition to technical staff.
(v)     Compliance with project covenants should receive as much attention as progress in
implementing physical project components since these covenants can have a major
impact on meeting project objectives. For major covenants, IDA should show a
greater willingness to pursue remedies for non-compliance, including the
suspension of disbursements.
(vi)    In order to  avoid major delays in the procurement process, the project
implementation unit of a new beneficiary should receive specialized training in
procurement practices and demonstrate that it is thoroughly familiar with the
Bank's procurement policy.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GHANA
PETROLEUM REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Credit No. 1819-Gil)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Introduction
1.    The Petroleum Refining and Distribution Project supported the Government of
Ghana's energy sector strategy to ensure long-term energy supplies at reasonable cost;
develop indigenous energy resources to substitute for imported fuels where economically
viable; and promote efficient energy use through appropriate pricing policy and other forms
of demand management. In support of these of objectives, the project complemented two
other projects which were in progress at the time of the project's appraisal in 1987: (a) the
Energy Project (Credit 1336-GH), which was helping the Government in its promotional
efforts to encourage oil exploration in the country by international oil companies (IOCs),
and (b) the Petroleum Refining and Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1446-GH), which
was financing the first phase of rehabilitation for the Tema refinery along with studies to
review petroleum supply operations.
B.    Statement and Evaluation of Project Objectives
2.    The main objectives of the project, as they appear in the Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR) were to: (i) rationalize the Borrower's investment plan in the petroleum refining and
distribution subsector; (ii) increase the reliability and reduce the cost of the supply of
petroleum products in the country by improving the operating efficiency of the refinery and
distribution system; (iii) reduce oil pollution from Tema refinery operations; (iv) establish a
new and economic route for bulk transport of petroleum products; (v) improve the supply
of agricultural products in the remote areas by bringing diesel and kerosene to these areas;
(vi) counter deforestation with the increased availability of liquified petroleum gas (LPG)
and kerosene; (vii) enhance the operating/earning basis of Tema refinery and solve the issue
of bulk crude procurement and bulk marketing of petroleum products; and (viii) strengthen
the organization, management and operating practices of Ghana Italian Petroleum Company
Limited (GHAIP), and Ghana Oil Company Limited (GOIL), ensuring that both entities
operate on a commercial basis.
3.    In support of the above objectives, the project's components consisted of : (i)
completion of the rehabilitation work on the Tema refinery, begun under Credit 1446-GH ,
particularly off-site facilities, utility systems, LPG handling, product shipping facilities, and
improvement of energy efficiency; (ii) rehabilitation of GOIL's bulk petroleum storage
depots at Takoradi and Kumasi and retail outlets; (iii) expansion of GOIL's infrastructure
and increased availability of LPG bottles and stoves to market additional LPG made
available from the Tema refinery; (iv) provision of storage tanks and transfer facilities at
Akosombo and Buipe to transport petroleum products on the Volta Lake towards the



-2-
northern parts of the country; (v) provision of oil jetties at Akosombo and Buipe, petroleum
barges and a tug boat; (vi) procurement of vehicles to transport LPG and other petroleum
products, as well as for the project management team's use; (vii) establishment of facilities
for farmers' service reseller outlets; and (viii) training of GOIL's managerial and operational
personnel.
4.    The project's objectives were reasonable and consistent with the Government's
priorities for energy sector development, encompassing physical targets for rehabilitating
the refinery and the supply system for petroleum products, policy actions for sector
development and institutional improvements for the two main implementing agencies of the
project:   GHAIP, which became Tema Oil Refinery Limited (TOR) during the
implementation of the project, and GOIL.
5.    The project's components were adequate to support the original project objectives.
However, during project implementation, there were two main changes to the Project's
components. One was the reduction in the size of the depots that the Bank was financing in
Akosombo and Buipe, because IDA learned that the Government had built depots in the
same area as the project with financing from other sources. Second, there was a change
establishing new farmer's reseller outlets through cooperative ventures, to installing such
facilities in GOIL's remote depots.
6.    The SAR provided a adequate assessment of most project risks. It indicated there
would be no major risk associated with the physical components of the project because they
had a significant amount of advanced preparation and detailed description. The project was
within the technical competence of GOIL and TOR but both of these public enterprises
needed improvements in operations and financial management which the project was to
address through the implementation of findings of a management study. Furthermore,
GOIL lacked sufficient exposure to modern oil marketing practices but the project
addressed this issue by including a component to provide GOIL with overseas training in
marketing practices. The SAR did not mention the risk that the Government might not
adhere to maintaining a rationalized investment program and taking on no new investments
outside agreed priority projects. With hindsight, acknowledgment of this risk might have
prompted closer monitoring of public expenditures in the petroleum sector and could have
helped the project achieve its investment rationalization objective.
C.    Achievement of Project Objectives
7.    Overview. The project substantially achieved its physical objectives and those for
institutional strengthening of GOIL and TOR.  It partially achieved its objectives for
petroleum sector policy development, environmental control, public enterprise management
and financial management.
8.    Physical Obiectives. The project substantially achieved its physical objectives for
improving the technical aspects of refinery operations and infrastructure for petroleum
product storage, transport, and distribution. As a result of the project's rehabilitation



-3-
program, the refinery's consumption and losses declined from nine percent at the time of
project appraisal to six percent at the project's completion. The improved condition of
refinery facilities has helped to reduce yearly maintenance expenses this combined with cuts
in the workforce of the refinery have caused overall operating costs to drop considerably.
Furthermore, the project has enabled the expansion of LPG production from 6,000 tons to
11,000 tons, enhancing revenue prospects and capacity utilization of the refinery.
9.     The project's rehabilitation of petroleum storage depots and retail outlets has
provided GOIL with the infrastructure it needs for better marketing of its oil products. The
project also has established a new system for transporting petroleum products from the
south to the north via Volta Lake, and a road from the northern waterside point to the
country's northern border, which should decrease overall transport costs. Road transport
alone has been unreliable due to poor road conditions, which reduced the life of vehicles
and resulted in increased operating and maintenance costs. The improved transport system
combined with an expansion of storage and pump facilities in remote northern depots, has
increased the access of agricultural activities to kerosene and diesel oil and should help
improve the performance of agri-business.
10.    Institutional Improvements. The project provided for the implementation of the
findings of a management study of TOR and GOIL. This study recommended serious
restructuring which involved large reductions in the staffing of both public companies
combined with staff training to improve the overall quality of work in these enterprises.
Both entities have made considerable progress in management restructuring. TOR reduced
its labor force from 680 to 346 and GOIL lowered it its staffing from 550 to 385.
Additionally, both GOIL and TOR personnel have improved the quality of their work
through training.
11.    Sector Development Policies. The project did not achieve an important objective
for petroleum sector development-- the rationalization of the investment program with a
focus on priorities agreed upon with IDA. The reason for this is that the Government took
on additional investment projects in areas which are redundant with IDA-financed projects
and has made a major investment in expanding the refinery's output from 28,000 tons per
day (tpd) to 35,000 tpd. These additional projects include: (i) The Ministry of Energy and
Mines' (MEM) petroleum storage depot and LPG facilities in Accra Plains, five kilometers
away from the refinery; (ii) new storage depots in Kumasi and Buipe adjoining GOIL's
depots; (iii) new storage depots in Bolgatanga; and (iv) LPG distribution facilities of Ghana
National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) at several places.   These investments could
increase the cost of petroleum products, unless petroleum product sales increase sufficiently
to offset the added investment cost.
12.   Another aspect of petroleum sector development which the project addressed was
the appropriate pricing of petroleum products. The recommendations of the pricing study
covered under the project was that the Government should maintain prices at or above
international levels and that oil distributors be allowed to increase the margin they receive



-4-
for the petroleum they sell to account for the high cost of transport to the northern region.
They now have a greater incentive to expand their activities to remote locations.
13.   Financial Objectives for GOIL and TOR.  TOR was able to comply with all
financial covenants under the project. It maintained a current ratio of more than 1.1 and
generated net revenues of more than 1.5 times the debt service requirements for the years
1991 through 1993. While GOIL was able to maintain a current ratio of more than 1.1, it
could not generate net revenue equal to 1.5 times the debt servicing requirements. Both
TOR and GOIL failed to submit their audited financial statements on time. To compete
with private oil companies, GOIL will have to reduce its costs further and develop a more
efficient and cost-effective marketing strategy to prevent greater declines in its share of the
market, which dropped from 25.2 percent in 1987 to 22.7 percent in 1994. With the
completion of the rehabilitation and modernization of its facilities, GOIL will be better
equipped to implement such a strategy.
14.   Environmental Obiectives. The project partially achieved its environmental
objectives. TOR has reduced the threat of oil leaks to marine life by installing a new oil
separator in Tema refinery. However, TOR will need to install additional facilities to meet
internationally acceptable environmental standards. Some improvements in oil pollution
control also have resulted from the refinery's rehabilitation program, which replaced
corroded crude oil and petroleum product pipes connecting the oil jetty and refinery. As for
GOIL's facilities, rehabilitation of the Takoradi and Kumasi depots and the replacement of
the leaking product pipeline from the Takoradi oil jetty to its depot have made it possible to
control oil spillage. Finally, the marketing of an additional 5,000 tons of LPG from the
refinery, as a substitute for woodfuels, could help reduce the threat of deforestation.
D.   Main Factors Affecting Project Implementation
15.    Factors Subiect to Government Control. There were numerous delays in the
project's implementation which resulted from factors that were within the scope of
Government control. After completion of the project appraisal, in April/May 1986, it was
necessary to postpone project negotiations for a year because the Govemment did not: (i)
obtain the expected grant to do a management improvement study for TOR and GOIL;
and (ii) make an arrangement acceptable to IDA for bulk procurement of crude oil and bulk
marketing of petroleum products. Negotiations took place in April 1987; IDA approved
the Credit in June 1987; and the signing of documents took place in September 1987.
17.   Factors Subject to the Iminlementin! Aeencies' Control. GOIL's portion of the
project took 74 months from the date of Credit effectiveness to completion, compared to
an implementation schedule of 24 months, as the SAR for the project had estimated.
Furthermore, there were three extensions of the project's closing date. Among the major
causes of the delay were: (i) difficulty in appointing a qualified project management team;
(ii) GOIL's inexperience in implementing a large project and its lack of familiarity with IDA
guidelines; (iii) the need for re-tendering in the procurement process; (iv) the need to
change the scope of work for the project because MEM commissioned a pipeline project



-5-
funded by other sources; and (v) GOIL's inability to pay local expenses due to a shortage
of domestic currency. The Credit closed on December 31, 1994, three years beyond the
original closing date of December 31, 1991.
E.    Sustainability of Project Achievements
18.   The sustainability of the project's achievements is uncertain at this time for several
reasons. First, IDA is concerned about the potential impact of the Govemment's new
investment in refinery expansion on TOR's financial viability. The Govemment is executing
an expansion of refinery capacity with an investment of US$60 million with external
funding. The transfer of this investment and its associated debt to TOR would likely erode
the gains made under the project in TOR's financial performance and its net revenues may
not be able to meet the target of covering 1.5 times its debt service. Furthermore the
additional investment also could lead to increases in the cost of petroleum products,
countering the Govemment's strategy for cost containment. Second, the unaccounted losses
for the country due to undefined responsibility for bulk procurement of crude and bulk
marketing of petroleum products, are likely to persist without the establishment of sufficient
controls at various stages of procurement, refining, and distribution. Third, there is some
uncertainty surrounding GOIL's ability to maintain its market share and compete with
private oil companies that are also modemizing their facilities and trying to capture a larger
share of the market. GOIL will have to commercialize its entire distribution system to
maximize the use of the investments it has made with the IDA credit and other extemal
finds. This commercialization should include further downsizing to further reduce costs,
signing commercially-oriented contracts, decreasing credit sales, and collecting overdue
arrears.
F.    Bank Performance
19.   The Bank's performance during the identification, preparation, preappraisal, and
appraisal stages of the project was satisfactory. The Bank proved flexible at negotiations,
board presentation, and effectiveness stages. In particular, it granted the Govemment
additional time to meet some of the conditions agreed upon before negotiations and credit
effectiveness. Supervision missions sufficiently monitored the technical aspects of the
project, as well as progress in contracting, and disbursement. However, they did not
sufficiently monitor the project's covenants for reviews of investment planning and financial
achievements. For example, according to section 4.07 of the project agreement, TOR and
GOEL were to review their three year rolling investment plan with IDA no later than March
31 of each year. This did not actually take place until the final supervision mission in 1994.
Due to reassignment of Bank staff involved in this project, follow-up was irregular.



-6-
G.    Borrower Performance
20.   The Government of Ghana was the Borrower for the Project , while GOIL and
TOR  were its beneficiaries and implementing agencies.   Overall, the Borrower's
performance in preparation was satisfactory but was deficient in project implementation and
compliance with some important covenants in the Credit Agreement. Furthermore, by
taking on investments in the petroleum sector outside of priorities agreed upon with IDA,
the Government showed that it has not yet rationalized its investment program for the
petroleum sector, which was a major objective of the project. The performance of GO6L
and TOR was satisfactory in project preparation and implementation with some deficiencies
in compliance with covenants of the Project Agreement.
21.   The Borrower was slow in adhering to the timetable for important actions in project
implementation. In particular, there were delays in: (i) conducting the management
improvement study; (ii) assigning the responsibility for bulk procurement of crude and bulk
marketing of products; (iii) appointing GOIL's managing director; (iv) signing a contractual
agreement between the Volta Lake Transportation Company (VLTC) and GOIL on the
transportation of products on Volta Lake; and (v) settling arrears due by parastatals and
other Government agencies to GOIL.  These delays resulted in some losses to the
beneficiaries of the project and to the country. The losses resulted from : (i) the
accumulated interest on arrears of receivables due to GOIL by state-owned enterprises; (ii)
inefficient arrangements for bulk procurement of both crude oil and petroleum products;
and (iii) excessive road transport fees.
22.    TOR was responsible for rehabilitating the refinery. Except for the facilities
designed to clean up oil-contaminated effluent water leaving the refinery, TOR executed the
project in a satisfactory manner through a project unit it had established under Credit 1446-
GH. TOR managed the project adequately and completed its components by the end of
1992. GOIL handled the petroleum supply and distribution components. GOIL completed
the land-side facilities for the Volta Lake transport system while the VLTC/Volta Lake
Authority (VRA) handled the waterside facilities.   GOIL  set up a new  project
implementation unit but there was considerable delay in its staffing. The absence of a full-
time managing director for GOIL was a significant factor in the delays and had an adverse
impact on project management performance during the first half of the project's
implementation period. However, during the period 1992-1994, GOIL's performance in
project management was excellent.
23.   Both TOR and GOIL failed to meet the covenant requiring their presentation of
corporate development plans for IDA review. Also, they were late in submitting their
audited financial statements to IDA. Toward the end of the project, IDA supervision noted
that GOIL had not made provisions in its financial statements, for nearly three years, to
repay the IDA credit onlent by Government. However, GOIL subsequently revised the
statements to incorporate the arrears payable to Government. At the same time, GOIL had
difficulty collecting a substantial amount of past arrears receivable from Government
agencies and parastatals.

H.    Assessment of Outcome
24.   IDA has rated the project's overall outcome as satisfactory because of substantial
achievements in meeting its physical objectives and in the institutional strengthening of the
project's beneficiaries -- GOIL and TOR. However, IDA has given this rating with caution
noting that the Government did not fulfill the project's major objective of rationalizing the
petroleum sector investment, and that it has made the Government aware that efficient
investment programming should be a major sector priority and is essential for any further
commercialization of the petroleum sector.
I.    Future Operations
25.   IDA is planning an adjustment credit for fiscal year 1997. This credit will include
actions to promote the deregulation of the petroleum sector and streamline, for greater
efficiency, the functions that remain in the public domain. Successful actions in these areas
could enhance the prospect that the project's achievements will be sustainable.
J.    Key Lessons Learned
26.   The main lessons learned from this project are:
(i)     It is important to obtain fulfillment of critical conditionalities for sector
policy and development either before Board presentation or at least by the
effectiveness date of the Credit. Otherwise, there is a greater risk of losing
sight of them in the process of supervising project components which are
mainly technical in nature.
(ii)    An annual review of corporate investment planning is crucial to avoid
duplication of project investments or additional investments outside agreed
upon priorities with the Borrower.
(iii)    With hindsight, it would have been useful to have a specific covenant
limiting the Government's investment program in the petroleum sector,
without prior consultation with IDA.
(iv)    In technical projects with important development and financial policy
components, it is important to ensure the staffing of missions with
appropriate related skills, in addition to technical staff.
(v)     Compliance with project covenants should receive as much attention as
progress in implementing physical project components since these covenants
can have a major impact on meeting project objectives. For major covenants,
IDA should show a greater willingness to pursue remedies for non-
compliance, including the suspension of disbursements.



-8-
(vi)    In order to avoid major delays in the procurement process, the project
implementation unit of a new beneficiary should receive specialized training
in procurement practices and demonstrate that it is thoroughly familiar with
the Bank's procurement policy.

APPENDIX A
PETROLEUM REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Credit No. 1819-GH
PART II - BORROWERS CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
1.    TEMA OIL REFINERY (TOR)
INTRODUCTION
The Ghana Petroleum Refining and Technical Assistance Project, which was
initiated in 1983, identified the urgent need to rehabilitate the Tema Oil Refinery to keep it
in efficient operation until the year 2000.
The scope of repairs and replacements of obsolete equipment, which were defined
in 1984, were estimated at US$24,850,000, but due to unavailability of funds to
implement the whole project in one go, it was divided into two phases.
Phase 1 was completed in 1988 at a total cost of US$6.5 million and it has made a
significant improvement in the operations of the Refinery.
TOR Rehabilitation Project Phase 2 was appraised by the Bank staff in 1986 to
complete the ongoing Rehabilitation Project Phase I under Credit 1446-GH.
The initial cost estimate was US$8.2 million and financing was as follows:
IDA = US$1,700,000
EIB = US$6,500,000
Project Agreement was signed in September 1987, but the credit was declared
effective in October 1988 because GOG was unable to fulfill certain conditions.
During the implementation, the funds were found to be woefully inadequate and, as a
result, the scope of work for the API separator plus Flotation facilities was reduced and
TOR had to fund some of the costs from its own resources.
The project was successfully completed in September 1993 with some of the
objectives fully achieved and others partially achieved.



-2-
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of Rehabilitation Project Phase 2 were the following:
1)    To reduce oil pollution from refinery operations;
2)    To strengthen the organization and improve management and operating
practices of Tema Oil Refinery;
3)    To improve the quality of LPG to meet international standard for LPG
export;
4)    To improve LPG handling and shipping facilities for safe export of excess
LPG; and
5)    To reduce Consumption and Losses to about 6%.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The Credit was declared effective in October 1988 even though the Credit
Agreement and the Project Agreement were signed in September 1987. The delay was
partly due to Government's long wait to get a grant for the management improvement
study and partly due to Government's inability to accept certain IDA conditions for bulk
procurement of crude oil.
PROJECT TEAM
TOR maintained the project team which handled the Rehabilitation Project Phase
1. However, during the course of the project implementation, some of the key members
resigned. The final project team, at the completion of the project, was as follows:
Mr. R. K. Apau      Project Manager
Mr. B. K. Osam      Project Engineer, Processing
Mr. P. A. Frimpong   Project Engineer, Mechanical
Mr. A. Y. Ayenu     Project Engineer, Civil
Mr. I. N. A. Kotey    Project Accountant
Mr. S. A. Asmah     Procurement Officer
PROJECT COST
The initial estimated cost for the project during the appraisal stage was
US$6,700,000 and is as shown in Appendix 2. The actual cost of the project at
completion was US$11,441,155.71. The details of the cost and the funding agencies are
shown in Appendix 3.

PROJECT EXECUTION PLAN
The scope of work for executing the project was divided between BEICIP and
TOR as shown in Appendix 1. Basic design and preparation of tender documents for the
major items of the project were carried out by BEICIP. Procurement and contracting
were carried out in accordance with IDA Procurement Procedure Guide (i.e., ICB). Bids
for major items were evaluated by both BEICIP and TOR while purchase orders were
issued by TOR.
During the engineering stage, the installation of Mist eliminators in the existing
boilers was found impracticable because the diameters of the boiler drums were just too
small to accommodate them.
We also found out, during the engineering stage, that TOR had sufficient steel
plates for repair of tanks.Therefore, steel plates for tank repairs, originally included in the
project, were not purchased.
With regards to the Waste Water Treatment Plant, the lowest quotation received
for the main equipment was about US$3.3 million as compared to the US$435,000
estimated by the consultants and allocated by the Bank. We, therefore, had to reduce the
scope of work to the construction of only the API Separator when the Bank could not
increase the allocation for the item.
Before the commencement of the project, the co-financier E.I.B. included
Performance Monitoring in the scope of work and allocated US$500,000 to purchase the
necessary instruments for it. The contract for the performance monitoring was awarded to
Comerint of Italy at a price of US$492,000. They have completed the Auditing and
Definition of improvement phases. Very useful recommendations were made and most of
them have been carried out remaining a few which will be completed during the next Shut-
down Maintenance in July 1995. After completing the recommendations, they will
continue with the implementation phase.
During the course of the implementation, we were informed by Kent-Tighi of Italy,
the manufacturer of the old process units control room instrumentation, that the
equipment have become obsolete and that they have stopped producing spare parts.
Because of the seriousness and urgency of the situation, we requested IDA and EIB for
assistance to replace the control room instruments. EIB allowed us to use the portion of
their contribution for local expenditure of US$1.4 million to buy the new equipment while
TOR provided funds for the local expenditure.
CONSTRUCTION
Construction and installation of the project components were divided into two
phases, namely construction Step I for the installation of the short lead items and
Construction Step 2 for the installation of the long lead items.



- 4 -
Construction Step 1 was awarded to Motherwell Bridge Projects (Ghana) Ltd. on
February 28, 1991. The works involved the following:
1)   Installation of LPG Marine Loading facilities;
2)    Construction of 6"6 pipeline (LPG) to the jetty;
3)    Repair/Modification of the existing pipelines to the jetty;
4)    Rebuilding of 3 No. A. T. K. storage tanks;
5)    Construction of LPG truck loading facilities; and
6)    Installation of Sprinkler System for LPG Storage Tanks.
This phase of the project started in March 1991 and was completed in March 1992
and final cost was US$2,993,247.25.
Construction Step 2 was awarded to Motherwell Bridge Projects Limited,
Scotland, on January 20, 1992 at a cost of US$3,366,213.46.
The works involved were: (i) Construction of new API Separator; (ii) Installation
of Sea Water Chlorinating Plant; (iii) Procurement & Installation of Fire Alarm System for
the whole refinery; (iv) Installation of LPG Production Improvement Plant; and (v)
Installation of Process Units Instrumentation (DCS).
The works were successfully completed and commissioned in October 1993.
FINANCING
During the project implementation, TOR identified the following important
projects and sought external financing.
a)    Construction of 2500m3 LPG Spherical tank
b)    Replacement of Bonna Pipeline and GRP Pipe; and
c)    Installation of 6.5 MW Turbo Alternator.
TOR was mindful of its financial covenants with the Bank when seeking financial
assistance for the above projects. It maintained a current ratio of more than 1.1 and also
generated net revenues of more than 1.5 times the debt servicing requirements for 1991 to
1994.



- 5 -
With regards to the Revamping project, it is the Government of Ghana that has
contracted a loan to finance it. And it will, therefore, not affect TOR's financial covenants
with the Bank.
BANK PERFORMANCE
The Bank played a crucial role in the identification and appraisal of the project
components.
Periodic supervision was carried out by the Bank during the beginning of the
implementation stage but, at a certain stage, the supervision ceased and continued at the
tail end of the project.
At the supervision meetings between the Bank, TOR, GOG and the consultant, the
Bank staff were very constructive. They ensured that the project was on course and the
quality of the work was up to standard.
The Bank's approvals for procurement and disbursement were made without
delay.
The Bank's performance on the whole was satisfactory.
PROJECT RESULTS
To a large extent, the project has achieved its objectives and has led to:
(1)   Consumption and Losses has reduced from 9% to about 6.2%.
(2)   Workforce has reduced from 650 to 340.
(3)   Pipeline leakages have substantially reduced.
(4)   Quality of LPG has improved.
(5)   LPG production has increased from 6,000/year to 10,000/year.
(6)   LPG handling at the jetty and at the refinery is safer and more efficient.
(7)   Oil pollution has reduced.
(8)   Production is efficient and more reliable.
(9)   Properly trained staff to man sophisticated equipment, and
(10)  Improved accounting system.

2.    GHANA OIL COMPANY LIMITED (GOIL)
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Whilst the project objectives, as stated in the Bank's portion of the ICR, remained
largely the same during the project, the provision of facilities for Farmers' Services
Reseller Outlets was slightly altered as GOIL felt that, instead of providing entirely new
outlets in the farming areas to bring kerosene and diesel closer to the farming
communities, mnist of its existing stations in those communities which were not going to
benefit from the IDA loan should receive the facilities originally meant for the Fanner
Service Outlets.
B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Physical Objectives
GOIL distribution facilities has expanded and made more reliable from the
provision of transport vehicles. LPG is also more readily available outside Accra and
Tema with the commissioning of the LPG plants in Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale. The
new economic transport mode, via the Volta Lake to Ghana's Northern Regions has been
made better by the linkage of Akosombo and Tema by a product pipeline (Ministry of
Energy & Mines project).
Financial Objectives
In general, the effect of the project would have been much more felt if the local
cedi component was more available. The local cedi shortage, which was a result of
increase in the working capital requirements during the currency of the project phase, was
only 40% of the expected local cedi to be made available, even though through the
saleable items purchased with IDA money, the IDA loan generated not less than d 2,056
billion. The dilapidated conditions of GOIL retail outlets were not improved as expected
because of the above reasons.
Environmental Objectives
Environmental objectives were generally met as stated in the Bank's portion of the
report.

C.    IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
Factors Subject to Government Control
The full complement of the project implementation team took ten (10) months to
be put in place. An additional reason for the thirteen (13) months initial delay in the
project was the inconsistencies and frequent changes in directives from the previous Task
Manager (IDA) of the project. This led to confusion over whether to follow Bank
guidelines or Task Manager's guidelines. Bank performance became nornal/excellent on
the changing of the Task Mangers to the present. This has helped complete the project.
Occasionally, the Bank has been too rigid in their interpretation of the guidelines,
these caused delays. The issue of continuity of Bank staff monitoring the project was not
carefully worked out by the IDA. Also, because of the change in the environmental
concerns on the project, there was a slight change in the design and this necessitated a
fresh tender for the works, causing a twelve (12) month delay. This delay was, however,
necessary.
D.    BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
Once the latter Task Manager was giving same instruction as the standard IDA
guidelines and the full complement of the project management unit was in place, the
performance of the borrower improved tremendously to very satisfactory levels.
F.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
i)    Project Management Team has to be in place before project commences.
ii)   IDA guidelines for procurement should be made available to new
beneficiaries of IDA loans.
iii)   The IDA must find ways of supporting beneficiaries of credits, operating in
countries when provision of local currency to support the IDA runs into
problems because of escalation, exchange rates and increase in the working
capital of the beneficiary, otherwise these cause delays.
iv)   IDA providing the entire financial requirement of the project would have
made the impact of the project better felt.
v)    Maintaining a single and capable Task Manager on the project augers for
the smooth execution.

3.    MINISTRY OF ENERGY & MINES
The Ministry of Energy & Mines is in the process of drawing up the scheme for the
management of all its depots after the commissioning which is set to begin on 15th June,
1995. The Ministry is bearing in mind the discussion with IDA and the proposal for GOIL
to manage to Kumasi depot will be given top most priority when the management
arrangement is made.
As part of the SOE reforms, the Government of Ghana is undertaking a
programme of total restructuring and recapitalisation of GOIL. In this connection, the
Government debt of 14.4 billion will be taken care of when the programme is started. It
must be noted that this programme is being done in collaboration with the Ministry of
Finance and State Enterprises Commission.
The signing of an agreement with VLTC for the transportation of petroleum
products through the Volta Lake is to be deferred until the management of the Bulk Oil
Storage and Transport Company is in place. This is deemed proper by the Ministry
because they will have to negotiate on the freight rate, etc., and it would not be fair for the
Ministry to do so on their behalf.
Government is currently discussing deregulation of petroleum prices and the
restructuring of the downstream activities. This will eventually bring about the bulk
procurement of crude oil in a cost effective manner.
Additional pollution control facilities to clean the refinery effluent in TOR water
will be installed under the ongoing expansion and revamping project.
