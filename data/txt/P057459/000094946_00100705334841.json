fisheries management capacity, in accord\n            with the strategic context to modernize the role of the\n            public sector. The components will: 1) strengthen the\n            management capacity of the Secretariat of Agriculture,\n            Livestock, Fisheries and Food (SAGPyA), particularly those\n            functions required under the Quota Management System,\n            including identification of service requirements, and cost\n            effective mechanisms for service delivery. Local, and\n            foreign technical assistance (TA) will be financed to review\n            key functional responsibilities, and propose institutional,\n            and operational modifications, including provision of\n            equipment, and training needs; 2) strengthen monitoring,\n            control and surveillance functions of SAGPyA, through: the\n            development of license, and quota registry; improved\n            fisheries inspection services; and, a pilot on-board\n            observer program to address research needs. Information, and\n            communication systems will be developed, supported by\n            improved hardware/software infrastructure; 3) pilot social\n            assistance action centers for unemployed fisheries workers,\n            assessing existing labor programs, targeting vulnerable\n            industry workers in coordination with cooperatives, unions,\n            and industry as a whole; and, 4) provide administrative\n            support for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2000-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
