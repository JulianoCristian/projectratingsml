However,\n            at approval time, it was realized that the project failed to\n            be included by the Ministry of Agriculture in the multi-year\n            Budget, as presented to the Ministry of Finance in mid-2001.\n            After repeated requests by the Bank, the Ministry of\n            Agriculture informed it had been compelled to prioritize its\n            requirements within a tight CY2002 budget, thus, not\n            considering the project a high priority, in addition to\n            internal conflicts potentially affecting project\n            implementation. Following the economic and political crises\n            in the country, although the new administration expressed\n            interest in the project, it was unable to assign the\n            necessary budget for the project, and, on June 13, 2002 the\n            Bank informed the Government of the formal withdrawal of the\n            loan. This Project Completion Note stipulates the Bank\n            conducted significant sector work linked to the project\n            preparation, culminating in a Rural Development Working\n            Paper, that provided an overview on marine fisheries,\n            serving as well as an advisory document on the\n            implementation of the QMS."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
