PROJECT 
COMPLETION 
NOTE 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
ARGENTINA 
SUSTAINABLE 
FISHERIES 
DEVELOPMENT  PROJECT 
(LIL:Ln. 
45790-AR) 
1. 
The  objective 
of 
the 
project  was  to  identify  innovative  and  cost-effective 
mechanisms 
for 
strengthening 
the  ocean  fisheries  management  capacity 
of 
the 
government,  which 
could 
be  expanded  in 
harmony 
with  the  implementation 
of 
a  “quota 
management system”- 
(QMS). 
The 
project 
was 
to  have  been 
the first 
Bank-financed 
project 
directly 
to support the 
implementation  of  a  “rights-based”  fisheries  management 
system, 
and  would 
have 
supported  the 
CAS 
objective 
of 
promoting  the  sustainable 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
and  the  protection 
of 
bio-diversity. 
2. 
The 
proposed 
project 
was  identified  by  the  government  and  the  Bank  in 
December 
1998,  and 
was 
prepared 
at 
the  government’s  request  with  the  assistance  of  a 
Japanese 
PHRD  grant. 
It 
was 
appraised 
in 
June  1999,  and  negotiations  for  the  proposed 
loan 
took  place 
in May 
2000. 
A 
Learning  and  Innovation  Loan  for  US$5  million  was 
approved 
by  the  Board 
on 
September 
18,2000. 
3. 
The  expected  effectiveness  date  of 
the 
loan,  as  agreed 
in 
the  Project  Appraisal 
Document,  was  October 
1 
, 
2000, 
and  the  project  was 
to 
have  been  implemented  over  a 
period 
of 
28 
months 
between 
September 
1,2000 
and  December 
31,2002. 
The  project 
unit  (the 
Project 
Executing 
Unit 
- 
UEP)  was  established  in  the  Fisheries  Sub-secretariat’ 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
of 
Agriculture2,  and  it  prepared  the  operational  manual  and  the 
management information 
system,  the  approvals 
of 
which  by  the  Bank  were 
conditions 
of 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
loan. 
4. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
signing  of  the  LIL,  it  was  discovered 
that 
the  project 
was 
not 
included 
by  SAGPyA 
in 
the 
Multi-year  Budget  it  presented 
to the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
in 
mid-200 
1. 
5. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
October 
2001, 
the 
Bank 
formally  asked  the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
to 
confirm 
whether  the 
project 
remained 
of 
importance 
to 
the  government;  no  reply 
to 
this 
letter was 
received. 
At 
this 
point,  the  Bank 
was 
informed 
by 
SAGPyA  that 
it 
had  been 
compelled 
to 
establish 
its 
priorities  with  the  prospect 
of 
a 
very  tight  budget  for 
CY2002, 
and that the 
project 
had not 
been  considered 
a 
high 
enough  priority  compared  with  other 
activities 
already 
under 
implementation. 
In 
addition,  there 
is 
some 
evidence 
that there 
were 
serious,  personal 
internal 
conflicts 
in 
SAGPyA  at 
this 
time  which  further  affected 
the 
project’s 
future,

The economic and political 
crisis 
that 
overcame 
Argentina 
in 
December 
2001 
brought with it a change in the 
authorities 
in 
SAGPyA.  The  new 
authorities expressed 
considerable interest 
in 
the project, 
and 
at the 
government’s 
request the 
eighteen-month 
deadline for 
loan 
signing, that fell 
due 
on 
March 
18,2002, 
was  extended 
by 
two  months. 
In 
spite of this, the 
government, 
in the midst 
of  the 
crisis, 
was 
unable to 
assign 
the 
necessary budget to 
the 
project. 
As 
a result, 
on  May 
17,2002, 
during the 
Country 
Project 
and Planning Review, 
the 
government 
was 
informed  that  no 
further extension 
of 
the 
signing deadline would 
be 
considered 
by 
the 
Bank. 
The 
Bank 
informed the 
government 
of 
the formal withdrawal of the 
loan 
on June 
13,2002. 
7. 
In 
addition to establishing 
itself 
and preparing the operational 
manual  and 
the 
management 
information system, the 
UEP 
made 
diligent efforts to initiate 
certain 
activities foreseen 
under 
the project, 
for 
example the organization of several 
seminars3 
and the maintenance 
of 
dialogue 
with 
the industry, within the severe 
budget 
restriction it 
faced. However, major progress 
with 
the main activities of the project could 
not  be 
attempted in the absence of 
the 
loan resources. 
8. 
During 
the 
course 
of 
project preparation 
and 
linked 
to 
it, the 
Bank  carried 
out an 
important piece 
of 
sector 
work 
that 
culminated 
in 
the 
publication 
of a 
Rural  Development 
Working Paper entitled “Argentina: Towards Rights-Based Fisheries 
Management”.  The 
report benefited from extensive consultation with 
a 
wide 
range 
of representatives 
of 
the 
fishing industry, and 
provided: 
(a) an over-view of 
the 
marine 
fisheries sector; 
(b) 
an 
advisory document on 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
QMS; 
and 
(c) 
an 
extensive 
review 
of 
international experience 
with 
the 
implementation of 
the 
QMS. 
Including 
a 
path-breaking seminar entitled “The Judicial System Position Regarding the 
Implementation 
of 
an 
Administration System Based on 
Individual, 
Transferable Capture 
Quotas” 
in 
April 
2001.
