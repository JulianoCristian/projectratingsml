modern sector; (b) for training programs to promote rural\n            development, on which some 75 percent of the population are\n            likely to depend for many years to come; (c) the expansion\n            of basic educational opportunities to a greater proportion\n            of the population than the 38 percent of the age-group now\n            reached by primary education; and (d) the strengthening of\n            planning and management, consistent with the human and\n            financial resources which the education system is likely to command."}, "docdt":
