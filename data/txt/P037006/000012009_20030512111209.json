Completion Report ratings of unsatisfactory\n            project outcome, unlikely sustainability, and negligible\n            institutional development impacts. The overall disappointing\n            performance mainly reflects over-ambitious objectives for\n            such a short implementation period, and a government change\n            at the outset, which exposed incomplete commitment to the\n            project strategy, exacerbating design, and preparation\n            shortfalls. The experience of this project confirms a number\n            of lessons: 1) in responding to emergencies, assistance in a\n            conventional project format should be limited to the\n            immediate emergency, while a series of Adjustable Program\n            Loans, may be a better instrument for longer term needs; 2)\n            a thorough political risk analysis, and ensured broad\n            political support - e.g., privatization, and utility tariff\n            modification - is essential whenever government, or policy\n            changes could occur; 3) contract management should consider,\n            and avoid potential conflicts of interest, by excluding\n            contractors who bid on the preparation of privatization\n            arrangements from bidding on supply, and construction\n            contracts, or the privatization itself; and, carefully\n            foster incentives and/or penalties in management contracts,\n            to ensure proper contractor performance; and, 4) greater\n            consistency is needed in project documents, so as to improve\n            understanding, and agreement in the statement of objectives,\n            and project description."}, "docdt": "2003-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
