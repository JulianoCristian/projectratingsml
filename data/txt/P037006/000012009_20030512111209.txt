MEMORANDUM 
TO 
THE 
EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS 
AND 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
SUBJECT: 
Performance 
Assessment 
Report 
on 
Trinidad 
and 
Tobago 
Water 
Sector 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
Project 
(Loan 
3784-TT) 
The 
loan 
of 
US$25 
million 
for 
the 
Trinidad 
and Tobago Water 
Sector 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
Project (Loan 3784-TT) 
was 
approved 
in 
August 
1994. 
It 
closed 
in 
June 
1999 
after 
a 
one-year 
extension and 
an 
undisbursed 
balance 
of 
about US$0.9 
million 
was 
subsequently cancelled. 
The 
operation 
failed 
to 
achieve 
most 
of 
its 
objectives and 
the expected 
follow-up 
investment 
support 
was 
abandoned. 
The 
project 
was 
intended 
to 
be 
the 
start 
of 
a 
rescue 
operation 
for failing 
water 
services 
leading 
to 
institutional 
reforms 
and expansion 
investments. 
It 
followed 
the 
Bank’s 
earlier 
assistance 
to public 
utility 
reform 
and 
investment. 
A 
Structural Adjustment 
Loan 
approved 
in 
1990 
focused 
on 
trade 
reform, 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the water 
and 
electricity utilities, 
and progressive 
reduction 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
by 
divestment 
of 
selected state-owned enterprises (a 
start 
was 
made 
with 
telecommunications and 
power 
generation). 
However, 
despite 
reforms 
introduced 
in 
1992 and 
1993, 
water and 
sanitation 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
Water 
and 
Sanitation 
Authority 
(WASA) 
continued 
to decline 
(with 
heavy 
decapitalization 
of 
facilities 
in 
a 
stressed 
economy) and 
WASA 
was 
near collapse. 
The 
government 
had 
sought 
Bank 
assistance 
to implement 
a 
strategy 
of 
three 
overlapping 
phases: 
(a) 
a 
Short-Term Stabilization Program 
for 
WASA; 
(b) 
a 
Rehabilitation Program 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
most 
pressing technical and 
maintenance problems; 
and 
(c) 
a 
Medium-Term 
Investment 
Program 
for 
high-priority 
expansion 
of 
works 
and 
facilities 
for 
the 
water 
sector. 
This 
report 
assesses 
the 
outcome 
of 
a fast-track 
response 
by 
the 
Bank to 
provide 
assistance 
for 
the 
first 
phase 
to 
avoid 
the 
collapse 
of 
water services and 
to 
prepare 
for 
rehabilitation 
and 
institutional 
change 
to 
ensure 
services 
for 
the 
future. 
An 
innovative 
approach 
to 
privatization 
through a 
two-stage process 
aided 
by 
private 
sector management 
was 
the 
main 
instrument. 
The 
strategy and 
project 
also 
provided 
assistance 
for 
high-priority 
strengthening 
of 
drainage 
and 
flood 
control 
measures. 
While 
the 
project 
objectives 
were, 
and 
remain, 
highly 
relevant 
to 
Trinidad’s 
needs, 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
project 
was 
unsatisfactory 
as 
there 
were 
serious 
implementation 
problems 
leading 
to 
shortfalls 
in 
plans. 
Sustainability 
is 
unlikely 
and 
institutional 
development 
impact 
is 
negligible. 
Both 
Bank 
and 
borrower 
performance 
are 
rated 
unsatisfactory. 
These 
ratings accord 
with 
those 
in 
a generally excellent 
ICR. 
The overall 
disappointing 
performance reflects 
mainly 
over-ambitious objectives 
for 
such 
a 
short 
implementation 
period 
and a government 
change at 
the 
outset 
which 
exposed 
incomplete 
commitment 
to 
the 
project 
strategy and 
which 
exacerbated 
design 
and 
preparation shortfalls. 
In 
particular 
the arrangements 
for 
private 
sector management 
and preparation 
for 
private 
operation 
of 
water 
services 
were 
not 
supported 
broadly 
enough 
such that 
were unresolved 
tensions 
for 
much 
of 
the 
project 
between 
the government, 
WASA’s 
board, 
the Bank, 
and the 
private 
management 
company, and 
WASA 
remains a 
public 
sector 
utility. 
There have 
been 
some 
service 
improvements 
(a 
small 
increase 
in 
customers supplied, water 
production, 
improved metering 
and 
Page  4
2 
billing) 
but 
some 
serious 
shortfalls 
remain 
(reliability 
of 
supply, 
minimal 
sewerage treatment, 
over-manning, and 
financial 
viability). The 
Bank 
and 
government 
did 
not 
go 
ahead 
with 
financing 
for 
the 
three 
follow-up 
operations that were 
planned 
to 
build 
on 
this 
initial 
support, 
as 
lending 
to 
Trinidad 
and 
Tobago contracted 
sharply 
in 
the 
late 
1990s. 
The 
main 
findings 
point 
especially 
to 
this 
project 
having 
been an 
ideal 
candidate 
for 
the 
Bank's 
new instrument 
(Adaptable 
Program 
Lending 
- 
APL), 
had 
it 
not 
preceded 
that 
instrument's 
introduction 
in 
1997. 
Findings 
relate 
to 
hasty 
project 
preparation 
in 
response 
to 
the 
danger 
of 
WASA' 
s 
collapse; 
confused project 
documents; that the 
interim 
operating 
agreement 
was 
flawed 
(as 
are 
well 
described 
in 
the 
ICR), 
and 
more 
so 
once 
the 
government 
changed; that 
political 
undercurrents 
of 
the water 
sector 
situation 
were 
not 
adequately 
explored 
or 
understood 
by 
the 
Bank which 
led 
to 
the 
contract 
deficiencies; 
and 
that the 
Bank's 
role 
in 
the 
project 
was 
fraught 
with 
uncertainty, 
high 
staff 
turnover 
and 
missteps 
which 
resulted 
in 
it 
muddling 
through 
to 
a 
thoroughly 
unsatisfactory conclusion. 
The 
experience 
of 
this 
project confirms 
a 
number 
of 
OED 
lessons: 
Resoonding 
to 
emergencies: assistance 
in 
a 
conventional project format should 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
immediate 
emergency, 
while 
a 
series 
of 
Adjustable Program Loans 
may 
be a better 
instrument 
for 
longer 
term 
needs; 
Political 
factors: 
thorough 
political 
risk 
analysis 
and, 
in 
the 
process, 
enlistment 
of 
broad 
political 
support 
for 
sensitive 
changes 
such 
as 
privatization 
and 
utility 
tariff 
modification, 
is 
essential 
if 
there 
is 
any chance 
of 
government 
changing 
and 
of 
this 
leading 
to 
a change 
in 
policy; 
Management 
contracts: 
(a) 
to 
avoid 
actual 
or 
apparent 
conflicts 
of 
interest, 
contractors 
who 
bid 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
privatization 
arrangement 
should 
be 
excluded 
from 
bidding 
on 
supply 
and 
construction 
contracts, 
or 
on 
the 
privatization 
itself, and 
(b) 
there 
must 
be 
a 
careful 
mix of 
incentives and 
penalties, 
with 
checks and 
balances, 
in 
management contracts 
to 
ensure 
performance 
by 
the contractor 
without 
suspicion 
of 
impropriety, 
and 
Bank 
oroiect 
documentation: a greater 
degree 
of 
consistency 
in 
project 
documents 
is 
needed 
to 
improve 
understanding 
and 
agreement, 
especially 
in 
the statement 
of 
objectives 
and 
project 
description.

OED 
Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence 
in 
evaluation. 
About 
this 
Report 
The Operations Evaluation 
Department assesses 
the programs 
and 
activities 
of 
the World Bank for two 
purposes: 
first, 
to 
ensure 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
Bank's 
self-evaluation process 
and 
to 
verify that the Bank's 
work 
is 
producing the expected 
results, 
and second, 
to help 
develop 
improved directions, policies, and procedures through 
the dissemination 
of 
lessons drawn from experience. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
work, 
OED 
annually assesses 
about 
25 
percent 
of 
the Bank's lending operations. 
In 
selecting operations 
for assessment, 
preference is given to those that are 
innovative, large, 
or 
complex; those that 
are 
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which 
Executive Directors 
or 
Bank 
management 
have 
requested assessments; and 
those that 
are 
likely 
to 
generate 
important lessons. The projects, 
topics, 
and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger evaluation 
studies. 
A Project Performance 
Assessment 
Report 
(PPAR) 
is 
based 
on 
a review 
of 
the Implementation Completion 
Report (a self-evaluation by the 
responsible Bank department) and 
fieldwork conducted 
by OED. 
To prepare 
PPARs, 
OED staff examine project 
files 
and other 
documents, 
interview operational staff, 
and 
in most cases 
visit 
the borrowing country for 
onsite 
discussions with 
project staff and 
beneficiaries. The 
PPAR 
thereby seeks 
to 
validate and augment the information provided in the 
ICR, as well as examine 
issues 
of 
special interest 
to 
broader 
OED studies. 
Each 
PPAR 
is subject 
to 
a 
peer review 
process 
and 
OED 
management 
approval. Once cleared internally, the 
PPAR 
is reviewed 
by 
the responsible 
Bank department and amended as 
necessary, The completed 
PPAR 
is then 
sent 
to 
the borrower 
for review; 
the borrowers' 
comments are 
attached 
to 
the 
document that 
is 
sent to 
the 
Bank's 
Board 
of 
Executive Directors. 
After an assessment report has 
been 
sent 
to 
the 
Board, 
it is disclosed 
to 
the public. 
About 
the 
OED 
Rating System 
The time-tested evaluation 
methods 
used 
by OED 
are 
suited 
to 
the broad 
range 
of 
the World 
Bank's 
work. 
The methods offer both rigor 
and 
a necessary level 
of 
flexibility 
to 
adapt 
to 
lending instrument, project 
design, 
or 
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all 
apply 
the 
same 
basic 
method to 
arrive 
at 
their project ratings. Following is 
the definition and rating scale 
used 
for each evaluation criterion 
(more 
information is available on the OED 
website: 
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.

The

was 
closed 
on 
June 
30, 
1999, 
one 
year 
after 
the

is 
based 
on 
the

staff. 
An 
Operations 
Evaluation 
Department (OED) 
mission visited 
Trinidad 
and 
Tobago 
in 
April 
2002 
to 
discuss the effectiveness 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
assistance 
with 
the government, 
project 
implementing 
agencies, 
private 
sector 
agencies, 
and 
other 
stakeholders. 
The 
cooperation 
and 
assistance 
of 
government 
officials, 
management, 
and 
staff 
of 
WASA, 
stakeholders, 
and 
other 
interested parties 
are 
gratefully 
acknowledged. 
This 
PAR 
assesses 
the 
outcome 
of 
an 
attempt 
by 
the 
Bank to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
a 
public 
water 
supply 
utility 
that 
was 
struggling 
to 
survive 
and 
to 
continue 
to 
provide 
services 
to 
its 
customers. 
An 
innovative 
approach 
to 
privatization 
through 
a two-stage process 
aided 
by 
management 
agents 
was 
the 
main 
instrument. 
The 
assessment 
took 
place 
more 
than 
seven years 
after 
the 
loan 
was 
approved 
and 
three years 
after 
loan 
closing, 
by 
which 
time 
results 
of 
the 
initiative 
were evident. 
Following 
standard 
OED 
procedures, 
this 
draft 
PAR 
will 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
borrower 
for 
comments 
before 
it 
is 
finalized. 
All 
comments 
will 
be taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
final 
version 
and 
will 
be 
included 
as 
an 
attachment 
to 
the 
PAR. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
disclosure 
policy, 
the 
final 
report 
will 
be 
available 
to 
the 
public 
following 
submission 
to 
the

Bank’s 
Board 
of

1. 
Background 
1.1 
Trinidad 
and Tobago 
consists 
of 
the largest 
island 
(Trinidad) 
in 
the southern Caribbean, 
plus 
Tobago 
to 
its 
northeast. 
The 
population 
of 
1.3 
million 
is 
concentrated 
in 
the 
northeast 
of 
Trinidad 
in 
the 
capital, 
Port 
of 
Spain, 
and 
in 
two 
conurbation 
corridors 
eastward 
and 
southward 
from 
the 
capital 
to 
the 
towns 
of 
Arima 
and 
San 
Fernando 
respectively. Based 
on 
petrochemicals 
exploited 
since 
1908, 
the economy 
is 
the 
most 
industrialized 
in 
the 
Caribbean 
and average 
incomes 
are 
in 
the 
upper 
middle-income 
range. 
The 
economy 
experienced 
boom 
years 
while 
oil 
prices were 
high 
during 
the 
1970s, 
but 
too 
little 
of 
the 
boom 
had 
lasting 
domestic 
impact. 
In 
the 
period 
of 
financial 
stringency 
following 
the 
boom, 
as 
average 
incomes about 
halved 
during 
the 
1980s, 
the 
water and 
sanitation 
sector 
infrastructure deteriorated 
as 
investment 
declined 
and 
routine 
repairs 
and 
maintenance were neglected.’ 
By 
the 
early 
1990s 
service 
had 
fallen 
to 
low 
levels, 
performance 
of 
the 
public 
Water and 
Sewerage 
Authority (WASA) 
was 
poor, 
and 
low 
service 
charges and 
collection 
rates 
made 
WASA’s 
operations 
financially 
unsustainable. 
1.2 
infrastructure, 
reforms 
and 
institutional 
strengthening 
to 
increase 
public 
investment, 
increasing 
the effectiveness 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
private 
sector 
development, and 
improving 
human 
resources. 
A 
Structural Adjustment 
Loan 
approved 
in 
1990 
focused 
on 
trade 
reform, 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the water and 
electricity utilities, 
and 
progressive 
reduction 
of 
the 
public 
sector 
by 
divestment 
of 
selected state-owned enterprises (a start 
was 
made 
with 
telecommunications 
and 
power 
generation). 
However, 
despite 
reforms introduced 
in 
1992 
and 
1993 
water 
and sanitation 
services 
continued 
to 
decline 
until 
WASA 
was 
near collapse. 
The 
Bank’s 
assistance 
strategy 
in 
the 
early 
1990s 
gave 
priority 
to 
rehabilitation 
of 
public 
1.3 
Bank 
assistance 
to 
implement 
a 
strategy 
of 
three 
overlapping 
phases: 
a 
Short-Term 
Stabilization 
Program 
for 
WASA; 
a 
Rehabilitation 
Program 
for 
the 
water sector 
and 
flood 
control to 
handle 
the 
most 
pressing technical and 
maintenance problems, 
and a 
Medium-Term 
Investment 
Program 
for 
high-priority 
expansion 
of 
works and 
facilities 
for 
the 
water 
sector, 
and 
drainage 
and 
flood 
control. 
To 
resolve 
the emergency 
and 
provide 
expanded 
future 
services the 
government 
sought 
2. 
The 
Project 
Design 
2.1 
The 
Water 
Sector 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
Project 
(WSIS) 
was 
described 
as 
a 
“fast- 
track” project 
to 
execute the 
first 
(stabilization) 
phase 
of 
the government’s  strategy, prepare 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
private 
sector 
equity 
partner 
to 
operate the water sector 
system, 
and 
to 
complete preparation 
of 
two 
major 
projects 
(the 
ICR 
notes that 
they were 
already 
under 
preparation) 
that 
would 
follow 
in 
the 
rehabilitation 
and investment 
phases. 
These 
were a 
Water 
Sector 
Rehabilitation Project 
(WSRP) 
and a 
Drainage 
and 
Flood Control 
Project 
(DFCP). 
The 
WSIS project 
was 
prepared, 
appraised, 
and 
negotiated 
in 
just 
five 
months 
to 
forestall 
the 
’. 
Between 1982 
and 1992, 
when 
the 
economy 
was 
in 
difficulty 
because 
of 
lower 
oil 
revenues, 
it 
has 
been estimated 
that 
WASA’s 
decapitalization totaled 
TT$525 
million, 
or 
half 
of 
total 
facility 
replacement 
costs, 
despite 
large 
government 
subsidies.

imminent 
collapse 
of 
WASA.’ 
Beyond 
avoiding 
the 
immediate 
risk 
of 
service 
failure, 
the 
government’s 
longer-term 
objectives were 
to 
secure 
better 
quality 
water 
and 
wastewater services, 
at 
lower 
cost, 
and 
without public 
subsidies. 
A 
privatization 
strategy 
was 
chosen 
to 
achieve 
this 
as 
described 
in 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
the President 
(MOP) 
in 
proposing 
support 
for 
the 
project: 
“The 
main 
thrust.. 
. 
. 
is 
to 
seek 
a 
private 
sector 
partner 
who 
would 
take a 
substantial 
equity 
interest 
in 
production, 
treatment and 
distribution 
of 
water and 
the 
provision 
of 
sewerage services. 
The 
government recognizes 
that 
given 
the 
present 
financial and physical 
condition 
of 
WASA, 
the 
attainment 
of 
this 
goal 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
a two-stage 
process. 
The 
first, 
involves 
bringing 
in 
an 
experienced 
private 
sector 
operator 
under contract 
to 
manage 
WASA’s 
water 
and 
waste water 
operations; the second 
phase 
will 
be 
a 
move 
to 
equity 
partnership 
once the basic 
rehabilitation 
of WASA 
has 
been 
completed 
and the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
designed 
and 
implemented.” 
(para. 
8) 
The implementation 
schedule 
of 
the strategy 
was 
highly 
ambitious-it 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
only 
41 
months 
(from 
August 
1994 
through 
1997). 
The 
sequencing 
of 
activities 
under the three 
phases was 
also 
ambitious 
(but 
none 
too 
clear 
in 
the documents) 
as 
implementing 
the second 
and 
third 
phases was 
to 
begin 
soon after the 
project 
started 
and 
was 
contingent 
upon 
project 
actions.3 
The 
WASA 
rehabilitation 
part 
of 
the 
second 
phase 
was 
to 
start 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
private 
sector manager 
had 
been 
chosen, 
while 
the drainage and 
flood 
control 
part 
of 
the 
second 
phase 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
“mainly 
in 
1995,” 
and the drainage 
and 
flood 
control 
investments, 
under 
the 
third 
phase, 
were 
to 
start 
in 
1996. 
Objectives 
2.2 
Some 
unraveling 
of 
the 
project 
descriptions 
in 
the 
project 
documents 
was 
required 
to 
arrive 
at an 
evaluable 
framework. 
The project’s 
main 
objective 
of 
record 
as 
stated 
in 
the 
MOP 
was 
implementing 
the 
Short 
Term 
Stabilization Program by: 
0 
providing 
essential technical 
and 
material 
resources 
(during 
six months 
of 
transition 
to 
private 
sector management) 
to 
prevent 
WASA’ 
s 
collapse; 
preparing 
and 
implementing 
private 
sector 
management 
of 
WASA, 
including 
preparing 
for 
transfer 
of WASA 
to 
a 
private 
operator; 
and 
preparing and implementing 
an 
integrated 
water 
resources 
management 
strategy.

It 
was 
also 
to: 
0 
design 
the 
second 
(rehabilitation) 
and 
third 
(investment) 
phases 
for 
water 
supply and 
waste-water 
facilities, 
and 
for 
drainage 
and 
flood 
control 
(which 
were 
to 
begin 
during 
the 
project 
period). 
However, 
the statement 
of 
objectives 
and project description 
is 
organized 
quite 
differently 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement, 
which 
must 
have caused 
some 
confusion. 
This 
issue 
is 
discussed 
in 
more 
detail 
’. 
Requiring 
only 
13.6 
staff 
weeks 
of 
inputs (this 
is 
the number 
on 
record 
but 
it 
seems 
extraordinarily low). 
The quick 
preparation and 
few 
resources 
used must have 
contributed 
to 
design, process 
and documentation 
issues 
discussed 
later. 
’. 
Moreover, more “fast-track”  processing 
of 
Bank 
loans 
for 
the 
follow-up 
projects 
would 
have been 
required 
if 
the 
schedule 
was 
to 
be 
maintained.

decision 
to 
replace 
ineffectual 
public 
sector 
management 
of 
WASA 
with 
private 
management, 
but 
to 
accomplish 
this 
in 
two 
stages: 
first 
by 
awarding 
an 
interim 
short 
term 
management contract (to 
manage 
the 
immediate 
high 
priority 
investments, 
training

and

for 
the

on 
a 
long

to

The 
ICR 
commented 
(in 
a 
degree 
of 
understatement) that the 
project 
objectives 
could 
have 
been stated 
more 
consistently 
across 
different project 
documents, 
but 
did 
not 
itself 
present 
a 
fully 
adequate 
revision. 
This 
report 
explores 
the 
point 
further 
in 
Annex 
C 
because 
inadequate 
statements 
of 
objectives 
and 
project 
descriptions 
are 
a 
frequent 
issue 
in 
project 
documents and must 
complicate implementation 
and 
Bank/Borrower 
dialogues. 
Annex 
C 
also 
contains 
for 
reference 
details 
of 
project 
components 
as 
listed 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement, 
but 
this 
does 
not 
add 
clarity 
to 
the 
project 
description 
as 
it 
follows 
the 
MOP’S 
project 
objectives 
structure 
with 
more 
confusion 
added 
by 
different 
order 
and 
labeling 
of 
items.

the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Utilities 
(responsible 
for 
WASA 
activities), 
in 
WASA 
itself, 
and 
in 
MoWT. 
Terms 
of 
reference 
for 
consultants and 
staff 
training 
requirements 
were 
also 
prepared 
ahead 
of 
approval. 
A 
detailed timetable 
for 
implementation 
was 
drawn 
up 
and 
it 
was 
agreed that 
the 
government and 
the 
Bank 
would 
review 
progress 
annually. 
During 
negotiations the 
government 
had 
agreed 
to 
several 
time-bound 
actions. 
One 
was 
a 
subsidiary 
agreement 
for 
transfer 
of 
funds 
for WASA’s 
Emergency 
Operational 
Fund 
(to 
fund 
the 
stabilization 
program) 
and 
for 
technical 
assistance 
for 
project 
preparation 
and 
privatization (which 
was 
conditional 
on 
WASA 
reducing 
its 
arrears 
to 
trade creditors). 
A 
second was 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
the water sector 
and 
associated 
legislation. 
A 
third 
was 
a 
plan 
for 
water 
tariff 
review 
toward 
implementing 
the government’s 
policy for 
cost 
recovery 
by 
utility 
services. 
Three project implementation 
units 
were 
established 
before 
the 
project 
was 
approved, 
in 
3.2 
The 
project 
was 
not 
implemented 
as 
planned 
and delays 
and 
implementation problems 
contributed 
to 
sometimes 
poor 
relations between 
the government, 
WASA, 
the 
management 
contractor, and 
the 
Bank. 
The loan 
was 
extended 
for 
a 
year, 
despite 
poor 
performance, 
to 
allow 
the 
Bank 
to 
contribute 
through 
the 
last 
year 
of 
the 
interim 
private 
management 
contract 
when 
the 
government 
was 
finalizing 
its 
strategy 
for 
the 
long-term 
private 
operation 
of 
WASA. 
3.3 
fully 
resolved. 
The 
project 
suffered 
from 
a 
series 
of 
crippling 
implementation problems 
that 
could not 
be 
0 
Just 
after 
the 
IOA 
was 
signed 
the government 
changed 
in 
an 
election 
and 
a 
new 
WASA 
board 
was 
appointed. 
The new 
board 
and government were 
less enthusiastic 
about the 
project 
arrangements 
and 
suspicious about the 
propriety 
of 
the 
contract 
negotiated 
by 
the 
previous 
government-review 
of 
the 
contract 
had 
been an 
item 
in 
the 
winning 
party’s 
election 
platform. 
Ministerial 
intervention 
was needed 
to 
resolve 
the 
issue, 
but 
at the 
expense 
of 
a 
six-month 
delay 
while 
the 
contract 
was 
reviewed 
and 
eventually approved 
with 
only 
one 
change. 
Even 
so 
the 
working 
relationships 
continued 
to 
be 
difficult 
from 
then 
on, 
colored 
by 
distrust 
on 
both 
sides 
as 
a 
result 
of 
basic 
flaws 
in 
the 
IOA 
arrangements 
(as 
discussed 
further 
below), and 
the 
IOA 
management 
team 
was 
unable 
to 
manage 
WASA 
operations 
directly.

There 
were 
performance shortfalls 
by 
the 
private 
operator. 
The 
WASA 
board had 
misgivings 
about the performance 
and 
suitability 
of 
some 
IOA 
team 
members 
and 
most 
of 
the 
first 
IOA 
team 
was 
replaced 
after 
a 
year. 
The 
foreign 
managers 
had 
difficulty 
adapting 
to 
the 
local 
customs, 
style, and practices, and 
WASA 
staff 
and 
board 
members 
felt 
that 
their 
operational proposals and 
methods were 
not 
sufficiently 
attuned 
to local 
cultural 
norms 
and capabilities. 
The 
attempted 
introduction 
of 
British 
management 
systems 
is 
believed 
by 
WASA 
staff to 
have been 
impractical 
and 
a 
more 
selective 
approach 
was 
needed 
in 
Trinidad 
conditions. There were 
also 
problems 
with 
a 
proprietary 
maintenance management system 
(STORMS) 
that 
was 
not 
totally 
handed over 
to 
WASA 
(and 
so 
required 
continued contractor 
inputs), 
and 
the 
expertise 
required 
was 
beyond 
WASA’s 
capabilities. 
0 
The Bank for 
its 
part 
did 
not 
provide 
consistent 
leadership 
as 
the task manager 
changed 
five 
times over 
the 
five 
years 
of 
the 
project 
relationship. 
Each 
new 
task 
manager 
brought 
a 
different 
perspective 
to 
the 
project 
and 
their supervision 
task, 
which 
the 
Trinidad 
staff 
saw 
as 
repeated 
moving 
of 
the 
project 
goalposts. Changes 
in 
WASA 
management also 
contributed 
to 
implementation problems 
and delays. 
The 
government’s 
ICR 
mentions 
policy 
changes 
and 
other problems 
that affected 
implementation 
adversely 
but 
the 
Bank’s 
ICR 
does 
not 
respond 
to 
these issues.

The 
confused 
project 
documents 
(no doubt 
exacerbated 
by 
staff 
changes 
on 
both 
sides) 
contributed 
to 
misunderstandings 
over 
what 
was 
meant 
to 
be 
done 
under 
the 
project, 
for 
example, over the 
financing 
of 
water 
meters, 
which 
were 
essential 
to 
improved 
bill 
collection.

achieved. 
WASA 
remains a 
publicly 
managed 
utility, 
but 
with 
some 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
infrastructure 
repairs 
and 
maintenance and 
in 
some 
corporate functions. 
WASA 
management 
sees 
these 
areas 
of 
private 
sector 
activity 
as 
a 
viable 
alternative 
to 
the 
project’s 
wholesale 
privatization 
strategy, 
but 
the 
ultimate 
proof 
lies 
in 
improved 
coverage 
and performance 
indicators, 
which 
have 
improved slightly or 
stagnated 
(see 
below)? 
Implementation 
shortfalls 
are 
demonstrated 
by 
performance 
against 
34 
indicators 
of 
actions 
and outputs 
reported 
in 
the 
ICR 
The project 
was 
only 
partially 
implemented 
and 
the 
major 
objectives 
could 
not 
be 
’. 
The 
government’s 
ICR 
puts 
its 
wasted 
expenses at 
US$2.7 
million 
and 
suggests 
that the 
Bank 
meet that 
expense. 
The 
Bank 
did 
not 
respond 
in 
its 
ICR. 
‘. 
The 
Bank 
was 
concerned about a number 
of 
issues, 
but 
primarily 
over the 
future 
viability 
of 
WASA 
(on 
which 
it 
did 
detailed 
work 
through a 
skilled 
senior 
specialist), 
but 
the 
government eventually backed 
down 
from 
the 
project 
on 
the 
grounds that 
it 
could not 
meet 
the 
Bank’s 
requirements. 
The 
government perceived a substantial toughening 
of 
the 
Bank’s 
conditionality 
to the 
point 
where further 
borrowing 
became 
impractical 
in 
its 
view. 
’. 
It 
is 
worth noting 
that 
privatization 
itself 
is 
not 
the 
major 
objective, 
which 
is 
efficient provision 
of 
water 
sector 
services, 
with 
privatization 
the means 
of 
achieving this end 
where 
public 
service 
provision 
has 
proved 
inadequate.

Of 
the 
34 
indicators 
only 
12 
were completed 
and 
4 
are 
ongoing. 
Moreover 
some 
of 
these 
completed indicators 
are 
not 
substantive 
but 
are 
merely 
administrative 
steps 
(such 
as 
appointment 
of 
advisors, start 
of 
an audit, 
completion 
of 
bidding 
documents, 
start 
of 
bidding, 
and setting 
up 
a 
steering committee),  such that 
their 
completion 
is 
of 
relatively 
minor 
significance.

purchase 
of 
critical 
supplies, 
but 
other 
activities 
suffered 
from 
delays, changed plans, 
and 
lack 
of 
support. 
Even 
so, 
operational 
improvements 
reported 
by 
the 
ICR 
are 
significant, 
including 30 
percent increased 
water 
production, 
markedly 
reduced 
plant 
down-time, 
revenue 
collection 
up 
by 
60 
percent 
and 
staff 
reduction 
by 
32 
percent 
(from 
3,507 
to 
2,394, 
but 
is 
now 
increasing 
again). 
Service 
delivery 
data 
is 
more 
mixed, 
as 
shown 
by 
the 
indicators 
in 
Table 
4. 
Whereas 
the 
share 
of 
households 
connected 
to 
water supply 
has 
risen, 
as 
has 
the 
metered water and customer 
billing, 
the 
proportion 
of 
households 
with 
continuous supply 
has 
fallen 
markedly 
as 
available 
supplies are 
being 
allocated 
among more 
connectionsP 
The very 
low 
sewer 
connection 
ratio 
has 
not 
changed (many 
newer 
housing 
areas 
have 
private 
systems, 
but 
most 
are 
said 
to be 
failing 
or 
inoperative). 
This 
marginally improved 
performance, 
with 
some 
tariff 
increase, 
resulted 
in 
the 
working ratio 
(operating 
costsh-evenue) 
almost 
breaking 
even 
at 
97 
percent 
in 
1998-99, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
against 
a target 
of 
75 
percent. 
During 
the 
OED 
mission, 
WASA 
staff reported 
progress 
on 
major 
construction 
schemes 
(which 
should 
have gone 
ahead 
during 
the 
project 
period 
had 
funds 
been 
available), 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
change 
these 
numbers 
substantially. 
The 
major 
initial 
achievement 
was 
largely 
avoiding 
the 
collapse 
of 
WASA 
and 
its 
4.3 
strategy, 
completion 
of 
a 
WASA 
restructuring 
study, 
delinking 
the 
Water 
Resources 
Agency 
(WRA) 
from 
WASA, 
and enactment 
of 
a 
law 
to 
establish a Regulated Industries 
Commission 
(with 
follow-up 
matters ongoing). 
Removing 
WRA’ 
s 
policy 
and 
strategy 
work 
leaves 
WASA 
to 
focus 
on 
production 
and 
service 
delivery. The 
major 
shortfalls 
included 
that 
once the 
Bank 
follow-up 
loan 
was 
dropped the 
major 
function 
of 
the 
IOA 
team 
in 
rehabilitation 
management 
became 
redundant 
and 
nothing 
was 
done 
on 
the 
various 
tasks 
to 
prepare 
for 
divestiture 
of 
WASA. 
On 
the 
drainage 
and 
flood 
control 
component, 
the 
drainage 
division 
of 
MoWT 
was 
not 
reorganized. 
Other 
principle 
achievements 
are 
the development 
of 
a water 
resource management 
*. 
The 
costs 
to 
consumers 
of 
intermittent 
supplies 
are 
well 
recognized.

Findings 
5.1 
A 
number 
of 
the 
assessment's 
findings 
point to 
future 
projects 
of 
this 
type 
being good 
candidates 
for 
Adaptable 
Program 
Lending 
(APL) 
instrument, 
which 
was 
not 
available 
at 
that 
time. 
Thus 
APLs 
are 
intended 
to 
be flexible, 
and 
to 
provide 
an 
opportunity, 
inter 
alia, 
to 
test 
approaches 
where 
sensitive 
policy 
issues 
and 
political 
uncertainty 
make 
traditional 
instruments 
too 
risky. 
0 
Hasty 
project preparation 
in 
response 
to 
the danger 
of 
WASA's 
imminent 
collapse 
resulted 
in 
insufficiently 
broad 
consultations and 
agreement and a 
lack 
of 
appreciation 
of 
political 
risks. 
Haste 
must 
also 
explain 
in 
large 
measure the 
confused 
documentation, 
which 
must 
have 
contributed 
to 
later 
misunderstandings. 
There 
was 
confusion 
in 
the 
project 
documents 
between 
the strategy 
of 
the 
project 
and the 
different 
descriptions 
of 
the 
project 
content 
in 
the 
MOP 
and 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
(see 
Table 
1, 
Annex 
C). 
These 
differences 
are 
significant 
and 
could 
not 
have helped 
implementation 
agencies 
and 
staff 
who 
were 
responsible 
for 
project 
execution 
to 
understand 
the 
work 
they 
were doing. 
Agreeing 
on 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
operation 
would 
have been 
critical 
at 
the 
time 
the 
project 
was 
being 
prepared and negotiated, 
and 
more 
so 
during 
implementation 
with 
a change 
of 
government 
and 
with 
the 
Bank 
and 
government 
beginning 
to 
drift 
apart 
in 
their 
relationship. Such 
agreement 
must 
have been 
difficult 
without 
clear documents. 
0 
A 
specific 
point 
of 
some 
importance 
and confusion 
was 
exactly 
when 
the long-term 
rehabilitation 
expenditure 
was 
expected 
to 
occur-during 
the 
IOA 
or 
later through 
privatization? The 
original intention 
of 
rehabilitation 
investment 
beginning 
a year 
into 
the 
IOA 
was 
later 
questioned 
by 
the 
Bank 
on 
the 
grounds that experience elsewhere 
had 
shown 
that investment before divestiture 
did 
not 
generate adequate returns 
to 
either the government 
or 
the 
private 
operator, 
and 
had 
especially 
limited 
the 
options 
open 
to 
the 
private 
operator. 
0 
The 
Interim 
Operating 
Agreement 
was 
doomed 
from 
the 
outset, 
and 
more 
so 
once the 
government 
changed. 
The 
reasons 
have 
been eloquently 
described 
in 
the 
ICR 
(Box 
2) 
and 
Page  20
8 
cannot 
be 
improved. 
The 
assessment agrees 
with 
these 
comments 
but, 
in 
contrast 
with 
the 
ICR, 
regards 
the 
change 
of 
government 
just 
after the contract 
was 
signed 
as 
merely 
hastening 
the demise 
of 
what 
were 
inherently 
unsatisfactory 
arrangements. 
Field 
enquiries 
suggest 
that 
WASA’ 
s 
board 
had 
such serious 
and 
understandable 
misgivings 
about 
IOA 
implementation 
that 
the arrangement 
would 
have foundered 
in 
any 
case. 
The 
main 
complaints 
were: 
rehabilitation contracting and 
expenditure 
without 
adequate 
oversight 
and performance 
incentives; performance 
concerns 
(some 
inappropriate appointments 
to 
the 
consultants’ 
team 
making 
it 
long 
in 
experience, 
of 
mainly 
British 
public 
sector 
water works, 
but 
short 
in 
energy, 
flexibility, 
and 
cultural 
sensitivities); and 
that the 
IOA 
team 
was 
not making 
progress 
on 
the 
main 
problem-a 
shortage 
of 
water 
supplies. 
The 
political undercurrents 
of 
the 
water situation were 
not 
adequately 
explored 
or 
understood 
by 
the 
Bank. 
In 
hindsight 
the 
soundness 
of 
the 
project 
strategy 
of 
privatization 
through 
the 
introduction 
of 
an 
overseas 
partner 
has 
been 
undermined 
by 
experience 
and 
controversy 
elsewhere. 
Privatization 
of 
a 
run-down 
and 
insolvent 
enterprise, 
before 
it 
has 
been 
rehabilitated, 
implies raising 
income 
if 
the investment 
costs 
are 
to 
be 
recovered 
and 
a 
satisfactory 
return 
on 
capital 
is 
to 
be 
made. 
Raising 
the 
price 
of 
domestic water 
supplies, 
even 
in 
a 
middle-income country 
such 
as 
Trinidad 
and 
Tobago, 
is 
bound 
to 
cause a 
political 
reaction. 
Expecting 
that 
this 
could be 
achieved 
successfully 
in 
a 
water 
utility 
managed 
by 
an 
entity 
of 
the 
former colonial power 
seems 
to 
be 
beyond 
reasonable 
probability, 
especially 
when 
aspects 
of 
the earlier 
privatization 
of 
the 
UKs 
own 
water 
utilities 
was 
being 
subjected 
to 
critical 
public 
comment 
in 
the 
press. 
The credibility 
of 
the 
strategy 
was 
undermined 
further 
by 
the 
inadequacies 
of 
the 
contractual 
arrangement 
between 
the government and 
its 
IOA 
partner, 
which 
allowed 
ample 
room for 
speculation 
on 
the 
propriety 
of 
the relationship. 
The 
WASA 
board 
reacted 
by 
closely 
controlling 
the 
situation. 
Box

Interim 
Operating 
Agreement-Flawed 
and 
Handicapped 
(ICR 
para. 
21) 
“In 
retrospect, 
the 
IOA 
never 
really 
had 
much 
of 
an 
opportunity 
to succeed. 
One, 
neither 
the 
IOA, 
nor 
the 
chosen operator, had 
the 
support and the 
commitment 
of 
the 
WASA 
Board. 
The 
IOA 
was 
negotiated 
by 
the 
previous Government 
and 
at 
least 
some 
members 
of 
WASA’s 
new 
Board 
started 
the 
process 
with 
a 
high 
level 
of 
skepticism 
and 
distrust. 
Two, 
this 
distrust 
was 
compounded 
by 
the 
fact that 
the 
contract 
itself 
was 
poorly 
designed, 
a fact 
now widely 
accepted 
within 
the 
Government 
and the 
Bank. 
The 
contractor had 
little 
at 
stake, 
the 
management 
fees 
[structure] 
was 
not effectively 
linked 
to performance 
measures 
as 
these 
had 
been 
left 
undefined. Though 
the 
contract 
did 
foresee 
six indicators 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
determination 
of 
fees, 
the 
contract 
did 
not 
specify 
these 
performance indicators, 
which 
were 
to 
be 
agreed 
during 
the 
contract 
period, 
with 
data 
generated 
by 
the 
contractor. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
contractor 
also 
had a 
significant 
upside 
with 
sole 
source 
rights to 
capital works 
initiated 
within 
the 
contract period. 
This 
combination 
of 
lack 
of 
accountability 
for 
results, 
low 
risks 
and 
a 
high 
potential 
upside 
for capital 
works compounded 
the 
natural 
distrust 
of 
the 
“foreign”  contractor. 
Three, 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
WASA 
remained 
unchanged. 
Though 
TTWS 
took over 
management, 
it 
continued 
to 
be 
supervised 
by 
WASA’s 
Board 
of 
Directors which 
had 
earlier 
supervised 
a 
public 
utility. 
With 
a 
private 
management arrangement 
a 
clearer 
separation 
of 
the 
Board’s 
policy 
and 
oversight 
role 
and 
TTWS’ 
management 
role 
was 
required 
and 
this 
did 
not 
take place. 
This 
ambiguity allowed 
the 
Board 
to interpret 
its 
role 
and 
duties 
broadly 
and 
at 
least 
some 
members 
of 
the 
Board 
sought 
to 
involve 
themselves 
actively 
in 
WASA 
management, 
leading 
to 
delays and 
conflicts, 
and 
not 
giving 
the 
management 
contractor 
the 
space 
and 
authority 
to 
manage. 
Finally, 
the 
situation 
was 
complicated 
by 
the 
fact that 
the 
World 
Bank financing 
for 
rehabilitation 
works expected 
to 
accompany 
the 
management 
contract 
was 
delayed, 
and 
eventually 
cancelled. 
This 
became 
a 
rallying 
point 
both 
for 
the 
contractor 
and 
the 
Government 
as 
another 
reason 
for 
less 
than expected 
improvements 
in 
WASA.”

The 
Bank’s 
role 
in 
the 
project 
was 
similarly 
fraught 
with 
uncertainty 
and 
missteps 
that 
resulted 
in 
it 
muddling 
through to 
a 
thoroughly 
unsatisfactory 
conclusion 
to 
the project. Three 
points 
stand 
out 
as 
reflecting 
loose 
Bank 
supervision and 
management 
oversight 
of 
the 
project. 
First, 
because 
the 
IOA 
contract 
was 
crucial 
to 
the 
project’s 
success 
the 
Bank 
should 
have been 
closely 
involved 
in 
its 
design 
and detailed particulars. 
However, 
uncertainty 
remains 
as 
to 
whether the 
Bank 
was 
concerned 
sufficiently 
about 
this 
contract 
to 
want 
to 
have 
any 
influence. 
Even 
the 
ICR 
is 
contradictory 
on 
the 
point, 
referring 
in 
the summary (para. 
8) 
to 
the 
Bank 
having 
“endorsed” the contract 
with 
reservations, 
but 
in 
the 
main 
text 
saying that 
there was “no  evidence 
of 
any 
formal 
no-objection 
by 
the 
Bank” 
to 
the 
contract. Whatever 
actually 
happened, 
it 
is 
clear that the 
Bank 
did 
not 
adequately 
insist 
on, 
or hold 
out 
for 
changes 
in 
some 
of 
the 
areas 
where the 
contract 
was 
flawed 
(board 
role, 
single 
source 
contracting, 
lack 
of 
performance incentives and 
penalties, 
and 
poor 
arrangements 
for 
monitoring 
of 
performance). 
Second, 
the 
Bank 
failed 
during 
supervision 
to 
take 
effective 
action 
to 
rescue 
a bad situation. 
Its 
attempt 
to 
have the 
WASA 
board 
replaced, 
apparently 
to 
allow 
the 
project 
to 
proceed 
as 
planned, 
which 
would 
have 
removed 
all 
checks 
on 
the 
contractors’ 
activities 
under a 
seriously one-sided contract, 
is 
difficult 
to 
understand 
in 
retrospect. 
Third, 
the 
Bank 
continued 
for 
too 
long to 
give positive 
signals 
on 
the prospects 
for 
follow-up 
financing 
for 
rehabilitation 
contracts, 
as 
its 
financing 
intentions 
became 
uncertain. 
Consequently, 
some 
significant’costs 
were 
incurred 
that 
might 
have been 
avoided 
with 
more 
open 
communication 
on 
the 
point.

Outcome 
The 
outcome 
criterion 
is 
based 
on 
the 
ratings 
for 
three 
sub-criteria 
(relevance, efficacy, 
and 
efficiency) 
and 
is the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
project’s major 
relevant 
objectives were 
achieved, 
or 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
achieved, 
eficiently. 
6.2 
The 
outcome 
of 
the 
project 
is 
rated 
unsatisfactory. 
Although 
the collapse 
of WASA 
and 
deterioration 
of 
services 
was 
averted, the 
project 
did 
not 
achieve 
its 
major 
relevant 
objective 
of 
putting 
WASA 
on 
the 
chosen 
path 
to 
reform 
management, 
providing 
more 
reliable 
services, 
and 
meeting 
demands. 
There 
were 
substantial 
inefficiencies 
(wasted expenditure) 
in 
the 
process 
of 
achieving 
the modest 
result 
recorded. 
The 
drainage and 
flood 
control 
component 
was 
only 
partially 
implemented. 
Relevance 
of 
Objectives 
The extent 
to 
which 
the 
project’s 
objectives 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
country’s current 
development 
priorities 
and 
with

strategies 
and

modest 
achievements compared 
with 
objectives

Despite 
the

than 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
capital 
and 
benefits 
at 
least cost 
compared 
to alternatives. 
6.5 
implementation 
was 
problematic throughout and 
the investments achieved are 
risky 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
substantial 
institutional 
improvements 
to 
ensure 
WASA’s 
effective 
management 
of 
the 
facilities 
available. 
Expenditure 
on 
the 
management services 
was 
particularly 
unproductive given 
that the 
original 
management 
impact 
and 
outputs 
could not 
be 
achieved. 
Efficiency 
is 
rated 
modest, 
although 
no 
economic rate 
of

is 
available.

is 
rated 
as 
negligible. 
Apart 
from 
the 
physical 
objective 
of 
preventing 
WASA 
collapse 
by 
providing 
supplies and equipment, 
institutional 
change 
was 
the 
major 
instrument 
for 
achieving 
the 
long-term 
objective. The 
major institutional 
change 
of 
introducing 
a 
private 
operator 
did 
not 
have the 
wide public 
and 
political 
support 
needed.

Sustainability 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
project 
investments 
is 
rated 
unlikely 
in 
the 
present 
uncertain 
circumstances 
WASA 
faces.

important industrial

for 
the

(by

but 
the water

is 
not 
in 
a 
stable 
state 
although 
heavy

now 
in-hand

change 
this 
outlook. 
Bank 
Performance 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
services 
provided 
by 
the Bank 
ensured 
quality 
at 
entry and supported 
implementation 
through appropriate 
supervision 
(including 
ensuring 
adequate 
transition 
arrangements 
for 
regular 
operation 
of 
the 
project) 
6.8 
Bank 
performance 
is 
rated 
unsatisfactory: 
in 
hindsight 
the attempt 
to 
combine 
rapid 
emergency 
assistance 
with 
long-term aid 
to 
the water 
supply 
sector 
was 
high 
risk. 
The 
short 
preparation 
period 
resulted 
in 
the details 
of 
the 
long-term proposal 
being 
poorly 
understood and 
not 
widely 
accepted 
in 
Trinidad, 
and 
implementation 
expectations 
were 
extraordinarily 
unrealistic. 
Quality 
at 
entry 
of 
the 
project 
was 
therefore 
poor. 
The 
concept 
of 
introducing 
outside 
management 
expertise 
and 
privatizing 
WASA 
was 
not 
acceptable 
to all 
stakeholders. 
The 
choice 
of 
the 
company 
to 
provide 
the expertise 
and 
the details 
of 
the arrangements 
were 
flawed 
in 
ways 
that 
the Bank, 
as 
the 
main 
source 
of 
experience 
in 
the 
area, 
should 
have 
handled 
better.9 
When 
things 
went 
awry 
between 
WASA’s 
board 
and the 
management 
firm, 
the 
Bank’s 
position 
in 
supporting 
the 
firm 
(apparently 
in 
the interests 
of 
seeing 
the 
project 
plan 
go 
ahead) 
is 
difficult 
to 
justify. 
The 
Bank failed to 
provide 
reasonable 
staffing continuity 
and 
at the 
end 
was 
slow 
to 
advise the 
government 
that 
the 
expected 
finance 
for 
major 
water 
investments 
was 
not 
forthcoming 
(as 
the 
country 
lending 
program 
was 
reduced), such 
that 
much 
preparatory 
work 
became wasted 
effort. 
Borrower 
Performance 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
borrower 
assumed 
ownership and responsibility 
to 
ensure 
quality 
of 
preparation 
and implementation, and complied 
with 
covenants 
and 
agreements, 
toward 
the achievement 
of 
development 
objectives 
and 
sustainability.

agencies) 
was 
unsatisfactory. 
It 
is 
not 
clear 
that at the outset the 
project 
objectives 
had 
the 
full 
commitment 
of 
concerned 
agencies, 
perhaps because the water 
supply 
situation 
was 
so 
fragile 
that 
any 
hope 
of 
improvement 
was 
seized 
upon. 
In 
particular 
there 
had 
not 
been

of 
Political 
change 
notwithstanding, 
the 
performance 
of

In

the selection 
of 
a 
British 
company 
from 
a water

that

not 
itself 
long 
been 
privatized 
and 
in 
a 
utility 
sector 
where 
the 
privatization 
process 
had 
been a 
source 
of 
some 
controversy, 
now 
seems 
risky 
and 
unfortunate.

minds 
on 
WASA 
privatization-the 
key 
measure 
to 
improve 
the water 
supply 
situation 
for 
the 
long-term. 
Long 
implementation 
delays were the 
norm 
and 
the 
IOA 
was 
not 
given 
the 
high 
priority 
and 
thorough 
attention 
it 
deserved 
from 
those 
agencies 
and 
staff 
who 
should 
have 
shepherded 
it 
through. 
Necessary 
regulatory 
measures 
were 
not 
introduced 
and 
the 
industrial 
tariff for 
only 
one 
locality 
was 
revised, 
with 
no 
overall 
tariff 
reform 
strategy 
produced. 
The 
compliance 
of 
the government 
with 
project 
covenants 
was 
poor, 
although 
for 
10 
out 
of 
15 
covenants 
listed 
by 
the 
ICR 
there 
is 
no 
information 
provided. 
For 
the 
remaining 
five 
covenants, 
two 
were 
breached 
and 
for 
two 
there 
was 
only 
partial 
compliance. 
Audit 
reports 
did 
not 
meet 
Bank 
standards 
and 
were 
qualified 
in 
the 
case 
of 
WASA’s 
accounts, 
as 
financial 
management 
continued 
to 
be 
weak. 
7. 
Lessons 
7.1 
The 
experience 
of 
this 
project confirms 
a number 
of 
OED 
lessons. 
Distinguish 
between 
short-term 
and 
longer-term 
needs: 
assistance 
in 
a 
conventional 
project 
format 
should 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
immediate 
emergency 
and 
not 
also 
attempt 
to 
deal 
with 
longer 
term 
needs, 
although 
a 
series 
of 
Adjustable 
Program 
Loans 
may 
be 
a 
better instrument 
in 
such 
circumstances. 
The 
Bank 
is 
ill-equipped 
to 
respond 
promptly 
to 
emergency 
needs 
for 
financial 
aid 
and 
must 
employ 
shortcuts 
to 
its 
normal 
procedures 
to 
make 
assistance 
available 
with 
promptness. 
Hence 
it 
is 
difficult 
if 
not 
impossible 
to 
respond 
promptly to 
the emergency 
need 
while 
adequately 
preparing 
assistance 
for 
long 
term 
support. 
As 
in 
this 
instance 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
hat 
too 
rapid 
preparation 
of 
the 
assistance 
will 
lead 
to 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
longer-term 
arrangements. 
Fortunately 
such 
complex and 
politically 
difficult reform 
programs, 
with 
high 
risks 
and uncertainty, 
can 
now 
be supported 
more 
appropriately 
through 
the 
flexibility 
of 
APLs. 
Thorough 
political 
risk 
analvsis 
is 
essential: 
thorough 
political 
risk 
analysis and, 
in 
the 
process, 
enlistment 
of 
broad 
political 
support 
(from 
across 
the 
entire 
political 
spectrum) 
for 
sensitive 
changes such 
as 
privatization 
and 
utility 
tariff 
modification, 
is 
essential 
if 
there 
is 
any 
chance 
of 
government 
changing 
and 
of 
this 
leading 
to 
a 
change 
in 
policy. 
The 
preparation 
of 
proposals 
and 
plans 
should 
involve 
all 
interested 
parties, 
not 
just 
those 
currently 
in 
authority. 
Management 
contracts 
need 
careful 
design: 
(a) 
contractors who 
bid 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
privatization 
arrangement 
should 
be 
excluded 
from 
bidding 
on 
supply 
and 
construction 
contracts, 
or 
on 
the 
privatization 
itself. 
Any 
benefits 
from 
contractor 
continuity 
throughout 
the process 
are 
likely 
to 
be overridden 
by 
lack 
of 
objectivity 
(between 
technical 
supervision 
and 
commercial 
interests), 
if 
not 
actual 
conflicts 
of 
interest, 
and 
understandable 
public 
suspicion and 
criticism; 
and 
(b) 
there 
must 
be 
a 
careful 
mix 
of 
incentives 
and 
penalties, 
with 
checks 
and 
balances, 
in 
management 
contracts 
to 
ensure 
performance 
by 
the 
contractor without 
suspicion 
of 
impropriety. 
Separate 
monitoring 
arrangements are advisable 
to 
maintain 
political 
and 
public 
credibility. 
Statements 
of 
obiectives 
and 
expectations 
must 
be 
unambiguous: 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
consistency 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
project 
documentation 
is 
needed 
to 
improve 
understanding 
and 
agreement, 
especially 
in 
the statement 
of 
objectives 
and 
project 
description.

Comments 
on 
Statements 
of 
Project 
Objectives 
The 
project 
objectives 
and 
description 
of 
parts 
of 
the 
project 
differ 
between the 
two key 
project 
documents, 
the 
Memorandum 
of 
the President (there 
was 
no 
appraisal report, 
only 
a 
technical 
annex 
in 
the 
MOP) 
and the 
Loan 
Agreement. 
While 
noting 
that 
the 
project 
objectives 
could 
have 
been 
presented 
more 
clearly, the 
ICR 
did 
not 
itself 
succeed 
in 
clarifying 
the design intentions, 
but 
relied on 
the 
existing 
description and 
its 
confusing 
language. 
Unfortunately, material 
differences 
between various 
statements 
of 
objectives and 
project 
descriptions are 
not 
unusual 
in 
project 
documents. 
Legal 
documents sometimes 
rephrase 
the 
description 
in 
the 
appraisal 
report 
and 
in 
the 
process 
the precise intentions 
of 
the 
project 
designers 
may 
be 
obscured. 
Such 
discrepancies are 
less 
cause 
for 
concern when the 
legal 
documents 
merely 
provide 
for 
a 
wider 
interpretation 
of 
intent 
and 
content than a 
more 
precise designer’s 
typology. 
Such 
flexibility 
in 
language 
can 
avoid 
or 
at least 
mitigate 
problems later 
if 
changes are 
needed 
if 
implementation 
runs 
into 
difficulties, 
since 
small 
changes 
can 
be 
accommodated 
without 
compromising 
the 
project’s 
legal 
basis. 
The 
differences 
in 
the various documents 
for 
the 
WSIS 
project 
are 
compared 
below 
for 
both 
the 
statements 
of 
obiectives 
and 
the description 
of 
the 
Darts 
(or 
components) 
of 
the project. 
When 
the 
legal 
document 
does 
not 
capture the 
essence 
of 
the 
main 
project description confusion 
may 
result and 
in 
contentious 
relationships 
such differences are 
likely 
to amplify 
or 
even 
cause 
misunderstandings.’ 
As 
an 
example, the 
main 
urgent 
objective 
of 
the 
WSIS project 
(with 
the 
largest single expenditure 
category) 
according 
to 
the 
MOP-supplies 
to 
stave 
off 
the 
collapse 
of 
WASA 
and 
its 
services4oes 
not 
appear 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
project 
objectives and 
only 
shows 
up 
in 
the description 
of 
parts 
of 
the 
project 
in 
Part 
B 
as 
item 
(d), 
and 
after 
17 
earlier 
items. 
Also, 
it 
became apparent 
during 
implementation 
that there 
was 
no 
commitment 
by 
the 
Bank to 
assist 
the 
rehabilitation 
phase 
of 
the 
project, although 
the 
MOP 
expressly 
states 
(para. 
9 
b) 
that the 
“WASA 
component 
of 
the 
[rehabilitation] program 
would 
start 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
private 
sector 
manager 
has 
been 
chosen.” 
But 
there 
is 
no 
indication 
as 
to how 
rehabilitation 
was 
to be 
financed, 
unless 
it 
was 
to 
be 
by 
extraordinarily 
rapid 
processing 
of 
a 
Bank follow-up 
loan. 
Confusion 
about 
how 
rehabilitation 
was 
to 
be 
financed 
began 
in 
the 
project 
documents and 
contributed 
to 
implementation 
problems and 
to 
the 
souring 
of 
relations between 
government, 
the 
private 
sector 
management, 
and 
the 
Bank. 
Table 
C1 
compares the structure 
of 
the 
project 
obiectives 
statements 
in 
the 
MOP 
and the 
Loan 
Agreement and indicates a 
surprising 
degree 
of 
discord over 
what 
the 
project 
was 
supposed 
to 
achieve. 
’. 
Even 
the 
MOP 
is 
not 
consistent 
on 
a 
critical point 
in 
omitting 
in 
its 
summary the 
first objective 
of 
the 
main 
text,

The 
description 
in 
the 
Loan 
Agreement 
of 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
project 
(or 
components) 
was 
also 
complex 
and 
a 
source 
of 
confusion 
(Box

in 
Water 
Services 
Reorganization.. 
..aimed 
at 
the 
introduction 
of 
private 
operators 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
wastewater  services, 
through: 
(a) 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
strategic 
plan 
for 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
WASA 
[eight  detailed 
steps 
omitted]; 
(b) 
interim 
management 
support 
for 
WASA; 
(c) 
preparation 
of 
a 
rehabilitation program for 
the 
WASA 
water 
supply 
and 
distribution 
systems and 
facilities

mitigatory 
measures, 
as 
needed; 
and 
(d)  establishment 
and 
operation 
of 
a 
WASA 
rehabilitation 
emergency 
operational fund, 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
critical 
equipment, 
spare 
parts 
and 
operating 
supplies 
during 
the 
period 
of 
transition to private 
sector 
operation. 
Part 
C: 
Drainage 
and 
Flood Control 
Institutional Support 
1. 
Strengthening 
of 
MOWT-PIU 
[responsible 
for 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Borrower’s 
drainage 
and 
flood 
control 
program]. 
2. 
Preparation 
by 
the 
Borrower 
of 
a 
drainage 
and 
flood 
control program 
which 
will 
include 
enhanced 
maintenance 
and 
rehabilitation. 
Note 
in 
particular 
the 
confusion and 
overlap between 
Parts 
A 
and 
B 
both 
of 
which 
are 
concerned 
with 
“reorganization” 
of 
water 
sector 
management. 
Part 
A 
provides 
various 
forms 
of 
strengthening, 
including 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
and 
developing 
a 
management 
strategy, 
while 
Part 
B 
prepares 
and implements 
transfer 
of 
water sector operations 
to 
private 
management. 
The 
title 
of 
Part 
A-“Reorganization 
of 
Water 
Sector Management”- 
is, 
in 
effect, 
incorrect 
as 
the 
actions 
Page  31
18 
Annex 
C 
proposed 
were 
all 
to 
do 
with 
adding capacity 
to 
existing 
sector 
organizations, 
developing 
a 
management strategy 
(which 
was 
redundant 
as 
that 
had 
already been determined), 
and 
project 
planning, and 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
reorganization 
per 
se. 
The 
project 
descriptions, 
regardless 
of 
source, 
are 
not 
as 
clearly 
organized 
as 
they 
should 
have 
been 
if 
everyone 
was 
to 
readily 
understand the purpose 
of 
the 
project 
and the 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
different 
implementers. 
This 
deficiency 
must 
have 
contributed to 
misunderstandings, 
especially 
as 
relationships 
deteriorated.
