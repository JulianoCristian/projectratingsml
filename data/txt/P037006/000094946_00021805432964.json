for the short term, and,\n            uncertain for the medium term. The Bank performance was\n            inadequate in the design for private participation\n            inclusion, was not appropriate on decisions regarding issues\n            on performance indicators, and, supervision was deficient on\n            several fronts, namely, lack of financial covenants'\n            monitoring, weakness towards achieving appraisal indicators,\n            and, lack of substantive auditing action. Likewise, the\n            Borrower's performance was mostly unsatisfactory,\n            accounting for both implementation, and counterpart funding\n            delays. Lessons indicate that private participation in\n            infrastructure would better succeed under an open process\n            design, with an approach towards public sharing of\n            contracts, preventing governmental mistrust, offering\n            instead a participatory strategy, i.e., broader dialogue,\n            ownership, and transparency. Management contracts should\n            encompass a framework for incentives, to prevent negative\n            monitoring impacts, in the absence of performance\n            indicators. Furthermore, contracts need to be comprehensive,\n            and self-contained, allowing the management contractor full\n            autonomy, and the resources to meet the performance\n            indicators. Consequently, governments need to accept full\n            responsibility for the development of performance\n            indicators, and the underlying data."}, "docdt": "2000-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
