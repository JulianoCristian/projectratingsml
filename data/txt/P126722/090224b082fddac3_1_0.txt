Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 A. Proposed PDO The Project Development Objective is to support improvement of the quality and availability of water supply in selected
 service areas of the Armenian Water and Sewerage Company. This is a repeater operation. The original project is scheduled to close in February
 28, 2012, with satisfactory PDO and implementation rating. This Project will replicate the original project activities in three other cities and scale up
 the institutional development and sustainability measures.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project has progressed well, and the activities under the Project are all completed now. With the completion of rehabilitation works in the network,
 the duration, quality and efficiency of water supply services improved and will continue to improve yielding larger efficiency. Overall, the Project
 performance indicators are on track with end-of-project values exceeded for most of them.

         The end-of-project target is almost achieved. All individual connections to households are completed and the water flows through the new
         pipes in most project areas, while defects are being fixed in a few neighborhoods in Ashtarak and Echmiatsin. The actual impact of the
         reform in terms of NRW reduction will be measured in six months' after completion of all works in the network, i.e. January 2016, and the
         operator is confident that the 70% end-project target will be ensured. The annual independent technical audit will be carried out in January
         2016 to verify these results.

               Comments
               The end-of-project target is almost met. Before the launch of the Project, the billing was quite low, and over time AWSC has significantly
               increased its billing. This certainly entails an increase in the number of non-payers. There are a number of awareness campaigns that the
               utility successfully implemented to encourage customers to pay the bills. A successful example of such campaign is quarterly lottery held
               among those customers of AWSC that regularly pay their bills. These lotteries have been broadcasted on public television and have
               significantly increased the collection rate.
