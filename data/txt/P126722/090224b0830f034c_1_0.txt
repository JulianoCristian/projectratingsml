0           To the Management of the "Armenian Water and Sewerage" CJSC

            We have audited the accompanying financial statements of "Armenian Water and Sewerage"
            CJSC (hereafter, the Company) which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31
D           December 2014, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of
            changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of

0           significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

            Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

0           The Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of
            these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and
            for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
L           financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.

            Auditor 's    Re~ponsibility
0           Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
            conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing issued by the

D           International Federation of Accountants. Those standards require that we comply with ethical
            requirements and plan and perfonn the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial
            statements are free from material misstatement.

c           An audit involves perfonning procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
            disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
            judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
L           statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
            internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial
            statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
[           for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An
            audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
            reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
0           presentation ofthe financial statements.

0   The Foundation has not appl ied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued
    but are not effective. The Foundation has not yet determined the potential effect of the new
    and revised standard on its financial position and performance.

0   •   IFRS 9, Financial lnstntments, (issued on November 2009, revised on July 2014) is
        effective for annual periods beginning on or after I January 20 I5, except for revisions
        done on July 2014, which are effective from I January 2018. IFRS 9 (revised on July

0       2014) will replace lAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, at the
        date of its being effective.
        IFRS 9 introduces new classification and measurement requirements for financial assets,
0       which replace the classification and measurement requirements previously included in lAS
        39, according to which all financial assets to be subsequently measured at amortised cost
        or fair value. Specifically:
0          ./ A debt investments that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is to
              collect the contractual cash flows, and (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely
              payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding, must be measured
0             at amortised cost. unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit and loss
              (FVTPL) under the fair value option.

0          ./ A debt investments that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is
              achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and
              (ii) has contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash

c             flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal
              outstanding, must be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
              (FVTOCI), unless the asset is designated FVTPL under the fair value option.

c          ./ All other debt investments must be measured at FVTPL.
           ./ All equity investments are measured at FVTPL, except that if an equity investment
              is not held for trading, and irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition
0             to measure the investment at FVTOCI (however, dividend income is recognized in
              profit and loss).

0       The impairment model under IFRS 9 reflects expected credits losses, as opposed to
        incurred credit losses under lAS 39. Under the impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is no
        longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized.
[       Instead. and entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those
        expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses should be updated at each
        reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

G   •   IFRS I5, Revenue from contracts with customers, (issued on May 2014) is effective for

c       annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. IFRS 15 establishes a single

Q
        IFRS 15 will only cover revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, a
D       customer of an entity is a party that has contracted with the entity to obtain goods or services
        that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange of consideration. Unlike lAS
        I 8, the recognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and

0       equity instruments are no longer within the scope of IFRS 15.


        IFRS 15 has a single model to deal with revenue from contracts with customers. Its core
D       principal is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
        services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
        to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.

0       require biological assets that meet its definition to be accounted for as property, plant and
        equipment in accordance with lAS 16, instead of lAS 4 I. The bearer plants can be measured

c    3. Significant accounting policies

     3.1 Statement of compliance
0    These financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with International
     Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter - IFRSs). !FRS are Standards and Interpretations
D    issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They comprise:
         • International Financial Reporting Standards;
         • International Accounting Standards;
0        • International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) Interpretations;
         • Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) Interpretations.

0    The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are
     set out bellow. These policies have been consistently applied.


0    3.2 Going concem
     The Company has incurred substantial financial losses in recent years, particularly, AMD
     10,920,399 thousand in year 2014 (2013: AMD 3,242,121 thousand). As a result the
0    accumulated Joss as at reporting date amounts to AMD 37,277,838 thousand. As at
     31.12.2014 Company's net assets amount to AMD 7,864,430 thousand (31.12.2013: AMD
     t 3,965,626 thousand) .
.0   In accordance with decree N 1366-A dated 05.12.2013, the Government of the Republic of
     Armenia approved the approach to transfer water system operating rights from "Armenian

c    Water and Sewerage'' CJSC to a lessee on tender bases. However, the implementation of the
     decree was postponed. and it was decided to extend the contract with "SAUR" SA
     organisation by prolonging the functions of the executive body in the Company till end of

c    May 20 16 (Note 1.1.).
     After making assessments, the Company's management has a reasonable expectation that the
     Company is able to continue its operational existence in the foreseeable future. The Company

c    therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial· statements.

     3.3 Basis for measurement
0    The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the property and
     equipment measured at revaluation model. The last revaluation was conducted as at
L    3).' 2.2012.


c    3.4 Functional and pre.5elllatimr currency
     The functional currency of the Company is the national currency of the Republic of Armenia,
     the Armenian Dram (AMD). AMD is also the currency in which these financial statements are
     presented rounded to the nearest thousands.
[
     3.5 Use ofjudgments, estimates a11d assumptions

     reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets ·and liabilities to




0                                                                                                 14

        those estimates.


0       3.5.1 Assessment uncertainties
        The following are important assumptions and other uncertainties of assessment concerning the
D       future as at the reporting date. which have a significant impact on the current values of assets
        and liabilities:

0          a) Tire revalued anwulll of PPE {Note 12)
        Some classes of Company's PPE are measured by revaluation model. As there is no market-
        based evidence of fair value because of the specialised nature of the some items, for example,
u       water supply pipelines, the fair value of those assets are estimated applying depreciated
        replacement cost approach by an external professional valuator.
        The last revaluation is implemented as at 31.12.20 I 2 through water supply and sewerage
0       pipelines.
        As at 31. I 2.20 12 net increase on these PPE from implemented revaluation amounts to AMD

0       I9,259,053 thousand, from which the increase in the amount of AMD 19,567,943 thousand is
        recognised in equity, and decrease in the amount of AMD 308,890 thousand is recognised in
        profit or loss.

0          b) Tile collectability oftrade receivables (Note 15 and 24.2)
        The Company assesses the collectability of trade receivables arisen from water realization
        through riskiness analyses based on the following three risk categories: legal status of
[       consumer, debt aging and usage of water meter. For each risk category the uncollectability
        coefficient is determined on the basis of prior year results and future expectations of

c       collectability.
        As at 31.12.20 14 the provision on uncollectability in the amount of AMD 5, 719,699 thousand
        on receivables on water realization in the amount of AMD 8,145,052 thousand is formed

c       (31.12.20 13: AMD 5,419,603 thousand on receivables in the amount of AMD 7, 735,292
        thousand).
           c) Deferred tax assets and liabilities (Note 23)
0       In recent years the Company has incurred tax losses as well as there are differences between
        tax bases and accounting bases of some assets and liabilities. As at 01.01.2012 no deferred tax
        asset was recognized on carried forward tax losses and deductible temporary differences
0       because the Company's management did not expect taxable profits against which those could
        be used.

0       As a result of revaluation as at 31.12.2012 of some property and equipment deferred tax
        liability exceeded the sum of deferred tax asset and tax losses, so the deferred tax assets were
        recognized in 2012.

    translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in

    The following non-derivative financial instruments are available at the Company:
    •    Receivables;
D   •    Payables;
    •    Loans and borrowings received;
0   •    Cash and cash equivalents.
    Receivables and payables, loans and borrowings received are not designated as financial
0   instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
    Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, and cash in transfer. Bank

0   overdrafts that form an integral part of the Company's cash management are included as a
    component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.


0   3. 7.1 RectJgnition tmd initial meu.mrement
    The financial instrument is recognized on the balance sheet (accounting) when, and only
    when, the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions ofthe transaction. When a
0   financial asset or financial liability is recognized initially, the Company measures it at fair
    value plus expenditures directly related to the transaction. Fair value of short term (with less
    than 6 months of maturity period) receivables and payables is equal to the transaction price,
0   i.e. the nominal amount of monetary assets receivable (payable) against receivables
    (payables), if the effect of discount is immaterial.

0   3. 7.2 Subsequent measurement
    After initial recognition the payables and receivables, loans and borrowings received are
0   measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method less impairment losses.
    Amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial
    asset or liability was measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or
0   minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between that initial amount and the
    maturity amount and minus any write-down for impairment or uncollectability. The effective
    interest method is a method of calculating amortization using the effective interest rate of a
0   financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
    the expected stream of future cash payments through maturity or the next market-based
    review date to the current net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. It
[   includes all payments paid or received between the contract parties.

0       b) If the Company transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control
           or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.

0    Financial liabilities (payables, loans and borrowings received) are written off from the
     company's balance sheet when and only when it is settled, i.e. when the contractual
     provisions under the contract have been fulfilled or declared void or expired (limitation of
0    action).

     3.8 Property and equipme11t

0    3.8.1 Initial measurement
     An item of property and equipment that qualities for recognition as an asset is measured at its
0    cost.
     The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price less trade

0    discounts, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and other mandatory payments,
     transportation costs, and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working
     condition for its intended use. Exploitation and similar pre-production expenditures are not
     included in the cost of PPE items.
0    3.8.2 Subsequent expenditures

c    Expenditures relating to addition of new component to property and equipment or
     replacement of components of property and equipment are added to the carrying amount of

D    the property and equipment (are capitalized) when it is probable that future economic
     benefits, in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset,
     will flow to the Company, and its value can be reliably measured. Replaced components of
     property and equipment are derecognized.
0    Apart from the above, other expenditures on property and equipment (e.g. servicing,
     maintenance), are not added to the book value of the property and equipment (are not
0    capitalised).

     3.8.3 Subsequent meas11rement
[    After recognition as an asset, buildings, structures, pipelines, equipment and vehicles are
     carried at revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any
     accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. After recognition as an
lJ   asset, other items are carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
     accumulated impairment losses.

0    If an item of property and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant and
     equipment to which that asset belongs is revalued. When an item of property, plant and
     equipment is revalued. any accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is restated
Q    proportionately with the change in the gross carrying amount of the asset so that the carrying
     amount of the asset after revaluation equals its revalued amount.

0    basis over its useful life using the straight-line method.
     Depreciation of the property and equipment is calculated when it is available for exploitation,
     i.e. when the venue and the status of the property and equipment allow its exploitation per the
     Company's intentions. Depreciation calculation is ceased at an earlier of the following dates:
0    a) when the property and equipment is classified as available for sale; etc.
     b) when the property and equipment is derecognized.
0    Depreciation calculation does not cease when the PPE item is no longer used.

     Useful lives for all property and equipment are expressed in periods. The following are the
0    estimated useful lives:

     •   Buildings                                                              20 to 50 years

f~   3.8.5 Construction in Process
     Unfinished property. plant and plant are those assets in the process of construction. The


c    initial cost includes cost of materials, labor and other direct expenditures.
     Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
     a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset, except for the property and equipment
     curried at revalued value. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial

    Lessee.

c   During the reporting year, the Company does not have assets received or surrendered under
    finance lease.


[   3.10.2 Operating leases
    Lease other than financial lease is operating lease. The assets under operating lease are

0   3.11/nvelltories
    Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of interchangeable
[   inventories is determined using the weighted average value formula. The cost of inventories
    includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing
    location and condition.                                                       ·

L   Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
    estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Materials intended for use in the course of
    provision of services and other inventories are not revalued lower than their cost if it is
u   expected that the service for the provision of which they will be used, will be sold at a price
    equal or higher than the cost.


0   3.12 Impairment
    At each reporting date, property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed to

0   determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.

{
l

0       lf there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset
        (or group of related assets) is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If estimated
        recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable
0       amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
        Similarly, at each reporting date, inventories are assessed for impairment by comparing the
        carrying amount of each item of inventory (or group of similar items) with its selling price
0       less costs to complete and sell. If an item of inventory (or group of similar items) is impaired,
        its carrying amount is reduced to selling price less costs to complete and selJ, and an
        impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
0       The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective indication that
        financial assets (or group of similar assets) measured at cost or amortized costs may be

c       impaired. If any such indication exists, the impairment loss is recognized directly in profit and
        loss.
        lf an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or group of
D       related assets) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount (selling price less
        costs to complete and sell. in the case of inventories), but not in excess of the amount that
        would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (group of
[       related assets) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in
        profit or loss.


0       3.13 Sllort-term Employee Benefits
        Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries short-term compensated absences (such
[       as paid annual leave and paid sick leave}, and bonuses.
        When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, the

    c   Company recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be
        paid in exchange for that service:
        a) as a liability after deducting the amount already paid. If the amount already paid exceeds
            the undiscounted amount of benefits, the Company recognizes this difference as an asset
    c       to the extent that this prepayment will lead e.g. to a decrease in future payments, or
            recovery of financial resources: and
        b) as an expense. unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.

    0   3.14 Provisio11s


    c   A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or
        constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of
        economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

    0   The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle
        the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably
        surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate
    [   of a provision. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a
        provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
        obligation. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the
        time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

0       24.1.2 Interest rate risk

0       Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
        fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company interest rate risk arises from
c       long-term borrowings. The Company has a loans received from the Republic of Armenia
        Ministry of Finance (International Development Association, European Bank of Reconstruction
        and Development, International Bank of Reconstruction and Development, European Investment
(       Bank) and Asian Development Bank with fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings in
        floating interest rate expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk, and borrowings in fixed
        interest rate expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. The relevant information on the
0       mentioned loan is presented in the Note 19. Management does not have a formal policy of
        determining how much of the Company's exposure is to fixed or variable rates. However, at the
[       time of raising new loans or borrowings management uses its judgment to decide whether it
        believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favorable to the Company over the expected
        period until maturity.
[
        24.1.3 Otller price risk
c       Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
        fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or

c       currency risk). The management assessed that the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities
        does not materially different from their carrying value as at reporting date.

r       The provision for impairment of trade receivables is provided based on risk groups analysis. The
        above groups are subject to additional credit risk depending on whether the volume of services

c       amount of receivables is determined in a manner other than water meters, the credit risk is

 c   property or environmental damage arising from accidents on Company's property or relating to

0   25.3 Tax regulation
    The taxation system in Armenia is relatively new and is characterised by frequent changes in
    legislation, which are sometimes unclear, contradictory and subject to varying interpretation.
0   Taxes are subject to review and investigation by tax authorities, which have the relevant
    authority.

D   No tax liabilities are created for reviled tax violations with more than three years of maturity. But
    in some cases the mentioned maturity period could be suspended.
    These circumstances may create tax risks in Armenia that are more significant than in other

0   countries. Management believes that it has provided adequately for tax liabilities based on its
    interpretations of applicable Armenian tax legislation. However, the interpretations of the
    relevant authorities could differ and the effect could be significant if due authorized bodies are
0   successful in enacting their interpretations.

    26. Capital management
D
    The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as going concerns.

0   The capital structure of the Company consists of debt (current and non-current liabilities) and
    equity.
    Both at reporting and end of previous year, most of debt ofthe Company consist ofborrowings
[   and loans.
    The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

0   27. Related party transactions
