      for Armenia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: Armenia is an absolute pioneer in\n            using extensive PPP for providing water supply and waste\n            water services, in the former Soviet Union. No other country\n            in the region has utilized this instrument to this extent.\n            Most countries have a fully public supply system or\n            outsource only small parts of the service, such as\n            maintenance or collection of payments (very popular payment\n            kiosks).The construction seasons should be accounted for in\n            project design and a project closing date should not occur\n            in the middle of construction season. Unusually cold and\n            warm weather should be noted as a potential risk to on-time\n            completion. In the case of MWP, the closing date in the\n            middle of the summer meant that works were executed right\n            until the end of the project, thus also hindering the\n            ability to survey the beneficiary once the effects of the\n            project could be fully felt, i.e. six or more months after\n            completion of the works. In all Former Soviet Union (FSU)\n            countries, the consumer\u2019s price of water supply and\n            sanitation services remains very low. Most utilities,\n            whether public or private, struggle to achieve financial\n            sustainability because the tariffs are far too low to cover\n            operating costs. In most cases tariffs are decided at the\n            local council level and are hence affected by politics. In\n            general, the regulators should be strengthened to provide\n            guidance not only on maximum affordability level for the\n            consumers but to also on the minimum requirements for a\n            utility to cover its operations and maintenance costs."}, "docdt": "2015-12-15T00:03:00Z"}
