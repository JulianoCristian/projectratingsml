Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 A. Proposed PDO The Project Development Objective is to support improvement of the quality and availability of water supply in selected
 service areas of the Armenian Water and Sewerage Company. This is a repeater operation. The original project is scheduled to close in February
 28, 2012, with satisfactory PDO and implementation rating. This Project will replicate the original project activities in three other cities and scale up
 the institutional development and sustainability measures.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project is progressing well and the activities under the project are all expected to complete on time. With the completion of ongoing work in the
 network, the duration and quality of water supply services will continue to improve yielding larger efficiency. By and large the project performance
 indicators are on track with some of them awaiting results of civil in Ashtarak and Echmiatsin and in Masis.The performance indicators representing the
 progress made in project supported selected areas of AWSC reveal progress onto meeting the project objectives.

               Comments
               As part of the water network rehabilitation, the project is replacing main water pipes in the selected areas. While most of the
               network rehabilitation and pipe replacement is completed, the individual connections to households are yet to be completed. The water is
               still being delivered to the customers through the old deteriorated pipes until the household connections are done. This explains the high
               level of non-revenue water. This indicator is expected to drop to realistically reflect the actual NRW. The measurement will be taken in end-
               June 2015 and reported in the final ISR.

               The end of project target is expected to be met by end-June 2015. Over the last year, AWSC has identified a number of illegal connections,
               particularly in the rural communities, and has signed service contracts with new customers. AWSC is currently updating its customer data
               and billing information, which will be reported in the next ISR.

               The end of project target is expected to be met. As part of the network rehabilitation in the selected areas, the project is replacing water
               meters. While most of the meters are installed, the household connections are not yet completed, hence the consumption data reported as
               of January 1, 2015 does not reflect the actual domestic metered consumption per metered inhabitant. All connections are expected to be
               completed by early June, and the revised data will be reported in the final ISR.
