﻿NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
"Armenian Water and Sewerage" cjsc
For the six months ended 30 June 2015
I. Background
1.1. Company and operations
Armenian Water and Sewerage closed joint stock company (hereinafter - Company) has been
established based on the order of Ministry of Urban Development of the Republic of Armenia
N 169 of the year 1997. The Company is the legal successor of Armenian Water and
Sewerage State Enterprise (registration no: 286.140.00736, 22.12.1994). The Company has no
subsidiaries.
100% shareholder of the Company is the Republic of Armenia represented by State
Committee for Water Management of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Armenia.
[.              Legal address of the Company is 8a Vardanants deadlock, Yerevan, the Republic of Armenia.
The authority of the Company's Executive Body has been transferred to a private manager -
French "SAUR" SA organisation in accordance to the decree N 942-N dated 9 July 2004 of
the Government of the Republic of Armenia. On 19 August 2004 the management contract
has been signed between the "SAUR" SA and the Company for a period of four years, which
was periodically extended. In accordance with Contract Amendment # 4 on 14 October 2011
contract period is extended till 31 December 2013 with possibility of additional one year
extension, and in accordance with Contract Amendment # 5 on 12 December 2013 contract
period is extended till 31 May 2016.
The Company's principal activity is water supply and sewerage services rendered to legal
entities and individuals. The Company carries out its activity on the entire territory of the
Republic of Armenia, except for Yerevan, Gyumri, Vanadzor and Armavir, and those
neighboring areas. During the year 2013, the Company rendered its services through three
branches: North-Western, Central-Western and Southern. Since I June 2014 the Company's
branches were restructured into two: North-Western and South-Eastern.
The branches are responsible for exploitation and maintenance of existing systems (daily
regulated water reservoirs, stations of drinking water purification, chlorine stations, water
carriers and distribution networks, water removal collectors, sewerage stations and other
structures). Most structures are over 20 years old.


﻿2. New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
The Foundation has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued
but are not effective. The Foundation has not yet determined the potential effect of the new
and revised standard on its financial position and performance.
* IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers, (issued on May 2014) is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after I January 2017. IFRS 15 establishes a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts
with customers. It supersede the following revenue Standards and Interpretations upon its
effective date:
]AS 18, Revenue,
IAS II, Construction Contracts,
V  IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes,
V  IFRIC 15, Agreement for the Construction of Real Estate,
V  IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers,
FR ' SIC 3 1, Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services.
IFRS 15 will only cover revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15, a
customer of an entity is a party that has contracted with the entity to obtain goods or services
that are an output of the entity's ordinary activities in exchange of consideration. Unlike IAS
18, the recognition and measurement of interest income and dividend income from debt and
equity instruments are no longer within the scope of IFRS 15.
IFRS 15 has a single model to deal with revenue from contracts with customers. Its core
L               principal is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
* Amendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, and IAS 38, Intangible Assets, -
Clarification ofAcceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortization (issued on May 2014)
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after I January 2016. The amendments to IAS
16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based depreciation method for items of property,
plant and equipment. The amendments to lAS 38 introduce a rebuttable perception that
revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortization of an intangible asset (which can be
rebutted in two limited circumstances).
* Amendments to lAS 16, Property. Plant and Equipment, and lAS 41, Agriculture, -Bearer
Plants (issued on June 2014) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2016. The amendments define a bearer plant (mature bearer biological assets, which no longer
undergo significant biological transformation and are used solely to grow produce) and
require biological assets that meet its definition to be accounted for as property, plant and
equipment in accordance with lAS 16, instead of lAS 41. The bearer plants can be measured
using either the cost model or the revaluation model set out in IAS 16. The producing
growing on bearer plants continues to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 41.

﻿3. Significant accounting policies
I                3.1 Statement of compliance
These interim financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with
international Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter - IFRSs). IFRS are Standards and
Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They
comprise.
* International Financial Reporting Standards;
* International Accounting Standards;
* International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) Interpretations;
* Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) Interpretations.
1I               The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are
set out bellow. These policies have been consistently applied.
3.2 Going concern
The Company has incurred substantial financial losses in recent years, particularly, AMD
81,090 thousand in six months ended at 30 June 2015 (30.06.2014: AMD 2,631,230
thousand). As a result the accumulated loss as at reporting date amounts to AMD 37,245,586
thousand. As at 30.06.2015 Company's net assets amount to AMD 9,679,695 thousand
(30.06.2014: AMD 7,864,430 thousand).
In accordance with decree N 1366-A dated 05.12.2013, the Government of the Republic of
Armenia approved the approach to transfer water system operating rights from "Armenian
Water and Sewerage" CJSC to a lessee on tender bases. However, the implementation of the
decree was postponed, and it was decided to extend the contract with "SAUR" SA
organisation by prolonging the functions of the executive body in the Company till end of
May 2016 (Note 1.1.).
After making assessments, the Company's management has a reasonable expectation that the
Company is able to continue its operational existence in the foreseeable future. The Company
therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
3.3 Basis for measurement
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the property and
equipment measured at revaluation model. The last revaluation was conducted as at
31.12.2012.
3.4 Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency of the Company is the national currency of the Republic of Armenia,
the Armenian Dram (AMD). AMD is also the currency in which these financial statements are
presented rounded to the nearest thousands.
3.5 Use ofjudgments, estimates and assumptions
Management has made a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions relating to the
reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to
prepare these financial statements in conformity with IFRSs. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.
13


﻿U
3.5.1 Assessment uncertainties
The following are important assumptions and other uncertainties of assessment concerning the
future as at the reporting date, which have a significant impact on the current values of assets
and liabilities:
a) The revalued amount of PPE (Note 12)
Some classes of Company's PPE are measured by revaluation model. As there is no market-
based evidence of fair value because of the specialised nature of the some items, for example,
water supply pipelines, the fair value of those assets are estimated applying depreciated
replacement cost approach by an external professional valuator.
The last revaluation is implemented as at 31.12.2012 through water supply and sewerage
pipelines.
As at 31.12.2012 net increase on these PPE from implemented revaluation amounts to AMD
19,259,053 thousand, from which the increase in the amount of AMD 19,567,943 thousand is
recognised in equity, and decrease in the amount of AMD 308,890 thousand is recognised in
profit or loss.
b) The collectability of trade receivables (Note 15 and 24.2)
The Company assesses the collectability of trade receivables arisen from water realization
through riskiness analyses based on the following three risk categories: legal status of
consumer, debt aging and usage of water meter. For each risk category the uncollectability
coefficient is determined on the basis of prior year results and future expectations of
collectability.
As at 30.06.2015 the provision on uncollectability in the amount of AMD 5,831,774 thousand
on receivables on water realization in the amount of AMD 8,395,572 thousand is formed
(31.12.2014: AMD 5,719,699 thousand on receivables in the amount of AMD 8,145,052
thousand).
I                3.6 Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to AMD at exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions. Settlement rate established by the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia is
taken as a currency. At the reporting date:
a)  foreign currency monetary items are reported (restated) using the closing rate (reporting
date);
b)  non-monetary items which are carried in terms of historical cost denominated in a
foreign currency are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of transactions or from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognized in the profit or loss.
3.7 Financial instruments
The following non-derivative financial instruments are available at the Company:
Receivables;
14


﻿*  Payables;
* Loans and borrowings received;
*  Cash and cash equivalents.
Receivables and payables, loans and borrowings received are not designated as financial
instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, and cash in transfer. Bank
overdrafts that form an integral part of the Company's cash management are included as a
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
3.7.1 Recognition and initial measurement
[.              The financial instrument is recognized on the balance sheet (accounting) when, and only
when, the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the transaction. When a
financial asset or financial liability is recognized initially, the Company measures it at fair
value plus expenditures directly related to the transaction. Fair value of short term (with less
than 6 months of maturity period) receivables and payables is equal to the transaction price,
i.e. the nominal amount of monetary assets receivable (payable) against receivables
(payables), if the effect of discount is immaterial.
3.7.2 Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition the payables and receivables, loans and borrowings received are
measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method less impairment losses.
Amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial
asset or liability was measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or
minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between that initial amount and the
maturity amount and minus any write-down for impairment or uncollectability. The effective
interest method is a method of calculating amortization using the effective interest rate of a
financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
the expected stream of future cash payments through maturity or the next market-based
review date to the current net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. It
includes all payments paid or received between the contract parties.
3.7.3 Derecognition offinancial instruments
Financial assets (receivables) are derecognized when and only when:
a) Company's contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or
b) If the Company transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities (payables, loans and borrowings received) are written off from the
company's balance sheet when and only when it is settled, i.e. when the contractual
provisions under the contract have been fulfilled or declared void or expired (limitation of
action).
3.8 Property and equipment
3.8.1 Initial measurement
An item of property and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is measured at its
cost.
I


﻿The cost of an item of property and equipment comprises its purchase price less trade
discounts, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and other mandatory payments,
transportation costs, and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working
condition for its intended use. Exploitation and similar pre-production expenditures are not
included in the cost of PPE items.
3.8.2 Subsequent expenditures
Expenditures relating to addition of new component to property and equipment or
replacement of components of property and equipment are added to the carrying amount of
the property and equipment (are capitalized) when it is probable that future economic
benefits, in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset,
will flow to the Company, and its value can be reliably measured. Replaced components of
property and equipment are derecognized.
Apart from the above, other expenditures on property and equipment (e.g. servicing,
maintenance), are not added to the book value of the property and equipment (are not
capitalised).
3.8.3 Subsequent measurement
After recognition as an asset, buildings, structures, pipelines, equipment and vehicles are
carried at revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. After recognition as an
asset, other items are carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses.
If an item of property and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant and
equipment to which that asset belongs is revalued. When an item of property, plant and
equipment is revalued, any accumulated depreciation at the date of the revaluation is restated
proportionately with the change in the gross carrying amount of the asset so that the carrying
amount of the asset after revaluation equals its revalued amount.
The revaluation surplus included in equity is transferred directly to retained earnings when the
property and equipment is disposed.
3.8.4 Depreciation
The depreciable amount of an item of property and equipment is allocated on a systematic
basis over its useful life using the straight-line method.
Depreciation of the property and equipment is calculated when it is available for exploitation,
i.e. when the venue and the status of the property and equipment allow its exploitation per the
Company's intentions. Depreciation calculation is ceased at an earlier of the following dates:
a) when the property and equipment is classified as available for sale; etc.
b) when the property and equipment is derecognized.
Depreciation calculation does not cease when the PPE item is no longer used.
Useful lives for all property and equipment are expressed in periods. The following are the
estimated useful lives:
* Buildings                                                 20 to 50 years
* Structures                                                20 to 40 years
16


﻿*  Pipelines                                                   20 to 40 years
Equipment                                                    5 to 20 years
*  Vehicles                                                     5 to 9 years
Other                                                        I to 5 years
3.8.5 Construction in Process
Unfinished property, plant and plant are those assets in the process of construction. The
initial cost meludes cost of materials, labor and other direct expenditures.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset, except for the property and equipment
curried at revalued value. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial
period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.
The depreciation on construction in process commences since the completion and
exploitation of constructed asset.
3.9 Intangible assets
3.9.1 Measurement
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are measured at cost less accumulated
amortization and accumulated impairment losses.
3.9.2 Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits
embodied in the specific asset, replaces or services its component, providing that the
Company may demonstrate that these expenditures meet the definition and recognition criteria
of intangible assets. All other expenditures are recognized in profit or loss when incurred.
3.9.3 Amortization
The depreciable amount of an intangible asset is allocated on a systematic basis over its useful
life on a straight-line basis.
Amortisation of an intangible asset is calculated from the moment since the asset is available
for use. Amortisation ceases at an earlier of the following two dates:
a) when the intangible asset is classified as held for sale; etc.
b) when the intangible asset is derecognized
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
* Computer software                                      I to 10 years
Water usage rights and licenses                          10 years
* Other intangible assets                                I to 10 years
Amortization for an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not calculated.
17


﻿3.10 Leases
3.10.1 Finance leases
Leases in terms of which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as finance leases. The assets under finance lease are recognized by
]                 Lessee.
During the reporting year, the Company does not have assets received or surrendered under
finance lease.
[I                3.10.2 Operating leases
Lease other than financial lease is operating lease. The assets under operating lease are
]            recognized by Lessor.
Payments made or received under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
3.11 Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of interchangeable
inventories is determined using the weighted average value formula. The cost of inventories
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing
location and condition.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Materials intended for use in the course of
provision of services and other inventories are not revalued lower than their cost if it is
expected that the service for the provision of which they will be used, will be sold at a price
equal or higher than the cost.
3.12 Impairment
At each reporting date, property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If there is an indication of possible impairment, the recoverable amount of any affected asset
(or group of related assets) is estimated and compared with its carrying amount. If estimated
recoverable amount is lower, the carrying amount is reduced to its estimated recoverable
amount, and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Similarly, at each reporting date, inventories are assessed for impairment by comparing the
carrying amount of each item of inventory (or group of similar items) with its selling price
less costs to complete and sell. If an item of inventory (or group of similar items) is impaired,
its carrying amount is reduced to selling price less costs to complete and sell, and an
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective indication that
financial assets (or group of similar assets) measured at cost or amortized costs may be
impaired. If any such indication exists, the impairment loss is recognized directly in profit and
loss.
If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or group of
related assets) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount (selling price less
costs to complete and sell, in the case of inventories), but not in excess of the amount that
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (group of
I
18
I


﻿related assets) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in
profit or loss.
3.13 Short-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries short-term compensated absences (such
as paid annual leave and paid sick leave), and bonuses.
When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, the
Company recognizes the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be
paid in exchange for that service:
a) as a liability after deducting the amount already paid. If the amount already paid exceeds
the undiscounted amount of benefits, the Company recognizes this difference as an asset
to the extent that this prepayment will lead e.g. to a decrease in future payments, or
recovery of financial resources; and
b) as an expense, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.
3.14 Provisions
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or
constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle
the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably
surround many events and circumstances are taken into account in reaching the best estimate
of a provision. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a
provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation. The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
3.15 Revenue
3.15.1. Services
When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated
reliably, revenue associated with the transaction are recognised by reference to the stage of
completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. The outcome of a transaction can be
estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied:
a)    the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
b)   it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to
the Company.
Revenue from water supply and sewerage services is recognised in parallel with the rendering
of services on a monthly basis. The amount of services rendered is determined based on the
quantity of water used by customers and tariff approved by Public Services Regulatory
Commission of the Republic of Armenia. Stage of completion of other services is estimated
based on the review of work performed.
3.15.2 Goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been
satisfied:
a) the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of
the goods;
19
I
n1


﻿b) The Company retains none of the following:
1. continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership;
II. effective control over the goods sold;
c) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
d) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the
Company.
Company's sale of goods includes sale of water meters and tangible assets available in excess
in the Company, or assets which are not suitable for use. Revenue from sale of mentioned
goods is recognized at the moment when the ownership towards the goods passes to the
buyer.
3.16 Cost of sales
The cost of water supplied and sewerage consists of salaries of staff directly involved in
service provision; materials used as well as other direct overhead (variable and fixed) related
to provision of services.
Variable operational overhead expenses are those indirect costs related to provision of
services that directly or semi-directly are varied corresponding to sale volume, as an example,
supplementary materials related to service provision, salary of supplementary service.
Variable overhead costs are allocated to unit of service based on actual operational capacity.
Fixed operational overhead expenses are such indirect cost related to provision of services
that are relatively stable regardless to service volumes, example, depreciation of operational
buildings and equipment, maintenance costs of those assets, administration of operational
division and general operational costs. Allocation of operational overhead expenses to service
cost is done based on standard capacities of operational means used. The standard capacity is
the service level that reached in several average periods considering planed idle periods.
Fixed operational overhead costs allocated to unit of service are not increased while for low
LJ               effectiveness or idealness. Unallocated overhead costs are recognized as expense in the period
as incurred.
Selling and administrative overhead costs are not included in the cost of sales but recognized
as expense in the period as incurred.
3.17 Government grants
Government grants are recognized as a deferred income if there is reasonable assurance that:
a) the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them; and
b) the grants will be received.
Government grants are measured at fair value.
Government grants recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them with the
related consists which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis.
A government grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already
incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Company with no
future related costs is recognized as income of the period in which it becomes receivable.
The Government grants received by the Company include subsidies from the Government, co-
financing from Government in relation to credits of International Development Association,
European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, International Bank of Reconstruction
and Development, and Asian Development Bank, as well as computer hardware received
from USAID, water meters and other assets.

﻿U
I
3.18 Financial expense and income
Finance income comprises interest income accrued on current accounts.
Finance expenses comprise interest costs on borrowings. Borrowing costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset form part of
the cost of that asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs expensed in the period
I                 in which they accrued.
3.19 Income taxes
3.19.1 Current tax
Income tax on current year profit or loss consists of current tax. Current tax is recognized as
an income or expense and are included in the net profit or loss of the period, except to the
extent that the taxes arise as a result of an event or a transaction which is recognized directly
in equity during the same or another reporting period, in which case taxes are recognized
directly in equity.
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for a period.
Current tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to
be paid to the budget, using the tax rates that have been enacted by the reporting date.
3.19.2 Deferred tax
Deferred taxes (deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets) of the Company are
conditioned by carry-forward of temporary differences (taxable and deductible temporary
differences) and unused tax losses to the future periods.
Deferred taxes arising as a result of temporary differences are calculated using balance sheet
liability method, based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities used for preparation of financial statements, and amounts used for taxation
purposes (tax base).
A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences unless the deferred
tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at
the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).
A deferred tax asset is recognized for deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary
difference can be utilized, unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the transaction, affects neither
accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses carried forward, to the extent that it is
probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary
difference can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied
upon realization of the asset or settlement of liability, based on the tax rates that have been
enacted or substantially enacted as of the reporting date.

﻿3.20 Changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and material errors
3.20.1 Changes in accounting policies
The Company accounts for a change in accounting policy resulting from the initial application
of an IFRS in accordance with the specific transitional provisions, if any, in that IFRS. When
the Company changes an accounting policy upon initial application of an IFRS that does not
include specific transitional provisions applying to that change, or changes an accounting
policy voluntarily, the change is applied retrospectively.
When a change in accounting policy is applied, the Company adjusts the opening balance of
each affected component of retained earnings. Comparative information is restated while it is
realizable.
There were no accounting policy changes in the reporting year that could have effect in these
financial statements.
3.20.2 Changes in accounting estimates
The effect of a change in an accounting estimate is recognised by including it in net profit or
LI loss in:
(a)   the period of the change, if the change affects that period only; or
(b)   the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.
When it is difficult to distinguish a change in an accounting policy from a change in an
accounting estimate, the change is treated as a change in an accounting estimate.
There were no changes in an accounting estimate in the reporting year that has an effect in the
financial statements of the current period or is expected to have an effect in future periods.
Il               3.20.3 Prior period errors
Prior period material errors are corrected retrospectively after their discovery by:
(a) restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) presented in which the error
occurred; or
(b) if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening
balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest prior period presented.

(d) Revaluation
As at 31.12.2012 revaluation of water supply and sewerage pipelines was conducted in
accordance with RA Government decree NI 187-A dated 20 September 2012. The revaluation
was conducted by a qualified valuer. Revaluation results were approved by the decree of the
Government of RA N262-A dated 21.03.2013.
As there is no market-based evidence of fair value because of the specialized nature of the
some items, for example, water supply and sewerage pipelines, the fair value of those assets
are estimated applying depreciated replacement cost approach.
As at revaluation date any accumulated depreciation amount of revaluated assets and any
accumulated impairment loss were mutually eliminated against the gross cost of the asset and
the net amount restated to the revalued amount of the asset.
Net increase from revaluation conducted as at 31.12.2012 was AMD 19,259,053 thousand
from which AMD 19,567,943 thousand is recognised in equity, and AMD 308,890 thousand
decrease in profit or loss.

and Development, International Bank of Reconstruction and Development, European Investment
Bank) and Asian Development Bank with fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings in
.            floating interest rate expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk, and borrowings in fixed
interest rate expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. The relevant information on the
mentioned loan is presented in the Note 19. Management does not have a formal policy of
determining how much of the Company's exposure is to fixed or variable rates. However, at the
time of raising new loans or borrowings management uses its judgment to decide whether it
believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favorable to the Company over the expected
period until maturity.
24.1.3 Other price risk
Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or
currency risk). The management assessed that the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities
does not materially different from their carrying value as at reporting date.

I amount of receivables is determined in a manner other than water meters, the credit risk is
significantly higher. As a result of assessment the provision for impairment as at 30.06.20 15 was
assessed at the amount of 5,83 1,774 thousand AMD (31 .12.2014: 5,719,699 thousand AMD).

fl        24.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations
associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
To manage the liquidity risk the Company prepares three-year cash flow forecasts which serve as
a basis the next year's budget approved by the board of directors. The cash flow forecasts
include state subsides receivable approved at each year state budget. The subsidies are based on
tariff calculations for water supply and sewerage services.
The payables for credits are included in the cash forecasts based on credit repayment schedules.
If the cash budget does not ensure satisfactory cash balances to repay the debt in accordance to
credit schedule then the repayments are projected through state resources, particularly, release of
payments for previous, current and the next year (Note 19).
The Company finance department monitors liquidity of the Company to ensure enough cash
balances for operational activity following the approved annual cash budget of the Company.
The Company does not have derivative financial liabilities. The following table analysis the
Company non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the
remaining periods at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date.

25. Contingencies
25.1 Insurance
The Company's property and equipment, except vehicles are not insured. The Company does not
have coverage for its plant facilities, business interruption, or third party liability in respect of
property or environmental damage arising from accidents on Company's property or relating to
Company's operations, except for third party liabilities arising from car accidents. Until the
Company obtains adequate insurance coverage, there is a risk that the loss or destruction of
certain assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and financial
position.
25.2 Contingent liabilities and provisions
It is not anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from the suites brought against the
Company or other contingent liabilities, except does that are already recognized in these
financial statements.
25.3 Tax regulation
The taxation system in Armenia is relatively new and is characterised by frequent changes in
legislation, which are sometimes unclear, contradictory and subject to varying interpretation.
Taxes are subject to review and investigation by tax authorities, which have the relevant
EL            authority.
No tax liabilities are created for reviled tax violations with more than three years of maturity. But
in some cases the mentioned maturity period could be suspended.
These circumstances may create tax risks in Armenia that are more significant than in other
countries. Management believes that it has provided adequately for tax liabilities based on its
interpretations of applicable Armenian tax legislation. However, the interpretations of the
relevant authorities could differ and the effect could be significant if due authorized bodies are
successful in enacting their interpretations.
