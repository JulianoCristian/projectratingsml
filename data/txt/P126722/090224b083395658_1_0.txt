On the special purpose financial statements of

for the period from 1 January 2015 to 12 October 2015
To the management of "Armenian Water and Sewerage" CJSC
We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of "Municipal Water

Position as at 12 October 2015, the Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds, the Statement of
Uses of Funds by Project Activity, Summary of summary reports and SOEs, Statement of
Designated Account for the period from I January 2015 to 12 October 2015, and a summary
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of
these special purpose financial statements in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting
described in the Note 2 accompanying these special purpose financial statements, and for such
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of special
purpose financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud
or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the special purpose financial statements are free
from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the risk of material
misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the special purpose financial statement in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also
includes the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the special
purpose financial statements.
