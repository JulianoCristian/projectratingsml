                 To the management of"Armenian Water and Sewerage" CJSC
0                We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of"Municipal Water
                 Project" (the Project) financed by IBRD Loan 8129-AM and implemented by "Armenian
0                Water and Sewerage" CJSC (the Company), which comprise the Statement of Financial
                 Position as at 31 December 2014, the Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds, the Statement
                 of Uses of Funds by Project Activity, Summary of summary reports and SOEs, Statement of
0                Designated Account for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies
                 and other explanatory notes.


0                Management 's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

                 The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of

c                these special purpose financial statements in accordance with the basis of accounting
                 described in the Note 2 accompanying these special purpose financial statements, and for such
                 internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of special

c                purpose financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud
                 or error.


0                Auditor's Responsibility

                 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based
                 on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
0                Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
                 audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the special purpose financial statements are free
                 from material misstatement.
Q
                 An audit involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable audit evidence about the

c                amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. The procedures selected
                 depend on the auditor's judgment including the assessment of the risk of material
                 misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
                 making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
0                preparation and fair presentation of the special purpose financial statement in order to design
                 audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
                 expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also
0                includes the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
                 estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the special
                 purpose financial statements.
