A.2. Project Objectives: 
 
The development objective of the project is to support the national program that aims to 
prevent and to control the spread of HIV/AIDS and to mitigate the socio-economic 
impact of the disease on the population. The project will use a two pronged strategy: 
targeting interventions at high risk groups and implementing non-targeted activities for 
the general population. Successful achievement of the development objective will 
demonstrate: (a) sustained national commitment to the HIV/AIDS response; (b) reduced 
incidence of HIV infections by a higher use of safe sexual practices in high risk; (c) 
prolonged and improved quality of life of people living with AIDS; (d) mitigated 
negative impact of HIV/AIDS on infected persons and their families; and (e) reduced 
degree of stigma and discrimination associated with the disease.

A.3. Project Description 
 
This project is part of the third phase of The World Bank’s Caribbean Multi-Country 
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending (APL) approved in June 
2001.   The project will be financed through a blend of IDA grant, IDA credit and IBRD 
loan.  The project will cost US$ 8 million equivalent.  It has the following four 
components: 
 
Component 1: Community And Civil Society Initiatives.
  This component will finance HIV/AIDS 
prevention, care and support activities of civil society organizations.  The types of HIV/AIDS activities to 
be supported include: delivery of community based HIV/AIDS IEC/BCC; Condom distribution and/or 
social marketing; home based care of PLWHA; community advocacy to reduce HIV/AIDS stigma and 
discrimination; support activities for orphans and widows/widowers of HIV/AIDS; support activities for 
people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.  Capacity building of civil society organizations will also be 
supported. 
 
Component 2: Line Ministry Response.  
This component will support the response to 
HIV/AIDS by non-health sector line ministries.  There are basic cross-cutting HIV/AIDS 
activities which all ministries are  expected to implement under their respective 
HIV/AIDS programs. These include:  development and implementation of workplace 
HIV/AIDS policies; IEC/BCC for HIV/AIDS and STDs; condom distribution and 
promotion; advocacy to reduce HIV/AIDS stigmatization and discrimination, particularly 
in the work place.  The project will also support  HIV/AIDS related interventions that are 
specific to the external clients of ministries. 
 
Component 3: Strengthening The Health Sector Response To HIV/AIDS
.  
This component will 
strengthen the health sector response to HIV/AIDS by supporting HIV/AIDS related services for 
prevention, treatment and care.  It will strengthen existing primary health care  (PHC) services to 
respond to HIV/AIDS.  Capacity building will include strengthening of diagnostic capacity of the 
health care system, training of health care staff  and strengthening of monitoring and evaluation. 
 
 
Component 4: Strengthening Institutional Capacity For Program Management.  
This component will support: strengthening institutional capacity for coordinating and 
managing the National HIV/AIDS Program;  and program monitoring and evaluation.  It 
will also support drafting of a comprehensive new act that will ensure to people living 
with HIV/AIDS and other vulnerable populations, including children affected by 
HIV/AIDS, full equality and dignity under the law as well as updating the necessary legal 
and regulatory provisions to make the country’s legal framework compliant with the 
WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in a manner 
that fully protects the public health and that promotes access to HIV/AIDS drugs and 
related medicines and supplies to all who need them.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The proposed project has a Category “B” environmental rating.  Overall , activities under 
the project are not expected to generate adverse environmental impacts.  Some medical 
waste is expected to be generated from care and treatment activities. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
NONE 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The St. Lucia Solid Waste Management Authority (SLSWMA) is responsible for solid 
waste management in the country.  With joint funding from GPEC and the Canadian 
International Development Agency’s Industrial Cooperation Program (CIDA INC), 
GPEC developed the Medical Waste And Other Bio-Hazardous Wastes Management 
Plan for St. Lucia.  The plan addresses waste generated in the healthcare industry (e.g. 
hospitals, medical laboratories, health clinics, doctors and dentist offices, veterinary, and 
funeral parlors) as well as condemned meats and quarantined foodstuff.  The plan is 
under implementation: most of the investments in biomedical waste disposal equipment 
has been completed and installed; guidelines for management of biomedical waste in 
health facilities are in use.  This project will finance the training of health care workers 
on biomedical waste management to ensure the continuity of the practices that have been 
institutionalized.   
 
The SLSWMA provides technical oversight  and health care facilities have adequate 
capacity for implementation of the plan. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The biomedical waste management report was prepared  through consultations with  
technical staff in the SLSWMA and health care workers at different health care facilities 
and officials of the Ministry of Health. Dissemination involved use of the official 
Government website and the official gazette.
