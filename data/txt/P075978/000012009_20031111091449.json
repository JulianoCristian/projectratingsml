build human capital\n            in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) which\n            in turn will contribute to the diversification of their\n            economy and more sustainable growth. St. Lucia and St. Kitts\n            and Nevis are the first of the OECS countries to join the\n            program. There are three main project components. The first\n            increases equitable access and equity in secondary\n            education, particularly in poor rural communities, by\n            constructing a new secondary school in St. Kitts and\n            providing equipment, furniture, and materials; and expanding\n            the school meals program in secondary schools. The second\n            component comprises 4 subcomponents, which 1) develop\n            curriculum for Forms i-III and provide instructional guides,\n            textbooks, ad other resource materials; train\n            trainers/educators in select areas, including fellowships,\n            and development of a coordinated teacher appraisal system;\n            2) establish learning resource centers, and expand and\n            upgrade learning centers, including science and information\n            technology labs; 3) elaborate program to support\n            participation of disadvantaged students, and related teacher\n            development in special education; and, 4) provide\n            school-based improvement projects, and extra-curricular\n            activities. The third component expands the education\n            management information system, including networking of\n            schools and EMIS training."}, "docdt": "2002-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
