ecosystems\n            requiring attention, and/or protection. The site for school\n            construction is presently occupied by two large farming\n            plots, and the Ministry of Agriculture have agreed to\n            relocate farmers to appropriate sites, of equally\n            accessible, and comparable plots, based on communications\n            among all parties involved. The site is located adjacent to\n            a steep sided ghaut, thus the development has made\n            provisions for a 100 feet buffer zone, and mitigation\n            includes placing dust screens around the area, particularly\n            close to the Housing development, and playing field;\n            materials, and surfaces will be water sprayed, while a\n            phased removal of vegetation should prevent large areas\n            becoming exposed to erosion. In addition, rainwater off the\n            various buildings, will be collected into cisterns to serve\n            as reserves in times of drought, while a proper sewage\n            system will be designed, to incorporate the\n            development's future demands, taking into consideration\n            the present drilling plans of the Water Department, and the\n            need to prevent groundwater contamination. However,\n            percolation tests will be required to inform due process. An\n            adequate drainage system should be designed to prevent\n            occurrence of erosion on the site, during and after construction."}, "docdt": "2001-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
