development outcome. The\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and the\n            borrower's performance was satisfactory. The main\n            lessons learned were: (1) Results framework with a clear\n            link between outputs and outcomes. The link between\n            Project's activities and the outcome indicators was not\n            clearly addressed in the project document. As a result,\n            these indicators could not adequately measure the project\n            achievements. To maintain the focus on Project Development\n            Objectives (PDO) during the implementation and to clearly\n            address how different activities and components fit\n            together, creating a well-defined results framework is\n            critical. (2) Consistent monitoring of indicators throughout\n            the project. During the project implementation, not all the\n            PDO indicators were included in the Implementation Status\n            and Results Report and the data was not updated regularly.\n            In addition, the data criteria seemed to be inconsistent.\n            This has made the project assessment difficult. (3)\n            Realistic cost estimate and scope of work. The Project\n            experienced significant cost overrun. This led to the\n            reduction of scope of the activities, which caused\n            additional delays. The activities should not be included\n            unless their funding is assured. The project teams should\n            ensure that funding is assured for all the planned\n            activities based on a realistic cost estimate. (4)\n            Infrastructure maintenance scheme put upfront. (5)\n            Continuity from preparation to implementation. The Project\n            Advisory Committee was set up to guide the whole process of\n            the Project, from preparation to implementation. (6)\n            Communication within the Bank. There were some cases that\n            the Bank's advice to the Government varied depending on\n            the individual officers. The mixed messages from the Bank\n            caused some confusion and frustration in the project team\n            and affected implementation. It is important that the\n            Bank's advice to the client is consistent regardless of\n            the personnel who process a client's request. (7)\n            Balance between sub-regional approach and targeted approach.\n            When setting up regional institutions or initiatives, clear\n            arrangements for staffing and sustainability should be\n            agreed upfront."}, "docdt": "2009-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
