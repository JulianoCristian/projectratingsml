Although\n            the two main objectives were achieved, the main condition of\n            the project, to permit ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Commission)\n            to enter into joint ventures with international oil\n            companies for the development of existing oil fields, was\n            not met by the Government. The Ministry of Petroleum and\n            Natural Gas has not yet acted on several proposals for joint\n            ventures to develop existing fields. The project's\n            sustainability is uncertain at this time, institutional\n            development is negligible, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. The main lesson to be\n            learned from this project is that the Government of India\n            must continue to encourage foreign direct investment in its\n            oil industry."}, "docdt": "1993-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
