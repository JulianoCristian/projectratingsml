Project for El Salvador are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Ratings for the Land\n            Administration Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Land Fund Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: the assessed projects make\n            assertions about enhanced tenure security, increased credit\n            access and reduced conflict over land rights but provided no\n            evidence to back these claims up. There is a literature\n            outside the Bank challenging these assumptions and the Bank\n            has only recently begun to take this into account. There are\n            a number of ways to measure tenure security and the progress\n            toward increasing it; and these measures need to be taken\n            into account in project design and monitored during\n            implementation. Summing up, security of land tenure is not\n            automatically boosted by land administration initiatives;\n            good land administration is a necessary (but not sufficient)\n            step toward secure land tenure. EI Salvador-with its single\n            agency-has made more progress toward technical integration\n            than Guatemala with its separate agencies. A unified agency\n            is preferred, if it can be politically established. If a\n            unified agency is not politically feasible, effective\n            arrangements for data integration must be introduced,\n            otherwise the unsatisfactory experience of Guatemala will be\n            repeated in other places. There are steps that can be taken\n            during project design and implementation to make it more\n            likely that integration will be effective. Regularization\n            may be more urgent, more feasible and more sustainable in\n            urban areas and in fertile rural areas with dynamic land\n            markets. Urban regularization could usefully be accompanied\n            by complementary efforts to improve municipal services,\n            municipal financing and slum upgrading. In rural areas,\n            there is more of a need to adopt an integrated approach to\n            land in private property, protected areas and indigenous\n            communities (the last two typically having been orphaned in\n            land administration projects)."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
