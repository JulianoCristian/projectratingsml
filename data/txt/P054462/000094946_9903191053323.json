{"cdata!": "The Land Fund Project seeks to assist\n            the Government to: a) establish a program to facilitate\n            access to land to beneficiaries; b) support beneficiaries to\n            access technical assistance and productive subproject\n            financing; and c) improve the legal and institutional\n            framework for land markets to work more efficiently. There\n            are four project components. First, institutional\n            strengthening will support procurement of vehicles, office\n            and field equipment and provide technical assistance and\n            training. Second, community strengthening involves pre-and\n            post-land purchase services. The component will support\n            communities and establish their legal entity status,\n            organize themselves according to their uses and practices,\n            research legal status of prospective lands to be purchased,\n            etc. Third, community subprojects will finance social and\n            productive complementary infrastructure investments related\n            to land purchased under the program. The last component,\n            land purchases and leases, is not financed by the Bank."}, "docdt": "1998-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
