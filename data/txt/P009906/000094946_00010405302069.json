were satisfactorily\n            met, but its environmental performance was unsatisfactory,\n            and sustainability is unlikely. Excessively broad investment\n            eligibility criteria, poorly designed interest rate\n            covenant, and lack of interest rate subsidy reporting during\n            implementation, contributed to a marginal Bank performance,\n            coupled with the failure to incorporate sludge disposal in\n            subproject design. Regardless of the borrower's\n            satisfactory counterpart funding, inadequate procurement,\n            and project coordination/management practices were\n            nonetheless unsatisfactory. The key lessons convey that\n            institutional strengthening, and technical assistance\n            components, should complement the investment component,\n            along with an agreed implementation program, in place at the\n            preparation stage. In addition, procurement of equipment\n            should be decentralized to beneficiaries, which\n            incidentally, local World Bank offices, have already,\n            delegated these responsibilities accordingly. To ensure\n            effluents sustainability, a model should be developed - to\n            contain pollution - in accordance with adequate design,\n            scope, management, and ownership issues, as well as cost\n            sharing systems. Since environmental credit lines rarely\n            contribute to successful outcomes, well designed technical\n            assistance, and institutional building, should prod\n            environmental performance."}, "docdt": "1999-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
