to prevent\n            and alleviate environmental degradation caused by industrial\n            operations and assist in the successful attainment of the\n            proposed short and medium-term targets of its environmental\n            policy. The project is designed to assist in the\n            identification and implementation of a cost effective\n            program for industrial pollution monitoring, control, and\n            abatement within the context of institutional and financial\n            constraints present in India. The project comprises three\n            components: (1) an institutional component designed to\n            strengthen the Central and State Pollution Control Boards in\n            the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar\n            Pradesh; (2) an investment component designed to support\n            efforts by industry to comply with regulations, including\n            the support for the set up of common treatment facilities;\n            and (3) a technical assistance component designed to support\n            the Ministry of Environment and the DFI's to provide\n            specialized technical assistance for the evaluation of\n            environmental problems and the assessment of their solutions."}, "docdt": "1991-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
