MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRMSIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION ANID DEVEWPNET
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVEWPNENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO INDIA
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL POLUTION     ; MM  PROJ-ECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval,  the  followdg  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan of US$124 million equivalent and development
credit of SDR 23.4 million, (US$31.6 million equivalent) to India, to help
finance an Industrial Pollution Control project. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years
maturity.
2.         The Government would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to the
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (US$50 million) and the
Industrial Development Bank of India (US$74 million). The Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk, onlending to the institutions in Rupees, at an
interest rate of 2% below the long term domestic lending rate (currently 15),
with a repayment period of 15 years, including five years of grace.
3.        Biakgamiun.  Since the early 1970s, InUdia has forcefully moved to
reduce the conflict between industrial development and environmental protection.
Among the actions already undertaken to achieve this goal are: (a) the enactment
of laws and regulations governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and
water bodies, as well as the generation and disposal of toxic and bazardous
residues and the development of safety codes for factory operations; (b) the
creation of rsforcement agencies to monitor and oversee compliance with the
envlronmental Xaws; and (c) the enactment of an umbrella environmental act
empowering the state to pursue environmental protection measures. The Government
has also introduced a number of incentives and penalties to ncourage industry
to comply with environmental standards. The Gavernment's actions have already
had a significant effect by encouraging a favorable change in attitude in
industry toward environmental concerns, the adoption of environmental Impact
assessments as standard practice for new industrial projects and the
implementation of a large number of treatment plants and abatement measures at
existing units.
4.         As industtrial modernization is a key element of the development
strategy of the country, efforts continue to be mounted to control and reduce
its adverse environmental impact. The Government is in the process of enacting
a policy statement for the promotion of environmentally safe industrial growth,
conservation of natural resources, waste minimization and control and abatement
of pollution. The elements of the strategy are still being defined but are
likely to Lnclude: (a) the internalization of environmental concerns in economic
policy making; (b) the integration of environmental policy within industrial
policy particularly for the future development of the chemical industry and the
small scale sectors; and (c) the adoption of a common management strategy for
environmental policy with active participation of industry and the public. The



2
proposed targets for this policy for the next five years are: (a) to reduce by
25% the use of water by the industrial sector and the generation of solid
residues and all emissions of pollutants from lndustrial sources into water
bodies; (b) to promote the adoption and implementation of common effluent
treatment plants at existing clusters ofamall scale industries; (c) to contain
the emissions of airborne pollutants, in particular COs and SOx, at present
levels; and, (d) to regulate the use of non-biodegradable products and the
disposal of toxic and hazardous waste. These targets are optimistic and may take
longer to achieve.
5.          Lesgons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. This project is the
first stand alone environmental operstion in India dealing with control and
abatement of industrial pollution and the first dedicated environmental operation
for industry in the Asia region. It therefore involves an element of role
definition. However, the implementation of industrial finance projects in India
has been satisfactory with disbursement rates consistent with Bank standards.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvent.  The proposed project fits CZearly
within the proposed strategies for pollution control in India as described by
the draft Policy Statement on Abatement of Pollution, now being developed by the
Government, and by the draft Environmental Action Plan, currently under
preparation. The proposed Action Plan calls for the formulation of specific
action programs for some of the most critical environmental problem confronting
India including: (i) the strengthening of the relevant institutions; (ii)
industrial pollution control; and, (iii) ensuring safe water supply.  The
proposed project directly deals with these priorities and addresses the technical
asistance, financial resources and policy advice needed to address environmental
concerns in industry.
7.          rro1ect Obtectives. The project's overall objective is to support
the Government of India's (GOI's) efforts to prevent and alleviate environmental
degradation caused by industrial operations. The project is designed to assist
in identifying and implementing a cost effective program for industrial pollut.ion
monitoring, control and abatement within the context of institutional and
financial constraints present in India. The project specific goals are:(i) to
promote effective and timely enforcement of existing legislation on environmental
protection regarding industrial sources; (ii) to support efforts by industry to
comply with existing environmental regulations, includiag a special effort
designed to reach the small scale sector by setting up common treatment
facilities; and (iiI) to support assessments, extension services and research
in waste minimization, resource recovery and pollution abatement in industry.
8.          Pro1ect Deserintion.  The project will focus on the chemical and
related industries including fertilizers, tanning, dyes, pesticides and
insecticides, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, pulp and paper, and sugar and
distilleries, which as a group have been identified as a major source of
industrial pollution. Because of their size and importance, and the nature of
their operations, these industrial subsectors have a substantial potential for
pollution control and monitoring investments with sizable environmental-benefits.
Under the project, efforts to monitor, control and alleviate industrial pollution
will be concentrated in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Radu and Uttar
Pradesh. The first three states are the seat for the bulk of the chemical and



3
related industrial sector In India, while Uttar Pradesh ls the largest state,
with a large numbor of small and medium size industrLal plants.
9.          The proposed project comprises three components:
(i) Ten l El 0nln SgldglW Lis designed to strengthen the monitoring
and enforcement abillty of the 001 by financing a program of
improvements at the Central and selected State Pollution Control
Boards to enable effective implementation of their mandates. The
component would finance: (a) a training program in technical and
managerial skills; (b) acquisition of equipment required to upgrade
technLeal capabilitieo of tho Boards; and (c) other laboratory
facllities.
(ii) The Investment Component would finance: (a) individual enterprise
projects in the target sectors dealing with waste inilmization,
resource recovery and pollution abatement; (b) implementation of
common treatment facilities at industrial estates for the treatment
and proper disposal of liquid and solid wastes; and (c) demonstration
projects selected on the basis of their innovative nature, potential
environmental beneflts and other eligibllity criteria agreed between
the GOI and the Bank.
(iMi) The Technical Assistance CoSgonent would assist: (a) the Ministry
of Bnvironment and Forests (NOEF) to evaluate enironmental problem
and develop solutions; and (b) the DFIs to assist enterprises in
undertaking the required feasibilLty studies for pollution control
investments.
10.        The total project cost is about US$260 million equivalent, icluding
physical and price contingencles.  Direct and indirect foreip exchange costs
account for about US$56 million, or 22% of the total cost. A summary of project
costs and the financig plan are presented in Schedule A. Asmots and methods
of procurement, and the dlsbursement schedule are shonm In Scbedule B. All
project funds are expected to be disbursed in seven years. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are
given in schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No.9347-
IN, dated Nay 7, 1991, is being distrlbuted separately.
11.        $yeed  Actions.    The  001 has  agreed  to:  (a)  maintain  an
Implementation Cell and a Steering Committee for the duration of the project and
provide them with the requislte assistance to carry out thelr functions properly;
(b) undertake and complete a study by Dcamber 31. 1991 on the organization and
management of the State Pollution Control Boards; (c) discuss wLth the Bank,
the progress in the iplementation of changes in the discharge standards for
industrial sources of pollution; (d) obtain a Letter of Understanding from IDBI
for channeling grant funds under the inuvstment and technical assistance
components, as a conditlon of loan effectiveness; and (e) relend to the DFIs the
proceeds of the Bank loan under the terms of Subsidiary Loan Agreements to be
signed as a condition of effectiveness, specifying lending in Rupees at a rate
2% below the DFIs' long-term domestic lendlng rate (currently 15%) with a maturity
of 20 years including up to five years of grace.



4
12.         The DFIs have agreed to relend the proceads of the Bank loan (a) in
accordance with sub-project eligibility criteria and free limits agreed with the
Bank; and (b) at an interest rate of 15% or such other rate as may be revised
in consultation with the Bank with sub-loan maturities of up to 15 years
including four years of grace.
13.         ACgfith. The main bonefits of the project are associated with the
reduction in environmental degradation, caused by industrial sources, resulting
from the activities described in the report. The institutional component is
expected to yield, in the short term, improvements in the effectiveness and
coverage of the Boards in their monitoring and enforcement activities. With
stronger Boards, the 001 will be able to promote stricter complianco with the
provisions of the environmental acts. The sponsoring of the common treatment
facilities is a pioneering effort with potential for replication across India.
Successful implementation of the proposed facilities should result in a
substantial impact in the environmental performance of the small and medium
scale industries which so far have proved resistant to change. By providing
technical and financial support for individual enterprise efforts in waste
minimization and resource recovery, the project is expected to contribute
substantially to a reduction of waste generation in the chemical and related
industries.    The support of demonstration projects will assist in the
introduction of novel techniques and processes for solving pervasive
environmental problems in industry.
14.         Risks.  Specific project risks are associated with the response of
industry to the need to improve the environmental aspects of their operations.
Although the project places priority on the strengthening of the amonitorlig and
enforcement institutions, in the final analysis it is the ability to convey these
concerns to the manufacturer that will deterine the success of the operation.
The weaknesses of the State Boards, among these the current inadequacies in
training aud infrastructure, represent an implementation risk. lowever, GoI's
commitment to address the shortcomings In organization and management structure
of the Boards and the project sponsored actions in training, equipment and
facilities will greatly contribute to improve their effectiveness.   The
investment component has been carefully sized to reflect the knwn demand for
investments in pollution control.
15.         Re    *ndatiRn   I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
respectively, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.
