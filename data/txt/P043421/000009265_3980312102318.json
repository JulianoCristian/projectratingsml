metropolitan region\n            (RJMR) by developing a fully integrated urban transport\n            system; and 2) to substantially improve the level of service\n            provided by the Suburban Train Company (Flumitrens) by\n            reducing operating subsidies and increasing private sector\n            participation in its operations and management. The project\n            has two components: 1) an infrastructure and equipment\n            component that rehabilitates/refurbishes Flumitrens'\n            rolling stock and infrastructure and rehabilitates or builds\n            transfer stations between the trains and other modes (Metro,\n            buses, and ferries); and 2) an institutional and policy\n            development component that helps a) support the process of\n            concessioning Flumitrens to the private sector through\n            technical assistance for preparing and evaluating bids; b)\n            operate the Regional Transport Coordination Commission\n            (RTCC) for the RJMR; c) prepare an integrated Transport\n            Policy, Land Use, and Air Quality Management strategy for\n            the RJMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and\n            to introduce sound cost recovery, tariff, regulatory, and\n            subsidy policies; d) set up a comprehensive staff retraining\n            for Flumitrens; e) prepare feasibility studies and bidding\n            documents for a proposed extension and other priorities of\n            the mass transit system; and f) implement an Environmental\n            and Traffic subcomponent."}, "docdt": "1997-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
