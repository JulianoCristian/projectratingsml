The Project Development\n            Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Performance (IPS)\n            ratings of  the project  have been satisfactory and have\n            succeeded in improving the rail transit sub sector of the\n            RJMR, decreasing its burden on the State Treasury by\n            eliminating operating subsidies. The additional financing\n            requested by the State is being requested solely to cover a\n            portion of the financing gap due to the devaluation of the\n            US$ in relation to the Brazilian and Korean currencies. With\n            this additional financing loan and the counterpart funds,\n            all contracts will be completed as planned. The State has\n            assured the Bank that it will continue to provide the US$20M\n            in counterpart fund requirements, so that by the end of the\n            project the Bank will finance 67 percent of the project cost\n            instead of the original 50 percent."}, "docdt": "2007-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
