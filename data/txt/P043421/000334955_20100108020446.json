Janeiro Mass\n            Transit Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: designing a more comprehensive\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework: while the\n            project monitored the quality of services and operating\n            subsidy in accordance with the stated project development\n            objectives (PDOs), this M&E framework did not allow for\n            an assessment of the general benefit to public welfare or\n            the impact on the poor. It is recommended that projects with\n            similar objectives also monitor ridership classified by\n            income class and the affordability of services. The periodic\n            rehabilitation of existing trains can be a cost-effective\n            option if a system has spare operating capacity. However, it\n            can be unexpectedly costly and complicated if the\n            implementing agency does not have very specialized technical\n            and management capacity. It often takes longer and costs\n            more than planned because it is difficult to assess all of\n            the rehabilitation costs without disassembling the cars.\n            Also, rehabilitation does not allow for the easy\n            installation of some modern features including signaling,\n            telecommunications, air conditioning and energy-efficiency\n            improvements such as regenerative braking."}, "docdt": "2009-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
