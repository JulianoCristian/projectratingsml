F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
1. Improve the quality of urban transport services in the RJMR by enhancing the
development of a fully integrated urban transport system.

  2. To substantially improve the level of service provided by Flumitrens while reducing
the operating subsidies it receives from the State through the susbstantial participation of
the private sector in its operation and management.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Brazil's Economy

By 1997, when the appraisal was finalized, the economic climate in Brazil was uncertain.
Although inflation had dropped to 6.9% from almost 16% a year earlier, fiscal austerity
measures announced by the government to shore up the Brazilian Real in the wake of the
financial turmoil in Asia brought a drop in economic activity. Of the 27 Brazilian states, 18
states, including the State of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ), promised the federal government to slash
their budgets. Public spending began a downward trend in 1997 as fiscal discipline became a
mantra for the government. Primary fiscal balances began going up steadily in 1999.

While these risks were considered at appraisal, an unpredictable macro-economic
environment in Rio de Janeiro eventually affected infrastructure investments in general,
including the availability of counterpart funding from the State and the implementation of the
project as further described in Section 2. The Argentine macroeconomic crisis, which peaked
in 2001-2002, also negatively affected Brazil's trade and growth rates through 2003.

1.1.2 Urban Transport in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (RJMR)

Demand: In 1997, the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (RJMR) had 9.8 million
inhabitants spread irregularly over 18 individual municipalities, dominated by the Rio de
Janeiro Municipality (RJM) with 5.7 million inhabitants. The RJMR concentrated roughly 76
percent of the State's population. Each day, 13 million person-trips took place in the RJMR,


                                                         5
of which 40 percent were work trips. Of the total trips, 67 percent were by public transport, 11
percent by auto, 20 percent on foot, and the remaining 2 percent by other modes. Of the
public transport trips, 77 percent were by bus (mostly private operators), 4.5 percent by auto
(taxis, kombis), 4 percent by suburban train (Flumitrens, now the Central system operated by
SuperVia), 3 percent by subway (Metro), 1 percent by ferry, and 0.5 percent by other modes.
Of the 8.7 million trips by public transport, about half used more than one mode requiring
some sort of modal transfer. About 37 percent of all Metro trips, 47 percent of all train trips,
and 41 percent of all bus trips required one or more transfers to be completed. It is worth
noting that, at the time of appraisal, the suburban rail system's daily ridership had been
decreasing precipitously due to degrading infrastructure and services, from a high of over 1
million passengers per day in the mid 1980s to less than 200,000 by 1997.

Supply: Urban transport activity was dominated by road-based motorized modes, including
cars and buses, which had a significantly negative impact on the air quality of RJMR'. Despite
an expansive existing rail network, the lack of integration between the Metro (2 lines, only 23
, km) and the Flumitrens system (241 km) discouraged more rail trips in favor of buses and
automobiles, creating heavy congestion during peak hours and significantly increasing work
trip times. RJMR's topography, with hills and tunnels, makes it prone to traffic congestion,
especially when accidents and/or cars break down on major arteries. There is also limited
space for fully segregated busways. The average "carioca" (resident of Rio de Janeiro),
therefore, wasted considerable time each day stopped in traffic. The main users of the public
transport system were and continue to be the poor on the periphery of RJMR, who also bear
the brunt of the system's problems: (a) shortage of capacity at peak hours resulting in
overcrowded trains (>10 passengers/m2), (b) long work journeys (2.5-4.0 hours/day for a
round trip) from the metropolitan periphery to the urban centers, often with more than two
modal transfers; and (c) paying one-quarter or more of their income towards fares. The lack
of coordination and oversight from the three levels of government involved in urban transport,
particularly between the SRJ and the RJM, resulting in poor modal integration, no tariff
integration, lack of prioritization in urban transport investments, and no common policy on
pricing and subsidies.

Rationale for project: The Rio Mass Transit Project had its origins in the decision of the
Government of Brazil to transfer the Rio de Janeiro subdivision of the Brazilian Urban Train
Company (CBTU) to the State Government (supported by an earlier Bank loan 3633-BR, Rio
de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project, US$128 million), and the interest
of SRJ to improve the modal and tariff integration1 of urban trains with the state-owned
subway, the ferry system, and the bus transport system. In addition, faced with huge subsidies
to urban transport agencies (estimated at 8-10 percent of State revenues), SRJ embarked on a
far-reaching staff rationalization and concession program which was supported by a Bank
loan for State Reform. The Rio Mass Transit Project was fully consistent with the Bank's

 An integrated tariff allows passengers to pay one price for a journey requiring one or more transfers between
modes or operators involving a common (usually electronic) fare instrument. The price is usually less than the
sum of individual tariffs, which encourages trip-making. In São Paulo in recent years, the integrated modal tariff
(Bilhete Único) has substantially increased rail ridership. However, the companies that operate most bus
services in RJMR have generally opposed intermodal integration for fear it would hurt their business.

Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the time, as it was designed to: (a) promote reforms
and financial viability of public enterprises, including concessions or sale of state-owned
urban transport agencies to the private sector; (b) foster private sector participation in the
development of new infrastructure and its operation; (c) increase the efficiency of
infrastructure investments; (d) contribute to poverty alleviation; and (e) reduce Government
subsidies through improved tariff policies and financial management.

1.1.3 Institutional Issues

Three main government bodies were, and continue to be, responsible for overseeing the urban
transport sector in the RJMR: (a) the State Secretary of Transport (SETRANS) which
regulates all the inter-municipal bus, rail and ferry services of the region; (b) the Secretary of
Transport of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro which regulates municipal bus services and is
also responsible for traffic management and control in the RJM; and (c) the State Directorate
for Roads. Since the different levels of government had been formulating policies and
regulating urban transport without a formal coordinating arrangement, there was a lack of
consistency in the fares charged by similar or competing modes, a chronic lack of investment
in the rail system, and only embryonic modal integration. In 1998, in an attempt to improve
the deteriorating conditions of the suburban rail system, the State of Rio de Janeiro transferred
the vast majority of the system (5 lines, 225 km previously operated by the State-owned
company Flumitrens and now managed by the State-owned company Central) to a private
concessionaire (SuperVia) in the form of a concession without the direct transfer of operating
subsidies from public accounts.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original PDOs were: (a) to improve the quality of urban transport services in the RJMR
by enhancing the development of a fully integrated urban transport system; and (b) to
substantially improve the level of service provided by CENTRAL/Flumitrens while reducing
the operating subsidies it receives from the State through the substantial participation of the
private sector in its operations and management.

At the time of Appraisal, a formal results framework was not required by the Bank, but SRJ
did adopt the following performance indicators for the Flumitrens system (later known as
CENTRAL) in a monitoring letter dated March 24, 1999. These performance indicators are
described in more detail in Section F of the Datasheet, and their appropriateness is discussed
in section 2.3.
    1. Percentage of stations with integrated bus/rail and metro/rail lines
    2. Share of total urban transport trips
    3. Average interval between trains at peak hour (headway)
    4. Total number of paying passengers carried per day (linked trips)
    5. Availability of rolling stock (trains in operation/total train fleet)
    6. Staff costs
    7. Operating subsidy




                                                7
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
There were no changes to the PDOs.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of the project are the residents of the RJMR as a result of the creation
of an integrated mass transit system. Low-income populations benefit the most because they
are the main users of public transportation and directly benefit from physical and tariff
integration. Car users also benefit given the reduced number of buses in the streets replaced
by trains. Real estate interests also benefit because properties around the stations increase in
value. Finally, privatization of operations and the gradual decrease in operational subsidies
benefit the State government.

1.7 Other significant changes

The original loan agreement was amended several times to facilitate project implementation
given unfavorable macroeconomic and fiscal conditions, as explained further in Section 2.
Most of the amendments involved minor changes to the project components, loan categories,
disbursement percentages or extensions of the closing date to allow the Borrower to fully
implement the project. One restructuring of the project occurred in December 2001,
following a mid-term review, to replace Flumitrens (Companhia Fluminense de Trens
Urbanos) with Central (Companhia Estadual de Engenharia de Transportes e Logística) as
the Borrower's project implementing entity after the concession of the suburban rail system
was completed in 1999. The restructuring did not require Board approval since the project
objectives were unchanged. Two cancellations of part of the loan were made primarily due to
the Borrower's fiscal restrictions, one for US$17.1 million on October 23, 2000 and another
US$10.6 million on June 16, 2004. However, the total cancelled loan amount (US$27.7
million) was reinstated on November 7, 2006 at the request of the Borrower.

An additional financing for US$44 million was approved by the Board on December 28, 2007
to help finance the costs associated with the devaluation of the US Dollar and Korean Won
(currency of one of the biggest contracts financed by the loan) in relation to the Brazilian Real
and shortages in counterpart funds, which caused a financing gap. The project closing date
was extended by 18 months to allow the new loan to be fully disbursed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1   Project quality at entry was satisfactory for the reasons described below:
   a. The background analysis that supported the project design was solid as it was fully
      aligned with the main pillars of the CAS: equity, sustainability, competitiveness, and
      sound macro-economic management. The project was designed to advance the Bank's
      four-pillar metropolitan transport strategy in RJMR (described in Section 3.5(b)),
      which is still relevant today. More specifically, the project supported the reform and
      financial viability of public enterprises, including the concession of State-owned
      suburban rail system (Flumitrens) to the private sector; improving the efficiency of
      infrastructure investments; and contributing to economic growth and poverty
      alleviation by improving accessibility of low-income segments of the population to
      jobs, educational and health facilities.
   b. The project incorporated in its design the lessons from several Bank-financed projects
      in urban transport in Brazil and elsewhere, such as the need to: include institutional
      strengthening, ensure adequate counterpart funds by all levels of government
      involved, and involve the private sector through operational concessions.
   c. During preparation, the different levels of government were committed to the project,
      which had its origins in two major developments at the federal and state level: (i) the
      decentralization of the Rio de Janeiro Urban Trains from the Federal Government to
      the State of Rio de Janeiro in December 1994 (supported by Bank loan 3633-BR); and
      (ii) the decision of the new State administration which took office in January 1995 to
      achieve a more effective integration of all modes in the RJMR, with an aim of
      reducing subsidies to urban transportation agencies and substantially increasing the
      participation of the privates sector.
   d. The project was solidly conceived from a technical standpoint. A Bank-financed mass
      transportation plan was completed in 1995 that selected the corridors served by the
      Flumitrens system as the most cost-effective alternatives for an investment program.
      Alternatives to improving the level of service on the Flumitrens corridors using buses
      and busways were considered infeasible given the amount of expropriation and
      resettlement required to achieve the planned transport capacity. Thus, the project was
      designed to minimize total costs, including resettlement and environmental impacts,
      while improving major existing corridors, key multi-modal stations, supporting
      infrastructure, and increasing the rolling stock.
2.2.2   A range of risks were evaluated during project preparation and appropriate mitigation
        measures were considered, among the most important:
   a. Project costs and time overruns: This was mitigated by the use of well-known
      technology available from many sources. Delays in the procurement process and in the
      rehabilitation of rolling stock were minimized by starting the pre-qualification of
      works in the critical path of project implementation at pre-appraisal, by the use of
      standard bidding documents, and by requiring the borrower to produce the major
      tender documents by negotiations.          Nevertheless, delays persisted during


                                               11
       implementation, but mostly due to factors outside the control of the project (as
       described in Section 3).
   b. Timely availability of counterpart funds: A major effort was made to mitigate this risk
      at entry by requiring the State to give assurances of adequate budgetary provisions.
      Counterpart funds were included in the State's budget for 1997, 1998, and in future
      projections. However, this mitigation measure turned out to be ineffective after 1999
      as the project began suffering from counterpart shortfalls due to external factors.
   c. Delays in the actual award or failure to concession out Flumitrens: The risk of an
      unsuccessful concession was lessened by signing the Bank's loan agreement after the
      concession agreement for Flumitrens was signed in 1999. A concession study was
      completed and the concession bidding documents were prepared before the project
      went to the Board. Several procurement alternatives were evaluated settling for one
      that promoted efficiency, reduced implementation time and mitigated risks.
   d. Physical and tariff integration: Project preparation appropriately recognized the
      importance of expanding integration to increase efficiency and sustainability of urban
      transport in the region. As such, the project included targeted investments to improve
      physical integration between the suburban rail, metro and bus networks, and technical
      assistance to support analysis and policy dialogue on the tariff structure and systems.
   e. Establishment and sustainability of regional coordination: At the suggestion of the
      Bank, the State of Rio de Janeiro signed an implementation agreement together with
      20 municipalities to create a regional transportation coordination commission known
      as AMTU-RJ, and initiated studies to define its role. The existence of AMTU-RJ was
      also a mitigating measure to ensure the planned expansion of physical and tariff
      integration.

2.2 Implementation

The Board approved the original loan for the Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit Project for US$186
million on March 5, 1998 and an additional financing for US$44 million on December 28,
2007. The original loan was signed on June 1, 1999 and became effective on August 3, 1999.
The extended period between approval and effectiveness was due to a change in the State
government and issues related to the debt of the SRJ with the Government of Brazil. By the
time the project became effective, some of the trains that were supposed to be rehabilitated
were cannibalized for spare parts, which made rehabilitation a less viable option. Therefore,
after a mid-term review in 2001, the Bank agreed to restructure the project to finance the
purchase of 20 new trains in lieu of rehabilitating some 55 existing trains. Also, the planned
Systems subcomponent (primarily transmission lines) was greatly reduced in part because of
delays in the rolling stock program and because of design changes that still allowed the
project objectives to be reached. Annex 1 and 2 provide a summary of the changes since
appraisal by cost category.

A Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA) undertaken by QAG (dated July 28, 2004)
resulted in a rating of "Satisfactory" for the Bank's supervision of the project. The project
was originally scheduled to close on June 30, 2002, but the final closing date was extended


                                             12
five times until June 30, 2009. Overall, the implementation of the project can be described as
moderately satisfactory as most of the factors that influenced the project were outside the
direct control of the Borrower and implementing agency, including:
·   Changes in macroeconomic condition: Starting around the year 2000, the project
    suffered from a perennial lack of counterpart funding, which caused considerable delays
    in project implementation. This problem had its origin in the rapid degradation of State
    finances from early 2002 to end of 2003 due to the impact of the financial crisis in
    Argentina and the devaluation of the Brazilian Real (increasing the US Dollar
    denominated debt of the State). The strict budgetary target set for the Government of
    Brazil in their agreement with the IMF was also an indirect contributor to fiscal
    restrictions of the State. Two cancellations of part of the loan were made due to the
    worsening fiscal situation of the Borrower and changed priorities for the components.
    However, the total cancelled loan amount (US$27.7 million) was reinstated on November
    7, 2006 at the request of the Borrower because the State had improved its fiscal situation
    and the Brazilian Real had recovered.
·   Availability of counterpart funds: The project experienced major delays and
    considerable changes to its original rolling stock rehabilitation program due to delays in
    counterpart funding by the State and Federal Governments (investments supported with
    Bank loans 3633-BR and 4291-BR). As a result, SuperVia rehabilitated only about half
    the number of trains that were expected at appraisal. After 2004, the State's fiscal
    condition improved. Particularly since 2007, the project has received the appropriate
    support and counterpart funding from the State to complete most of the project
    implementation including the rehabilitation of 50 suburban trains (including 18 with air
    conditioning), acquisition of 20 new suburban trains with many modern features such as
    regenerative braking, and various station upgrades and system modernization investments.
·   Currency fluctuations: The continuous devaluation of the US Dollar vis-à-vis the
    Brazilian Real (the currency in which work contracts were signed) that started in early
    2004 put a major strain on the implementation process along with the simultaneous
    devaluation of the US Dollar against the South Korean Won (KRW). The Korean Won
    was the currency in which the contract for the acquisition of 20 new trains was signed
    (around 55% of the original loan). The overall financial gap due to the devaluation of the
    USD was estimated at US$64 million. An additional financing for US$44 million was
    approved by the Board on December 28, 2007 to help finance the costs associated with the
    devaluation and shortages in counterpart funds. As a requirement for the additional
    financing, the State assured the Bank that it was going to fulfill its commitment to provide
    US$20 million in counterpart funds. By the end of the project, the Bank had financed
    approximately 60% of the total project cost instead of the original 53%.
·   Growth in tariffs and explosion of informal transport: The concession contract allows
    the regulating agency (AGETRANSP) to adjust the suburban rail tariff, in addition to the
    yearly inflation adjustments based on the Brazilian index of market prices (IGP-M). The
    financial-economic equilibrium clause of the concession agreement permitted
    extraordinary tariff adjustments ensuring the concessionaire a financial rate of return of
    12% on its own investments. Under this arrangement, the base suburban rail tariff
    increased four-fold during the first ten years of the concession, from R$0.6 in 1998 to



                                              13
    R$2.5 in 2009. Municipal bus tariffs, which compete with SuperVia, also increased by
    around the same rate in this time period and are traditionally about 10% more expensive
    than rail tariffs. The tariffs on inter-municipal buses that compete with SuperVia in
    general are much higher than SuperVia. Meanwhile, informal public transport services
    proliferated, offering door-to-door service for a lower price than the combined (un-
    integrated) tickets of the formal public transport providers.

Other factors that were partially or entirely within the control of the Borrower or
implementing agency that also affected implementation included:
·   Delays in loan effectiveness: The Federal and State Governments were responsible for
    the initial delay in signing of loan agreements that lasted more than one year. As a result,
    the first extension of the loan for two years was done in conjunction with the project
    restructuring in December 2001.
·   Delays in the delivery of trains: The procurement process for the rehabilitation and
    acquisition of new trains was lengthy due primarily to delays by the implementing agency
    to comply with the Bank's procurement recommendations. Problems during the pre-
    qualification process for the new trains delayed the delivery of the trains by two years. A
    prolonged procurement dispute over the pre-qualification of one of the bidders delayed the
    awarding of the contract and the closing date was extended for a second time by two
    years. In addition, some companies contracted for the rehabilitation of the existing trains
    did not deliver on time. The train delivery contracts included penalty clauses for delays
    but these were not triggered because the State was late in making progress payments. The
    consequence was a lack of rolling stock for SuperVia, constraining operating capacity and
    lowering demand in the long-run.
·   Lack of integration: The poor level of services offered by the bus system and Flumitrens
    before the project's implementation, the lack of an integrated public transport system, and
    lax enforcement of regulations allowed for the massive proliferation of vans and other
    informal services that compete with bus and rail modes, beginning in about the year 2000.
    Despite the best efforts by the Bank in providing policy support and dialogue with all
    stakeholders, the State and local Governments were not able to fully comply with their
    commitments to integrate the bus networks with the suburban rail system. The project did
    achieve the level of physical integration with Metro and inter-municipal buses (modes
    overseen by the State), but the physical and tariff integration with municipal bus services
    was less than expected. In response, SuperVia began operating limited feeder bus services
    to its principal stations.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design: While a results framework was not required when the project was
presented to the Board, the project was monitored through a series of indicators adopted by
the Borrower to reflect the achievements of the PDOs (see Section F of Datasheet). Two
indicators (percentage of integrated stations and mode share of suburban rail) adequately
address the first part of the PDO, which is related to the integration and quality of services in
the region. The five other indicators (average headway in the peak hour, number of paying


                                               14
passengers, availability of rolling stock, staff costs, and operating subsidy) adequately
addressed the financial and operating performance of suburban rail in the second part of the
PDO. The outcome indicators were easily measurable either directly or through standard
transport or operational models that incorporate regular observations. In addition, as
described in the PAD, the project also had subsidiary objectives of improving the mobility of
the low-income population (who are the main user of Flumitrens and public transport), and
the reduction of the environmental impacts (mainly air quality and noise) on the RJMR due to
road-based vehicle use. However, no specific indicators were established for these subsidiary
objectives of the project. Nevertheless, the concessionaire (SuperVia) provided, at the Bank's
request, supplemental information on the environmental aspects of its operations and the
profile of its users in the last few years of the project. Regarding the M&E of outputs, since
specific indicators were not defined during project preparation, monitoring of these aspects
relied on very detailed monthly and semi-annual reports of physical, financial, and
institutional progress by subcomponent. Annex 2 provides a summary of these output
indicators by subcomponent and Section F of the Datasheet aggregates them into the two
components of the project.

2.3.2 M&E Implementation and Utilization: The Project team appropriately used the
physical and financial output indicators to supervise the progress of the works and the
delivery of equipment. To measure the progress in institutional development and compliance
with related covenants, the semi-annual monitoring reports included useful updates on
integrated modal tariffs (Bilhete Único), creation and maintenance of the AMTU-RJ,
responsibilities of the regulatory agency ASEP-RJ (later known as AGETRANSP), and the
concessionaire's environmental management programs. The ISRs were timely and usually
included a comprehensive Aide Memoire as an attachment, The ISRs reported on two output
indicators: "concession of the system to the private sector" and "concession sustainable and
modal integration with buses and metro in progress" but these may have been to general and
qualitative to inform management decisions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Procurement

The procurement component was well designed and supervised. The implementing agency
had good capacity, as assessed during preparation, and became more knowledgeable with
Bank procurement procedures. There were no post reviews as the borrower insisted on prior
reviews, even for small contracts. The QAG Assessment in 2004 concluded that the quality
and timeliness of procurement actions were satisfactory.

2.4.2 Financial Management

Financial Management (FM) of the project was in compliance with Bank procedures. Audited
copies of the accounting records had to be submitted semi-annually until loan closure.
Central has submitted all reports detailing expenses as required, but often one to three months
late. In April 2001, an issue was raised regarding to the incorrect use of the Special Account
(SA) according to Section 4.01 of the Legal Agreement since the beginning of the project.



                                              15
The client's non-compliance issue was resolved in early 2003 and noted in the semi-annual
monitoring report. There were no other significant FM system weaknesses. No other major
issues were found in the auditor's reports and the FM ratings remained moderately
satisfactory and satisfactory throughout project implementation.

2.4.3 Environmental and Social Aspects

The project was rated Category B and triggered the Environmental Assessment policy of the
Bank. The concession of Flumitrens was preceded by an environmental and safety audit
carried out by independent consultants, following the terms of reference provided by the
Bank. Consultants monitored compliance with the recommendations of the audit for the Bank
and, in parallel, the State environmental agency verified the performance of the supervision
consultants. Significant positive environmental and social impacts were expected from
reductions in traffic congestion and bus services (given their more pronounced relative impact
on the air quality, noise levels, traffic congestion, and road accidents) but verification of these
savings were not quantified. The review of "the Borrower's environmental program related to
urban traffic issues, consisting of an inspection and maintenance strategy for vehicle
emissions and noise", as called for by the original project subcomponent A.4, became a
regular reporting of environmental management programs by the concessionaire. Population
resettlement was not necessary given that works were in existing right-of-ways, and these
were never invaded. Independent consultants physically inspected the right-of-ways and
confirmed that no resettlement was needed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The vast majority of the components financed by the Project were successfully completed. As
detailed in Annex 2, seven contracts of the original loan were not concluded at the closing of
the project but are very likely to be completed by the end of 2010 using local funds because
they are underway and the Borrower is fully committed. A new Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit
Project 2 (US$211.7 million, Loan 7719-BR) to finance the purchase of 30 additional new
suburban trains was approved by the Bank on June 2, 2009 and became effective on
December 3, 2009. In addition, and as part of plans to host event for the 2014 World Cup and
2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the State is interested in acquiring at least 60 additional new
suburban trains. RJM is also interested in renovating and rationalizing the municipal bus fleet
owned by private operators under a reform and renewal of concessions in the coming years.

The legislative assembly for the SRJ on December 22, 2009 formally approved to implement
an integrated modal tariff (Bilhete Único) in 2010 for inter-municipal transport over which the
State has jurisdiction (including buses, ferries, Metrorio and SuperVia). Once implemented
successfully, it should greatly benefit poor passengers who currently make the longest trips
from the periphery of RJMR on multiple modes. The Project financed the studies that
provided the basis for this very promising political decision. The MRJ is currently studying a
similar proposal. Moreover, there are at least two electronic smartcard systems in operation
in the RJMR and there are ongoing discussions to create a single, interoperable fare card
system. This development would help expand tariff integration and ensure the long-term
sustainability of the development objectives. The recently-approved Rio Mass Transit 2



                                                16
Project follows on these efforts with technical assistance to support the implementation of
integrated modal tariffs and specific targets for bus-rail tariff integration in all five of
SuperVia's lines.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDOs remained relevant throughout the life of the two loans and did not require any
changes in response to changing government priorities or external conditions. The objectives
also stayed relevant in light of Bank's priorities regarding Brazil. For example, the objective
of improving quality of urban transport by developing an integrated mass transport system
was in line with the 2004-2007 CAS (Report no. 36116) priority of "Investing in growth,
including enhanced emphasis on improving competitiveness and investing in infrastructure."
A high-quality integrated transit system is an investment in infrastructure that promotes urban
competitiveness and efficiency by requiring fewer resources to move passengers, hence also
promoting growth. The PDOs are also in line with the current 2008-2011 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS, Report no. 42677) which identifies as Brazil's country goals: (i) to improve
competitiveness by investing in the transport system, and (ii) to reduce inequality by
providing, among others, job opportunities for the poor. The improvements to the integrated
system benefit mainly the poor residing in the periphery of RJMR.

The project amendments were requested by the Borrower primarily to facilitate
implementation under unfavorable fiscal conditions and mostly involved minor changes to the
project components, loan categories, disbursement percentages and extensions of the closing
date to complete implementation. These changes reflected close supervision and an
appropriate level of flexibility by the Bank. The 2004 QSA report affirms that the original
implementation period of four years turned out to be too short given the change in
administration, complexity of the project, counterpart funding issues, and other delay risks
that had been identified during project preparation. The Bank could have adopted a somewhat
more realistic implementation period at entry, but it was not possible to mitigate all the factors
that contributed to the implementation delays (described in Section 2.2).

Therefore, a combination of factors including a lack of rolling stock, a lack of intermodal
integration (particularly with buses), and growing competition from informal modes resulted
in less than half the ridership growth that was expected for SuperVia. For lower-income
people, the increase in tariffs for rail and buses may have been a contributing factor to the
lower than expected growth in ridership despite a decrease in the generalized cost of travel
(including travel times, wait times, reliability, etc.). The lower than expected demand
combined with delays by the State in compensating operators for discounted fares (i.e., for
schoolchildren, elderly) may have also contributed to SuperVia's critical financial position
during the first eight years of the concession and hindered its ability to make additional capital
investments in the system as planned. The original concession agreement envisioned some
US$240 million in capital investment from the private sector. Despite a strong start in capital
investments, only about one-third of this planned total has been realized to date. SuperVia's



                                               17
balance sheet showed negative equity from 2002 to 2006, but has turned positive since 2007
due in large part to the efficiency of its operations, described further below.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the first PDO, "to improve the quality of urban transport services in the
RJMR by enhancing the development of a fully integrated urban transport system," is
considered Moderately Satisfactory based on the following evidence:
1. The project supported the creation of the AMTU-RJ in 1997, which coordinates the
   planning and implementation of the multi-jurisdictional transportation systems in the
   RJMR. It continues to be in operation, but its efficacy would be greater if it were to be
   provided with more authority for regional priority-setting.
2. The project supported the creation of the Urban Transportation Master Plan (PDTU) for
   the RJMR, including a detailed origin-destination study completed in 2005. The PDTU,
   the first in Rio in 28 years, was an important result of the project because it mapped out
   and prioritized the medium and long-term options for the RJMR in the context of land use,
   urban transport and air quality considerations. All operators in the region use the PDTU
   for transport planning and the new Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit Project 2 is expected to
   finance an update of it.
3. The key outcome indicator "Percentage of stations with integrated bus/rail and metro/rail
   lines" was fully achieved at the closing of the AF. The target for number of stations in
   Central's system physically integrated with bus and metro services (20%) was reached in
   2008. SuperVia services were physically integrated with Metro services in 4 stations and
   with bus services in 18 stations. This is a significant achievement considering that there
   was essentially no such integration before the Project.
4. Another important aspect of integration supported by the Project was the intermodal tariff
   integration with a discounted fare. Tariff integration between SuperVia and bus services
   reached 120 municipal bus lines and 20 inter-municipal bus lines in 2008. The State and
   Municipal Governments are continuing to work hard to further integrate the transport
   system.
5. The key outcome indicator "Share of total urban transport trips" was partially achieved.
   The mode share of Central's system among all trips in the RJMR increased slightly during
   project implementation and remains around 5% today. This indicator has fallen short of
   the 10% target for a number of reasons described above, including the lack of rolling
   stock, higher than anticipated fares due in part to a lack of integrated modal tariffs, and
   competition from buses and informal public transport services.
The achievement of the second PDO, "to substantially improve the level of service provided
by Central/Flumitrens while reducing the operating subsidies it receives from the State
through the substantial participation of the private sector in its operations and management,"
is considered Moderately Satisfactory based on the following evidence:
1. The level of service provided on Central's system has improved substantially as measured
   by operating performance and user surveys. The key indicator of this, "Average interval
   between trains at peak hour (headway)," was substantially achieved, although several



                                             18
   years after the original target date because of a lack of rolling stock. Average headways
   in the peak hour in 1997 were around 13 minutes while the target was 6 minute by project
   completion. Through good management and maintenance practices, SuperVia achieved an
   average peak-hour headway of 7 minutes in 2008 which was maintained in 2009.
2. The quality of services has also greatly improved with higher punctuality (92%) and
   reliability (99%) for rail operations. User satisfaction surveys have shown significant
   improvements in the perception of various aspects of SuperVia's service quality and 91%
   of those interviewed said services had improved after the concession.
3. There were major improvements at stations as a result of the project, including improved
   accessibility features (bridges, crossings, and escalators), illumination, security, bicycle
   parking, and government service offices. These station improvements in poor areas on the
   periphery also had a large positive impact on their surrounding neighborhoods, for
   example the "Citizenship Station" in Duque de Caxias.
4. The key outcome indicator "Availability of rolling stock (trains in operation/total train
   fleet)" was fully achieved. At the start of the project, this indicator was around 58% and
   was improved greatly in only a few years. The original target was achieved in 2002 and
   has remained steady at around 90%, which is a good benchmark for the industry.
5. The key outcome indicator for "Total number of paying passengers carried per day (linked
   trips)" was partially achieved. Although SuperVia's daily ridership has more than tripled
   during project implementation (from around 150,000 in 2008 to 465,000 in 2009) and
   continues to increase, it has achieved less than 40% of the original target at project
   completion (1.288 million) for the many reasons previously described. In 2005, Central
   revised the target to 800,000 but it has still not been achieved in part because of a lack of
   rolling stock. Currently, as system capacity and the level of service continue to increase,
   ridership is expected to reach 1 million passengers per day around 2015.
6. The key outcome indicator for "Operating subsidy" was fully achieved. The subsidy
   provided by the State achieved its target in 2001 and has remained steady until the last
   year recorded (2006). The remaining State subsidy corresponds directly with the staff
   costs associated with the state-owned Central. If only the concessionaire is considered,
   the operating subsidy is essentially zero.
7. The project successfully supported and sustained the concession of the Flumitrens system
   to the private sector in 1998, and today it is operated by SuperVia without operating
   subsidies from government. This has saved the State as much as US$l80 million per year,
   which the State has then been able to reinvest in capital improvements to the transport
   system. The Bank loans allowed the State to fulfill its short-term capital investment
   obligations included in the concession contract, albeit with significant delays.
8. The project supported the creation of ASEP-RJ in 1997 as the Borrower's regulatory
   agency for public services under concession. ASEP-RJ was then re-organized into
   AGETRANSP as a means to have a specific agency able to focus on regulation of the
   transport sector. The creation of AGETRANSP was a necessary step for ensuring the
   quality of privately-operated services in the transport sector, but it requires continuous
   support and strengthening.




                                              19
9. The key outcome indicator for "Staff costs" was fully achieved. The direct labor costs
   borne by the State under the Central System (not including the concessionaire) has
   declined substantially, achieving its target in 2001 and remaining steady until the last year
   recorded (2006). A large part of the reductions in SuperVia's operational costs (reduced
   by around 50% from 1999 to 2008 in constant prices) was realized through significant
   staff cuts (2,500 staff were laid off and the respective severance payments were taken over
   by the State at the beginning of the concession). SuperVia's productivity ratio (operating
   costs per car-km) improved significantly from 4 to 1.4 in constant prices and from 4.4 to
   3.4 in nominal prices in the same time period.

Therefore, the overall achievement of PDOs is considered Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

A conventional cost-benefit analysis was carried out using the latest cost estimates to assess
the effectiveness of the project through its closing. The situation with the project was
compared against the situation without the project. The model used was the same one used
during appraisal to ensure comparability of results. The revised Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) calculated for this report is 14%. This is significantly lower than the one
calculated at appraisal (64%) but still confirms the positive economic efficiency of the
project. The following conservative assumptions were made in this analysis with respect to
the situation at appraisal:

   1. All benefits were reduced by 66% to reflect the fact that the actual demand is about
      one-third the demand projected at appraisal
   2. Included a two year delay in the start of benefits
   3. Updated investment cost stream to reflect the changes to the components and timing
   4. Maintained the reduction in wages and the incremental increase in operating and
      maintenance cost which were consistent with appraisal

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating of Moderately Satisfactory is based on: (i) the relevance of the project objectives
and design; (ii) the substantial achievement of the two development objectives; and (iii) a
reasonable but lower economic efficiency of the project-financed investments.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project had a subsidiary objective of improving the mobility of the low-income
population (who are the main users of SuperVia and the public transport system), but
indicators were not required at the time of project preparation and a thorough analysis was not
possible because of the lack of comparable data. Nevertheless, SuperVia reported that its
ridership increased in all income classes (including the poor) from 1999 to 2004.
Specifically, it recorded a 36% increase in the number of passengers per day earning less than


                                              20
5 minimum salaries (generally considered poor). Therefore, the quality and availability of rail
services to the poor has improved. Accessibility for mobility-impaired passengers has also
improved considerably as the project helped finance escalators, elevators, and special signage
in a number of SuperVia stations. In addition, SuperVia periodically reported the percentage
of passengers by socio-economic class; however, these data may not be directly comparable
between years because they do not measure inflation-adjusted incomes.2 In 2007, 74% of
passengers were from the lowest socio-economic classes (C, D and E), while this figure was
76% in 2004 and 89% in 1999. It is apparent that SuperVia's ridership has slowly migrated
upwards in socio-economic classes as economic conditions and opportunities in RJMR have
improved in recent years.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Bank's support in the creation of AMTU-RJ, PDTU, and AGETRANSP through this and
previous operations has had a lasting institutional impact in the region. Specifically, the
Project allowed significant progress to occur in accordance with the Bank's overarching 4-
pillar strategy for urban transport:

    1. A regional transportation coordination commission to help set priorities for major
       urban transportation investments between levels of governments and jurisdictions, and
       promote integration: AMTU-RJ was envisioned for this and continues to be
       strengthened.
    2. A plan for integrated land use, urban transportation, and air quality that provides a
       framework for decision makers to evaluate future urban transportation investments
       and policies: PDTU was envisioned for this and continues to be used and updated.
    3. Financing mechanisms to ensure that long-run variable costs are covered by operating
       and non-operating revenues and with appropriate user charges: This has been
       explored by authorities in Rio de Janeiro and work remains to be done to fully capture
       the value of the massive infrastructure investments planned.
    4. Private sector participation in the operation, maintenance, and construction of urban
       transportation systems to lessen the financial burden on government: This was
       accomplished for rail with the SuperVia and Metrorio concessions and the creation of
       AGETRANSP.

                                                   21
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome of this operation is moderate for the following reasons:

·   There is a moderate risk of SuperVia's tariff structure growing above inflation and
    adversely impacting demand growth. The regulatory agency authorizes additional
    extraordinary tariff adjustments based on the financial-economic equilibrium clause of the
    concession contract. Thus, shortfalls in the projected ridership can be compensated by
    tariff increases if justified. However, a tariff elasticity analysis by Fundação Getúlio
    Vargas (FGV) and commissioned by SuperVia for a proposed tariff adjustment in 2008
    showed that an increase in real terms of the current base tariff may result in a decline of
    operating revenues because of lower demand. Very low income riders may not afford
    tariff increases and may be forced to use cheaper, lower-quality alternatives such as
    informal vans. The State is currently negotiating a 25-year extension of SuperVia's
    concession (from 2023 to 2048) and is considering this risk. Some ways to possibly
    mitigate this are by: (i) greatly expanding intermodal tariff integration to lower general
    travel costs, (ii) direct subsidies to the lowest income riders who do not benefit from the
    current employer-based subsidy program (i.e., vale transporte) because they lack formal
    employment, and (iii) enforcement of regulations against informal modes that operate
    unfairly and sometimes unsafely.
·   There is a moderate risk of SuperVia deferring maintenance of the fleet and facilities,
    thereby affecting the long-term sustainability of the rail system. SuperVia significantly
    improved the overall efficiency and productivity of the system, as well as the quality of
    services. However, it was able to do this by aggressively cutting costs. According to a
    report commissioned by SuperVia for a proposed tariff adjustment in 2008 and conducted
    by FGV, maintenance expenditures experienced the largest reductions in real or nominal
    terms from 1999 to 2007. The data in the report shows that maintenance costs per car-km
    in 2007 were a fraction of what they were in 1999. However, it is not possible to
    determine if any of this reduction was driven by deferred maintenance because the train
    fleet has become considerably newer in this time period (requiring less essential
    maintenance), and worker productivity has also significantly increased (as described
    earlier). The current high ratio of fleet availability (90%) also suggests that there is no
    maintenance issue with the rolling stock.
·   The current risk of macroeconomic or fiscal conditions adversely affecting planned
    investments is low. Significant investment in rolling stock, stations, and system upgrades
    are needed to increase operating capacity in anticipation of the 2014 World Cup and 2016
    Olympics. These investments in transport infrastructure are among the highest priorities
    for all levels of government and have the financial backing of the Federal government.
    Current projections by SuperVia are for 1 million riders per day by 2015 (roughly double
    the current ridership). The State has already expressed its intention to acquire more trains
    and make other improvements.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

At entry, the Task Team designed an urban transport operation that entailed sound and
innovative features that are still very much valid and appropriate today. These included: (i)
capacity building and support for the concession process of a large but degraded suburban rail
network to private sector operators without operating subsidy; (ii) targeted investments in
rolling stock and infrastructure to support improved services, integration, and streamlined
operations; and (iii) institutional development to promote metropolitan transport coordination
and integration.

In this context, the Bank and the Borrower prepared the project by (see also section 2.1): (i)
carrying out a solid background analysis; (ii) evaluating lessons learned from previous
operations and appropriate alternatives; (iii) holding detailed missions with specialized teams
of consultants; (iv) designing a technically well-conceived project; (v) evaluating a range of
risks and proposing appropriate mitigation measures; (vi) paying attention to institutional
aspects, such as the need to create a coordination body and regulatory agency; and (vii)
gathering support from all levels of government governments and asking them to show
commitment (for example, by including counterpart funds in budget projections).

There were minor shortcomings involving the overly optimistic projection of ridership growth
and the implementation period that were influenced by a combination of factors (as described
in Sections 2.2 and 3.1). Most of these factors were external to the project design or very
difficult to mitigate, such as future macro-economic conditions. The basic premises of the
demand analysis were discussed and agreed with the Government during preparation but a
change of administration plus the fiscal crisis affected those premises. The demand in the
suburban rail network is in part supply-driven (i.e. availability of trains or operating capacity)
and depends on integration with buses. The State failed to provide both of these in a timely
manner. The trains were all rehabilitated in the end but were delivered late and some new
trains took longer than expected.

Finally, the project development objectives were comprehensive and flexible enough to
remain valid throughout the life of the decade-long project that saw numerous amendments.
In sum, the rating of "Satisfactory" reflects the absence of significant shortcomings in
identification, preparation, and appraisal.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank supervision is rated "Satisfactory" on the following basis (please also see Section 2): (i)
frequent supervision missions (38 ISRs filed between April 1998 and April 2009, or more
than 3 per year, not including FM and Procurement supervision missions which took place at
least once every year); (ii) prompt and sound identification of implementation problems such



                                               23
as delays; (iii) high-quality advice and proposed solutions to the Borrower to address the
implementation problems, for example by agreeing to increase Bank financing percentages in
some categories to make up for lack in counterpart funds; (iv) the hiring of local consultants
to help supervise technical or procurement issues; and (vi) appropriate and prompt Bank
follow-up actions. Overall, the Task Team showed profound knowledge of the client's needs,
excellent engagement, and appropriately adapted the project to ensure maximum relevancy
and achievement of PDOs in light of changing macroeconomic conditions and local priorities.

A Quality of Supervision Assessment in 2004 resulted in an overall rating of "Satisfactory"
having encountered no significant issues and commending the Project Team for its
understanding of the client's needs. The QSA report, however, noted that "on the Borrower's
counterpart funding, it might have been useful to elevate this issue to a higher level of Bank
management and to involve the IMF (International Monetary Fund) in the discussions as this
issue also affects other projects in the portfolio." The QSA report also noted that although the
project reporting was satisfactory, the ISRs could have been more useful as a management
instrument if they highlighted the performance indicators and more realistic implementation
and risk ratings to reflect ongoing delays (only one of 38 IP ratings in the ISRs was less than
satisfactory). The Project Team made great efforts to promote intermodal tariff integration
through dialogue with stakeholders (including bus operators), policy advice, and reports on
the implications and status of integration in the region. Significant progress was made in
achieving the key performance indicators but the full implication for the subsidiary objective
of "reducing poverty by improving transport services to the poor" was not fully assessed.
Finally, the Task Team provided outstanding support to the client and was very responsive in
processing an AF in 2007.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank helped the Borrower in the adequate preparation of the project. The Bank also
actively addressed implementation problems thanks to a careful and proactive supervision.
This helped adapt the project to changing circumstances and resulted in the substantial
achievement of the PDOs.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During project preparation, the State of Rio de Janeiro performed well by supporting the
necessary studies, estimating the investment needs, recognizing institutional weaknesses
based on previous experiences with Bank operations, and initiating reforms such as the
creation of AMTU-RJ and AGETRANSP in 1997. However, during implementation and
beginning in 2000, there were significant delays related to the availability counterpart funds
due to fiscal restriction which significantly impacted the project implementation. This, in
turn, created delays in some contracts. Furthermore, the State could have been more effective
in promoting additional integration with buses. Since January 2007, the Government of SRJ
has improved its performance greatly by supporting the project with counterpart funds that



                                              24
have helped make up the funding gap. With the Bank's AF loan and the Borrower's
counterpart funds, virtually all contracts were completed at conclusion of the loan.
Significant institutional reforms were made and work is still ongoing (including under the
follow-on Rio Mass Transit 2 Project) to achieve the ultimate mandate for AMTU-RJ and
AGETRANSP of multi-modal integration and regulation of urban transport modes.
Considering the positive outcomes and moderate shortcomings, the performance of the State
is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The State Secretary of Transport and its implementing agency, Central, were able to
successfully plan and execute the vast majority of a large investment program of works,
goods, and services, although with significant delays mostly caused by factors beyond their
control. The program to rehabilitate trains in particular experienced numerous changes and
delays due to procurement issues and interdependencies between contracts. Central
adequately performed detailed implementation planning to ensure that civil works did not
interrupt regular rail services and caused minimal disturbance to traffic and station
surroundings. Central's Project Implementation Unit was adequately staffed, its management
was stable, and generally produced detailed and timely reports. Its institutional capacity and
knowledge of Bank requirements increased throughout the project implementation period,
particularly regarding financial management and procurement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory based on the performance of
the Government and implementing agency.


6. Lessons Learned
The following lessons emerge from the analysis of the project:

Designing a more comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation framework: While the
project monitored the quality of services and operating subsidy in accordance with the stated
PDOs, this M&E framework did not allow for an assessment of the general benefit to public
welfare or the impact on the poor. It is recommended that projects with similar objectives
also monitor ridership classified by income class (as is the case with the Rio Mass Transit 2
Project) and the affordability of services (including the tariffs of alternative modes).

Enhancing the risk assessment based on cumulative factors: Despite impressive
efficiency gains, quality improvements, and significant investments, the original ridership
projections for SuperVia have not materialized or were overly optimistic. Among the risks
that explain the overly optimistic ridership projection and that were realized to one degree or
another were: (i) the non-compliance of the Government regarding the expansion of tariff
integration, (ii) a lack of investment from counterpart funds in rolling stock to increase



                                              25
operating capacity to planned levels, (iii) the negative impact of increasing tariff levels on
demand, and (iv) competing lower-cost transportation by the informal sector. Therefore,
investment plans and demand forecasts should be carefully scrutinized by considering all
relevant, mutually non-exclusive risks together and their cumulative impact through a
sensitivity analysis.

Analyzing rolling stock investment decisions to include economic, technical and
institutional aspects: The periodic rehabilitation of existing trains can be a cost-effective
option if a system has spare operating capacity. However, it can be unexpectedly costly and
complicated if the implementing agency does not have very specialized technical and
management capacity. It often takes longer and costs more than planned because it is difficult
to assess all of the rehabilitation costs without disassembling the cars. Also, rehabilitation
does not allow for the easy installation of some modern features including signaling,
telecommunications, air conditioning and energy-efficiency improvements such as
regenerative braking. Special attention should be paid to the interdependency of parts and
sequencing of contracts, which often cause delays. Therefore, the decision to purchase new
trains or rehabilitate existing trains should be carefully analyzed from an economic, technical
and institutional sense.

Enhancing project implementation through financing flexibility: As shown in this and
previous operations, reducing counterpart funds for certain critical components (such as some
works and rolling stock) and ensuring that the Borrower (to the extent possible) gives
budgetary priority for the project in times of fiscal restriction can avoid costly delays.
However, these mitigating measures are not always possible or sufficient to eliminate the
risks from a lack of counterpart funds. In the case of Rio de Janeiro, the success of the long-
standing partnership between the Bank and the Borrower through multiple loans was
facilitated by the adjustment of financing percentages, loan categories, and extension of
closing dates. At the same time, strong financial commitment and agreement between state
and municipal governments is needed to forge fundamental institutional changes that have a
real impact on the sustainability of rail investments, such as integration with buses and
preventing unfair competition.

Importance for Bank to be engaged for the long-term: The Project was able to achieve its
successful outcome because the Bank was also committed to supporting the Borrower through
a difficult macro-economic situation and changes in administration. Because of its belief in
the importance of the Project, the Bank accepted all of the Borrower's requests for closing
date extensions as well as eventually agreeing to an AF. This approach has paid off and a very
trusting relationship exists with the State, as evidenced by the recent approval of a follow-up
project and new requests to continue to support improvements to their metropolitan public
transport system in the face of the World Cup and Olympics.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

A summary of the translated Borrower's report is included in Annex 7. The Borrower,
through Central, describes the project, its changes, and explains the factors that led to delays
in the completion of the project. These factors are similar to the ones explained in this report.
The Borrower's report assesses the Bank's role and rates it as "highly satisfactory." The
Borrower also comments on the low risk to sustainability of development outcomes, the
importance of pushing forward the integration agenda through the AMTU-RJ, and the
inclusion of buses and other regulated modes in a future integrated system. Finally, the
borrower evaluates its own role by highlighting some of the problems faced during
implementation and the actions taken. The Borrower states the project fully achieved its
objectives.

Notes: The latest estimate incorporates all of the changes in project components and scope,
which explains the variation from appraisal. The reduction in the rolling stock rehabilitation
program is explained by a large increase in new rolling stock acquisition, as described in the
text. The planned Systems subcomponent was greatly reduced in part because of delays in the
rolling stock program and design changes that still allowed the project objectives to be
achieved.

Annex 3. Economic Analysis

A conventional cost-benefit analysis was carried out using the latest cost estimates to assess
the effectiveness of the project at the time of this writing. The situation with the project was
compared against the situation without the project. The model used was the same one used
during appraisal to ensure comparability of results. The following were conservative
assumptions made in the evaluation model with respect to the situation at appraisal:

   5. All benefits were reduced by 66% to reflect the fact that the actual demand is about
      one-third the demand projected at appraisal
   6. Included a two year delay in the start of benefits
   7. Updated investment cost stream to reflect the changes to the components and timing
   8. Maintained the reduction in wages and the incremental increase in operating and
      maintenance cost which were consistent with appraisal

Benefits
The evaluation considered the same benefits as for the evaluation at appraisal. These are:

   1. Travel time savings: These are estimated by determining the passenger-hours saved,
      by type of trip (home to work, business or other) and multiplied by the value of time
      for each type of trip. The demand model estimates passenger hours with and without
      the project mode. Value of time was kept at the appraisal level to be conservative and
      because of lack of updated values.
   2. Operating cost savings: These are savings resulting from the lower costs of operating
      all modes with and without the project. The demand model estimates the passenger-
      kms with and without the project and these are multiplied by the respective estimated
      unit operating costs. The project decreases the number of bus-kms traveled on the
      urban bus network through the re-routing of the buses to the main stations. The bus-
      kms saved per year are estimated by the demand model. The costs of operating the
      metro are included. The result is the net savings.
   3. Reduction in road maintenance costs due to the reduction of bus-kms with the project
      (minor).
   4. Reduction of accidents: These are estimated by multiplying the average cost per
      accident per 1000 passenger-kms with and without the project. This reduction of
      accidents is normally a function of the number of bus-kms saved (minor).
   5. Reduction of air pollution costs due to reduction in bus-kms with project (minor).

The resultant EIRR is about 14%.

                                           Preface

This is the final report relating to the Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit Project undertaken with the
participation of Rio de Janeiro's Urban Transport Company (SETRANS), the Rio De Janeiro
State Transport Engineering and Logistics Company (CENTRAL), the State of Rio de Janeiro
Government and Brazil's Federal Government. The Project was supported with the total sum of
US$230 million of IBRD financing under the terms of a first Loan Agreement signed on June
1999, amended on May 2008.

Introduction
This project had its origins in the decision of the Government of Brazil to transfer the Rio de
Janeiro subdivision of the Brazilian Urban Train Company to the State Government, and the
willingness of the State of Rio de Janeiro to better integrate urban trains with the
State-owned subway and the bus transport system. The project is fully consistent with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy of supporting policies and investments that will encourage
economic growth and social development in a context of macroeconomic stability. This project
is also a follow-up to the efforts started with the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport
Decentralization Project (Loan 3633-BR), which decentralized the federally-owned CBTU to
the State of Rio de Janeiro to allow for more effective modal and tariff integration.

Project Objectives

Loan agreement No. 4494-BR between the State of Rio de Janeiro and the IBRD became
effective on March 5, 1998. The original Loan Agreement signed with the IBRD was in the
sum of US$186 million. The State of Rio De Janeiro provided counterpart funds totaling
US$186.5 million. This created a total project value of US$ 372.5 million. An additional loan
of US$ 44 million was signed on May 20, 2008 to help finance the costs associated with the
devaluation o f the US$ and Korean Won (currency of one o f the biggest contracts financed by
the loan) in relation to the Brazilian Real and shortages in counterpart funds, which caused a
financing gap. Counterpart funds by the State of Rio de Janeiro were US$ 20 million. The
additional loan brought the total project value to US$ 436.5 million. The main project
objectives were (a) to improve the quality of urban transport services in the RJMR by
enhancing the development of a fully integrated urban transport system; and (b) to substantially
improve the level of service provided by the operating agency, CENTRAL, previously
Flumitrens, while reducing the operating subsidies it receives from the State through the
substantial participation of the private sector in its operations and management.

Objective (a) would be reached through the rehabilitation/construction of transfer stations
between different transport modes (metro, buses, ferries); the introduction of multi-modal
tariffs and the establishment of a Regional Transport Commission in charge of the coordination
and recommendation of common policies regarding prices, financing and evaluation of projects
in the RJMR.

Objective (b) would be reached through an investment program for the
rehabilitation/modernization of assets and the full or partial concession of rail operations and
management to the private sector as a means to reduce subsidies from the State.

Project Description

Infrastructure and Equipment: Rehabilitating/ refurbishing of CENTRAL/Flumitrens' rolling
stock and infrastructure and rehabilitating or building transfer stations between the trains and
other modes (Metro, buses and ferries);

Institutional and Policy Development: Supporting the process of concessioning Flumitrens to
the private sector through technical assistance for the preparation and evaluation of bids;
operating the RTCC for the RJMR; preparing an Integrated Transport Policy, Land Use and Air
Quality Management strategy for The RJMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and
to introduce sound Cost-recovery, tariff, regulatory and subsidy policies; a comprehensive
Retraining program for CENTRAL/Flumitrens staff in view of the planned restructuring of the
company; preparing feasibility studies and bidding documents for the proposed Niteroi-
S.Goncalo extension and other priorities of the mass transit system and implementing an
Environmental and Traffic subcomponent including a study to review the ongoing vehicle
inspection/maintenance program; and a comprehensive review of traffic violations with
emphasis on a more reliable system to collect traffic violation fines and enforce them as a
Deterrent to traffic accidents.

Revised Components

Some components were dropped as reflected in Annex 2. A few others were introduced:
Modernization of São Francisco Xavier, Méier, Madureira and Duque De Caxias Stations;
refitting of Engenho de Dentro Station to service PAN Olimpic Stadium and construction of
Metropolitano da Alameda São Boaventura e Avenida Feliciano Sodré Corridor; improvements
in the Santa Teresa line; improvements in the Saracuruna-Guapimirim line; rehabilitation of 14
Santa Teresa line trams and acquisition of 20 EMUs.

Experience acquired in the implementation of the project and results achieved

The results obtained from the implementation of this Mass Transit Project in Rio de Janeiro
have been highly satisfactory. The objectives have been reached steadily and steadfastly and
the strategic importance of this project to the RJMR is without precedent due to the level of
integration it promotes, particularly in the busy downtown area, through roughly 264 km of
urban and suburban rail systems that benefit 450 thousand passengers a day. Some significant

results from this project are fully in line with objectives (a) and (b) previously described in this
document are:

Improvement in the quality of urban transport services in the RMRJ due to the
development of an integrated urban transport system (objective A):
This objective has been reached satisfactorily, with a full physical integration as well as tariff
integration between the suburban rail system and the subway system. Physical integration: the
current rail system, roughly 264km long, operated by SUPERVIA and the subway system,
which is now around 42km long, are now fully integrated inside Rio de Janeiro and carry
almost 900 thousand passengers per day. The passengers, mostly coming from low-income
areas are now able to travel through the five rail lines and the two subway lines. Tariff
integration was obtained in all 4 main stations involved in this project with the subway system,
which contributed to create a more effective and reliable system with significant time and cost
savings for users. The success of these measures and the results obtained by the integration can
be quantified by the roughly 190% growth in number of passengers computed by the
concessionaire SuperVia between 1999 and 2008.

Improvement in the quality of service and reduction of operational subsidies by
increasing the participation of the private sector in system operation and management
(Objective B):
 This objective has been satisfactorily obtained judging by the following results:
After an initial reduction of rolling stock availability between 1996 and 1998 (beginning of
private sector participation), there was a significant increase that reached close to 89% in 2004
and 91% in 2008. The main factor that led to this improvement was the rehabilitation of 50
trains (18 are air-conditioned) and the acquisition of 20 new trains. The
rehabilitation/modernization and acquisition of rolling stock was an important factor in the
privatization proposal. The privatization to SuperVia reduced operational subsidies from
US$96 million to US$25 million between 1996 and 2006, a total reduction of 74%.

Another indicator of quality of service and user satisfaction is the significant increase in the
number of passengers, which went from 156 thousand per weekday to 387 thousand per
weekday in 2006 (148% increase) and reached 450 thousand in 2008 (190% increase). It is
also worth noting that these results were obtained with a simultaneous 70.21% reduction in the
number of public workers involved in operations and management.

Institutional aspects:
The results, which totaled less than 4% of the project cost, were considered very satisfactory.
The Transport Master Plan was concluded in April 2005 and is currently undergoing some fine-
tuning. Consulting services were quite valuable and are still in progress. Due diligence and
valuation of assets under the CENTRAL/Flumitrens system was key due all the institutional
changes over the years prior to privatization. Consulting services rendered were very important
to come up with a current valuation of assets under concession. The concession was contracted
for 25 years (until 2023) and can be renewed for another 25-year period (2048).

Additionally, consultants are currently looking into the possibility of gradually introducing
Integrated Modal Tariffs (IMT), which would allow the user to buy a single ticket to use



                                                42
different modes of transport within a given period of time. It would cost less than the sum of
individual tickets, thereby creating inclusion by benefiting the lower income segments of the
population.

Implementation and results:
The World Bank Loan Agreement was signed on March 5, 1998 and became effective on
August 3, 1999. Implementation of the project was tentatively scheduled for a period of 5
years, with an estimated completion date of December 31, 2001.            Main factors causing
implementation delays were delays in the acquisition and delivery of 20 new trains; devaluation
of the US Dollar vis a vis the Brazilian Real and the South Korean Won, which was the
currency the twenty new trains were contracted in. For this reason the Government of the State
of Rio contracted an additional loan No. 7508, signed on the 5th of May, 2008, in the amount of
US$44 million.

Additionally, delays in the signing of the loan agreement by the Federal and State governments
led to major delays in the implementation of the project, being one of the major reasons for the
five and a half years delay in the project. Insufficient counterpart funds from 2000 to 2003 and
regulatory and overseeing agency issues also contributed to the delay.

World Bank Participation
The Bank held a key role throughout the whole process, in the diagnostic, design and
evaluation of the project. The Bank was particularly helpful in identifying and designing the
best project to fit the needs of, and significantly improve mobility in the Rio de Janeiro
Metropolitan Region. The level of oversight and supervision was intense, particularly in the
beginning of the implementation phase and also later on in the process when the works were at
a more advanced stage. The support given by the Bank extended to every stakeholder in the
project and every level during each decision making process. The frequent missions allowed
the Bank team to follow the developments closely on the field. The Bank team worked as a
partner and mediator along the way and gave their input, and proposed alternative solutions
where they saw fit. Consequently the Bank's performance and level involvement was
considered highly satisfactory.

Borrower Participation
The Borrower properly identified the city's transport needs and priorities and detailed the
necessary civil works, adequately evaluated the infrastructure previous to the project, systems,
estimated the investment needs and recognized the weakness in the institutional leadership and
lack of leadership in terms of coordination of the public transport system. The borrower also
came up with the equivalent of what is the current implementation project and helped the Bank
in its economic and financial analysis of the project.
SETRANS was in charge of general oversight and project coordination and CENTRAL was
responsible for project implementation. In sum, they both worked satisfactorily during the
design of the project, offering logistic support and all the necessary information for proper
project evaluation. Implementation was a big challenge for CENTRAL from a technical
standpoint. However, it was capable of implementing the necessary works with minimal impact
to normal train service and traffic in general.




                                              43
CENTRAL at times applied advanced engineering solutions which resulted in above average
results, such as in modernization works of stations and the great effort made to connect each
station with the adjacent areas, creating community centers, thereby positively affecting the
quality of life of passengers and the local community.

Due to disputes between the State and Federal Government, which were unrelated to the
project, implementation was delayed for 10 months after signing with the Bank. Though, once
the project implementation process started the State Government offered its full support and
collaboration. The private concession process was concluded in November 1998. The current
administration classified the project as a top priority and gave its full financial support.
