All reported\n            accidents could have been avoided if proper surveillance and\n            operation and Maintenance procedures were in place. Such\n            observations suggest that other failures cannot be rules out\n            if the situation of dam safety in Armenia is allowed to\n            remain out of control. Considering that no dam is reported\n            to have a functioning instrumentation system and that\n            country-wide around 460,000 people are at risk, the\n            situation should be regarded as an emergency. Accordingly,\n            the Dam Safety Project aims to protect the population and\n            the socio-economic infrastructure downstream of the dams\n            facing the highest risk of failure. This project has two\n            main components. The first component supports repair work on\n            primary irrigation dams including design and supervision,\n            field tests, civil works, hydraulic steel structures.\n            Rehabilitation consists of upstream protection works,\n            spillway structural repairs, leakage reduction, and\n            irrigation/bottom outlet repair. The second component\n            prepares, operates, and supervises dam safety plans for\n            operation and maintenance and an emergency preparedness\n            plan; finances dam safety site installations, which include\n            instruments and monitoring devices and early warning\n            systems; strengthens the capacity of the Dam Maintenance\n            Enterprise; and supports safety investigations into all\n            remaining dams in Armenia."}, "docdt": "1999-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
