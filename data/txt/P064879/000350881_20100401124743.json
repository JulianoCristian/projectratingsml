highly satisfactory outcome and moderate risk to development\n            outcome. Both the Bank and the borrower performances were\n            highly satisfactory. The main lessons learned were: (1)\n            Assessment of dam safety is complicated. For countries such\n            as Armenia, to identify a problem in a dam, assess its\n            potential impact, and propose measures to improve dam safety\n            are difficult. It needs a deep level of experience which\n            most often can be provided largely by international experts.\n            (2) Training is essential for the staff of the project\n            implementation unit and Water Supply Agency (WSA) on dam\n            safety aspects especially as this is a very specialized\n            field. (3) Establishing a separate dam agency for operation\n            and maintenance or a separate unit within the WSA is\n            recommendable because dam operation and maintenance is a\n            very specialized task which requires significant experience\n            and high professional skills. (4) Improving dam safety\n            promotes private investment downstream the rehabilitated\n            dams as result of potentially more reliable water supply and\n            more effective safety structures. (5) Improvement of dam\n            management and optimization of water utilization is still\n            needed in the country. This would involve computer based\n            operation and maintenance and may be construction of new\n            dams especially on the rivers which have the potential for\n            cascade dams."}, "docdt": "2010-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
