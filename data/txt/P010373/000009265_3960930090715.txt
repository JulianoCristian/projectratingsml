MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
SRI LANMA
FOR A SECOND TELECOMNUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Sri Lanka for SDR 39.7 million (US$57.0 million equivalent), on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, is submitted for approval.
Proceeds of the IDA Credit will be passed on by the Government of Sri Lanka
(GOSL) to Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), under terms and conditions which shall have
been approved by IDA, including, inter alia: interest at a rate of not less
than 10 p.a., 15 years maturity (including five years of grace), and foreign
exchange risk borne by SLT. The proposed credit would help to finance a
Second Telecommunications Project. The project would be cofinanced by ADB for
SDR 29.7 million (US$40.0 million equivalent), OECP US$45.0 million
equivalent, the Government of France US$4.4 million equivalent and UNDPIITU
US$1.0 million equivalent.
2.   Background.  With only 0.6 telephone lines in service per 100
population, Sri Lanka's telecommunications services are inadequate to meet the
economy's needs. Service quality is poor due to underinvestment, lack of
spares for maintenance and i1adequate planning. Demand for telecommunications
services is growing by about 8X p.a. and estimated to exceed the current
supply of about 110,000 lines in service by about 1002. About 462 of the
lines in service are for business use, 302 for residential and 242 for
Government.
3.    Supported by IDA under the First Telecommunications Project (Cr. 1020-
CE), the Government of Sri Lanka separated the postal and telecommunications
services in 1980 and created the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Department
(SLTD). GOSL decided in 1985 that it would be necessary to further
restructure the telecommunications sector to satisfy the demand for telephone
service, improve service quality and promote institutional efficiency and
flexibility of operations. During preparation of the proposed project, IDA
'roject preparation facilities (PPFs)  in 1986 and 1988 and a TA component
under the Third Industrial Development Project (IDP III, Cr. 1948-CE)
supported GOSL in planning the restructuring of the telecommunications sector.
In July 1989, GOSL decided to transfer SLTD's telecommunications operations to
a fully Government-owned corporation, Sri Lanka Telecom, which was legally
established on February 6, 1990 and expected to become fully operational in
June 1991. SLT will be given adequate operational autonomy in finance,
procurement and personnel matters. A regulatory authority within MWPT will
retain responsibility for radio frequency monitoring, type approval of
equipment, licensing, tariffs and other regulatory matters for the sector. A
draft Telecommunications Act was presented to Parliament in March 1991 and is
expected to replace the existing Telecommunications Ordinance after
1/ The first PPF (P-322-CE) for US$750,000 was absorbed under the
telecommunications component of IDP III and the second PPF (P-53$-CE)
for US$550,000 would be absorbed under the TA component of the
proposed project.



-2-
parliamentary review scheduled for May 1991. The proposed project will
provide technical assistance to help commercialize the operation of SLT and
finance part of its 1991-95 investment program.
4.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Despite about two years delay in
completion and cost overruns, the First Telecommunications Project - Cr. 1020-
CE - (PPAR, Report No. 7517) achieved its main objectives of expanding the
telephone network, improving sector organization and financial perfor.mance and
introducing modern technology. Building on the experience under this project,
the two PPFs and the IDP III telecommunications component, IDA is well suited
to assist GOSL in the restructuring of the telecommunications sector. The
proposed project would assist in the commercialization of SLTD by converting
it into a corporation (SLT) with adequate autonomy under the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunication's (NOPT's) regulatory oversight as well as improving and
expanding telecommunications facilities essential to the growth of industries,
tourism and services. SLTD's commercialization could provide a precedent for
the restructuring of other public services. IDA involvement would also
promote coordination with ADB, OECF, UNDPIITU and other co-financiers. The
proposed project would complement public sector management reforms initiated
under the Economic Restructuring Credit (Cr. 2128-CE) and the Public
Manufacturing Enterprise Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2185-CE).
5.    Project Obiectives.  The proposed project's main objectives are to
support sectoral reform through the establishment of a new commercially
oriented, autonomous operating entity ($LT) and to improve sector efficiency.
(MOPT's regulatory capabilities are being strengthened with the support of the
TA component under IDP III). The project will also help finance the SLT's
initial investment program to expand and improve telecommunications services
needed to support economic growth and coordinate sector development and co-
financing. Specific Project objectives are to: (a) strengthen SLT's
capabilities in the areas of corporate planning, network planning and
engineering, operation and maintenance, and financial management through
relevant technical assistance; (b) facilitate private sector participation,
e.g., as contractors to 8LT and in the subscriber equipment market; (c)
develop SLT's humsa resources through training programs; and (d) support SLT's
initial investment program to improve and expand access to service in urban as
well as rural areas, replace worn or obsolete equipment, improve service
quality, and reduce unmet demand.
6.    Proiect Description.  The project's investment component has been
designed to expand and improve telecommunications services quickly at least
cost within the constraints of SLT's financial and implementing capabilities.
As demand cannot be fully met under the project, priority has been given to
investment with highest economic justification, e.g. international facilities,
which are highly profitable, and exchange equipment in Colombo, to permit
connection of new high revenue producing subscribers and make efficient use of
existing cable network capacity at marginal cost. Outside Colombo, the areas
have been prioritized based on projected demand, revenue earning potential,
and the need to improve the balance between existing exchange and cable plant
capacities. The project would includes (a) international facilities, trunk
transmission, information systems and TA funded by ADBs; (b) 35,600 exchange
lines in Colombo, 17,000 exchange lines in the provinces (including outside
plants), rehabilitation of existing exchanges, telegraph equipment and TA for
financial management, corporate planning, network planning and engineering



-3-
funded by IDA; and (c) a national switching center (funded by France), outside
plant in Colombo (OECF) and local transmission links, subscriber apparatus and
buildings funded by bilateral credits, the subscribers or GOSL. The project
is expected to be fully implemented by December 1995. Estimated project costs
and a financing plan are given in Schedule A, procurement method and
disbursements in Schedule B, a timetable of key project processing events in
Schedule C and a statement of Bank loans and IDA credits in Schedule D; a map
(IBRD No. 22723) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9095-CE,
dated April 26, 1991, is being distributed separately.
7.    Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached with GOSL that it will:  (a) by
June 1993 review, together with IDA, the adequacy of the new institutional
arrangements being introduced for the telecommunications sector and implement
any additional institutional changes as agreed; (b) allow SLT to implement a
satisfactory staff remuneration system, including a cost-center based,
performance related profit sharing system; (c) make funds available to SLT (on
appropriate commercial terms) necessary for the timely completion of the
project; (d) maintain SLT's tariffs at levels that would enable SLT to produce
a rate of retarn of 152 ou revalued net fixed assets in operations (e)
establish a special Tender Board, under the supervision of the Cabinet, for
SLT's procurement and set SLT's approval limits at adequate levels for
efficient project implementation; (f) take necessary steps, including tariff
adjustments, to enable SLT during the project implementation period to
contribute not less than 252 of its capital expenditures from internally
generated funds; and (g) not appropriate SLT funds unless such funds are in
excess of SLT's requirements for operating costs, debt service and an adequate
portion of its capital investment program. Assurances were obtained from SLT
that it will: (a) maintain a staffing ratio satisfactory to IDA; (b)
undertake a study of a cost center based, performance related profit sharing
system for SLT staff and submit its recommendations to GOSL not later than by
December 31, 1991; and implement agreed recommendations by June 30, 1992; (c)
agree to performance indicators to be monitored under the project; (d) take
all necessary steps, including applying for tariff adjustments, to produce a
rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation of not less than 152;
(e) have its financial statements audited by independent external auditors,
acceptable to IDA and make its audited statements available to IDA not later
than four months after the end of its financial year; (f) take all necessary
steps, including applying for tariff adjustments, to contribute not less than
252 of its capital expenditures during the project implementation period from
internally generated funds; and (g) maintain its accounts receivable below the
equivalent of three months of billing as from June 30, 1992. The enactment of
a Telecommunications Act satisfactory to IDA, the signing of SLT's license, a
subsidiary loan agreement between GOSL and SLT acceptable to IDA for the
proposed IDA credit, the effectiveness of ADB and OECP credits and the opening
of a special project account in a bank satisfactory to IDA would be conditions
of credit effectiveness.
8.    Environmental Impact.  The project has been given a "C' environmental
assessment rating. Most new exchange equipment will be housed in existing
buildings; new buildings, mainly for stores, will be less than 12 of project
cost. In the greater Colombo area, most new cables will be laid in existing
ducts, which have spare capacity. The impact on the environment during



-4-
project implementation will, therefore, be minimal. However, SLT will
coordinate closely with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to ensure
that the project implementation conforms to CEA guidelines.
9.    Benefits.   Benefits would include meeting a large part of unsatisfied
demand, improvement of service quality and increased operating efficiency in
the sector. SLT is projected to produce substantial fiscal benefits for GOSL
through taxes, duties, dividends and commercial onlending terms for IDA, ADB
and other credits. The estimated economic rate of return for the project is
37Z.
10.   Risks.  The project could be delayed due to difficulties in making SLT
and the sector regulation operationally effective. To minimize this risk,
agreement on a technical assistance package and suitable conditionalities was
reached during negotiations and the enactment of the new Telecommunications
Act is a condition of Credit effectiveness. Project implementation may also
be delayed due to SLT's limited implementation capabilities, especially during
its initial operations; this risk will be minimized by extensive use of
turnkey contracts, subcontractors and, to the extent practicable, private
sector participation in the supply, installation and maintenance of subscriber
equipment.
11. Recozmmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
