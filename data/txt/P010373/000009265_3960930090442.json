Specific objectives are to : a)\n            strengthen SLT's capabilities in the areas of corporate\n            planning, financial management, network planning and\n            engineering; b) facilitate private sector participation; and\n            c) connect 50,000 new subscribers to meet 80% of demand in\n            project areas by 1995. Project components include the\n            expansion of switching capacity in Colombo and the\n            rehabilitation of some of the existing exchanges and local\n            networks in seven provincial regions, improvement of the\n            telegraph service, and technical assistance as follows : 1)\n            in Colombo expand switching capacity by about 35,000 lines;\n            2) in the provinces provide seven parent exchanges as well\n            as remote units and 17,000 lines; 3) improve the existing\n            telegraph service by installing a store-and-forward message\n            unit in SLT's premises in Colombo, which will serve up\n            to 120 video-display (VDU) terminals and will be connected\n            to the telex exchange by a 2Mb/s digital link."}, "docdt": "1991-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
