Some lessons learned from\n            the project are: By being continuously involved in a sector\n            the World Bank has the opportunity to support reform--even\n            if it is politically unpopular--step-by-step under various\n            governments. The Bank should exercise patience and\n            flexibility regarding project objectives and conditionality\n            to overcome opposition to changes, provided the government\n            is committed in the longer term to sector reform. Involve\n            labor unions at an early stage of reform and address their\n            concerns to reduce resistance to change. The successful\n            private operation of value-added and other marginal\n            telecommunications services creates new job opportunities\n            and may reduce staff fears of privatization as well as\n            provide comfort to potential investors who observe a track\n            record of commercial operations and the workings of the\n            legal and regulatory framework. Only full corporatization\n            with private management and suitable regulation provides the\n            autonomy needed to quickly expand service and to become more\n            consumer-oriented and competitive. The continuity of project\n            staff contributes to the Bank's effectiveness. Surplus\n            credit funds due to cost savings and elimination of project\n            components should be identified and canceled early."}, "docdt": "1998-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
