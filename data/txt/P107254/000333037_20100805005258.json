Government\n            of Eritrea (GoE) also considered participation in the\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) for which it\n            remained potentially eligible to receive debt relief.\n            However, client commitment to the necessary reforms was\n            uneven over the course of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN)\n            and as a consequence the Bank shifted focus to maximize\n            improved service delivery through the existing portfolio,\n            largely centered on human development, and select analytical\n            work. Domestic policies had not been conducive to growth.\n            While effective in addressing macroeconomic imbalances, they\n            acted as a constraint on economic growth resulting in a\n            decline in annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth per\n            capita since 2005. In recognition of this, the GoE had\n            started to adopt a strategy intended to revitalize the\n            economy by: (i) improving broad-based growth through rural\n            development; (ii) exploiting valuable mineral deposits;\n            (iii) developing tourism and commercial fishing; and (v)\n            encouraging investment in newly-established economic\n            tax-free zones. Despite the weak overall economic\n            performance, the government support for the social sectors\n            had remained strong and World Bank assistance had achieved\n            positive results in the health and early childhood and\n            education sectors."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
