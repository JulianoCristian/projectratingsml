objective of the Second\n            Integrated Early Childhood Development Project for Eritrea\n            is to improve the health, nutrition, and access to\n            pre-school education of Eritrean children aged 6 and under\n            in the project villages. There are three components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is maternal and\n            child health and nutrition. This component will strengthen\n            the community based health system in order to expand and\n            sustain the household and community Integrated Management of\n            Childhood Illnesses (HWC-IMCI), as well as growth monitoring\n            and promotion in villages already covered in Phase I. The\n            second component of the project is early childhood care and\n            education (ECCE). This component will aim at consolidating\n            quality provision of ECCE services already established in\n            Phase I, expanding cost effective ECCE services to cover all\n            children in the target villages, and ensuring sustainability\n            of interventions in target communities after the completion\n            of Phase II. The third component of the project is project\n            management, monitoring, evaluation, advocacy and strategic\n            communication. This component will provide overall\n            coordination and manage cross cutting issues of monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) and advocacy and strategic communications."}, "docdt": "2008-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
