Coal Exploration Project will be the\n            Bank's first lending operation in support of the\n            Government's efforts to reduce its dependence on\n            imported oil through the development of domestic energy\n            resources. The project's objectives will be: (a) to\n            provide geological data for two coal-bearing areas with\n            development potential, and thus contribute to the expansion\n            of domestic coal supply; (b) to contribute to the\n            acceleration of the development of coal supply through\n            detailed exploration in a known coal field; and (c) to\n            strengthen the technical capability of PNOC-CC in its coal\n            operations. The project will consist of regional coal\n            exploration in Samar and Eastern Mindanao, to locate and\n            evaluate coal occurrences that might be amenable to mining\n            by open pit methods; detailed coal exploration in the Lalat\n            area of South Western Mindanao, to assess the economic\n            viability of a prospective coal area, previously identified;\n            and the provision of technical assistance to PNOC-CC in coal\n            geology and mining engineering."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
