PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
COAL EXPLORATION PROJECT (LOAN 2181-PH)
PREFACE
Lo_-n 2181-PH to the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) for
the Coal Exploration Project, in the amount of US$17.0 million, was signed
on September 18, 1982 and became effective on May 9, 1983. Since the
initial exploration stages did not indicate the existence of major
coal-bearing areas amenable to open-pit mining, the Government requested in
January 1985, an amendment to the loan agreement modifying the project
scope and reducing the loan amount from US$17.0 million to US$10.0
million. The loan was closed on December 3i, 1986, with a total
disbursem at of US$6.56 million, and the undisbursed balance of US$3.44
million was cancelled.
The main objectives of the project were: (a) to provide
geological data for two coal-bearing areas (Samar and Eastern Mindanao)
with apparent development potential, and thus contribute to expansion of
domestic coal supply; (b) to contribute to the accelerated development of
coal supply through detailed exploration of a known coal field (Lalat area
of Southwestern Mindanao); and (c) to strengthen the technical capability
of the implementing agency, Philippine National Oil Company-Coal
Corporation (PNOC-CC).
PNOC-CC prepared a comprehensive Project Completion Report (PCR)
which forms the basis for this PCR prepared by the Bank.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower for its comments  The comments which were received have been
taken into account in preparing the final report and they are reproduced as
Annex 1.

PRO.JECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES; COAL EXPLORATION PROJECT
(Loan 2181-PH)
HIGHLIGHTS
Pursuant to the joint World Bank/ADB energy sector survey, the coal
exploration project was conceived as a technical assistance project to support
the Government of the Philippines in its effort to develop indigenous resources
in order to reduce its dependence on imported oil, and to lighten the burden on
the country's balance of payments. The project was appraised in January 1982
and approved by the Board in June 1982. The project's objectives were: (a) to
provide the Government with geological data for two coal-bearing areas with
development potential and thus contribute to the expansion of domestic coal
supply; (b) to contribute to the acceleration of the development of coal supply
through detailed exploration of a known coal field; and (c) to strengthen the
technJcal capability of PNOC-CC in its coal operations. The project consisted
of three components: (a) regional coal exploration in Samar and Eastern
Mindanao, (b) detailed coal exploration in the Lalat area of southwestern
Mindanao, and (c) technical assistance to PNOC-CC (paras. 1-6).
Despite continuing peace and order problems in some project areas
which led to modifications of the project scope, the technical objectives of the
project have been largely achieved. By project completion date a comprehensive
assessment of the coal resource potential of all Mindanao and Samar and a
detailed exploration program at Lalat had been completed. Moreover, a number of
geologists and m:ning engineers had been trained (paras. 7-10).
During project appraisal it had been anticipated that the exploration
program in Mindanao ard Samar would probably locate several mine prospects which
would warrant detailed drilling programs and sibsequent prefeasibility studies.
However, as the initial exploration progressed, it became apparent that the
prospects for the discovery of major coal deposits of economic and financial
viability were far less than originally expected, in part due to the unexpected
secular decline in world energy and coal prices. Therefore, in late 1984, it
became clear that all the loan funds would not be required and at the request of
the Government in January 1985, US$7.0 million of the loan amount was
cancelled. As a result of changes in the project scope, it became essential to
raise the limit for procurement of goods and services under LIB from US$1.2
million to US$4.5 million. At closing date of June 30, 1986, only US$6.6
million of the loan amount had been disbursed and the balance of US$3.4 million
was cancelled (paras. 11-13).
Overall, the project succeeded in (a) achieving an accurate and
comprehensive regional assessment of the coal resources of two major islands,
and (b) significantly improving the operating standards of PNOC-CC. An
important lesson to be learned from this project is the confirmation of the
wisdom of the staged approach towards expenditures on mineral exploration, which
in this case acquired the great bulk of relevant information on Philippine coal
resources with minimal expenditures and large savings of loan funds (paras.
14-15).



PROJECT COMPLETION REFORT
PHILIPPINES - COAL EXPLORATION PROJECT
(Loan 2181-PH)
I.   Introduction
1.        Due to the importance of the energy sector to the economy of the
Philippines, the Government has since the 1973/74 oil price increase,
attached high priority to the development of indigenous- resources in order
to reduce its dependency on imported oil. Nonetheless, in 1980, the
Philippines still depended on imported oil for 84% of its commercial energy
supplies. Such heavy dependence required the country, during that year, to
spend 40% cf its merchandise export earnings on oil. To curtail this high
dependence on imported oil and thereby lighten the burden on the country's
balance of payments, the Government aimed at (a) limiting the growth of
demand for oil-derived forms of energy, and (b) developing domestic energy
sources that could substitute for imported energy.
2.        CGal resources in the Philippines are abundant and have been
estimated at 1.2 billion tonnes. The coal is however generally of a poor
quality and often requires phvsical upgrading prior to use. However, coal
occurrences are scattered throughout the islands impeding the Government's
effort in coal exploration and development. Moreover, the lack of basic
geological information has been an inhibiting factor for the development of
the coal industry. In order to assist the Government in tackling this
obstacle, on September 1982, an IBRD loan in the amount of US$17.0
million'! equivalent for a coal exploration project was extended to the
Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) to finance consultants services,
training programs, and the procurement of equipment for a basic geological
survey in two regions where coal bearing areas with open-pit mining
potential had recently been discovered.
II. Project Background
A.   Project Origin, Appraisal and Loan Aporoval
3.        In order to promote coal production, the Government introduced,
through the Coal Development Act of 1976, a scheme of coal service
contracts in an attempt to induce the private sector to play a more active
role in the coal industry. Although the scheme was fairly successful,
there remained a significant gap between demand and domestic supply of
1/  In January 1985, based on the initial exploration stages, it became
apparent that economical major open pittable coal reserves did not
exist in two major islands, hence at the request of the Government, the
project scope was modified and the loan amount was reduced to US$10
million. In December 1986, the closing date, a further cancellation of
the undisbursed balance of US$3.4 million reduced actual disbursement
to US$6. 6 million.

coal. The Government recognized that in order to bridge the gap,it needed
to accelerate the pace of coal exploration and development. Subseqttently
as part of its continuing energy sector analysis, the Government of the
Philippines sought the assistance of the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) to conduct an energy sectcr survey of the
Philippines. A joint World Bank/ADB mission visited the country in
April-May 1980, to provide the Government with an independent review of the
country's energy prospects. With regard to the coal sub-sector the Energy
Sector Survey2! concluded that:  (a) the coal resources in the country
were not well defined, (b) the need to upgrade information on the
indigenous coal resource potential was urgent, (c) lack of understanding of
the complex geological background had been a deterrent to the development
of coal production, and (d) comprehensive geological maps for the coal
regions slhowing boreholes, shafts, test pits, etc., were lacking. It also
concurred with the Government's high priority objectives, namely updating
of the geological data, and concentrating on the geological evaluation of a
few regions with good potential.
4.        While the Government was reluctant for Philippines National Oil
Company-Coal Corporation (PNOC-CC) to become the major coal company in the
Philippines,it realized that the private sector would never undertake the
regional geological assessment required to evaluate the indigenous coal
potential. As the work necessary to carry out a nationwide mapping and
drilling exercise would require an extended time frame, a prioritized
program had to be developed. The Government considered the following two
items to be of high priority: (a) updating of the geological data for the
known coal-bearing areas; and (b) concentrating on the geological
evaluation of a few regions where coal-bearing areas with open-pit mining
potential were thought to exist. The Project was prepared by the Ministry
of Energy and PNOC and was appraised in January 1982. Negotiations were
held in Washington, D.C. in May 1982. A loan of US$17 million equivalent
was approved in June 1982, and it became effective on May 9, 1983.
B.   Proiect Obiectives and Description
5.        The project was designed to support the Government's efforts to
reduce its dependence on imported oil through the development of domestic
energy resources.   The Project's objectives were:  (a) to provide the
Government with geological data for two coal-bearing areas with development
potential, and thus contribute to the expansion of domestic coal supply
within the shortest possible time frame through development of promising
coal fields; (b) to contribute to the acceleration of the development of
coal supply through detailed exploration of a known coal field; anid (c) to
strengthen the technical capability of PNOC-CC in its coal operations.
6.        The project was thus designed to consist of three components:
(a) regional coal exploration in Samar and Eastern Mindanao (identified Zos
the most prospective areas not under lease to the private sector); (b)
detailed coal exploration in the Lalat area of Southwestern Mindanao; and
(c) technical assistance to PNOC-CC. The regional exploration in Samar and
Eastern Mindanao was primarily aimed at lacating coal deposits suitable for
2/ Philippines Energy Sector Survey, February 1982, Report No. 3199a-PH.



-3-
open-pit mining methods. The detailed exploration of Lalat was aimed at
establishing measured coal reserves and completing a conceptual feasibility
study for the mining of a previously identified prospective coal area. The
technical assistance to PNOC-CC was designed to strengthen the technical
capabilities of this entity in all aspects of coal exploration, mine
development and mine operation. A description of the three components
follows:
(i) The regional exploration component was to be carried out in three
sequential phases in order to ensure that the studies and
exploratory work were carried out only after previous results had
been evaluated and the desirability of proceeding further had
been established. The first phase consisted of gathering and
interpreting all available geological information, carrying out
both photogeological studies and geological fieldwork. The
second phase consisted of the drilling of initial test holes in
the areas selected in the first phase to verify the stratigraphy
and structure of the coal-bearing sediments as suggested by the
initial mapping program. In the third phase, those areas which
following the reconnaissance drilling had shown good potential,
were to be further evaluated and a more detailed exploration of
the selected areas in Eastern Mindanao and Samar was to follow in
order to allow preparation if prefeasibility studies. The
prefeasibility studies were to be undertaken as a part of this
phase to determine the conceptual mining scheme and order of
magnitude of costs for any coal production schemes from the
identified areas.
(ii) The detailed exploration component of the project was designed to
carry forward the exploration in the previously identified
prospective coal area of Lalat. This area had been under
exploration for some time and had reached a point where a
de;tailed drilling program was required to obtain necessary data
for an underground mine prefeasibility study. This project
component consisted of the completion of drilling and other
exploratory works and the subsequent prefeasibility study.
(iii) Technical Assistance Programs. In view of the large investments
that PXOC-CC was making in coal exploration and in mine planning,
and in order to ensure that these investments were based on sound
technical evaluation, it was desirable to develop a comprehensive
technical assistance program to strengthen the technical
capability of PNOC-CC staff.
III. Project Implementation
A.  Achievement of Project Objectives
7.        The loan was signed in September 1982, but it took 8 months to
fulfill the two conditions of effectiveness namely, appointment of
consultants and the execution of Exploration Agreements satisfactory to the
Bank between the Government and PNOC-CC. Despite severe peace and order
problems in Samar and in some project areas of Mindanao which led to



-4-
modifications of the project scope, the technical objectives of the project
have been largely achieved. Geological mapping and exploration drilling
have been completed in both Eastern and Western Mindanao and Samar.
Detailed exploration was undertaken in selected areas but no. uLjor
economically mineable coal deposits were identified. Neverthe'Less, the
program helped PNOC to start four small scale mines in Eastern Mindanao.
Prefeasibility reports were prepared for several mora deposits technically
suitable for open-pit and underground mining operations. A number of
geologists and drilling staff have been suitably trained, and are now
conducting the operations without outside assistance. The computerization
of all geological data is now complete. Operational assistance at an
operating mine has improved the skill of personnel in both mine management
and in the practical aspects of operating semi-mec,aanized longwall faces.
In addition personnel of PNOC-CC gained insight into the economic cost of
indigenous coal compared to alteinate energy sources both domestic and
imported.
8.        Coal Exploration in Mindanao & Samar.  The exploration carried
out in Mindanao and Samar was the major activity funded from the proceeds
of the loan. Work commenced on both islands in 1982 but the peace and
order situation in Samar caused the immediate suspension of activities on
that island until 1985. Security problems in Mindanao restricted access
and drilling in some regions but are not believed to have compromised the
overall project results. By the project completion date, a comprehensive
assessment of the coal resource potential of all Mindanao and Samar had
been completed. Several potentially mineable deposists were identified on
Mindanao but prefeasibility studies indicated them not to be economically
viable within the prevailing and projected coal price scenario.
9.        Detailed Coal Exploration in Lalat Areas of Southwestern
Mindanao. The detailed exploration program at Lslat was completed in 1984,
and the results of the prefeasibility study were jointly (Bank and the
Government) reviewed. However, the Bank concluded that, based on financial
and economic analyses, no further work financed o t of proceeds of the 3ank
loan in Lalat area was warranted.
10.       Technical Assistance Program.  The technical assistance program
was implemented by a consulting firm. The con3ultants were expected to
assist the exploration in building up the geology data base, in overcoming
difficult drilling problems and assist/train the mining engineers in mine
development, infrastructure, and logistics necessary for the coal
industry. In terms of a training program, a otal of 22 geologists, and 17
mining engineers of different disciplines participated in various training
courses of varying duration ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months. In
addition, training for computer application in coal exploration and mining
were prov!ded for 6 months duration.
B.   Project Management
11.       The project was implemented by PNOC-CC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PNOC with the assistance of a consulting firm. Some changes in scope
occurred during execution of the project. It was hoped that the
exploration program in Mindanao and Samar would probably locate several



-5-
mine prospects which would warrant detailed drilling programs and
subsequent prefeasibility studies. For this purpose, funds for the
procurement of twenty drills and associated support equipment--valued at
US$6.0 million (exclusive of physical and price contingencies) were
provided in the project budget. However, as the initial exploration
progressed, it became apparent that the prospects for the discovery of
major coal deposits of economic and financial viability were far less than
originally anticipated. Therefore, the ICB tender for this major equipment
item, which had been issued, was cancelled. Furthermore, contracts
amounting to US$3.5 million to be awarded by ICB for seismic services which
were provided for in the project budget were not requested as the
technology was unsuitable in the geological environment. In view of the
above, in late 1984, it became apparent that all the loan funds would not
be required and at the request of the Government in January 1985, US$7.0
million of loan amount was cancelled. Procurement of goods and services by
LIB exceeded the aggregated limit specified in the Loan Agreement and, at
the request of the Government, the limit for non-ICB purchases was raised
from US$1.2 million to US$4.5 million. Most of this procurement was
directed towards small items and consumables for the support of the
reconnaissance geology and drilling. Despite the peace and order problems
and project costs and procurement modifications, the original project
completion and the loan closing dates were maintained.
C.   Performance of Consultants
12.       The Technical Assistance component was implemented by
consultants. The Training Program provided to the exploration group was of
a high standard and has enabled 'INOC-CC's staff to continue exploration
activities in a professional mariner at international standards without
technical assistance. The assistance provided to mine management and
operations was not satisfactory due to lack of in-house expertise among the
consulting firm's staff and the recruitment of inappropriate personnel by
them. Nevertheless some limited improvements were introduced into the
mining operations of PNOC.
D.   Disbursement
13.       Disbursements were made against 100% of foreign expenditures of
contracts awarded for equipment, and consultants' services. Disbursement
proceeded relatively smoothly, though at a smaller scale than had
originally been planned. Out of an adjusted loan amount of US$10 million
(para. 11) at closing date of June 30, 1986, only US$6.6 million had been
disbursed, due to the reduction of the project scope resulting from the
unfavorable gdological findings.
IV. Conclusions
14.       The success of the project should be measured not by whether or
not it located coal deposit which could lead to an ecouomically viable
project at current economic environment, but by whether prospects were
accurately evaluated, feasibility studies of high standard completed, and
technical standards raised. As most exploration efforts do not result in
new mine development, particularly in the short-term, and as world energy



-6-
and coal prices unexpectedly collapsed over the project period, the lack of
new mine development, as a result of the project, is not considered a
project failure. Indeed, since it is at least possible that the project
itself may have prevented a premature rush to initiating mine development,
the project may have saved many times its cost through avoidance of wasted
expenditure. The project did indeed evaluate the coal deposits of both
Mindanao and Samar, it did carry out prefeasibility work at Lalat, San
Miguel, Bislig, etc. and it did significantly raise the operating standards
of PNOC-CC so that all usual activities of the corporation can now be
completed without technical assistance.
15.       Lessons to be learned include:  (i) when preparing exploration
projects, provision of an expanded (US$1.5 million) Project Preparation
Facilities (PPF) should be used to generate as much data as possible to
form a sound basis for more realistic project cost estimate; and (ii) since
most exploration projects are carried out in several stages, the project
scope is subject to revision depending on incoming data, and there is
always a possibility that not all the stages as originally planned will be
implemented; therefore, both the borrower and the Bank should be prepared
to cancel the funds for stages of the project that are no longer warranted
as soon as possible in order to reduce the burden of high commitment
charges to the Government.

PNOC COAL CORPORATION
COMMEM FROM THE BORROWER
September 1, 1987
Mr. Rene A. Ribi
Acting Chief
Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Ribi:
Regarding the draft Project Completion Report for the Coal
Exploration Project which you sent us for comments, we would
like to make some clarifications regarding item No. 9 on
page 4. Please be informed that stoppage of further work on
Lalat Area was more of a World Bank decision than that of
the Government. The Philippine Government through NEDA
continues to classify the development of the area as a priority
project. As you are probably aware of, we submitted a proposal
for the Lalat Feasibility Study to the Asian Development Bank
which the ADB favorably endorsed provided some further geo-
technical studies arc completed. PNOC-CC completed the study
and got the support of the ADB for the conduct of the Peasibi-
lity Study. The Philippine Government just recently even
came up with an endorsement to accelerate the Feasibility
Study tc 1987 in view of the area's good potential.
We hope that the above clarifications would be considered
for inclusion in the report.
Very truly yours,
