The instruments employed by the ARSP\n            Credit to achieve the dual goals will include: supporting\n            the macroeconomic reform program; supporting\n            Government's efforts to design and implement a policy\n            reform program; providing non-inflationary resources to the\n            budget; easing the severe foreign exchange and import\n            constraints; easing the liquidity constraint on consumers by\n            allowing regular payments of wages and salaries and\n            producers by liberalizing prices and markets; and\n            strengthening the targeting and performance of the safety\n            net by focusing benefits on children, low income pensioners,\n            and non-working pensioners."}, "docdt": "1996-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
