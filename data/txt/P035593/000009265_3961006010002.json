decided to devalue their currency, the CFA franc,\n            effective January 12, 1994. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy whose main objectives are private sector led\n            growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Government's\n            program has also obtained the support of a second year\n            arrangement under the International Monetary Fund's\n            (IMF's) Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).\n            By shoring up support for measures taken in the aftermath of\n            the devaluation, the proposed operation is a crucial element\n            in helping the Government deepen its adjustment strategy.\n            Since 1991, adjustment in Burkina Faso has been supported by\n            a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAL I) as well as a first\n            year arrangement under the IMF's SAF and a first year\n            arrangement under the IMF's ESAF. Implementation of SAL\n            I has been satisfactory overall, and two tranches have been\n            disbursed. The Government of Burkina Faso has already taken\n            a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures to\n            regain and consolidate competitiveness. This credit is\n            designed to support the implementation of these measures in\n            1994. The major measures are: (i) the devaluation of the CFA\n            Franc from 50 to 100 CFAF/1 FF; (ii) increase in the\n            producer price of prime quality cotton by 40%; (iii) a\n            program of measures to attenuate the negative social effects\n            of the devaluation; (iv) prudent demand management policies\n            to reduce absorption by the public sector and limit wage\n            increases; and (v) implementation of key measures to\n            increase the coverage and quality of primary education and\n            health services in the context of a priority Action Plan for 1994."}, "docdt": "1994-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
