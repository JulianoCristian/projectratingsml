Based on the Bank's ex-poste valuation\n            norms, the ERC is classified as highly satisfactory This\n            assessment is based on the following elements: (i) the\n            program succeeded in restoring price stability quickly\n            following the devaluation; (ii) substantial progress was\n            made in the areas of education and, to a large extent, in\n            health; and (iii) the price regime, which was temporarily\n            controlled to limit the impact of the devaluation was\n            quickly liberalized in its aftermath. This credit was a\n            successful operation largely because of its simple design.\n            Reform measures had, by and large, been implemented in\n            advance, and as a result, the credit became effective soon\n            after Board approval and was fully disbursed shortly\n            thereafter. Emergency Recovery Credits, and one-tranche\n            operations in general, lend themselves well to support\n            policy reforms that depend on concrete policy decisions,\n            where implementation is not a long process."}, "docdt": "1996-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
