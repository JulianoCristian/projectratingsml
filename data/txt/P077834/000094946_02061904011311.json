Province\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project, supports the economic,\n            and social reform program of the Province, and builds on\n            four pillars: 1) strengthening provincial governance through\n            civil service reform, to strengthen accountability,\n            integrity, and institutional framework; 2) strengthening\n            public health, and education delivery systems, including\n            devolution of responsibilities to expand access to these\n            services, with a focus on primary service delivery; 3)\n            fiscal, and financial management reforms, to increase\n            provincial revenues, reprioritize expenditures, strengthen\n            procurement, and improve budget preparation and\n            implementation; and, 4) deregulation, and business\n            facilitations to enhance prospects for growth, and poverty\n            alleviation. However, major risks are failure to continue\n            the political commitment to the reform process in the\n            Province in light of the October 2002 forthcoming elections;\n            setbacks in the implementation of the Government's\n            reform agenda; and, external shocks arising from a downturn\n            in the economy, including tensions along Pakistani borders.\n            Nonetheless, the Bank's support program is\n            self-adjusting to mitigate the risk of reform derailment."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
