          West Frontier Province were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that it is better to proceed with a reform\n            program credit even if there are the risks of first-time\n            lending to a sub-national borrower, new elections and other\n            risks, if there is borrower ownership. An accompanying\n            Technical Assistant project would enhance the effectiveness\n            of subsequent Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs). The\n            North West Frontier Province (NWFP) reform program is\n            comprehensive and complex and there are a number of areas\n            where sustained expertise and capacity building would be of\n            great benefit. The slow implementation in some areas shows\n            the need to strengthen implementation capacity, among other\n            things through technical assistance. The ramifications of\n            judicial reforms and devolution must be reasonably well\n            understood before their implementation. The Bank and other\n            donors noted the constitutional requirement for a judiciary\n            separate from the executive branch, but did not fully take\n            into account the vacuum created by abolishing the Magistrate\n            (as part of the program of Devolution, not specifically the\n            SAC) as an arbiter of average citizen's disputes or as\n            a mediator between the public and the police. Violence has\n            erupted between the police and the public in NWFP with\n            considerable loss of life. Family courts and minor civil\n            courts should be established expeditiously to compensate for\n            the loss of the Magistrate's judicial role."}, "docdt": "2003-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
