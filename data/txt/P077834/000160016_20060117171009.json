For the NWFP Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project, project outcome is moderately\n            satisfactory; sustainability is likely; institutional\n            development impact is modest; overall Bank performance is\n            satisfactory; and overall Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. For the NFWP Community Infrastructure Project,\n            project outcome is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability\n            is unlikely; institutional development impact is modest;\n            overall Bank performance is unsatisfactory; and overall\n            Borrower performance is unsatisfactory. The main lessons\n            from these projects are: 1) Operations at the sub-national\n            level are a useful complement to those at the national\n            level. In terms of contributing to improved delivery of\n            service and poverty reduction, they compare favorably with\n            the Social Action Program. 2) Unless the mechanisms\n            governing the financial relationships between the federal\n            and provincial governments are revised, there is little or\n            no prospect for the provinces to be able to fulfill their\n            social mandate as provided by the Constitution and the\n            devolution plan in a sustainable manner. 3) Capacity at the\n            lower level is generally very weak since power resides at\n            the center for historical reasons. The focus, content, and\n            design of sub-national operations should target capacity and\n            institutional building at that level in conjunction with the\n            transfer of responsibilities from the higher to the lower\n            level. 4) When designing sub-national operations, joint\n            discussions with the central government are indispensable\n            for success. 5) Ownership and commitment, at the political\n            as well as at the administrative level, are keys to success.\n            6) Given the weak local capacity, emphasis should be placed\n            not only on building institutional capacity and training,\n            but also on incentives to encourage staff to learn and\n            assume greater responsibility. 7) Sub-national operations\n            should be accompanied by well designed and well focused\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2005-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
