{"cdata!": "The Third Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SAC3) to the Republic of Georgia had a satisfactory outcome\n            and a modest institutional development impact.  Project\n            sustainability is unlikely, with satisfactory performances\n            by both the Bank and the Borrower.  While SAC3 conditions\n            were implemented, they did not have the desired impacts\n            because of the poor governance environment. A number of\n            external factors inhibited the impact of the SAC3 including:\n            the Russian crisis of 1998; the presidential elections of\n            2000; and rising tensions over border security issues in\n            2002.  The Government has always supported the program, and\n            has been willing to intervene where implementing agencies\n            caused snags in implementation. Lessons learned include the\n            following.  SAC3 would have been better served by a\n            technical assistance project that supported not only\n            discrete activities, but aimed at true capacity building.\n            An operation with a significantly longer implementation time\n            would have better suited the Georgian reform programs.  The\n            Bank needs to be more realistic in estimating implementation\n            time, particularly for a three tranche operation with many\n            conditions.  The Bank needs to spend more time raising\n            ownership of the program at the level of implementing\n            agencies.  Finally, the quality of governance may dictate\n            the impact and the sustainability of the operation."}, "docdt": "2003-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
