                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was declared effective on March 5, 2010. The overall performance of the project is marginally satisfactory. After one year of implementation, the project disbursement rate
                         is 37.5 percent. The performance of the project coordination unit also remains marginally satisfactory. Out of the three intermediate results indicators, targets for 2010 were fully
                         achieved in only one case while little progress was observed for the remaining two indicators. The last implementation support mission concluded that more efforts were needed in
                         project coordination and activities implementation.
