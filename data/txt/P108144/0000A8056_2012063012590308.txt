                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project displays a disbursement rate of 85% at three months from the official closing date of June 30th, 2012. The two indicators (increase of organic matter in the soil in target
                         areas and increase of arable land with SLM practices in target areas) supposed to inform about the level of achievement of the GEO are not yet evaluated. However, studies are
                         carrying out to quantify these indicators and according to ISRA, the results will be available by mid-may 2012.
                         However, the delay observed at the start of the project is still having effect on project implementation despite the important progress realized across the different components.

                         Actually, none of the components did achieve fully the totality of its objectives as of to date, and it will be difficult to do so by end of June 2012, the project’s closing date. Accordingly,
                         a six-month extension of the project is required to allow particularly, the component C related to support to producers organizations, one of the core component of the project, to
                         consolidate its results and achieve its objectives.
