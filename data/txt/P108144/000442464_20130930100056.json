     outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the beneficiaries'\n            commitment and ownership are critical to the success of any\n            project. The involvement of a multitude of agencies in a\n            project can be successful if the coordination is successful.\n            The capacity-building program for producer organizations\n            (POs) in financial management, accounting, and procurement\n            empowered the POs and increased their confidence and pride\n            in implementing activities fruitfully. Using a community\n            demand-driven approach can greatly improve the ownership,\n            success, and sustainability of agricultural development\n            projects that provide infrastructure or equipment. The SLM\n            project showed that through transparency and good\n            governance, POs convince the entire community to contribute\n            to exceptional subproject achievements. Field visits during\n            joint Bank and government implementation support missions\n            are crucial to put projects on track to achieve development\n            outcomes. Much attention should be given to planning\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) to ensure that baseline\n            studies are completed on time with the required data.\n            Gender-sensitive teams and strong female leadership among\n            beneficiaries are driving forces in building the gender\n            dimension of a project. Well-trained focal points on\n            environmental and other safeguard policies encourage\n            compliance with World Bank policies without creating the\n            need to call upon World Bank specialists."}, "docdt": "2013-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
