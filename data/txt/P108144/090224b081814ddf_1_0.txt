                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At three months from the extended closing date of December 31st, 2012, the project is progressing very well with a disbursement rate moving from 85% in April 2012 during the last
                         ISM, to 99.64 as of October 5th, 2012. The first outcome indicator relative to the increase of organic matter in the soil in target areas is largely reached (0.47% against a target of
                         0.23%). The second outcome indicator relative to the increase of arable land with SLM practices in target areas is achieved up to 85% but the mapping of the covered area is still
                         ongoing and of sure the target will be achieved.

                         The several field visits made during the ISM throughout the sub-projects carried out by the producers organizations helped to get more insight on the diversity of SLM technologies
                         used and the achievements made so far. The innovative approach of the project is anchored in the fact that producers organizations identify their SLM sub-project, elaborate their
                         request and submit it for funding. As result, the project is very fascinating in terms of group dynamism created over rural communities translated by a strong commitment and coalition
                         of producers to carry out successfully their SLM sub-projects.

                         Nevertheless, given the project is closing on December 31st, 2012, a close monitoring is required for the completion of all activities and the payment of all invoices as agreed with the
                         different institutions involved in the project implementation.
