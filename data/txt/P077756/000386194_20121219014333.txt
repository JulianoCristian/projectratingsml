RESTRUCTURING PAPER
A.     SUmMARY
1.    This Project Paper proposes to introduce three changes in the Project Documents
of the Guatemala Maternal and Infant Health and Nutrition Project (P077756-Loan No.
3537), as follows: (a) extend the Project closing date for five months from December 31,
2012 to May 30, 2013 to allow for the completion of critical activities; (b) reallocate
funds among Project disbursement categories; and (c) formally revise targets for eight
indicators and the description of two indicators, as well as include three intermediate
results indicators in the results monitoring framework. These proposed changes will: (i)
allow the Project to complete the few remaining activities which have been delayed as a
result of changes in the Ministry of Health and related modifications in administrative
and fimancial procedures; (ii) reassign funds to take into account actual expenditures and
the Project's future needs; and (iii) align certain targets with what can be realistically
achieved based on implementation experience and prevailing country context, as well as
adjust the description of two indicators: one to specify three programs referred to and the
other in order to accurately reflect established reporting practice with the World Bank,
and also include three core indicators in line with the World Bank's Health, Nutrition,
and Population Sector requirements. The proposed PDO changes will not alter the
Project Development Objectives (PDOs).
B.     PROJECT BACKGROUND AND STATUS
2.     The Project was approved on January 19, 2006 and became effective on June 26,
2007. It aims to support the Government of Guatemala to: (a) improve maternal and
infant health in the Project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b) reduce chronic malnutrition
among children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities
targeted by the Project. It finances four components: (1) Strengthening of Maternal and
Infant Health Network; (2) Nutrition - Implementation of the AINM-C and Cresciendo
Bien Strategy; (3) Communications, Monitoring, and Evaluation, and Continuous
Auditing systems; and (4) Institutional Strengthening.
3.    Progress on attainment of PDOs and in Project implementation are both
moderately satisfactory. Despite a delayed start of thirty months' (implementation started
mid- 2008 even though the Project became effective in 2006), the Project has made
notable progress. To date, the Project has disbursed 99 percent of Loan funds and has
already attained two of its Project Development Objective targets (percentage increase in
'The 30-month delay was due to the delayed Congressional approval of the Project and the Government
transition because the outgoing Administration delegated Project implementation to the new
Administration. This is also the first World Bank Project for the health sector in Guatemala so time had to
be invested in learning and in resolving coordination issues between technical, financial, and administration
units. Subsequent changes in the Project Technical Coordination Team helped accelerate Project
implementation.

﻿the number of institutional births and percentage reduction in the indigenous to non
indigenous maternal mortality ratio), while also demonstrating progress in terms of
reducing the indigenous to non indigenous infant mortality ratio in Project areas. The
Project has also surpassed or met five intermediate indicator targets: the total number of
jurisdictions reached by the Community-based Integrated Care for Children and Women
(AINM-C); the number of families living in the Project areas attended by the Cresciendo
Bien Program; the number of rehabilitated secondary facilities with a fully functional
operating room;2 the percentage of women receiving postnatal care in the areas of
intervention; and it has also developed and has been implementing an integrated strategy
for AINM-C to improve the quality of primary and secondary levels of care as well as a
multicultural communications strategy linking three programs: AINM-C, the Expansion
of Coverage Program (PEC), and Cresciendo Bien. Other achievements of the Project
include significant increases in the percentage of children for whom change in weight is
measured in the Project areas, the percentage of children less than two years who
participate in weighing sessions in the areas of intervention, the percentage of pregnant
women with at least one prenatal care check-up, and the establishment of a
Communications Resources Bank which is available for use by all local agencies working
on maternal and child health issues. The Project has already rehabilitated 34 secondary
level facilities, provided a package of basic health and nutrition services to 950,000
persons, and trained at least 2,000 health staff per year.
3.    However, a number of institutional changes occurred in the Ministry of Health
(MOH) this year that have impacted and slowed Project implementation, including a
number of changes of Ministers and Vice-Ministers and corresponding changes in their
legal and administrative teams, as well as revised administrative and financial
requirements by the new Government. For example, new approval criteria were put in
place for technical proposals for water treatment plants in line with the new norms
introduced by the new Administration. Moreover payment requests for civil works now
have to be disaggregated based on revised budget lines using a new payment system.
Changes in the legal and administrative teams of the MOH also contributed to delays in
contract and payment approvals because the new teams needed time to become
familiarized with the Project and external funding norms and procedures: These factors
have all contributed to delays in the implementation of certain critical Project activities,
prompting the Government to request for an extension to allow the Project to complete
certain critical activities that will be discussed further in the following section.
C.    PROPOSED CHANGES
4.     Extension of closing date. The Government of Guatemala in a letter dated July
10, 2012 requested an extension of the Project closing date from December 31, 2012 to
June 30, 2013. This extension would allow the following remaining activities to be
completed: (a) rehabilitation of three remaining health centers to improve access to
secondary level health care services, with an emphasis on providing clean, safe births in
rural areas, with a high percentage of indigenous populations which would enable the
Project attain its current targets for rehabilitated facilities; (b) completion of construction
2 The original target for the number of secondary facilities rehabilitated, with "cartera ampliada" or
expanded services and a fully functional operating room was 8.

﻿of water treatment plants in eight health centers to comply with World Bank safeguard
policies; and (c) completion of the final nutrition assessment needed to assess Project
impact.
5.    Based on discussions between the Project Team and the World Bank Team, it was
agreed that Project implementation could be accelerated to ensure completion by May 30,
2013. The proposed extension will be the second for the Project for a cumulative total of
23 months. The Project and World Bank teams have discussed and agreed on an action
plan for implementation of the remaining activities covering the period November 2012
to May 30, 2013 (see Annex 2) as well as a risk mitigation plan. Both plans will be
monitored closely. There is no outstanding audit for the Project.
6.     Reallocation, The Government of Guatemala, in a letter dated September 24,
2012, requested a reallocation of Project funds between categories as presented in Table
1. The proposed reallocation will not result in any change in Project Development
Objectives and is necessary because funds will remain unused in Category I (Goods and
Associated Services), Category 2 (Works and Associated Services), and Category 4-B
(Services under Part B). Savings from the first two categories are the result of one health
facility rehabilitation not taking place because of unresolved legal issues regarding its
location, while the rehabilitation of two other health facilities will be covered by other
funding sources based on the Government's decision to have one health facility upgraded
to a hospital and another funded by the National Peace Fund. The extra funds from
Category 4-B are the unutilized amounts from contracted NGOs that were returned by the
Ministry of Finance to the Project Account. An estimated US$2,445,350.19 from these
three expenditure categories will be reallocated to three other expenditure categories
(described below) to cover the amounts already spent and to finance the completion of
remaining activities. The proposed increases relate to the following expenditure
categories:
a. Category 3 (Consultant services, training, and audits) requires an additional
US$1,210,370 to cover the costs of the External Audits for the Project for the years
2011 and 2012, as well as previous and planned consultancies and capacity building
activities for health staff.
b. Category 4-A (Health Services Part 1) needs an additional US$453,000 to cover the
amount already spent for staffing several health facilities to respond to increased
demand for services (e.g. institutional births), as well as to pay for certain staff while
the Government progressively assumes all health personnel costs.
c. Category 5 (Operating Costs) requires an additional US$781,980.19 to cover the
amount already spent, as well as future running costs, including storage of equipment
while facilities are being rehabilitated, fuel, communications, and maintenance of
vehicles such as ambulances.

7.    Results Framework. The Government of Guatemala in a letter dated November
13, 2012 has requested the formal revision of the Project's Results Monitoring Matrix as
an Annex in the Project Operational Manual. The revised results matrix which will be
used to assess Project performance includes the following changes: updated targets for 8
indicators, modified descriptions for two indicators, and the inclusion of three indicators.
The Ministry of Health was reluctant to request target changes because it wanted to
motivate stakeholders to strive hard to attain them. The MOH was persuaded to adjust the
targets based on in-country discussions that took place this year on the importance of
setting realistic targets, while taking into account prevailing country context for one of
the Government's flagship initiatives, the Zero Hunger Program (which seeks to address
7


﻿food and nutrition security) and the Results-based management agreement signed
between the Ministries of Health and Finance.
8. The targets for the following eight indicators will be revised:
a. The percentages of children under two who are underweight (with weight
for age <- 2Z) and stunted (height for.age < -2Z) will be adjusted to each
reflect a reduction of 5 percentage points instead of 10 percentage points3
because the actual baseline survey was undertaken in 2010/2011 when the
Project was already two years into implementation.4 The proposed targets
consider what can be realistically achieved given the two year period
between baseline and final surveys, rather than the expected larger
difference in results between no-Project and with-Project scenarios,
b. The target for rehabilitated health centers that provide surgical services
has been increased from 8 to 10 while the target for rehabilitated health
centers without surgical capacity has been reduced from 32 to 27. During
the course of Project implementation there was a strategic decision to
provide more areas with access to facilities that provide surgical services
while maintaining the same total number (40) of rehabilitated facilities.
The revised plan was to rehabilitate 12 instead of 8 secondary level health
facilities with surgical capacity (CAIMI) and 28 instead of 32 secondary
health centers without surgical capacity (CAP) for a total of 40 facilities.
However, as a result of difficulties in obtaining local legal clearances for a
CAIMI and the Government's decision to upgrade another CAIMI to a
hospital, the Project can only rehabilitate  10 CAIMIs. Also, the
Government decided to have one CAP rehabilitated by the National Peace
Fund, thus lowering the total number of CAPs to be rehabilitated under the
Project to 27.
c. Targets have been reduced for three indicators: percentage of women
obtaining prenatal care (from 100 percent to 90 percent), percentage of
children under two years of age participating in weighing sessions (from
85 percent to 80 percent), and percentage of children whose change in
weight is measured (from 85 percent to 80 percent) in order to reflect what
the Project can realistically achieve based on prevailing cultural beliefs
and practices in the areas of intervention, as well as available time and
resources.
3 New height for age targets are 63.2 percent (2008 cohort) and 73.3 percent (2009 cohort) while weight
for age targets are 16.9% (2008 cohort) and 22.4% (2009 cohort).
4The data used in earlier ISRs as baseline data were extrapolated data from the ENSMI 2002 based on
more aggregate level data that do not correspond completely with the Project areas. The actual baseline
survey was delayed due to various factors, including difficulties encountered in hiring a consulting firm
which lead the Project to decide to hire individual consultants, delays in signing contracts on the part of the
MOII, and serious weather disruptions during the survey period.
8


﻿9.    In addition, the description of the indicator related to having an integrated strategy
for three programs was revised to specify the programs, namely the Expansion of
Coverage Program or PEC, the Community-based Integrated Care of Children and
Women or AINM-C, and Cresciendo Bien. Also, the description of the indicator that
refers to the number of monitoring and evaluation reports was modified to: (a) take into
account that while most of the required information comes the Health Information
System (SIGSA), some key data come from the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC)
Information System, the National Institute for Statistics, and nutrition surveys and that
there is no single Monitoring Information System that provides all of the Project's
required information; and (b) the target has been decreased from three reports to two
reports each year to reflect the agreed reporting frequency during Project implementation
and supervision.
10.   Finally, three indicators (number of people with access to a basic package of
health, nutrition, or reproductive health services; number of health facilities constructed,
renovated, and/or equipped; and number of health personnel receiving training) will be
formally included in the Results Monitoring Framework because they are required sector
core indicators and are being monitored under the Project.
