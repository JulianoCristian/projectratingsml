                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project aims to support the Government of Guatemala to: (a) improve maternal and infant health in the project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b)
                         reduce chronic malnutrition among children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities targeted by the project.

                         The Project has made satisfactory progress in terms of disbursements, as well as in advancing toward attaining most of its development and intermediate outcome indicators. In
                         terms of results, the percentage increase in the number of institutional births, percentage of women receiving postnatal care ten days after giving birth, the percentage reduction in the
                         indigenous to non indigenous maternal mortality ratio have already surpassed their end of Project targets. In addition, the percentage of women who received at least one prenatal

                         beneficiaries receiving a package of services for children who are less than 5 years old; and number of health facilities constructed/rehabilitated. As of end of 2010, the following

                         intermediate outcome indicators have exceeded their end of project targets: number of jurisdictions implementing AINM-C and number of communities implementing the Cresciendo
                         Bien (Growing Well) Program. The two main child nutritional status indicators will be updated in July due to delays in completing the survey work. Although the nutritional status
                         indicators are not yet available, the Project has advanced in terms of (a) improving organizational processes at the community level to improve awareness and participation of
                         community members in promoting nutritional well being especially in children less than 2 years of age; including community leaders, health staff, mothers, fathers, mothers in law, and
                         midwives in discussions and awareness creation and counseling, and (b) developing training materials, using different forms of communication and 5 main indigenous languages.
                         The Project has established a Communications Resource Center, making available training materials such as videos and drama recordings on health and nutrition themes to other
                         public agencies.
