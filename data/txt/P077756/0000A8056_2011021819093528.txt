                         The proposed Project aims to support the Government of Guatemala to: (a) improve maternal and infant health in the project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b)
                         reduce chronic malnutrition among children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities targeted by the project.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to steadily improve in terms of disbursements, implementation of activities, and a number of intermediate outcome indicators such as increase in number of
                         children below 2 years of age who participate in the growth monitoring sessions, number of beneficiaries receiving a package of services for children who are less than 5 years old;
                         number of persons trained; and number of health centers constructed). Two indicators have already exceeded their end of project targets: number of jurisdictions implementing

                         The Project also concluded quality assessment pilots of the Community Based Integrated Attention for Children and Women (AINM-C) that were undertaken in November 2009 and
                         April 2010. The results of these assessments were used to refine evaluation forms and other related instruments that are being used as the AINM-C is expanded.

                         The Ministry of Health organized a workshop on September 8, 2010 to present and discuss international and local experiences regarding the implementation of the AINM-C to help it
                         reflect on and improve its own program.

                         Despite the improvements in implementation and disbursements, the Project could not totally compensate for the 30 month delay of the actual project start date. Thus the
                         Government requested the Bank to extend the Project closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The Bank has approved the extension request.
