1. Progress in project implementation is moderately satisfactory and Project objectives
   continue to be achievable. After a delayed start of thirty months (implementation
   started mid- 2008 even though the Project was approved by the Board in 2006), the
   Project has made notable progress. Following a request from the Government, the
   Bank approved an extension of the closing date from June 30, 2011 to December 31,
   2011 on September 14, 2010. This extension was granted to enable completion of
   civil works in 35 Maternal and Child Health Care Centers under Component 1
   ((Maternal and Child Health Referral Network) and design and implementation of a
   comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the nutrition and health
   intervention under Component 3 (Communication, Monitoring, Evaluation, and
   Continuous Auditing Systems). In the last year, the Project has made more progress
   in terms of disbursements (as of January 31, 2011, disbursements amount to 67
   percent of the loan) and implementation of activities. There has been progress in
   several intermediate outcome indicators such as, an increase in number of children
   below two years of age who participate in the growth monitoring sessions, number of
   beneficiaries receiving a package of services for children who are less than 5 years
   old; number of persons trained; and number of health centers constructed. Two
   intermediate outcome indicators have already exceeded their end of project targets:
   number of jurisdictions implementing the Community based Maternal and Infant Care
   Program (AINM-C) and number of communities implementing the Cresciendo Bien
   Program. In terms of project development indicators, the percentage of institutional
   deliveries in project areas (which tend to be among the poorest and most remote areas
   in the country) has increased from 22 percent in 2006 to 31 percent by mid-2010,
   already exceeding the targeted increase of 20%.


2. The Government of Guatemala, in its letter dated December 7, 2010, requested a
   reallocation of project funds across some expenditure categories. The Bank Project
   team, based on its review and discussions with the Project team, confirms that the
   proposed reallocation will not result in any change in project development objectives.
   The reallocation is necessary because of the following reasons:

       a. A careful review of future project expenditures indicates that not all of the
          estimated funds for Category 3 (Consultants' services, training, and audits),
          Category 4-b (Health Services under Part 2 of the Project), Category 5
          (Operating Costs), and Category 8 (Unallocated) will be needed and that a
          total of US$4,545,350.19 from these four (4) expenditure categories could be

                                           4
           reallocated to two (2) other expenditure categories as explained below in order
           to implement the rest of the planned activities under the Project and facilitate
           the attainment of its development objectives.

       b. The proposed increase for Expenditure Category 1 (Goods and associated
          services) amounts to US$3,535,350.10. Costs for services and goods
          especially for equipping and furnishing health care facilities have increased
          significantly since Project preparation was finalized in December 2005.
          Moreover, vehicles (pick-ups) to support community related activities related
          to the Integrated Maternal and Infant Care (AINM-C) and ambulances were
          purchased to strengthen the referral network between the primary and
          secondary levels of care. In addition, as part of the institutional strengthening
          activities in Component 4 (Institutional Strengthening) , it was also deemed
          necessary to procure computer equipment and some office furniture to support
          the Project Coordination Unit and the Food Security and Nutrition Secretariat.

       c. Expenditure Expenditure category Expenditure Category 4-A (Health Services
          under Part 1 of the Project) requires an additional US$1,000,000 in order to
          continue to finance trained health personnel needed for the health facilities
          (Maternal and Infant Health Care Center or CAIMIs and Primary Care
          Centers or CAPs) refurbished by the Project to meet the increased demand in
          maternal and child health services in the project areas.

   Nutrition, Loan No. 7357, P077756 will be reallocated as follows:
