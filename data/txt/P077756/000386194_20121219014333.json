and b) reduce chronic malnutrition among\n            children younger than two years of age in the rural areas of\n            the 70 municipalities targeted by the project. This project\n            paper includes: to introduce three changes in the project\n            documents as follows: 1) extend the project closing date for\n            five months from December 31, 2012 to May 30, 2013 to allow\n            for the completion of critical activities; 2) reallocate\n            funds among project disbursement categories; and 3) formally\n            revise targets for eight indicators and description of two\n            indicators, as well as include three intermediate results\n            indicators in the results monitoring framework. These\n            changes will i) allow the project to complete the few\n            remaining activities which have been delayed as a result of\n            changes in the Ministry of Health and related modifications\n            in administrative and financial procedures; ii) reassign\n            funds to take into account actual expenditures and the\n            projects future needs; and iii) align certain targets with\n            what can be realistically achieved based on implementation\n            experience and prevailing country context, as well as adjust\n            the description of two indicators: one to specify three\n            programs referred to and the other in order to accurately\n            reflect established reporting practice with World Bank, also\n            include three core indicators in line with World Bank's\n            health, nutrition, and population sector requirements."}, "docdt": "2012-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
