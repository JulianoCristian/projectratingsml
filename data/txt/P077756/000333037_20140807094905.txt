1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.        Country and Sector Background. At the time of Project appraisal, Guatemala
faced a number of development challenges related to high poverty and inequality
incidence. Poverty in Guatemala was widespread, though especially prevalent in rural
areas and among the poorly educated and indigenous members of the population, and
reflected in the country’s social indicators. Despite a difficult history and a complex
country context, the Peace Agreements signed in 1996 after a 36-year civil war created a
unique development opportunity for Guatemala, and the objectives established in the
Peace Plan continue to guide the country’s development.

2.        Inequality and poverty levels in Guatemala disproportionally impacted the
rural and indigenous population. Guatemala's Gini coefficient of 0.57 was the second
highest in Latin America (after Brazil) and one of the highest in the world. Wide health
and education equity gaps, closely associated with high-income inequality, largely
affected the rural and indigenous population, hindered human capital development and
perpetuated low intergenerational mobility.

3.         Maternal and child mortality and malnutrition were linked to poor pre-
natal conditions resulting from high inequities in health. One in five pregnant women
had no pre-natal care at all and only 50 percent had their first pre-natal care visit during
the first trimester of pregnancy. The rate of attended births grew to 42 percent in 2002
from 34 percent in 1995, but remained low. The proportion of births with no specialized
attention or lack of transportation in case of emergency was very high. Low birth
weights (affecting approximately 12 percent of newborns), deliveries under unsafe
conditions, malnutrition, infectious digestive diseases (diarrhea) and respiratory
infections raised infant mortality.

4.        Chronic malnutrition rates were among the highest in the world. At the
time of Project signing, 56 percent of malnourished children in Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC) lived in Guatemala. With half of preschool children chronically
malnourished, Guatemala had the highest prevalence of chronic malnutrition (stunting) in
the region and only a handful of other countries in the world exceeded its rates. A number
of largely preventable factors, including limited access to health care, inadequate
complementary feeding and certain cultural practices, constituted a major cause in the
perpetuation of chronic malnutrition. Chronic malnutrition and the poor health of young
children not only led to mortality, but also short stature, negative cognitive development,
poor school performance and reduced adult productivity. The irreversible loss of human
capital formation affected current and future generations, undermining economic growth.

5.      Progress in health was constrained by years of war, low health
expenditure, the inefficient and unequal allocation of resources and inadequate
health education. Guatemala’s 36-year civil war hindered the provision of social

                                             1
services for those residing in rural areas, while a difficult terrain further complicated
service provision. Low public health expenditure and high health needs also hampered
improvements in the national health profile. In 2003, the overall expenditure of Ministry
of Public Health and Social Welfare (Ministerio de Salud Pública y Asistencia Social --
MSPAS)1 amounted to US$212 million or US$17.6 per capita, one of the lowest in LAC.
Years of underinvestment were aggravated by low internal efficiency and a biased
allocation of resources towards the urban areas and non-poor. As a result, any progress
achieved over the previous decade in health disproportionally benefitted the non-
indigenous.

6.        The Project’s Development Objective (PDO) was consistent with the
Guatemala country partnership strategy and supported progress on key Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and Government efforts in tackling extreme poverty
and fostering sustained growth. The Bank’s FY05-08 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS, Report #31776) 2 was developed in line with the Vamos Guatemala Plan,
Guatemala’s development plan, and explicitly included Bank assistance in the nutrition
and health sectors. In particular, the Bank-financed Project supported the Government’s
social policy – Guate Solidaria – which addressed the main obstacles delaying human
capital formation in the country: chronic malnutrition, maternal and infant health, and
insufficient schooling, accompanied by high inequality in access to social services. The
Project also supported progress on three MDG’s: Eradication of Extreme Poverty and
Hunger (MDG1), Reduction of Child Mortality (MDG4), and Improvement of Maternal
Health (MDG5). In order to increase health care access, the Project strengthened the
Extension of Coverage Program (PEC), a Government effort to guarantee the universal
provision of an improved basic package of health services in over a hundred, largely rural
and vulnerable municipalities, while incorporating the Community Integrated Care for
Children and Women (Atención Integral a la Niñez y Mujer - Comunitario --AINM-C)
strategy within the PEC in order to expand maternal and infant health coverage.3

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.        The objectives of the Project were to assist the Borrower in: (a) improving
maternal and infant health in the Project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b) reducing
chronic malnutrition among children younger than two years of age in the rural areas of
the 70 municipalities targeted by the Project. Achievement of the PDO was measured by
five key indicators: (i) reduction in the indigenous/non indigenous infant mortality ratio
in Project area; (ii) reduction in the indigenous/non indigenous maternal mortality ratio in
Project area; (iii) increase in the percentage of institutional deliveries in the areas of
intervention; (iv) reduction in the percentage of children under two with weight for age <-

the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the PEC.

for age <-2Z in Project areas.4

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8.        The PDO did not change despite three Project restructurings. The third
restructuring in November 2012, formally revised targets for eight indicators and the
description of two indicators, as well as included three intermediate results indicators in
the Monitoring and Results Framework. The key indicators were adjusted in order to
reflect what the Project could realistically achieve based on prevailing cultural beliefs and
practices in the areas of intervention, as well as available time and resources.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.        Project investments directly benefitted vulnerable and underserved women
and children under two, residing in the rural jurisdictions with the worst maternal
and infant health indicators. The Bank-financed Project provided access to a basic
package of health, nutrition, or reproductive health services to over a million people
including approximately 160,000 are children under five. The emphasis on maternal and
infant health in certain regions in Guatemala meant that indigenous poor women and
children were the main beneficiaries. However, since the Project invested in health-
related public goods, it had externalities that benefited children over two, women without
children and men in the regions where interventions took place.

10.       The Project improved health education and skills of a diverse group of
individuals. Over 3,000 health personnel (community educators, health/nutrition
counselors, health providers and administrators and Ministry of Health (MOH) staff)
benefitted from Project-related health training and the improved availability of essential
equipment. Community educators also trained local community mothers in basic health
themes related to exclusive breastfeeding, complementary feeding, good nutrition, and
basic health and hygiene.

1.5 Original Components

The Project consisted of the following four components (see Annex 2).

11.       Component 1. Strengthening of the Maternal and Infant Health Network
(US$22.8 million). The objective of this component was to support the development of a
Maternal and Infant Health Referral and Response Network, promote the demand for
maternal and infant health care by increasing the proportion of safe institutional
deliveries, and ease the referral of obstetric emergencies directly from the community and


4 A child is considered to be malnourished when is below a normal, healthy growth path (more than two
“standard deviations” below average, in statistical terms).


                                                 3
for children with acute respiratory and digestive diseases. This component was divided
into three sub-components: (i) Maternal and Infant Health Promotion from the
community; (ii) Strengthening capacity of the secondary health level; (iii) Strengthening
the referral system; and (iv) Creation of Maternal Homes (“Hogares Maternos”).

12.       Component 2. Nutrition - Implementation of the Community Integrated
Care for Children and Women (AINM-C) and "Creciendo Bien" Nutrition
Strategies. (US$21.9 million). The objective of this component was to address child
malnutrition in the selected 70 municipalities by expanding coverage of community-
based growth promotion and basic health services. In addition, this component sought to
expand community-based capacity-strengthening of mothers and families in the most
vulnerable and indigenous communities. As the indigenous community is the most
exposed to malnutrition, the approach focused on ensuring that service demand was
generated and that those targeted could best respond to the interventions. This component
consisted of three sub-components: (i) Strengthening the basic AINM-C package of
services; (ii) Expanding the Creciendo Bien Program in the most vulnerable
communities; and (iii) Strengthening MSPAS’capacity for proper monitoring of the
provision of basic health and nutrition services.

13.       Component 3. Communication, Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuous
Auditing Systems (US$2.4 million). The objective of this component was to: (a)
provide knowledge of nutrition and health programs, encourage the poor and indigenous
population to utilize health and nutrition services, promote pattern behavior, disseminate
the population's right to utilize services, and encourage social audit; (b) design and
implement a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the nutrition and
health interventions; and (c) measure the Project's impact on targeted population welfare.
The component had three sub-components: (i) Communication Strategy, (ii) Monitoring
and Evaluation System, and (iii) Impact Evaluation of the Project.

14.       Component 4. Institutional Strengthening (US$1.7 million). The objective
of this component was to support the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare to implement and administer basic health and nutrition services. In
particular, the Project would support the Project and Program’s Coordination Unit
(Unidad Coordinadora de Programas y Proyectos -- UCPYP) and the Directorate of
Integral Health System (Dirección Sistema Integral de Atención en Salud -- SIAS)
providing technical assistance and equipment for an approximate cost of US$1.4 million.
In addition, the Project supported the institutional consolidation of the recently created
Secretariat of Food and Nutritional Security (Secretaria de Seguridad Alimentaria y
Nutricional -- SESAN) and provided the Secretariat with approximately US$300,000 in
consultant services, equipment, and workshops and training.

1.6 Revised Components

15.      The components were not revised during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.       The Project was restructured three times. The first restructuring was
approved by the Bank on September 4, 2010. It extended the closing date from June 30,
2011 to December 31, 2012 to ensure that various recently launched activities could be
completed and the PDO achieved. The second restructuring (level two) was approved
by the Bank on February 18, 2011. It reallocated unused Project resources amongst
expenditure categories to implement remaining Project activities and facilitate PDO
attainment. The third restructuring (level two) was approved by the Bank on November
28, 2012. The restructuring: (a) extended the Project closing date for five months from
December 31, 2012 to May 30, 2013 to allow for the completion of critical activities; (b)
reallocated funds among Project disbursement categories, and (c) formally revised
indicators as mentioned in Section 1.3. Summary of changes through Project
restructurings is described in Table 1.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

17.       Despite administrative and financial obstacles, frequent staff turnover, and an
ambitious design, the Project had a positive impact on the demand and supply of health
services in the targeted areas, achieving most key and intermediated indicators. In
particular, the significant decrease in maternal mortality, increase in institutional births
and decrease in chronic malnutrition are important outcomes and demonstrate large
national health improvements. A committed Project Coordination Unit (PCU), frequent
Bank supervision missions and interaction with Project stakeholders proved crucial for
Project implementation progress.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.       Project preparation and design were appropriately responsive to
Government policy and intended beneficiary priorities in the health sector. At the
time of Project preparation, the Bank’s work in Guatemala had focused on: (a) extensive
analytical work5 identifying the determinants of poverty and inequality and suggesting
near-term priorities; (b) the lessons learned and experience from several investment
operations, often coupled with technical assistance, in the human development sectors6;
(c) an intensive policy dialogue with the Government, including during the preparation of
the 2005-2009 CAS; and (d) a series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs) to support the
Vamos Guatemala plan and advance further in addressing Guatemala’s key challenges.
Project design was strengthened by a robust participatory process, including focus-group
meetings with women and men in target communities, the elderly, midwives, health
service personnel, etc.      The incorporation of the nutrition and infant-maternal
interventions through the PEC, which counts on a high degree of societal ownership,
helped assure political commitment. An environmental assessment was carried out
during Project preparation to comply with existing local environmental regulations
pertaining to the disposal of hospital solid waste. In addition, a Social Assessment was
carried out by the MOH with technical assistance from the Bank to understand: (i) the
practices and cultural values that women develop during the different stages of
pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum, (ii) health practices at home and infant nutrition,
and (iii) factors that are obstacles and/or facilitate access to health services for the
maternal and infant population.

19.       The design was clear, relevant and addressed Guatemala’s most critical
health issues. Significant analysis was undertaken to identify the main issues faced by
the health sector, as well as the behavior and challenges faced by the intended
beneficiaries in health care access and quality. Despite the range of implementation
issues facing the health system, the Project tackled those which: (a) were most critical in
improving the population’s health profile; (b) had the potential to have the greatest
impact on improving health service access and the health status of the rural poor; and (c)
addressed essential governance and management issues. Malnutrition during the critical
years of fetal and young child development not only results in infant and maternal
mortality, but also produces life-long consequences, including decreased likelihood of
finishing school and reduced economic productivity later in life. Further, it is
increasingly recognized that constrained growth early in life is linked to a higher risk of
being overweight or obese later in life when food availability is not constrained.7 These

individual negative consequences are amplified at the national level due to a loss in GDP
and increased health costs.

20.      The Project addressed three of the eight key MDGs: eradication of extreme
poverty and hunger, reduction in child mortality, and improvement in maternal
health. For the past fifteen years, the international development and aid communities
have used a prescription of eight ‘Millennium Development Goals’ as a benchmark for
development policy, practice, and success. The Project was key in focusing attention on
these goals in Guatemala, and in striving to attain the designated targets.

21.      Project design incorporated lessons learned from other operations and
international experience. The most relevant ones were:

         The lack of health infrastructure is a significant barrier to health service demand.
          Women in rural areas often have to walk long distances to reach the nearest
          facility and as a result often seek care from more accessible, though often less
          trained providers. In addition to upgrading existing health centers, links to
          Maternal Homes (Hogares Maternos) support access to safe deliveries for women
          living in isolated areas and strengthen the referral process.
         Community-based approaches enhance inclusion of the indigenous communities
          in health service provision and promote health service demand.


8 Chronic malnutrition is measured as low height for age, while global malnutrition is measured by low
weight for age.
9 The infant mortality ratio is defined as infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
10 The maternal mortality ratio is defined as the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the
number of live births.


                                                                7
      Focusing on culturally accepted interventions helps leverage cultural and social
       values of the rural indigenous communities. Investment in culturally appropriate
       and supervised health centers can increase demand for health center births.

22.       Despite solid inputs to Project preparation, some design aspects were
ambitious given that this was the first Project executed through the MOH. As the
first Bank-financed health sector Project in Guatemala, time had to be invested by both
sides in learning the rules and regulations governing the technical, financial and
administrative functions of each and in coordinating amongst them. While the design
was technically sound and based on global and country-specific knowledge, improving
maternal and infant health and reducing chronic malnutrition involve a complex host of
factors.   A less ambitious design, with reduced objectives could have eased
implementation and the achievement of outcomes. Further, in retrospect the focus on the
same jurisdictions for Component 1 and 2 could have simplified Project implementation
and evaluation.

23.       A number of risks included in the risk matrix did materialize during
project implementation. In particular, the lack of political and social sustainability
through changes in administration, delayed start of implementation, delayed M&E due to
dependence on the development of a broader M&E framework and a lack of financial
sustainability all negatively impacted Project implementation. Though these risks were
identified, the weight given to them and mitigation measures suggested were not
necessarily sufficient. More innovative mitigation measures were needed to confront
risks related to a delayed implementation, a steep uphill learning curve exacerbated by
frequent staff turnover and the existing administrative and financial complexities of
operating within the MOH.

2.2 Implementation

24.        Project implementation suffered a number of setbacks, delaying the
Project start date, compressing the original implementation period and slowing
Project execution. The Project was approved on January 19, 2006, signed on May 18
2007, became effective on June 26, 2007, and began implementation in mid-2008. The
first disbursement only occurred on May 12, 2008. Initial delays stemmed from
difficulties obtaining Project approval by the Guatemalan Congress, the transition in
Government, the fact that this was the first World Bank-financed project in the health
sector and frequent Government staff turnover.

25.       Challenges continued throughout Project implementation. Frequent
turnover in Project staff and Government counterparties reduced Project ownership,
hampered the development of working relationships, and exacerbated existing
administrative and financial hurdles. Even at the local level, community educators
exhibited a turnover rate of over 50 percent impacting Project links with the communities
and local community mother counselors. Turnover in the MOH legal and administrative
teams exacerbated contract delays and payment approvals (in particular for civil works)
because the new teams needed time to familiarize themselves with the Project and
external funding norms and procedures and often instituted changes in administrative and

                                           8
financial requirements, while legal consequences attached to contract signing increased
staff reluctance to sign documents. Furthermore, changes in the Ministry of Finance’s
(MOF) budgeting system in January 2013 delayed the release of downstream funds,
further slowing contract signing. All the senior Project Technical Coordination staff
resigned in the final year of the Project because of increased budget and administrative
challenges.

26.       Despite significant difficulties, the Project executed nearly US$50 million
and achieved concrete and important results. The Project achieved most of its
indicators. In particular, the reduction in maternal mortality, which remains a priority at
the national level (see Table 2), displayed significant improvement in the Project areas.
This is of particular consequence since infant and maternal mortality, much like
malnutrition is concentrated in the areas of Project intervention, weighing heavily on the
national averages. The Project was also successful in strengthening community-based
programs providing basic health and nutrition services, which have proved to be very
effective in reaching the extreme poor.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

27.       The M & E system measured Project indicators through local agencies and
the Nutrition Survey and included the development of a management information
system to track the Project’s progress during implementation. In addition, the
coordination of the baseline and final evaluations measuring Project impact in reducing
chronic malnutrition provided useful information on the policies implemented and on the
nutritional status of the population in the targeted areas. Further, through the
strengthening of the M&E system at the local level, the Project strove to influence and
promote the sustainability of good health practices. Though there was limited progress in
the integration of the Project M&E system into a broader health and nutrition or national
system, the Project supported a number of interesting local initiatives. For example, the
Project implemented a monitoring system for the use of communication materials (such
as educational videos) with positive results. Health personnel were monitored in their use
and management of communication material in order to identify health service
communication and provision problems.

28.       The M&E system design was ambitious, while health data was not used
sufficiently as a management tool or to inform decision-making. The design was
ambitious given the difficulties in obtaining data and weaknesses in Guatemala’s
Information Management System in Health (Sistema de Información Gerencial de Salud
--SIGSA). Frequent staff turnover at SIGSA hindered coordination with the MOH and
Project staff, while technology changes, infrequent data updates and quality issues
hindered data use. In addition, the M&E framework was ambitious in the establishment
of some of the indicators, for which data was difficult to collect and had to be inferred




                                            9
through available information. 11 Reporting on the Project was largely ad hoc and in
response to Bank requests. There was limited progress in the integration of the Project
M&E system into a broader health and nutrition or national system. The Bank and
Project teams tried to introduce changes in SIGSA, but changes in the organization’s
management made it difficult to move forward. Further, as the key measurement of the
Project’s impact on malnutrition, the nutrition survey suffered significant delays due to
difficulties in awarding the contract. (see Annex 2)

29.       Due to difficulties with the national M&E system, the Project refocused its
strategy and strengthened the community and facility level monitoring systems.
Bolstering the community’s involvement and knowledge of infant and maternal health
and nutrition not only supported the generation of more reliable base level data, but also
reinforced the messages promoted by the Project regarding health and nutrition. The
monitoring process, known as “auto-analysis”, had health teams, including the
community nutrition educator, review and analyze key health and nutrition indicators of
services provided to children aged 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. The results were
discussed with community members, especially caregivers and community leaders so that
they could understand how children were growing and what actions should be taken. The
system expanded from 52 pilot jurisdictions in 2009 to 150 rural jurisdictions in 2012,
and prompted the development of a self-evaluation pilot system using simple indicators
to measure the quality of health services focusing on maternal, neonatal, and perinatal
indicators in health facilities.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

30.       The Environmental Safeguard was triggered as a result of the
implementation of Component 1 and the associated increase in the production of
health care waste. The Government had an adequate regulatory framework pertaining to
the disposal of hospital solid waste although the MOH’s control capacity required
strengthening. The MOH designed a hospital solid waste disposal plan for the Maternal
and Infant Integral Health Care Centers (Centros de Atención Integral Materno Infantil --
CAIMIs) that included the recommendations made during the Project’s environmental
assessment. At the closing of the Project, 90 percent of the rehabilitated health facilities
had solid waste management plans, while the Project had financed the construction of
eleven water treatment plants and containers for the safe disposal of health waste. The
Project also built eleven placenta and medical sharp disposal facilities, three retention
walls, five septic tanks, and three absorption wells. Six additional wastewater treatment
plants were planned but never completed. This is the reason for the Moderately
Satisfactory rating in the last Project ISR.




11 For example the lack of distinction between indigenous and non-indigenous women in vital statistics
records required staff to use localities where more than 80 percent of inhabitants were indigenous as a
proxy to construct the maternal mortality indicator, while data for the infant mortality indicator was
available but with very significant lags.


                                                  10
31.       The Indigenous People Safeguard was triggered since the Project focused
mainly on indigenous people. An Indigenous People’s Plan, prepared and implemented
throughout the life of the Project, focused on the problems within these communities,
with the goal of diminishing the disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous
populations, between rural and urban areas, promoted acceptable intercultural practices
and removed barriers to health and nutrition. The reduction in the maternal mortality
ratio in Project areas is a significant achievement since it means that fewer indigenous
women have died in childbirth per year. The Project was successful in reaching
indigenous communities by developing a multicultural communication strategy, which
included culturally sensitive messages and interventions in eight different languages.

32.       Financial Management (FM) arrangements in terms of accounting,
budgeting, fund flow, internal control, external audit and financial reporting were
performed Moderately Satisfactorily in accordance with the last ISR. Shortcomings
existed but did not prevent the managing and monitoring of information required for
Project implementation. The management of administrative processes, such as payments,
budget requests and budget allocation, by the MOH challenged the definition of roles and
responsibilities between the Bank and the Government, generated some obstacles, slowed
disbursements and resulted in the establishment of a FM Action Plan.

33.       Following a number of FM issues at the onset, the segregation of functions,
including management of the loan disbursement processes, provision of
implementation support and oversight improved FM. Project disbursement
arrangements functioned satisfactorily, with withdrawal applications generally submitted
on time using the reimbursement disbursement method, and containing accurate
information. However, the Project had difficulties reclaiming funds, which were not used
by the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and reimbursed and deposited in the
Ministry of Finance Treasury. External audit reports prepared throughout the life of the
Project were issued with a qualified opinion, but qualification was mostly related to NGO
and local administration fund regulations, which produced delays and bottlenecks on
capitation disbursements and follow-up. Audit reports and interim unaudited financial
reports were reviewed and considered acceptable by the Bank.

34.       Procurement arrangements were performed Moderately Satisfactory in
accordance with the last ISR. MOH's internal procedures caused some delays in final
award requests, contract signing and payments. To ensure timely and adequate Project
implementation, all major activities were outlined in the corresponding Annual Operating
Plans (Plan Operativo Anual -- POAs) and in a Procurement Plan. All the Procurement
Plans agreed with the Bank are available in the Procurement Plan Execution System
(Sistema de Ejecución de Planes de Adquisiciones -- SEPA). The implementing agency
worked proactively with the Bank team through video conferences and frequent
supervision missions to gain a better understanding of the Bank's procurement guidelines.
Both the Bank and the Government teams were responsive in dealing with the
procurement processes in a timely manner but in some cases, internal procedures caused
delays to final award and contract signing and implementation.



                                           11
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.       The current administration continues to prioritize maternal and infant
health and nutrition. The Government and representatives of all sectors in the country
signed the Zero Hunger Pact in February 2012, maintaining malnutrition reduction as a
basic priority in Guatemala. The Plan seeks to reduce the incidence of malnutrition in
children under the age of five by supporting a comprehensive package of interventions
crucial to tackle food security and nutrition in the window of the first 1000 days of a
child’s life (pregnancy and the first two years of life). The Plan follows a holistic
approach, incorporating many elements found in the Bank-financed Project, such as the
provision of basic health services, promotion of proper nutrition, hygiene and
breastfeeding; complimentary feeding and supplementation with micronutrients, and a
focus on the population most vulnerable to food insecurity. The Government also
assumed responsibility for continuing AINM-C activities in almost all of the jurisdictions
supported by the Project by financing community educators who served as important
links between health staff and communities, and incorporating health personnel of the
Health Care Centers (Centros de Atención Permanente -- CAPS) and CAIMIS.

36.      The Bank has remained engaged in the health sector. In FY13, the Bank
implemented a non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) supporting Hambre Zero and
has an NLTA in the works supporting the Government’s health system strengthening
efforts.

37.       The Inter-American Development Bank’s (IDB) Iniciativa de Salud
Mesoamericana 2015 project includes a similar PDO as the Bank-financed Maternal
and Infant Health and Nutrition Project. The Project seeks to improve maternal,
reproductive and neonatal health, strengthen the access to and quality of services, while
contributing to the achievement of the MDGs, in particular maternal health, which
remains significantly far off from its 2015 target. A number of the interventions applied
follow closely those of the Bank-financed Project, such as: coverage expansion of
preventive maternal and infant health services through mobile medical teams, coverage
expansion of the AINM-C strategy, and the implementation of maternal homes as a
strategy to promote institutional births. A number of the PCU staff is currently working
on the IDB Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

38.        Project objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant. The
objectives of the Project are fully relevant to the country’s social and economic profile, as
well as timely and appropriate to the current needs of Guatemala. Health equity gaps,
just as in the distribution of wealth and income, reflect large inequities in the country that
characterize the low income, indigenous and rural populations. Inadequate malnutrition
and the lack of health care access during pregnancy, birth and during the first years of life

                                             12
can impact children’s cognitive development and opportunities in life. Interventions
early in the development of an individual are more cost effective and successful than
interventions later in life. This is particularly the case with malnutrition, as the age of
higher nutritional vulnerability is between the 6th and 24th month, the period when
complementary feeding begins. From this age on, there is an increase in nutritional needs
that cannot be met by exclusive breastfeeding, and until 24 months of age it is the period
where malnutrition becomes a chronic disease with long-term effects on learning capacity
and productivity. After 24 months of age, reducing malnutrition is very difficult.

39.       Project objectives support three key MDGs and are tightly intertwined
with the Bank’s goals to reduce extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.
Access to basic opportunities such as health and nutrition are crucial to promote shared
prosperity. The effort expended today by the Government in reducing opportunity
inequality will lead to less outcome inequality in the future. The FY13-16 CPS (Report
#69229) is aligned with the Government’s priorities and supports the strengthening of
public policy for social development and the promotion of inclusive and sustainable
economic growth.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

40.       The Project had five Project Development Indicators (PDI) and 13
intermediate results indicators. Three of the five PDIs and nine of the 13 intermediate
indicators were fully achieved (Annex 2). One PDI and the remaining four intermediate
indicators were partially achieved. Only one PDI did not make any progress.

Improving Maternal and Infant Health

41.        The Project made a significant contribution to improving maternal and
infant health, and reducing maternal mortality in the areas of intervention, with
achievement of two out of three PDIs. Improvement in the quality and supply and
demand of maternal and infant health was measured by changes in infant and maternal
mortality ratios (PDI 1 and 2), percentage of institutional deliveries (PDI 3), number of
secondary level services (indicators 6 and 7) and percentage of women with at least one
prenatal care and post-natal care (indicators 8 and 9). The policies implemented in
Component 1 were particularly successful in addressing the primary causes of maternal
mortality (safe deliveries). The Project strengthened health care access and service
quality through the rehabilitation of 35 secondary level health centers, establishment of
maternal homes in rural areas and through the expansion of the PEC platform. The PEC
initiative expanded health service through the contracting of NGOs, which formed health
teams that offered basic health packages to rural and isolated communities. As part of the
PEC, the AINM-C strategy expanded maternal and infant health coverage, focusing on
infant growth promotion and the counseling of mothers.

42.      Although Guatemala has made important progress in reducing infant
mortality nationally, the reduction in the ratio of indigenous/non-indigenous infant
mortality ratio in Project areas was not achieved (PDI 1). As discussed above,

                                            13
Guatemala has achieved MDG targets for reducing infant mortality at the national level
(see Table 2). Nonetheless, there has been relatively less measured progress in reducing
the ratio of indigenous/non-indigenous infant mortality. In fact, between 2007 and 2009,
the ratio increased (from 1.2 to 1.3) but subsequently decreased to 1.22 in 2010. Delays
in releasing data by SIGSA mean that the latest available data is from 2010, leaving
limited time to evaluate the impact of Project policies. However, this indicator may have
been affected by improved registration of indigenous infant deaths.

43.        In contrast, the Project was successful in reducing the ratio of
indigenous/non-indigenous maternal mortality ratio in the intervention areas,
surpassing the target for PDI 2. Specifically, the ratio fell 60 percent with respect to
the baseline, from 3.2 in June 2006 to 1.24 in December 2012. 12 The reduction in
mortality was likely associated with the over 90 percent increase, from 22.3 percent to 42
percent, in the percentage of institutional births (PDI 3).13 An increase in secondary level
services and emphasis on cultural norms in terms of the infrastructure available in the
birthing centers and rules allowing the local midwives to accompany mothers likely
facilitated a shift toward institutional deliveries. Interestingly, results from PDI 1 and 2
run counter to national trends, where infant mortality has achieved the MDG 2015 goal,
while maternal mortality remains far from reaching the 2015 target (Table 2 above).

Reducing Child Malnutrition

44.       The Project made some progress in reducing chronic malnutrition among
children younger than two years of age in the rural areas of the 70 targeted
municipalities (PDI 4 and 5). Chronic malnutrition was measured by changes in the
percentage of children under two with weight for age <-2Z (PDI 4) and the percentage of
children under two with height for age <-2Z (PDI5), as well as the percentage of families
attended by Creciendo Bien (indicator 13), and people with access to a basic package of
health, nutrition or reproductive health services (indicator 15). Both PDI monitored and
evaluated through the nutrition survey, measure children between the ages of 21 and 26
months. Other indicators, which were not part of the results monitoring framework but
that delve more specifically into malnutrition in Guatemala are included in Annex 2.

45.        The target for PDI 4, the percentage of children under two with weight for
age <-2Z, was partially achieved. Low weight for age measures global malnutrition and
is one of the MDG indicators. The ratio increased from 21.9 percent to 22.4 percent for
the 2008 cohort and decreased from 27.4 percent to 22.6 percent for the 2009 cohort,
between the baseline and the final survey respectively. The aggregate ratio for both
cohorts decreased from 24.7 percent to 22.5 percent. Though global malnutrition did not
fall sufficiently in the Project areas, the prevalence of low weight for age has decreased



12 Using data from the National Center of Epidemiology. The most recently available comparable
information from SIGSA had a ratio of 1.44 for 2011.
13 This remains slightly under the national average of 51.5 percent (2009).


                                                 14
significantly nationally (currently 13 percent) in Guatemala and is close to reaching the
MDG target.14

46.       PDI 5, the percentage of children under two with height for age <-2Z, for
children between 21 and 26 months was achieved. The target was achieved both in the
case of the original and formally revised target values. Chronic malnutrition in children
age two (21 to 26 months) decreased by 13 percentage points, from 73.3 percent to 60.2
percent, in the areas targeted between the baseline and the final survey.15 If the indicator
is disaggregated, chronic malnutrition fell from 68.2 percent to 54.8 percent for the 2008
cohort and 78.3 percent to 65.4 percent for the 2009 cohort. Supporting causality,
chronic malnutrition prevalence did not change in the control group. However chronic
malnutrition in the targeted areas remains above what is found at the national level, 52.3
percent and 55.4 percent in children 12 to 23 months and 24 and 25 to 35 months,
respectively.16

47.       The PDO rating was downgraded from Moderately Satisfactory to
Moderately Unsatisfactory in the last Implementation Status and Results (ISR)
report due to pending measurement of some PDO indicators. The status of the two
PDIs relating to weight and height for age for children under two was not available as the
results of the final nutrition survey had not yet been presented. The May 2013 ISR
specifically stated that the rating would be revisited once the two indicators were
available. These data have since become available and were analyzed for this ICR. A
summary of project indicators at Project closing is shown in Table 3.

3.3 Efficiency

48.       The Project made substantial contributions in terms of improving equity
and targeting health resources to the neediest populations. Since malnutrition is
concentrated in the poorest and more vulnerable population segments, reorienting
resources toward them improves equity.           Benefit incidence analysis from the
Commitment to Equity Project has shown that public spending on health is relatively
regressive in Guatemala; therefore targeting more resources to the poor, indigenous and
rural populations under the Project improves equity. 17 It also helps focus health and
nutrition interventions on those populations who need it the most.




14 See annex 2 for additional explanation regarding the fall in the percent of children with low height but
not weight for age.
15 Chronic malnutrition is defined as low stature (or stunting) for a certain age.
16 According to data from the Encuesta Nacional de Salud Materno Infantil 2002 and 2008-2009,chronic
malnutrition decreases between .85 and 1.06 percentage points a year without interventions.

49.       Moreover, Project costs for reaching the indicated objectives were lower
than alternative approaches.18 Furthermore, the Project promoted the efficient use of
limited resources in addressing the needs of the Guatemalan poor and indigenous
communities. The budget for Component one (US$22.8 million) provided maternal and
infant health services to more than 1.26 million inhabitants, while the US$21.9 million
earmarked for Component 2 benefitted over a million people. Approximately two percent
of the total project amount was set aside for management costs.

50.       Preventive, mainly community-based, actions to improve maternal and
infant health and reduce chronic malnutrition are cost-effective strategies in
Guatemala. An ex-ante economic evaluation (IDB 2008) of a Project carried out in
Guatemala with similar components revealed that the benefit cost ratio of the AINM-C
strategy was 2.35, and of interventions related to the promotion of institutional births
1.81.19 Furthermore, the establishment of maternal homes is of particular importance, as a
tool to reduce obstacles to health service access. The institutionalization of births and the
promotion of maternal and infant health through the expansion of mobile health teams
focused on the treatment and referral of obstetric emergencies and neonatal complications
have a benefit cost ratio of 3.15, largely due to the reduction in maternal and infant
mortality.20 Furthermore, in terms of nutrition in Guatemala, according to the 2012 World
Bank Global Monitoring Report: “A one standard deviation increase in height for age
lifted men’s hourly wage by 20 percent, increased women’s likelihood of operating their
own business by 10 percentage points, and raised the per capita consumption of
households where the participants lived by nearly 20 percent.”21 	

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

51.       The overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory. This composite is
based on the following considerations: (i) the Project was consistent with Government
and global priorities; (ii) as evident from follow on activities, Project objectives, design
and implementation remain highly relevant to the Guatemalan country context; (iii) the
Project largely accomplished its planned outcomes; (iv) the Project’s level of efficiency
was Substantial (see above); and (v) the Project had a significant impact on the health
profile of rural and indigenous women and children, the improvement of health service
quality and systems, and the institutionalization of health norms and regulations. The
Projects contribution to the establishment of rules, regulations and manuals, the



18 Economic analysis at the appraisal stage and international evidence shows that nutrition education and
micronutrient supplementation programs are among the most cost effective ways of preventing malnutrition.

of Sololá, San Marcos, Quiché, Huehuetenango and AltaVerapaz.

innovative communication strategy and the strengthening of the M&E system at the
community level all serve to bolster the rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.      The Project focused on improvements and the expansion of access to health
care in rural areas where the concentration of poverty is high and malnutrition and
infant/maternal death disproportionally concentrated in the indigenous population.
The Project not only expanded the supply of health care through the increase in health
centers, but also contributed to the efficiency and quality of service provision
improvements. Any behavioral change that engenders a positive impact on nutrition
could over the longer term have exponentially positive social development and poverty
impacts for rural and indigenous children due to the virtuous cycle of proper nutrition.

53.       The emphasis on culturally sensitive communication and health practices
supported the demand for health care services. The Project took into account cultural
norms to incorporate certain traditions into the institutional birth setting. In coordination
with the National Program for Traditional and Alternative Medicine, the Project
incorporated various cultural practices within the provision of second level health
services, which combined with communication in a number of local languages promoted
the demand for institutional health services. In particular, the support (by health
personnel and appropriate infrastructure) of squatting births, post birth traditional and
cleansing temascal (sweatlodge) rituals and the active incorporation of midwives (or
comadronas) in the birth process, all helped convince women and traditional midwives to
support birthing in the health centers. Since over half of maternal deaths occur within the
household, the ability to refer, transfer and treat women within an institutional setting
when there are signs of danger can go a long way toward reducing maternal mortality.22
The fact that the educators spoke the local languages eased communication and trust in
the health system.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

54.        The Project was a catalyst for long-term capacity and institutional
development of the MOH in Guatemala. As the first Project to be implemented
through the MOH, it set the stage for future development assistance in Guatemala,
supported the development and strengthening of institutional functions and provided
exposure to best practices. The Project also contributed to the establishment of manuals
on health norms and regulations, which serve to standardize and institutionalize best
practices.

55.       The Project’s multicultural communication strategy was so successful it is
being adopted by other projects in the country. The strategy generated culturally
sensitive messages and interventions in eight different languages, which are being used in
the Government’s flagship Zero Hunger Program and by different international
organizations. It also established a Communications Resource Bank available to all local
agencies working on maternal-child health issues.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

56.       The risk to the development outcome at the time of the ICR is considered
Substantial, though mitigated by the priority the Government and international
institutions have placed on reducing health equity gaps, infant and maternal
mortality and malnutrition prevalence in Guatemala. The new administration’s focus
on interventions in the first 1000 days of life within the framework of the Zero Hunger
Plan for children in vulnerable areas reflects commitment to maternal and infant health
and nutrition. Furthermore, the Government continues to strive to reach the MDG 2015
targets, and seek support from the Bank, the IDB and other international organizations.
Below are the main risk to development outcomes:

   The high vulnerability of Guatemala to global shocks and natural disasters poses
    a major risk to the country and the poor. Rising international food prices impact
    the poor the hardest, while natural disasters often require the diversion of funds to
    support emergency efforts, which disproportionally affect the poor and the vulnerable.
   Competing priorities for scarce financial resources are a risk to sustainability of
    Project outcomes. Guatemala has one of the lowest tax revenues in the region at
    approximately 11 percent of GDP, though forecast to rise to 12 percent in 2013/2014.
    The low level of revenue mobilization constrains the ability of the state to steer
    development and social policy, while low health spending (one percent of GDP),
    limits what the Government can accomplish in the health sector.
   Guatemala has a difficult implementation environment. Frequent gridlock
    between the executive, legislative branch and major stakeholders in the country
    (private sector, unions, NGO’s, the military, etc.) challenge policy decisions and
    execution in the country. Frequent changes in administration and policy priorities
    hinder the ability to sustain and institutionalize policies over time and increase the
    possibility that not well-entrenched gains are reversed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.       Bank performance on ensuring Quality of Entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The Project design built on the findings of earlier sector work, a robust
participatory process and the use of lessons learned. The Project objectives were relevant
and firmly supported Government and global priorities. However, there were gaps in
ensuring the readiness of the Government for a multi-component health sector Project, in
successfully mitigating the risks involved in working with the Government and the
national health information system, and in setting up the M&E framework. Less
ambitious targets and a more innovative approach toward Project effectiveness and
implementation might have facilitated Project progress.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

58.       The Project benefited from a steady and committed Bank team, which
successfully identified and resolved Project obstacles. The same task team leader
(TTL) was in charge of the design and the first four years of the Project life. Both the
initial and subsequent TTLs worked closely with Project counterparts, engaged in 19
supervision missions, numerous technical missions, constant video and audio interaction
and prepared informative Aide Memoires. Bank staff proactively identified and resolved
obstacles, which supported implementation and advancement toward the PDO. The
team’s strategy of holding shorter but more frequent missions, as well as a focus on short-
term achievements provided easier implementation objectives. Agreeing on specific
short-term action plans with the client, setting specific goals and deadlines proved crucial
in keeping Project momentum. Throughout the whole implementation period, the Project
benefited from the support of safeguard specialists.

59.       Despite Bank staff advice, Project indicators were not adjusted until the
last year of the Project because the Government believed a change in the indicators
would be interpreted as a lack of political commitment to its main policy priorities and
due to the MOH’s decision to motivate stakeholders to strive hard to attain the original
targets. The MOH was finally persuaded of the importance of setting realistic targets
based on in-country discussions in 2012, while taking into account the prevailing country
context for the Government’s flagship initiative, the Zero Hunger Program, and the
results-based management agreement signed between the Ministries of Health and
Finance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                            20
60.     For the reasons indicated above, the Overall Bank Performance is rated though
Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.       Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to the high
level of political support given to the Project. The Project spanned three
administrations, which remained committed to Project objectives. However, frequent
changes in Government staff, both due to administration changes and general turnover,
bureaucratic process and financing delays during the life of the Project contributed to a
challenging implementation environment. Changes in the MOF budgeting system
delayed the release of funds to the MOH, slowing contract signing, while MOF spending
ceilings due to budget issues contributed to delays in contracting and payments. The
Government’s post Project closing transition arrangements are adequate. The
Government has assumed responsibility for continuing AINM-C activities in almost all of
the jurisdictions supported by the Project, through the financing of community educators
in most of the AINM-C communities supported by the Project, as well as the mobile
health teams offering AINM-C.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.       The rating for the MOH is similar to that of the general Government since
similar issues apply. The performance of the PCU was satisfactory for the most part,
but affected by Government administrative procedures. The PCU was committed and
resourceful in finding ways to advance project activities within its control despite
changes and delays in Government administrative procedures and successful in
strengthening the community and facility level monitoring systems. Short-term contracts
for health staff and delayed payments led to high rotation, while the lack of a civil service
career ladder hindered the advancement of Project management capacities within the
MOH.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     For reasons outlined above, the overall Borrower Performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

64.       Projects seeking a shift in behavior require a longer time span.
Malnutrition in Guatemala is the result of a number of factors, some of them culturally
embedded. Successful changes in behavior require a longer implementation period in



                                             21
order to make a lasting impact and may require a longer support period so as to become
more institutionalized.

65.       Baseline evaluations should be conducted earlier in the Project cycle.
Baseline surveys should be implemented before a Project is underway, so that baseline
data is not tainted by Project activities, and administration systems designed with M&E
in mind. The baseline survey was carried out in 2010-2011, two years after the start of
project activities. Further, though not impacted systematically by the AINM-C actions,
the control group was likely exposed to promotion activities and mother-infant
Government programs.23

66.        Project impact may have been diluted by the overexpansion in
jurisdictions. The first year of Project implementation was spent hiring staff and
establishing and adjusting Project design, reducing the implementation period in certain
jurisdictions. Originally the Project design had coverage expanding to 90 jurisdictions
but as the start date was postponed by two years, the Project expanded to over 140
jurisdictions. As a result, in some jurisdictions the Project was only implemented for two
years, reducing the ability to support a behavioral change in the target population.

67.       Results-based performance linked to financial incentives framework for
NGOs could have improved outcomes. Services under the Project for the AINM-C
strategy were provided by NGOs contracted by the MOH for the PEC. Quality standards
defined for NGO performance and achievement were modest, while limited Government
supervision allowed NGO’s to stray from Project goals. Instead of focusing on the very
rural and hard to reach communities, NGOs would often focus on the easier access
communities within their jurisdictions.

68.       Projects with weak counterpart administrative capacity require innovative
approaches to supervision and strong stakeholder commitment. The team’s strategy
of holding shorter but more frequent missions, as well as a focus on shorter terms
achievements provided easier implementation objectives. Agreeing on specific short-term
action plans with the client, setting specific goals and deadlines was crucial in keeping
Project momentum. Constant interaction with the client through video and audio
conferences, frequent missions, and the use of consultants with experience in
implementing similar Projects also helped with implementation.

69.       Contracting international consultants in countries with weak in-house
capacity can ease implementation. Difficulties in awarding some of the contracts with
higher earmarked resources, such as the baseline survey, were hindered by bureaucratic
rules. Large technically specific contracts would likely be easier to manage if awarded
internationally. The IDB Iniciativa de Salud Mesoamericana 2015 Project, similar in
objective and scope to the Bank-financed Project, recently awarded their M&E survey
component externally.

70.       As the CPS suggests, international organizations should work together and
explore alternative opportunities to address implementation constraints through
better Project design and training of technical counterparts. Since Projects in
Guatemala are plagued by similar issues, staff should explore innovative approaches to
prevent implementation delays. The lack of institutional and operational capacity in
Guatemala makes training in Bank procedures and frequent interaction with Project staff
a priority. Likewise, priority should be placed on the strengthening of administrative and
legal norms. Better data on institutional bottlenecks would help protect Project design,
while regular mini portfolio reviews to identify capacity constraints and provide technical
assistance to address issues proved helpful.

71.       The ability of communities as a whole to systematically monitor the growth
of their young children and detect growth faltering signs should be strengthened.
The Project focused on educating and involving the whole community on maternal and
infant health in order to more successfully transmit messages and promote behavioral
change. In addition, health staff (doctors, auxiliary nurses, community facilitators,
community educators, technical coordinators of NGOs of health and nutrition services)
who work in these communities should be trained so they can appreciate their respective
roles and contributions in improving nutrition and health service quality and efficiently
support the communities in growth monitoring.

72.       Communication strategies should take into account the multi-cultural and
multi-ethnic nature of country’s like Guatemala. Training and engaging communities
in their cultural and linguistic context can achieve better knowledge transfer. The Project
translated communication materials into eight local languages.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.       Three of the five key PDO indicators were achieved, nine of the 13 intermediate
indicators were achieved, with the remaining five nearly achieved. As intermediate
objectives, the Project fostered the demand for health and nutrition services as a
complement to improving the quality and provision of beneficiary health and nutrition
services. Despite significant issues with implementation delays, the Project utilized
nearly the totality of the loan. As of Project closing, the Project had disbursed US$48.49
million, which represents 99 percent of the loan. Nevertheless, the final disbursement
amount at the date of this ICR is US 47.6 million, which represents approximately 97
percent of the loan.

Component 1: Strengthening of the Maternal and Infant Health Network

2.         Component 1 was successful in strengthening Guatemala’s maternal and
infant health network. Despite failing to reach all of its key indicators, the Project
expanded health service access to communities in rural and remote areas, eased referrals
and raised demand for maternal and infant health services. The Project strengthened
health care access and service quality through the rehabilitation of 35 secondary level
health centers, establishment of maternal homes in rural areas and through the expansion
of the PEC platform. Crucial innovations in terms of culturally sensitive interventions,
culturally sensitive training of medical staff and the establishment of a multicultural
communications strategy all established the building blocks necessary to attract
indigenous and rural women to the health centers. The PEC initiative expanded health
service through the contracting of NGOs, which formed health teams that offered basic
health packages to rural and isolated communities. An increase in secondary level
services and emphasis on cultural norms in terms of the infrastructure available in the
birthing centers and rules allowing the local midwives to accompany mothers likely
facilitated a shift toward institutional deliveries. These results run counter to national
trends, where infant mortality has achieved the MDG 2015 goal, while maternal mortality
remains far from reaching the 2015 target.

3.        Component 1 focused on both maternal and infant health promotion and
the strengthening of secondary level care and referral system and creation of
maternal homes. It was more successful in promoting maternal health and addressing
the primary cause of maternal mortality (safe deliveries) and not the major causes of
infant mortality (diarrhea and acute respiratory infections). While neonatal mortality may
have improved (as that would be more closely associated with the rise in institutional
births, and greater prenatal and postnatal controls), infant mortality is the result of a
number of factors affecting children between birth and one year of age. The
interventions needed to reduce infant mortality are generally preventive in nature and
include, among others: proper complementary nutrition, proper hygiene, vaccinations and
intake of micronutrients, and identification of danger signs (in particular for diarrhea and
respiratory illnesses). In addition, the increase in health service access may have
increased the accuracy of the infant mortality indicator (increasing identification) thereby
eliminating any progress on indigenous infant mortality reduction.

                                            25
4.        Despite the lack of progress in the infant mortality ratio, the demand for
infant health services increased as reflected in indicator 10 and 11 (percentage of
children under 2 years of age who participate in the weighting sessions in the areas of
intervention and percentage of children whom change in weight is measured in the areas
of intervention). Though both indicators experienced important increases, they both
remained 2 percent below the formally revised 80 percent target, and 7 percentage points
below the original target value.

5.        The increase in health infrastructure supported the access and quality
improvement of maternal and infant health care in the Project areas. Though the
rehabilitation of 40 centers was originally considered, during Project execution the
number was reduced to 38 CAPs and CAIMIs. The number of secondary services with
cartera ampliada and a fully operation operating room (indicator 6) missed the formally
revised target by two. By Project closing, eight rehabilitated facilities were in operation
in the Project areas. Indicator 7, the number of secondary level services with cartera
ampliada, but without a fully operational operating room achieved the formally revised
target (27). In addition to training health personnel, 237 staff were trained in
infrastructure maintenance for the new rehabilitated centers. The Project also constructed
a number of mitigation facilities such as: (i) eleven waste water treatment plants, (ii)
eleven placenta and medical sharp disposal facilities, (iii) three retention walls, (iv) five
septic tanks, and (v) three absorption wells. All the equipment, including 50 ambulances
was delivered and 99 percent is functional.

6.         The Project trained over 3000 health staff. In parallel with the rehabilitation
of the health centers, Bank-financed training for health personnel (indicator 17) surpassed
its target. Though there was a high rotation of health personnel, Bank-financed training
was an important addition to human capacity building. Working in rural and largely
indigenous areas requires not only cultural sensibilities, but also the ability to trouble
shoot a myriad of obstacles not usually encountered in urban settings. Personnel in these
facilities were provided culturally sensitive training in the care provision and
management, social participation and communication and self-evaluation.                The
establishment of checklists for health staff standardized health service provision. This
was particularly relevant for pregnancy, birth and post-birth progression.

Component 2: Nutrition – Implementation of the Community Integrated Care for
Children and Women (AINM-C) and "Creciendo Bien" Nutrition Strategies.

7.        Component 2 focused on strengthening community health and nutrition
programs through the PEC. PEC is a community based intervention that provides
basic health services, largely through NGO’s, to the poorest and dispersed populations,
which do not have access to health services. As part of the PEC, the AINM-C strategy
expanded maternal and infant health coverage, focusing on infant growth promotion and
the counseling of mothers. Ninety health service agreements with NGOs were
implemented to provide a package of health and nutrition services in targeted areas. In
parallel to strengthening the provision of health services, the Project implemented a

                                             26
systemic communication and behavioral change intervention and strove to create a more
holistic link between health care service and health care objectives. The Project worked
not only with mothers, but communities as a whole. Behavioral change through the
expansion in health coverage mechanisms was largely aimed at improving behaviors
impacting nutrition.

8.       This component made notable gains in providing training and counseling
to mothers, community field technicians, health community workers and basic
health teams. A number of activities promoted basic health and nutrition, such as:

    a.   Nutrition counselors organized and trained mothers on breastfeeding,
         complementary feeding, family nutrition, basic health and basic hygiene. In
         addition to increasing the skills of women in the maternal homes and traditional
         birth attendants (women), the establishment of support groups allowed women
         to express themselves and discuss issues affecting their lives.
    b.   Monthly growth promotion sessions (growth monitoring and individual
         assessments) for children under two and pregnant women. Counselors would
         evaluate the children’s weight and assess mothers on different health related
         topics.
    c.   Household visits to sick children or those which were not growing adequately,
         pregnant women and those that recently gave birth.
    d.   Referral of mothers and children to health centers for immunizations, prenatal
         checks, severe malnutrition and sicknesses.
    e.   Monthly meetings between local health personnel and mother counselors.
    f.   Strengthening of community participation through semestral meetings between
         local authorities and the communities to discuss health and nutrition issues. The
         Project promoted the active involvement of communities (making efforts to
         include fathers and midwives) in monitoring and promoting health and nutrition
         activities for women and children.

9.       The target for the number of jurisdictions with AINM-C (indicator 14) and
the indicator for people with access to a basic package of health, nutrition and
reproductive services (indicator 15) were surpassed. Over one million people in the
Project areas in over 150 jurisdictions received access to services crucial to strengthen
maternal and infant health. Though the Creciendo Bien program (indicator 13) was
discontinued, the indicator reached its target.

10.       The improvement in chronic malnutrition but not global malnutrition
could be the result of a number of factors. First, the number of children suffering from
chronic malnutrition (or stunting) in Guatemala is much higher than those suffering from
low weight for age. Therefore the children whose height for age improved may have
been those who already had adequate weight for age. Second, due to the lower
percentage of children with low weight for age, the sample may not have been large
enough to measure a statistically significant change (approximately 1,500). Third, a
number of children in the sample may have been affected by infections at the time of the
final survey, lowering their weight and contributing to the increase in acute malnutrition

                                           27
(since both global and acute malnutrition may reflect occasional weight loss as a result of
recent disease episodes).

11.     Despite an improvement in chronic malnutrition in two year olds, chronic
malnutrition in children under two (0

12.       to 26 months) did not show considerable change between the baseline and
the final survey, while the control group experienced a 12 percentage point rise.
However, the significantly lower number of children under 21 months in the final survey
compared to the baseline survey suggests that the two samples may not be comparable
since the prevalence of chronic malnutrition is much lower in children under 6 months of
age.

13.      Though chronic malnutrition decreased and global malnutrition remained
nearly the same, extreme malnutrition in children between 21 and 26 months
increased. Extreme malnutrition or very low weight has a strong impact on infant
mortality and in the health of children over the long term. At the national level only 1.4
percent of children under 5 experience extreme malnutrition, but in the population
between 12 and 23 months the likelihood increases to 2.8 percent. In the targeted areas
the percent of extreme malnutrition increased by 1.57 percentage points from 1.03 to 2.6
percent. Extreme malnutrition did not increase significantly in the 0 to 26 months cohort.

14.       Anemia levels deteriorated significantly in children between 21 and 26
months. Children with low hemoglobin levels increased by 8.4 percentage points
between the baseline and final surveys. This is likely related to the significant reduction
in iron supplements for children under 2 (15.5 percentage points in the target group and
15.3 percentage points in the control group), from 86 percent to 71 percent for children
between 12 and 24 months. Shortages in certain regions during the MOH’s attempt to
standardize the provision of iron supplements by subsidizing iron tablets, folic acid etc.
with powder micronutrients likely resulted in supply disruptions.

15.       Intermediate indicators in the nutrition survey measuring behavioral
changes reveal an improvement in health and nutrition practices. Exclusive
breastfeeding in children under 6 months increased slightly though not statistically
significantly, from 81 percent to 84.3 percent in the targeted areas and remains much
higher than the national average (49.6 percent).24 The percent of children between 6 and
24 months who received adequate complementary feeding improved significantly, from
36 percent to 52 percent, while in the control group the increase was from 26 to 45
percent. Growth monitoring fell slightly in both the target and control groups however
remains above 85 percent. Improvements in intermediate behavior-related indicators
likely resulted from an increase and improvement in home visits, the establishment of



24 It is important to mention that the size of the final sample is significantly smaller than that of the base
line survey (117 versus 888).


                                                       28
support groups and promotion of nutrition related information and focus on growth
monitoring.

16.       The identification of health dangers, one of the more important skills to
transmit to mothers in areas where children disproportionally suffer from
malnutrition improved. The percent of mothers who identified diarrhea danger signs
(one of the main causes of infant mortality in Guatemala) increased 18 percentage points,
while mothers that identified dangers related to respiratory infections increased by 22
percentage points. The identification of these health danger signs resulted in an increase
in the demand for health services, 25.7 percentage point increase for children with
diarrhea and 33 percent increase for children with respiratory infections. Increases in the
control group were similar to those who were part of the intervened cohorts. However,
the number of mothers adequately feeding and providing liquids to their children with
diarrhea decreased, pinpointing the importance of future work in this area.
                                          Nutrition Survey

   The survey aimed to measure the impact the interventions had on the Project and identify if
   the AINM-C actions produced effective changes in the nutrition situation of the children of
   Guatemala, in particular those two and under living in the most vulnerable communities. To
   measure the impact of the interventions the survey measured two groups of families
   participating in the Project – families that were initially affected by AINM-C interventions in
   2008 and those initially impacted in 2009 - and a control group. Though not impacted
   systematically by the AINM-C actions, the control group was likely exposed to promotion
   activities and mother-infant Government programs.

   The nutrition survey measured a multitude of nutrition indicators, which generally revealed
   an improvement in nutrition knowledge. Though only two indicators (4 and 5) are part of
   the results framework, the evaluation of a number of other indicators measured provides
   important information. However, the comparison of data between the baseline and final
   surveys suffers from a number of weaknesses, including the late start and short evaluation
   timeframe.

   Due to delays, what was originally planned as the half way line became the baseline. The
   initial collection of data took place in two stages, one in October–December 2010 and
   another in January – March 2011, while data for the final nutrition survey was collected in
   March-May 2013. The delay in the original survey compressed the period in which to
   evaluate Project impact. Furthermore, the fact that the children evaluated were not the same
   but from the same communities resulted in a significantly different age distribution (between
   0-26 months) between both surveys.

Component 3: Communication, Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuous Auditing
Systems

17.      The Project was successful in developing a multicultural communication
strategy to promote maternal and child health and nutrition. The strategy supported
the generation of culturally sensitive messages and interventions in eight different
languages. It also established a Communications Resources Bank available to all local
agencies working on maternal-child health issues. The availability of culturally sensitive

                                               29
interventions was essential in the development of a social communication strategy for
municipalities prioritized under the Government’s flagship Zero Hunger Program and the
1000 Days of Life Initiative. The Project’s multicultural communication strategy was so
successful it is being adopted by other Projects and countries, such as the Government’s
flagship Zero Hunger Program, the UNDP and the Nutrition Institute of Central America
and Panama (INCAP).

18.       The Monitoring and Evaluation framework in Guatemala requires
strengthening. The Project was hampered by the difficulties in obtaining data from
SIGSA, the ministry for the management of health information. Frequent staff turnover at
SIGSA hindered the release of information for measuring general health and Project
specific outcomes. Weak coordination between SIGSA and lower level units added to
problems in collecting information. The measuring of Project impact was also affected by
the delay in the baseline survey.

19.        Due to difficulties with the national M&E system, the Project refocused its
strategy and strengthened the community and facility level monitoring systems.
Bolstering the community’s involvement and knowledge of infant and maternal health
and nutrition not only supported the generation of more reliable base level data, but also
reinforced the messages promoted by the Project regarding health and nutrition.
The monitoring process, known as “auto-analysis”, had health teams, including the
community nutrition educator, review and analyze key health and nutrition indicators of
services provided to children aged 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age. The indicators
included growth measurement, micronutrient supplementation, counseling on infant and
young child feeding, immunizations, and follow-up activities. During the assessment, the
indicators were marked as ‘achieved’ or not (based on certain criteria), and a summary of
results yielded the percent compliance by community, jurisdiction, and health area. The
results were discussed with community members, especially caregivers and community
leaders so that they could understand how children were growing and what actions they
could take. The system expanded from 52 pilot jurisdictions in 2009 to 150 rural
jurisdictions in 2012, and prompted the development of a self-evaluation pilot system
using simple indicators to measure the quality of health services focusing on maternal,
neonatal, and perinatal indicators in health facilities.

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening

20.       The Project contributed to the institutional strengthening of various levels
of the health system. Despite many implementation hurdles, as the first international
Project implemented through the MOH, the Project set the course for future Projects.
Incorporating both Government regulations and those required by the Bank (or other
international institutions) takes time and effort. The development of a number of norms
and regulations through the Project did not only help the health sector in Guatemala but
also eased implementation of future Projects. Both the institutionalization of certain
regulations and production of numerous information manuals for a myriad of health
processes are an integral addition to Guatemala’s health sector. Manuals on the
functioning of the rehabilitated health centers, operation and maintenance of

                                           30
infrastructure and hospital waste management, as well as operative guides on a number of
key functions (such as regarding best practices for medical staff clothing for births, health
center sanitary practices, storage practices, infrastructure maintenance, etc.) standardized
and instituted best practices.

21.       The component also provided training on several themes including Food
Security and Nutrition, courses for health personnel, community workers, and other
local stakeholders on promoting exclusive breast-feeding, proper complementary feeding,
and growth monitoring and promotion, providing culturally sensitive health care, and on
using various tools, including E-learning modules developed with the support of the
Project. It also provided technical assistance on primary and secondary level care to the
MOH and on information system management to SESAN.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The analysis presents information from academic external sources with the
purpose of evidencing that nutrition and maternal and infant health interventions in
Guatemala are worthwhile economic investments.

2.        Health care deficiency and malnutrition greatly affect development,
hindering human capital formation and economic productivity and perpetuating
opportunity and income disparities. Improving a population’s health profile can
reduce health costs, while raising education levels and labor market productivity. Ending
chronic malnutrition represents significant economic resource savings. The latest
available estimates for 2004 reveal that chronic malnutrition costs Guatemala
approximately 11.4 percent of GDP, or 185 percent of total social expenditure.25 This
lower bound estimate represents in one year about 64 times the total investment cost of
this Project.

3.        Malnutrition not only generates higher health costs, but also has relevant
consequences for education and labor market productivity. 26 Total health
expenditure (private and public sources) amounts to US$285 million per year, 1.04
percent of annual GDP. In terms of education, malnutrition is associated with higher
repetition rates and a lower internal efficiency of the education system, which results in a
US$16.5 million cost (0.06 percent of annual GDP). 27 Finally, losses in productivity
amount to approximately US$2,826 million or more than 9 percent of annual GDP. 28

27 Malnourished children have a lower probability of being enrolled in primary school, face a higher
probability of repeating one grade or dropping out of school earlier in comparison to children that do not
present this condition .
28 This is measured through losses in years of schooling (and therefore salary losses) of malnourished
people and the working hours lost due to higher mortality rates.

4.         Preventive, mainly community-based, actions to improve maternal and
infant health and reduce chronic malnutrition are very cost effective strategies in
Guatemala. An ex-ante economic evaluation29 of a Project carried out in Guatemala
with similar components revealed the following results: (i) the benefit cost ratio of the
AINM-C strategy30 is US$2.35, that is to say that the benefit is more than twice the cost;
(ii) Micronutrient delivery generates the greatest benefit per dollar spent (benefit-cost
ratio of US$2.9), in particular iron supplements are related to improvements in cognitive
capacity and therefore future productivity gains; (iii) Maternal Homes (Hogares
Maternos) have an estimated cost benefit ratio of US$1.9, this benefit is the result of
increases in institutional births and its implications on maternal/infant mortality rates.
Given the high overlap of the components and the characteristics of the targeted
population between the Project and the described IDB Project, we can infer that the
results were cost effective and undoubtedly contributed to the improvement of the target
population’s health status. Furthermore, the existence of a similar intervention, prepared
after this Project, reveals the need for earmarked resources to improve the critical health
situation in the country.

5.        Empirical evidence shows that a mother’s education is one of the main
determinants of child chronic malnutrition. A studyof seven Latin-American countries
(including Guatemala) and the Dominican Republic showed that after family wealth, the
education of the mother and her partner are the second most important variables that
explain inequalities in infant malnourishment. 31 The estimated effect displays a non-
linear pattern, which means that the effect tends to decrease as education levels rise. In

UNNOFICIAL TRANSLATION SUMMARY

INTRODUCTION

The Maternal-Infant Health and Nutrition Project (IBRD 7357-GU), implemented by the
Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (Ministerio de Salud Pública y Asistencia
Social --MSPAS) and financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), includes the following objectives: improve maternal and infant
health in the Project's 40 areas of intervention, and reduce chronic malnutrition among
children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities targeted by
the Project; as established in the Loan Agreement 7357. The loan was authorized by the
Republic of Guatemala’s Congress Decree No. 22-2007, up to an amount of
$ 49,000,000.00 to be amortized over 17 years, with a 5-year grace period.

BACKGROUND

Despite significant progress in the social sectors during the past decade, Guatemala
human development indicators are lagging behind relative to other countries in the region.
This gap is of particularly concern in areas where expected progress was not continuous
in recent years. The rates of maternal and infant mortality and chronic malnutrition are
among the highest in the world, and much higher than expected considering the per capita
income of Guatemala. 66 percent of Central America malnourished children live in
Guatemala. This, together with the low education rates, is a severe limitation for human
capital accumulation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) in the country. Chronic malnutrition and poor health status of young children
cause irreversible losses in human capital formation, affecting current and future
generations and weakening economic growth. Reducing child malnutrition and maternal
deaths is a national priority with especial attention to reduce inequalities between
indigenous and non-indigenous, because, although there has been some progress in
reducing malnutrition indicators in the country, this has occurred mainly at the expense of
non-indigenous population. As a response to this situation, the Project supported the (i)
Extension of Coverage Program (Programa de Extensión de Cobertura – PEC); (ii)
Maternal and Infant Integral Health Care Centers (Centros de Atención Integral Materno
Infantil – CAIMIs), and (iii) Community Integrated Care for Children and Women
(Atención Integral a la Niñez y Mujer – Comunitario --AINM-C). In addition, it
supported communication systems, monitoring and evaluation and continuous audits that
allow MSPAS’ institutional strengthening.

IMPLEMENTATION

The MSPAS has demonstrated the necessary organizational and administrative capacity
to implement activities and provide basic health services throughout the country. It has
also shown flexibility and innovation to act beyond its institutional structure, and has

                                            39
been one of the pioneers in introducing innovative and cost-effective interventions to
reach, through PEC, remote and very poor areas. The Government has recognized some
weaknesses and the proposed Project included measures to support the MSPAS to
address such weaknesses.

The Project was approved on January 19, 2006 and signed 16 months later on May 18,
2007. Although it was declared effective a few weeks later - on June 26, 2007, the first
disbursement of loan proceeds was not made until nearly two and a half years after the
Project approval (May 12, 2008).

In May 2013, 70 months after Project effectiveness, the financial execution was at 97%.
The results achieved allow identify progress on the intermediate monitoring indicators
and in some cases achievement of impact indicators, meaning decreased equity gaps
mostly in maternal care. It is important to strengthen the processes that will allow the
institutionalization of actions that have proven valuable for the institutional strengthening.

Component 1

This component, in an amount of US$ 22.8 million, was aimed to support the
development of a health services network as part of a referral network of Maternal and
Child Health network. The objectives of this component are:

• Increase demand for services by the population with the worst maternal and child health
indicators (the indigenous population of the selected 70 municipalities);
• Implement a second level for maternal and child services that can meet this demand;
• Articulate these services with the first and third level of care to set up a referral health
care network providing maternal and child services.

Component 2

This component, in an amount of US$21.44 million, had the objective to address the
problem of chronic child malnutrition in 70 selected municipalities by developing
community-based interventions properly linked to the health system, which have proven
being successful in similar social and political contexts. All activities under this
component were included in PEC, which started being implemented in the country in
1997, and is based on public financing of NGOs to provide basic health services in areas
where no regular health services are present. The component focused its actions in
reducing the prevalence of chronic child malnutrition particularly, to indigenous children
population.

The objectives of this component are:

   1- To reduce chronic child malnutrition of kids younger than five years (with an
      emphasis on children under two years) in rural areas of the 70 municipalities.




                                             40
       Goal: Reduction of the chronic child malnutrition in a 15% of the actual
       prevalence in children under two years old, in the areas of intervention, in an
       expected term of five years.

Component 3

This component, with a total amount of US$2, 4 million, developed a communication,
monitoring, evaluation process and the developing of Continuous audit systems. The
linked activities were looking for: (i) provide support to low income families to learn
about nutrition and the health programs, encourage the low income and indigenous
population to utilize health and nutrition services, promote the behavioral change in pro
of the adequate use of services, spread the right of the population to utilize the services
and to foment social audit; (ii) Design and implement a comprehensive monitoring and
evaluating system (M & E) for the interventions of nutrition and health; and (iii) measure
the effect of the Project on the well-being of the goal population. The proposed
objectives were the following:

      Influence and promote the appropriation and sustainability of the activities
       tending to promote the malnutrition in the community level.
      Inform the goal population about the health and nutrition services and incentive
       the use of them;
      Promote social audits of the health and nutrition services;
      Publicize the importance of the preventive nutrition activities and foment the
       proactive work with the communities through the health personnel responsible for
       those services.
      Design and implement a monitoring and evaluating system for the nutrition and
       health interventions;
      Measure the impact of the project in the well-being of the goal population.

Component 4

This component in an amount of US$1.7 million supported the increment of the
institutional capacities of the MSPAS to implement and administrate health and nutrition
basic services. Specially, the project that supported the Project and Program
Coordinating Unit (Unidad Coordinadora de Programas y Proyectos-UCPYP), the
consulting services of the Primary Level Service Provision Unit (Unidad de Provision de
Servicios de Primer Nivel-UPS1), and the Secondary Level Service Provision Unit
(Unidad de Provision de Servicios de Segundo Nivel-UPS2), providing technical
assistance and the equipment. The Project also supported the Secretariat of Food and
Nutritional Security (Secretaria de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricion-SESAN) to
strengthen the management of the information system. The report of this component will
be the object of a particular consulting and that’s why it’s not included in this analysis.




                                            41
PERFORMANCE

For different reasons the project had a complicated start. While the design concluded in
December of 2005 and was approved in January of 2006, it was not until May 2007 when
it was signed by the national authorities, meaning that 18 months passed by between the
approval by the bank’s directory and the declaration of effectiveness and then, after
another 12 years, in May 2008, the first disbursement was made with the first activities.
As a consequence, during this first phase, the project was qualified as a problem project,
with unsatisfactory implementation and progress towards the achievement of the
objectives of the project, also unsatisfactory.

Beginning the second semester of 2008, the project presented significant progress, to the
point that they concluded, in 2012 with an important execution and achievements in the
technical, administrative and results scope. Originally, the project was designed for 5
years initiating in 2006, however, due to the delays in the beginning of the activities, the
end date was re-negotiated, stating the new one as for December 31, 2012.

Regarding the impact or effects of the activities, its measurement and analysis, depends
on the conclusion and publication of the results of the respective study, which that has not
happened to this moment and this is the reason why these results are not in this document.

The performance of the project can be seen in different aspects: the budget execution, the
conclusion of the programmed work, the territorial display of services and the generation
of competitive human resources.

While there were problems in the beginning of the budget execution, generally linked to
administrative obstacles, each year, beginning in 2009, it ended at least with 75% of
execution. One of the reasons, and in a particular way for Component 1, is that the work
transcends calendar years and the payment was delayed until the satisfactory delivery of
the work and equipment. This caused the payments to be reflected in the following years
after the beginning of the work.

In Component 2, it was evidenced and important growth in the execution starting in 2009
and 2010 when the agreements were incremented; originally there were 70 planned,
incrementing to 155 in those years. This was reflected in the budget execution.
Regarding Components 3 and 4, the execution was adequate on the same line than the
other components. At the end of the period, we count an execution of 98.75.

Thanks to the effort and the high commitment of the technical team of the Project in
collaboration with other actors of the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finances and in the
intervention areas, almost all the project activities have been completed under the Project;
however, a number of administrative problems that difficult the closing have been
identified..

At the end of 2012, 35 services were concluded (27 CAP y 8 CAIMI) of the 38
programmed. At the end of 2012, the Project had achieved: i) finish and operate 8

                                            42
wastewater treatment plants, ii) 8 sets of final disposition of placentas and sharp cutting
instruments; iii) three walls of retention, iv) 5 septic pits, and v) a well of absorption. It
remains pending for 2013 the execution of 9 wastewater treatment plants, from where
only 3 were finished and 6 will not be conclude in timeline of the project.

The Project acquired and delivered 100% of the equipment, with the 99 % installed,
benefiting 41 centers; also 50 ambulances have been distributed and are being use.
Among other relevant actions to the performance of the project, there is the consultation
to the indigenous leaders, parents, elderly, health services providers, midwives and
members of the COCODES commission of health, achieving: i) arrange aspects of
quality and cultural relevance of the strengthen services, ii) 37 COMUDES participating
of the local health actions, iii) 49 COCODES participating of the pilot intervention of
AIM-C institutional, iv) the design of a communication and training strategy about
responsible maternity and paternity in agreement with the National Reproductive Health
Program and PROEDUSA, v) 20 DAS and 40 municipalities of intervention count with a
committee for a responsible maternity and paternity, vi) Strengthen of the system of
reference and against functional reference within the articulated network of local services,
mapping of local actors (midwives, community facilitators, leaders), vii) Training in
danger signs and signals for timely reference, viii) 40 services count with local
committees that support identification and reference of obstetrical and neonatal
complications, supported by ambulances delivered by the project, y ix) 40 services are
working with trained midwives in identification and reference of danger signs and signals.

Also, there has been training for institutional and community human resources in 38
services, strengthen the regional blood banks and strengthen the reference and counter
referral through the provision of equipment of communication and ambulances to the
health services. As a result of the social participation, there are 7 maternal houses
functioning with an operating manual.

The component of nutrition initiated early its achievements by subscribing agreements
with NGO to develop the AINM-C strategy in 70 jurisdictions that escalated fast to 155.
The component during 2012 did not subscribe agreements and reoriented the work to
develop the AINM-C based in the services of the 1st and 2nd level. The actual AINM-C
institutional coverage covers 216 communities of 30 health posts and 16 minimum unities
that are located in 9 health districts prioritized both for Component 1 as for Component 2.
To develop the AINM-C institutional, there were hired 49 educators with funding from
the Project and 22 with funding from the health area, is expected that the areas at the end
of the Project, can give sustainability to the hiring of the educators. It continues to use
the application of the methodology of Auto analysis of the quality of the feature of the
services provided to children younger than 2 years old and continuing the training to the
PEC staff and other actors in the adequate use of the Bank interpersonal and group
communication resources.

The project implemented only one social communication strategy to promote maternal
and child nutrition in all the areas of influence and where there is demand. The Bank of
Interpersonal and Group Communications Resources (BRCIG) keeps working as an

                                             43
important source of communication resources in health and nutrition in the country. The
project has coordinated the transfer of the methodology used in the communication, as
well as the appropriate materials to 3 units: PROEDUSA; PROSAN; and PEC. Actually
the BRCIG is used as official materials for AINM-C.

The Project also implemented a monitoring system of the use of the communication
materials that are centered in the use of flipcharts and educational videos for the
educators with positive results.

Regarding the performance in Component 4, at the end of 2012, the acquisitions area: i)
have completed the 98% of the acquisitions previewed in the project, ii) there are some
process that require some intervention for their conclusion and iii) is incorporated to this
the hiring that results of the mitigation work.

In respect of the follow up of the indicators, there were difficulties by not having the
updated and appropriate sources of data. One of the most important steps was to define
the base line in the beginning of the implementation of the project. For Component 1,
the greater difficulty was the registration of deaths doesn’t have the information by
ethnicity, the mortality indicator was built, taking into consideration the municipalities
with more than 80% of indigenous population and as a database source, the national
statistics of the National Institute of Statistics for the children mortality and for the
maternal mortality, the official data of surveillance of the Maternal Mortality of the
National Center of Epidemiology of the Public Health and Social work Ministry.
The indicators of Component 2 are built based on surveys in the areas of intervention and
communities no intervene as control groups.

ACHIEVEMENTS

      Increase of the coverage of institutional delivery and pre and post control.
      Strengthening of health services of second level, improving the capacity of
       resolution, including cultural belonging and social participation.
      Increase of the coverage of growing control, accompanied of an educational
       process for mothers about the improvement of the quality of the alimentation of
       children under 2 years old.
      Develop and implementation of the process of cultural adequacy of health
       services; develop of educational materials with an intercultural objective, that
       permit and increase the coverage in care delivery and postnatal.
      The development of procedures for pre investment and infrastructure supervision
       permitted the achievement of the works of infrastructure even thought it was not
       possible with two of them that had a legal process.

SUSTAINABILITY

In regards of Component 1, with the exception of 3 not finished works, all the civil work
have been deliver to the MSOAS, the equipment it’s in use, the personnel have been


                                            44
hired by the Ministry and the processes of attention have started and they are kept with
equity of the Health areas.

Each one of the processes initiated with the project, has a manual that supports both the
clinic and the administrative and maintenance issues. There are reservations about the
maintenance of the buildings and equipment because the actual budget does not have a
category for these tasks, and this is why it is indispensable the effort for its inclusion on
the 2014 budget.

The specialized personnel of the CAP and CAIMI (Obstetrician, Pediatrician and
anesthetists) have been assumed by the Health Areas and its resources. There were
agreements between the MSPAS and the University of San Carlos, so the doctors that
finish their residence in those specializations, can rotate for the CAP and CAIMI as part
of the Supervised Professional Practice. The nursing assistant positions, laboratory
technicians and any other type of personnel have been included in the services regular
budget.

In summary, from financial perspectives, of competent human resources, materials and
equipment, operating manuals and community acceptance, the processes started in the
project, look sustainable.

LESSONS LEARNED

      To facilitate the work and the coherence in the actions, it is necessary to share the
       geographic space between all the components of the project. In this particular
       case, Component 1 developed its actions in 40 municipalities and Component 2
       got to develop them in 70. This lack of territorial coherence could make the
       coordination and the achievement of the final objectives more difficult.
      The multidisciplinary work evidence the importance that in the interventions of
       strengthening the attention is indispensable, the integral vision and not only as a
       part of a different infrastructure.
      In respect of the administrative and financial processes, although there was some
       sort of incompatibility between the Bank guidelines and what was developed by
       the Ministry, it is necessary to maintain the outline because of the high rotation of
       officials within the Ministry, and its curve is of knowledge of the processes, and it
       makes the procedures more complicated, but it keep them away from
       discretionalities and corruption threats.
      The development of manuals and standard procedures for the hiring of civil work,
       permitted to maintain the quality.
      Not all the services, such as CAP and CAIMI, required of the building of a
       maternity house.
      The civil works have been contracted in an integral way and no by pieces.
      In respect to the implementation in the strategy AINM-C, we can’t let the
       institutional inertia. It was necessary to insist that educators in health and
       nutrition dedicated 100% in actions that were only educational.


                                             45
   We cannot start from the idea that health workers know how to develop their
    functions in the activities of AINM-C.
   It is necessary to improve the salary and work conditions of the health and
    nutrition educators, to avoid desertion and high personnel rotation.
   Because of its complexity, the community organization requires enough time for
    the processes of organization, participation and community follow up.
   It is necessary to involve in AINM-C actions, to other decision making actors
    within the family and the community, such as: mothers in law, grandmothers,
    midwives, parents, etc. (The children mothers are not the only ones that make
    decisions).
   The actions and the places that are going to be supervise, have to be prioritized.
   The monitoring and supervision have to be done in a vertical way.
   To develop AINM-C actions, it is better to do them in a small number of
    communities (Prioritize) and to realize them in a longer period of time.
   The methodology of auto analysis of the quality of AINM-C services (For
    children under 2 years old), can be converted in a monitoring and supervision
    system of the first level of attention (the first level of attention of MSPAS doesn’t
    count with a monitoring and supervision system).
   To effectively develop the AINM-C actions, it is necessary to involve, stimulate
    and sensibilize the personnel and authorities of the Municipal District of Health.
   The domiciliary visits have to be realize based on the results of the methodology
    were the mothers support each other and not only by making meetings.
   For the training on AINM-C, the cascade methodology does not work.
   The strategy of communication has to be integral and the key messages of health
    and nutrition have to be manage in the same way in the first and second level of
    attention.
   To give sustainability to the AINM-C actions, the projects have to work integrally
    with the pairs of the institutional structures of the MS.
   As far as of the lending of services, it was very important the involvement of the
    personnel in all the processes of implementation.
   The high rotation of staff, does not allow to maintain the human resource with the
    basic knowledge to provide services and this is why we have to identify
    alternatives of secure capable human resource for one or two years.
   It is necessary that the Directors of the Health area and the District chiefs get
    involve and become more sensitive about this processes and the results of the
    supervision systems so they can stimulate their employees about making decisions.
   Within the system of supervision and monitoring has to exist a process of vertical
    and horizontal supervision, to facilitate processes; in the same way there is a need
    of strengthen the easy and capable supervision.
   The system of supervision and monitoring has to be integral and it has to be
    manage in the same way in all the levels of attention; for which the training has to
    be integral and to all the levels of complexity.

CONCLUSIONS

     The Maternal-Infant Health and Nutrition Project achieved the accomplishment of
      the majority of its objectives, especially the ones related to the strengthening of
      the Maternal-infant care from the second level of attention, where is located the
      rehab and the expansion of the services of maternal and infant care and the
      implementation of the strategy AINM-C, to combat chronic malnutrition.
     The achievements obtained with this project through the creation of the network
      of care for mothers and children in the selected municipalities, the implementation
      of the AINM-C strategy in coordination with the PEC and the processes of
      communication are sustainable because their regular activities have been absorb
      by the Ministry of Health and financed with their own resources.
     A critical mass of health workers has been generated with the necessary
      competencies to replicate the combat community strategies against the chronic
      malnutrition in the services of the municipalities served by the project.
