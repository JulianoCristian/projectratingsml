                         The proposed Project aims to support the Government of Guatemala to: (a) improve maternal and infant health in the project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b) reduce

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has achieved a number of its targets. In particular, the percentage of institutional births in Project intervention areas, the percentage reduction in the indigenous to non
                         indigenous maternal mortality ratio, the number of jurisdictions with AINM-C, and the percentage of families that were attended by the Creciendo Bien Program - when it still existed

                         Other notable achievements by the Project include the development and ongoing implementation of a multi-cultural communication strategy to promote maternal-child health and
                         nutrition and culturally sensitive messages and interventions, and the establishment of a Communications Resources Bank which is available for use to all local agencies working on

                         number of secondary level facilities rehabilitated, equipped and staffed increased from 29 in late 2011 to 33 by June 2012 and an additional health care center was rehabilitated by

                         The Government has assumed responsibility for ensuring the continuity of AINM-C interventions through the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC) by financing community
