                         The proposed Project aims to support the Government of Guatemala to: (a) improve maternal and infant health in the project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b) reduce
                         chronic malnutrition among children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities targeted by the project.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has continued to advance toward attaining several of its development and intermediate outcome indicators. In terms of results, the percentage increase in the number of
                         institutional births, percentage of women receiving postnatal care ten days after giving birth, the percentage reduction in the indigenous to non indigenous maternal mortality ratio
                         have already surpassed their end of Project targets. In addition, the percentage of women who received at least one prenatal control has increased to 87 percent. Through the

                         have lower levels of underweight (21.9%) and stunting (68.2 %) compared to children who became part of the AIN-C in 2009 (27.4% were underweight and 78.3% were stunted).
                         Targets for the percentage of children who participate in growth monitoring and weighing sessions and the percentage of families incorporated in the Food Security and Nutrition
                         Program have been met. The number of health facilities constructed/rehabilitated increased from 19 to 29 facilities. The Project also developed and officially launched in 2011 a

                         available for use by local agencies for maternal and child health and nutrition communication activities. The Project has also progressed in terms of (a) improving services at the
