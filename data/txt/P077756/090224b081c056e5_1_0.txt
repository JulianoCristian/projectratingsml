                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed Project aims to support the Government of Guatemala to: (a) improve maternal and infant health in the project's 40 areas of intervention; and (b) reduce
                         chronic malnutrition among children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities targeted by the project.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Guatemala Maternal and Infant Health and Nutrition Project was approved on January 19, 2006, signed on May 18, 2007, and became effective on June 26, 2007. As of end
                         April, 2013, it has disbursed US$48.48M, which represents 99% of the loan.

                         Despite facing numerous implementation challenges, the Project has made significant progress and yielded some positive results: the percentage of institutional births in Project
                         intervention areas and the percentage reduction in the indigenous to non indigenous maternal mortality ratio have both far surpassed their targets. This is no small achievement: it
                         means that significantly fewer indigenous women have died in childbirth per year. Of the remaining three PDOs, the indigenous to non-indigenous infant mortality ratio decreased
                         from 2009 to 2010 (the latest available year) but remains slightly higher than the baseline year while the status of two remaining PDOs (reductions in stunting and underweight in

                         children less than 2 years of age) will be confirmed once the nutritional impact analysis is completed in July. The Project has achieved 8 of its 13 intermediate indicators and is very
                         close to achieving the remaining 5 indicators. For example, the total number of rehabilitated health centers is 35 out of 37, of which 27 are Integrated Care Centers or CAPs and 8 are
                         Integrated Care Centers with Operating Rooms (CAIMI). The Project has made significant advances in other indicators. For instance, from a baseline of 54.2%, the percentage of
                         women who have had at least one prenatal care visit in the Project areas increased to 89%, almost attaining the 90% target while from a baseline of 55%, the percentage of children
                         less than 2 years of age who participated in weighing sessions increased to 78%, which is very close to the target of 80%.

                         The Project has also contributed to institutional strengthening at various levels of the health system. For example, it developed and implemented an integrated strategy for
                         Community-based Integrated Care for Children and Women (AINM-C) that emphasizes the first 1000 days of life, linking it with efforts to improve the quality of primary and secondary
                         levels of care. It also trained communities, with the support of health teams and community educators in using a self analysis tool to monitor the quality of child and maternal care in
                         their areas. Aside from rehabilitating, equipping and staffing health facilities, it also developed and introduced a management tool for monitoring the quality of child and maternal
                         services (focusing on delivery care, as well as perinatal and neonatal care) in these facilities. Moreover it prepared and supported the implementation of a multi-cultural
                         communication strategy to promote maternal and child health and nutrition, using culturally sensitive messages and interventions. As part of this strategy, it supported the
                         establishment of a Communications Resources Bank which is available to all local agencies working on maternal-child health issues, as well as the development of a social
                         communication strategy for municipalities prioritized under the Government’s flagship Zero Hunger Program and the 1000 Days of Life Initiative. The Project has also been requested
                         to share its communication strategy and materials by some countries in the region and by agencies such as UNDP and the Nutrition Institute of Central America and Panama
                         (INCAP).

                         In 2012, through the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC), the Government assumed responsibility for continuing AINM-C activities in almost all of the jurisdictions (142 out of
                         155) supported by the Project by financing community educators who serve as important links between health staff and communities. In addition, the Departmental Administration
                         Services have progressively assumed the financing of majority of the health personnel in the health facilities rehabilitated by the Project.
