Guatemala were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: malnutrition in Guatemala is the result of a\n            number of factors, some of them culturally embedded.\n            Successful changes in behavior require a longer\n            implementation period in order to make a lasting impact and\n            may require a longer support period so as to become more\n            institutionalized. The first year of Project implementation\n            was spent hiring staff and establishing and adjusting\n            project design, reducing the implementation period in\n            certain jurisdictions. Originally the Project design had\n            coverage expanding to 90 jurisdictions but as the start date\n            was postponed by two years, the project expanded to over 140\n            jurisdictions. As a result, in some jurisdictions the\n            project was only implemented for two years, reducing the\n            ability to support a behavioral change in the target\n            population. The team\u0092s strategy of holding shorter but more\n            frequent missions, as well as a focus on shorter terms\n            achievements provided easier implementation objectives.\n            Agreeing on specific short-term action plans with the\n            client, setting specific goals and deadlines was crucial in\n            keeping project momentum. Constant interaction with the\n            client through video and audio conferences, frequent\n            missions, and the use of consultants with experience in\n            implementing similar projects also helped with implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
