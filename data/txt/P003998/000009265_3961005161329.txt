SURMAXAA l,IBAN DEVELOPMENT PgC
Borrower:         The Republic of Indonesia
Bearficiaries:    The Municipality of Surabaya (KMS) and the Surabaya Water Enterprise
(PDAM)
Amount.           US$ 175.0 million equivalent
Terns:            20 years, including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
Onlending Tems:  Part of the proceeds (equivalent to US$ 153.8 million) would be onlent by the
Borrower to KMS and PDAM at annual interest rates related to market rates by
indexing to the prevailing 6 month average of the 3-month Sertifikat Bank
Indonesia (SBI) rate (which is currendy about 8%) for terms of 20 years.
However, the minimum rate of interest on loans to KMS and PDAM, regardless
of the SBI rate, would be not less than the Bank's loan rate plus 1.75%; and the
maximum rate of interest on loan to KMS and PDAM would not exceed 14%.
Interest and commitment charges would be payable during the grace
period. The Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk
rgiect DSoon: The objective of the project is to improve urban: (a) service levels and
affordability, particularly for the poor; (b) productirity and the effectiveness of
investments through better infrastructure planning and programming, especially
by enhancing local government capacity for fiscal management, revenue
mobilization, project implementation and O&M; and (c) environmental quality
by enhancing local government capacity to plan, implement and operate
infrastructure in an environmentally sound fashion and also by enhancing
community participation.
The project would finance investments to support: (a) urban transport and
traffic management with priority for public transport; (b) water distribution
system improvements and expansion to increase coverage from the current 65%
to 90% of the population; (c) storn drainage to reduce local flooding and
related economic and social losses and expand the affordable supply of serviced
land; (d) human waste collection and disposal ior about 200,000 people and
demonstrate the potential for conventional and low-cost off-site sanitation and
cost recovery; (e) solid waste to increase coverage from the current 65% to 90%
of the waste generated and improve collection and landfill disposal techniques
with improved services for about 470,000 people; (f) kampung improvement to
improve basic settlement facilitees and living conditions for about 500,000
people in low income areas, land tenure for 100,000 households and building
permits for about 200,000 households; community participation in planning,
implementing operating and maintaining improvements; and credit to low
income households to install septic tanks, pit latrines, water supply connections
and bathrooms and improve kitchens; (g) serviced, securely-tenured plots for
resettlement; and (h) institutional development and capacity-building support.
Benefits and Risks: The project, with its integrated approach to planning and implementation, is
expected to substantially alleviate urban poverty and much project activity is
targeted to improve services, lower costs and improve the quality of life and the



-ii-
environment in the poorer Kampung areas of the city, w .  fre 70% of the
population live at the highest population densities in the poorest living
conditions. PRoject funded community development, health improvement
activities, skills training and economic venture promotion would enhance
employment opportmities providing the means for sustained poverty
reduction. The main risks relate to: (a) land acquisition, which is, however,
well advanced for first and second year projects; (b) delays in appointment of
consultants for critical activities, for which tenns of reference and short lists
were submitted by negotiations; (c) shortfalls in water income and PDAM's
contribution to the investment progam, for which adjustments could be made
by concentrating early investments in existing system improvements and
conr.ections; and (d) provision of l.nd for resettlement on a timely basis, for
which assurances were obtained at negotiations.

1.1   DemophVlic Ten4. The urban population in Indonesia exceeds 55 million and is growing
at over 5 percent per year, more than twice the overall national population growth rate. About 80
million or 40 percent of Indonesians will be city dwellers by the year 2000. Urban employment has
also grown at about 5 percent per year, much more rapidly than the national rate. Indonesia's urban
settlements include 15 metropolitan and large cities of more than half a million people, 40 secondary
cities of over 100,000 (provincial headquarters and incorporated municipalities), 200 small towns
(district headquarters) over 20,000 and about 3,200 service centers (subdistrict headquarters) with
3,000 to 20,000 people.
Institutional Framework fQr Sector Development
1.2   National-Administration. AU key agencies with responsibilities in the urban sector are
represented in the Interagency Coordinating Team for Urban Development (Tim Koordinasi or
TKPP) chaired by BAPPENAS, the National Development Planning Agency. BAPPENAS is
responsible for overall planning and the aUlocation of resources, focused in Five-Year Development
Plans (Repelita) and Annual National Revenue and Expenditure Budgets (APBN).
1.3   The Ministry of Home Affairs (IviHA) is responsible for overseeing regional governments,
primarily through its Directorate Generals for Pub!ic Administration and Regional Autonomy
(PUOD) and for Regional Developme t (BANGDA). The Ministry of Public Works (MPW or PU) is
responsible for overseeing most infrastruture. Within the MPW, there are Directorate Generals
responsible for urban: (a) roads and bridges (Bina Marga or DGBM); (b) Water Resource
Development, flood control and water supply (Pengairen or DGWRD); and (c) city and regional
planning, water supply, drainage, sanitation and sewerage, solid waste management, kampung
improvement (KIP) and market inffsucture improvement (MIIP) (Cipta Karya or DGCK).The
Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for central and local finance through its Directorate
General for Monetary Affairs (DOM). MOFs Directorate General for Budget (DGA - Anggaran)
administers grant transfers, its Dictorat General for Taxation (DGP - Pajak) administers property
tax and its Agency for Fmancial Analysis (BAK - Badan Analisa Keuangan) analyzes regional
finance.
1.4   Other central agencies concemed with urban management, include: (a) the National Land
Agency (BPN), which administers land development permits; (b) the Ministry of State for
Administative Reform (MPAN), the Directorate General for Land Transport (DGPD)) of the
Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of State for Environment, the Ministry of State for
Housing, the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Health.
1.5   Regional Administration. Indonesia has a highly-centrlized unitary government in which
the center holds all powers not specificaUy assigned to lower levels. Since 1974, however, provincial
governments (Level I), including 27 provinces and local governments (Level H), including 302 local
governments, consisting of 55 kotamadya (municipalities) and 247 kabupaten (districts), have been
giv- increasing responsibilities and delegated authority. Legislative powers at both provincial and
k. A levels are held by People's Representative Councils (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah or DPRD)
of mostly elected representatives.
1.6 Provincial governments are headed by appointed governors who represent the President and
the centri government (GOI), and also head the semi-autonomous provincial administruaions.
Bupatis (kabupaten heads) and appointed walikotas (kotamadya mayors) both represent the
govemors and provincial governments, and head their own local governments. Regional



-2-
Development Planning Agencies (BAPPEDA I and II) report directly to their respective governors,
district heads or mayors, and are responsible for planning and resource allocation. Regional
government services are provided by separate departments (Dines I and II) analogous to line
ministries of the central government and routine adiinistration is provided by bureaus under the
regional secretaries (SEKWILDA I and II). The provincial agencies direct involvement in providing
urban services is litited.
1.7   Most central line agencies are represented in provinces by their KANWIL (Kantor Wilayah or
regional offices). KANWIL of MPW are located in all provinces and in urban areas and pritarily
execute infrastucture projects financed by central government. KANWIL's also provide technical
guidance and assistance to concerned provincial and local Dinas I and II public works departments
(DPUP and DPUK), an increasingly impowit function. In 1987, GOI significantly expanded urban
infrastructure responsibilities assigned to DPUP's and DPUK's, and provided guidelines to classify
cental, provincial and local public works infasucture responsibilities. In 1988, MPW announced it
intended to confine KANWIL project implementation to purely national schemes such as national or
regional roads.
1.8 - Sectr Constraints and Priorities. Average incomes in urban areas have risen substantially
over the past eight years, however income distribution remains relatively unequal and in 1990Q over
17% of urban dwellers were estimated still to be "absolute" poor based on their expenditure levels.
The problems of low income are exacerbated by deficiencies in basic services and degraded
environmental conditions leading to poorer health among the low income populadon. About 76% of
the urban population do not have ditect access to piped water supply and 11% rely on wells and
water vendors. About 65% of low income groups share toilets and waterways are commonly used for
sanitation purposes. In the larger cities, inadequate industrial water supply and liquid and solid waste
disposal is a serious problem. To meet GOrs service and equity objectives, more investment is
needed in low-cost, local or tertiary systems in underserved urban areas.
1.9 The Bank's 1984 Urban Services Sector Report (No. 4800-IND) estimated that total
expenditures by central and local government on investment, operation and maintenance (O&M) in
urban services during Repelita IV (1984-89) should be increased fPnm 0.4% of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) to 0.7% of GDP in order to reduce the backlog and keep up with increased demand
for urban services. Expenditures approached this level in 1987-89, aided by Urban Sector Loan
(2816-IND) and other donor financing, but fell back to inadequate previous levels thereafter. The
1993 Bank Urban Sector Report estimates that expenditures on urban public services will need to
more than double during Repelita VI.
1.10 Sector Finances. The dominant role of central government grants (INPRES) for financing
local government services is partly the result of limited local taxing authority. For example, the
potentially most promising local revenue source, the property tax, has an effective rate of only 0.I%
set by the central government. Central government grants can resolve the disparity between local
government taxing authority and expenditure; grant allocation criteria are being reviewed with a view
to makdng them more need and performance-based.
1.11  In local gov-ernment areas, the regional offices of cental government agencies also execute a
large number of infiasucture projects financed as grants-in-kind from the national budget (APBN
DIP). While urban infrastructure responsibilities are still being classified, some national projects
create infrastructure which, according to PP 14 (Government Regulation), is a local responsibility.
Central government grants-i-kind may be justified where local government institutions and
financial resources are weak. However, these projects may generate operaton and maintenance
responsibilities which local government is unable or unwilling to fulfill or bear, because the
infrasucture created may be of low local priority.
1.12  S     Coordination and Loca Pariipato   Due to the hierarchical decision-making
systenm, coordination of the urban sector has been poor and local participation limited. The size and



-3-
diversity of the country, the rapid pace of urbanization, the number of concerned agencies, the lack
of effective management information systems and, perhaps, cultual constraints upon horizontal
communication within and among agencies, have fragmented urban development management. As
urbanization and its related problems grow, so does the potential for further fragmentation and
inefficiency, Improvements in coordination would be easier to sustain at the local level than in the
large central government. The adopted policy of decentralization needs to be pursued more
effectively.
Urban Infrastructure Issues
1.13  Urban infrastructure as defined in GOI's Urban Infrastructure Development Programs
(IUIDP) for local governments (para. 2.3), includes water supply and distribution, sanitation, solid
waste collection and disposal, drainage, and roads. Community facilities (schools, hospitals, parks,
cemeteries, etc) are included in other programs.
1.14 The main problems faced by medium-size cities are: (a) large infrastructure deficiencies,
inefficiencies in investment, weak quality control and O&M backlogs; (b) lack of coordination in
planning, in particular of land use with infrastructure provision; (c) weak financial management as
evidenced by deficient accounting practices and the lack of adequate cost recovery, revenue
generation, use of credit and of private participation possibilities; (d) weak management of water
enterprises and municipal improvement programs including drainage, solid waste disposal, and
kampung micro-infrastructure; (e) inefficient programming of the design and construction cycles
often into single fiscal years; (f) poor information systems, and (g) complex relationships among
locaL provincial and central agencies with respect to responsibilities for project and program
preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation and O&M; and (h) shortage of trained and
experienced managerial and technical personnel at all levels.
1 .15 There has been considerable progress in improving water supply, however there continue to
be problems, including: (a) low service coverage, particularly of the poor; (b) water vendors pricing
water weil above cost and affordability of the poor; (c) weak, fragmented and understaffed agencies
at all levels from water resource management down to water enterprises; (d) ine:icient procurement
practices; (e) weak financial data and late and heavily-qualified audits; (f) inadequate cost recovery
with self-financing confined to a few major cities, like Surabaya; (g) high unzccounted-for-water
rates (UFW); and (h) low quality piped and groundwater and depletion of groundwater aquifers.
1.16  Urban trans  po roblems include: (a) increasing volumes of traffic and congestion; (b) weak
and fragmented agencies with poor coordination between the main levels of government; (c)
insufficient emphasis on traffic management and engineering and provision of priority for public
transport; (d) lack of adequate parking and pedestrian facilities and related public transport policies;
and (e) weak links between land management and transport policies and road user taxation.
1.17  Solid waste services suffer from inadequate disposal arrangements (transfer stations and final
disposal sites), even though solid waste collection is relatively good in some cities, including
Surabaya. Drainage and waste water disposal is inadequate, with the result that rivers and drainage
canals are heavily polluted with human waste and industrial effluent and there is extensive
groundwater pollution. Drainage channels also have insufficient capacity, with squatters and
improper garbage disposal reducing flows.
B. Urban Development in Surabaya
1.18 I   piltifn. Growth ad Administrtion. Surabaya is the capitol city of East Java Province, its
commercial and administrative center and the second largest Indonesian city. It is the major partner
of GERBANGKERTOSJSIUA or GKS (Map IBRI) 25014), a mnemonic for the Kabupatens of
Gresik, Bangkalan, Mojokerto, Sidoaio and Lamongan, together with Kotamadyas Surabaya and
Mojokerto. GKS has been selected by GOI as a natural base for the development of East Indonesia,



and a disproportionate amount of the regional population growth falls on metropolitan Surabaya.
1.19  Between 1961 and 1981, the population of Surabaya more than doubled (3.5%/yr) and
between 1980 and 1990 grew at an average annual rate of 2.5%. In 1988, 6% (3.5 million) of the
national urban population, equivalent to 1.9% of the national population, lived and worked in KMS.
Urbanization is mostly within the administrative boundaries of the city, but is spreading to
neighboring jurisdictions, particularly along the southem border with Kabupaten Sidoarjo where both
industrial and residential (formal and informal) developments are occurring. Gresik, West of
Surabaya, has been designated and is emerging as a major center for industrial development.
1.20 The strategic position of Surabaya and its port have helped to provide employment
opportunities for surplus rural labor especially at PT Sier in Rungkut, and expanded the production
base for Indonesia's industrial sector. From 1985-87 the regional domestic product grew at 7.9%/yr.
By the year 2000, KMS is projected to have a total population approaching S million compared to
3.5 million in 1990. For OKS as a whole, the current population of about 8 million is expected to
reach 10.8 million by the year 2000.
1.21 For local initiatives in improving the habitat of the poor, KMS was one of ten cities worldwide
honored at the first World Earth Environmental Summit, held June 1992 in Rio de Janiero.
Kampung Improvement Programs (KIP), implemented in Surabaya since 1968 have covered 3,000
ha and over 1.2 million people under the Bank's Urban nI, Im and V loans and other GOI programs.
1.22 Weakly-focused land management has resulted in relatively low-density formal land
development in large plots which are unaffordable to lower income groups, encourages unauthorized
settlement (Kampung), increases the costs and problems of infrastructure development (due to right
of way obstructions and the need for resettlement) and public transport operations. About 70% of
the population, including most lower income groups, live in Kampungs.
1.23  EnMironmental Condiions in Surabaya. Surabaya is a relatively clean developing city, but
rapid urban growth and indusutization is depleting the city's natural resources, degrading ground,
river and coastal waters with domestic and industrial waste, polluting the air and contaming the
soil. Pollution of the Kali (River) Surabaya, the main raw water source for the municipal water
treatment plants, has been recognized as a major risk to public health. A pollution control program,
initiated in 1985, defined an action plan to reduce industrial and domestic pollution but, pollution
remams at high levels due to lack of adequate enforcement of controls. As recently as September,
1990, depleted oxygen and high concentrations of pollutants caused serious fish kills and hindered
water treatment plant operations. This situaton adversely affects the health and quality of life of the
residents and the economy of the city. However, PROKASIH, the Clean Rivers Progran coordinated
by the East Java Province, has recently started to diminish the discharge of industrial wastes into the
nver.
1.24 Only about 40% of the city population have direct access to the city piped water system.
Many more rely on high-priced water (Rp 3000/m3 vs about Rp 300/m3 for PDAM water supply)
sold to them by vendors and neighbors and on extremely low-quality water from hand-dug wells,
rivers and canals. Groundwater in much of the city is saline and, in other areas, is deep and unreliable
as the silty clay has very low transmissivity. Sales of bottled water are booming but are too costly for
the poor.
1.25 *Solid waste collection coverage is relatively high (65%) and the city has won Indonesia's
ADIPURA merit award for the last five years. However final disposal facilities are problematic: the
Western disposal site is in the city's rainfall catchment area, while the Eastern disposal site is on coastal
flats causing surface water pollution and endangering coastal fishing and aquaculture. Similar
problems are caused by poor and inadequate sanitation, resulting in polluted drains, especially in the
large Mordkrembangan retention basin in the North of the city near the port.



-5-
1.26 The incidence of infant mortality and of gastroenteric, pulmnonaiy, and viral diseases caused
in part by polluted and congested conditions, is high among the poor and those living in the
norhern, flood-prone areas of the city. In addition to health and quality of life problems,
environmental conditions and land management deficiencies impose higher costs of infrastructure
development and maintenance. In the absence of an effective pollution control and enforcement
strategy and program, industries had been using inefficient and outdated technologies wasting raw
materials and reducing competitiveness in international markets, as well as imposing health and
economic costs on others.
1.27 Deelsopment Planning. Erumniwk. Concern that despite the relatively high level of
investment in Surabaya serious deficiencies in basic services persisted, has long been expressed at the
highest level. Consequently, with assisunce from the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), an urb  development planning study for OKS was commenced in 1981 and finalized in
1983. The main features of the GKS study's stucture plan included: (a) an integratd growth and
investment strategy; (b) the encouragement of industry in six designated areas; (c) improvement of
housing in existing areas and controlled development of new housing; (d) integrated urban transport;
(e) improved rivers and drainage; and (f) expansion of utilities to serve the residential and industrial
areas.
1.28 The official master plan for Surabaya (MPS 2000) was prepared in 1978f79 by KMS with
consultant assa1sunce and updated by KMS in 1985. Although the main planning guidelines of the
GKS study are being folowed by KMS, contemporary development pressures, some extenal to the
local administation, are distorting development objectives and the inftucture investment plan.
Urban growth has not extended to the southwest and west as envisaged, due mainly to lack of water.
While some developments are proceeding roughly as planned, some developments have occurred or
are panned in areas not foreseen, including environmenta11y sensitive areas (e.g., in the catchment
area of the Ngagel water treatment works and on the eastern coastal wetlands). BAPPEDA Ik. II of
KMS is emergiag as a focus for city issues, pulling together infonnation on the nature, scale and
location of changes which are occurring. The GKS structural plan, however, needs updating.
1.29 Much of the recent population growth has occurred in the fringe areas of the city, providing
considerable additional property tax revenues to KMS, although, the infrastructure needs of these
areas have yet to be fully addressed. However, important policy initiatives have been undertaken by
GOl which could strengthen land use and intersectoral investment planning and implementation in
Surabaya. These include the establishment of the BPN (National Land Agency ) and the Spatial
Planning Decee (Kepres 57/89). In Surabaya however, the activities of BPN have had a negative
impact: BPN permits to developers have locked up raw land for development, probably increased
land prces, been insensitive to environmental and social planning objectives and detrmentally
diminished local government responsibility for land use management.
1.30  Infrastructure lEndiSe in          Expenditure on urban infrastructure excluding
water supply in Surabaya during Repelita IV totalled Rp 101.4 bn (US$ 51 m) with an expenditure in
1989/90 of Rp 32.9 bn (US$ 16.5 m). Water supply capital expenditure in 1989 totalled Rp 11.1 bn
(US$ 5.6 m) and has not kept pace with requirements, despite that PDAM Sumabaya has had a
relatively robust financial performance. Expenditure has been mainly on roads, kampung
improvement and drainage.
1.31 Investment in Surabaya's infrastructure has not kept pace with needs. Considerable
deficiencies remain both in coverage and quality as in other Indonesian cities. Invesunent
deficiencies are specifically in or relate to: (a) transport infrastructure to link the East and West parts
of the city and to guide urban growth and traffic engineering and management to make the most of
existing facilties; (b) water distribution and bulk water supply to existing and new areas, due to low
taiffs, insufficient orgaization and management; (c) micro-infirstucture and services and the use of
effective and safe low-cost sanitation techniques in the urban kampungs, where most low income
people live; (c) policies and operational pgrams for: (i) O&M of infsutue and utilty services;



-6-
(ii) revenue generation and the use of municipal borrowing; (iii) private sector participation in
delivery of municipal services; and (d) unclear relationships between municipal and central
government authorities with respect to responsibilities for preparation, appraisal, financing and
implementation and O&M of infrastructure services.
1.32  These problems raise important issues for GOI policy and call for an efficient metropolitan
development strategy matched with a balanced intersectoral investment program using low-cost
technologies where practicable. Much of the growth will continue to take place at the city's periphery
and the need to initiate investments there, particularly in basic services, is urgent. Without adequate
spatial planning, tht cost or these services will rise rapidly and unnecessarily over time as planned and
unplanned settlement consolidates, densities increase and environmental resources are lost or
degraded. Surabaya's local govemment has significant manpower resources, growing experience to
address many of these challenges and is in touch with local conditions. Given iOI budgetary
constraints, the relatively high average incomes in Surabaya and large potential tax base and the
substantial needs elsewhere in the country, local taxes and user charges should pay for financing
much of the urban infrastructure in Surabaya. The proposed SUDP project attempts to address some
of the issues oudined above as part of a coordinated and integrated development program.
H. SECTR  aIRATEGY ANDJANK
A. GovermentStratgy
2.1   With large deficiencies in urban infrastructure and fast-growing urban populations, GOrs
strategy emphasizes physical infrastrcture targets: length of roads to be built, percentage of
population to be supplied with safe water etc. These targets usually have a promirzrt place in the
medium-term national development plans (Repelitas). For example, in connection with the UN
Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, GOI aimed at providing safe water supply to 75% of the
urban and 60% of the rural population by 1990. In 1988, 46% of the urban population had access
to clean water, compared to 38% in 1980, partly due to private provision through wells. Although
targets were not achieved, the performance was still impressive, in view of the more than 50% increase
in the urban population in the period.
2.2 The main constraint may not have been funds, but the capacity to prepare and implement
projects and the financing mechanisms in place. GOI has aimed to improve sectoral management at
the national level. BAPPENAS was designated to lead a nigh-level inter-agency team (Tim
Koordinasi - TKPP) representing the agencies concerned with infrastructre, and charged with
responsibility for overall urban sector policy development and coordination. The Bank's views of
policy priorities for urban development in Indonesia were set out in the 1984 Urban Services Report
(4800IND) and particularly on O&M and local government finance in the 1987 Public Resource
Management Report (7007-IND). The governmmt issued a Statement of Policies in 1987 which
represented a consolidated view of development in the sector. This Policy Statement, incorporated in
Repelita V (1988189-1993194) includes:
*   strengthening local governnent to build, operate and maintain local services;
*   improving the planning and programming of urban infrastructure investments;
mobilizing local revenues and optimizing their use;
*   implemnenting coordinated financing and administration systems for local services; and
*   strengthening consultative processes at various levels of government, particularly the
participation of municipalities and districts.
2.3   GOI's Policy Statement called for Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development
Programming (T TIDP) as the operational approach for achieving these objectives. The Policy was
translated into action plans for local institutional refonns (IDAP - Local Institutional Development
Action Plan) and improvements in local resource mobilization (Revenue Improvement Action Plans,
or RIAP), sector planning, and tinancing arrangements. These were incorporaed into the Urban



-7-
Sector Loan (Loan 2816-IND), which supported the strategic framework for urban development in
the water supply, drainage and flood protection, human and solid waste, roads and KIP sectors in
Indonesia
2.4   GOI has continued to develop the IUIDP process to emphasize the following priorities: (a)
expanding the scope of the IUDP process to include additional subsectors which are important in the
economic role of cities; (b) strengthening local government institutional development and training;
(c) improving infrastructure operations and maintenance (O&M); (d) improving cost recovery and
implementation of a more fully integrated system for the financing of urban services; and (e)
increasing attention to urban land and environmental management.
2.5   GOI has issued regulations and policy clarifications to operationalize urban sector policy and
the IUIDP approach: MPW announced it would relocate about half its headquarters staff to provincial
and local governments; with World Bank and Asian Development Bank bilateral assistance, GOI has
undertaken a nationwide program for IUIDP preparation and implementation since 1987; and UNDP
and UNCHS have supported a Central IlIDP Management Assistance Team (IMG) through 1994.
More than 50% of local governments have adoptced IUIDP plans. The TKPP and IUIDP
Inplementation Management Group (IMG) have been providing leadership for the IUIDP process.
2.6   Poverty reduction and balanced regional development are prominent objectives of Repelita V
and VI. 001's strategy for regional development is evolving; but specific investment programs
targeted to backward areas and increases in the resources available to such areas through INPRES
grants to local government to finance urban expenditures for which local governments are
responsible, are key strategic elements which give local governments more control over their
expenditure programs than grants-in-kind by central agencies.
2.7   Also under Repelita V, GOI has given priority to the expansion of borrowing by local water
enterprises. To induce a higher level of credit financing, GOI has adopted less conservative fmancial
criteria for borrowing by local governments and their enterprises (debt service coverage ratio of not
less than 1.5 for local government general fund operations and not less than 1.3 for local enterprises
like water supply PDAMs). This would bring the legal borrowing capacity for local governments,
particularly the large cities, more in line with their considerably-unused paying capacity.
2.8   GOrs strategy is to move interest rates towards market rates over the medium to long term.
Given the substantal grant element in the financing of local services in Indonesia, interest rate levels
must be viewed in the context of overal sector finances. Many local governments have little or no
experience with loan financing, having preferred instead to rely on central government transfers in
spite of the very low (two to four percent or, in some cases zero), interest rate on domestic loans.
Only the largest cities have significant experience with interest rates in the range of 9-12%.
Therefore, the move to market interest rates should be evaluated in the context of a program for
grants and each city's financial and administrative capacity.
B. Bank SectorEgeidoc
2.9 Worldwide Experience in Water Supply. The Bank has been involved in the water sector since
the 1960s with relatively little change in approach. The scale of projects increased and many
involved assistance to a number of smaller entities under one operation. Some operations relied on
intermediaries to manage implementation and to provide assistance to beneficiary entities. While
many projects provided substantial economic and health benefits, the expenence indicates: (a) high
levels of unaccounted-for-water persist; (b) improving institutions and cost recovery has been slow
and difficult; (c) delays in project implementation are common; (d) the supply of water has lagged
behind increasing demands; (e) disposal of waste water in densely populated areas has lagged behind
the limited supply of water and low water quality is a persistent problemL
2.10  Worldwide Ex ce in the Urbato  Bank involvement in the urban sector started in



-8-
the early 1970's with low cost investment projects in shelter, water supply, sanitation and urban
transport aimed at alleviating urban poverty. Sites-and-setvices and slum upgrading projects were to
demonstrate replicable approaches benefiting the poor, while recovering costs and reducing the
financial burden on the public sector. Many of these projects have been reasonably successful in
meeting physical objectives, but have had little impact on the policies of national and local
governments and on urban management. The policy dialogue between the Bank and governments
focussed on physical aspects and some institutional issues; but much less attention was given to the
broader policy framework such as intergovernmental fiscal relations and to devising lending
instruments to address them. More importantly, because many urban programs did not achieve
sustainable policy reform and institutional development, project approaches were generally not
replicable outside the framework of Bank financial support. In only a few cases, such as the
Kampung Improvement Program in Jakarta, have citywide impacts been achieved. Urban, like water
operations, also experienced substantial implementation delays due to insufficient project preparation
and ambitious implementation timetables. Only recently have Govemments mobilized private sector
and community initiative, while in many cases have increased the cost of private solutions through
over-regulation and rationing of scarce capital for investment.
2.11   By the mnid-1980s the experience of donor-assisted projects had led to shifts in approaches to
the urban sector. It was recognized that governments alone were unable to meet the shelter,
infrastructure and services needs of rapidly growing urban populations and it was believed that
greater efforts had to be devoted to:
*   improving the management of urban institutions and intergovernmental fiscal relations;
*   improving local resource mobilization;
* improving the management of urban infrastructure, particularly with regard to
maintenance;
*   establishing enabling rather than constraining regulatory frameworks;
*   strengthening financial services for urban development; and
*   reducing and focusing the public role in urban service delivery.
2.12   Recent initiatives by governments and donors in these areas reflect a growing appreciation of
the importance of policies, institutions, and regulations in formulating effective strategies to manage
urban growth. Assuming that government could provide the investment needed to serve the majority
of the urban population, inadequate attention was given to the importance of private households,
communities, and firms in providing for their own needs. A new policy framework is needed that
more selectively defines the relative roles of the public and private sectors. The policy framework
must also link the management and productivity of the urban economy to the broader objectives of
economic growth and development policy.
2.13   Experience in Indonlesia Bank experience confirms that: (a) limited planning and
imp'ementation capacity at the central level and the difficulties inherent in providing essentially local
services by central govemment departments, decreases the efficiency of mass delivery programs; (b)
capacity building at the local level is a long-run process that needs to be accompanied by an increase
in local responsibility and accountability; and (c) to develop such responsibility and accountability,
central-local financial relations need to provide more local government autonomy and enable private
sector involvement.
2.14 The Bank has financed 11 completed and 7 ongoing urban and water supply projects in
Indonesia since 1974, for more than fifty local govemments and many of their water enterprises
(Annex l,Table 1). Urban lending operations in Indonesia have progressed from demonstration
projects in Jakarta through more progrmmatic investments in selected other large cities, still limited
in geographic and subsectoral scope, to sector lending within an agreed policy and institutional
framework. Water supply projects initially covered only a few cities, but later, like Bank projects in
other countries, assisted a large number of urban settlements under one operation.

2.15 Completed Projects. Of the II loans closed to date, seven have been evaluated by the Bank's
Operation Evaluation Department. The issues and lessons from these reports are discussed below.
2,16  W r   ply. While about several million people received improved water supply due to
four projects (Five Cities Water, Second Water Supply, East Java Water Supply and Second East Java
Water Supply), the projects experienced the following problems: (a) substantial delays in project
implementation caused by inadequate preparation, especially of detailed designs; (b) over-optimistic
water demand and unaccounted-for-water projections leading to unmet financial covenants and
difficulties in servicing debt; and (c) inadequate institutional development and management of
technical assistance. For the proposed water supply component (and other municipal service
components), detailed designs have been prepared in advance for first and second year schemes,
consumer demand surveys have been used as a basis for water demand projections and realistic
targets for reducing unaccounted-for water have been set, based on leakage studies and the current
pipe network rehabilitation project.
2.17 Urban Projects. According to project performance audit reports, civil works included in the
first two urban projects were completed according to appraisal schedules. However, considerable
delays were experienced in the selection and appointment of consultants, requiring extension of loan
closing dates by three years to complete the technical assistance components. Water supply
components under KIP, experienced the same problem as free standing water supp!y projects: water
demand projections were over-optimistic at the prevalent tariff rates; willingness to pay for piped
water was less than expected where groundwater alternatives existed; and stronger anrangements for
maintenance arrangements were needed. The proposed project includes both maintenance
expenditures and institution capacity-building for O&M.
2.18  The combined Project Completion Report (PCR) for urban projects Urban III (1653-IND and
Urban IV (1972-IND) highlighted the following urban development priorities in Indonesia:
*   more local participation in implementation and visible leadership by the chief executive
(bupati or mayor) of the-local (Tk II) government;
*   increases in operations and maintenance budgets and institutional capacities at all
levels;
*   stronger and more coordinated planning and programming of urban infrastructure;
*   improved local resource mobilization for sustaining urban development programs; and
*   strengthened municipal mnagement, technical staff capacities and operational systems
to achieve the decentralization of urban development programs.
2.19  Some of the functional requirements and policy reform options to address these issues on a
national basis (see below) were explored under Urban V (Ln 2408-IND) and an Urban Sector Loan
(Ln 2816-IND). The need for coordinated infrastructure planning was the key to the development of
the IUIDP concept, which is being implemented under various projects.
2.20 Beneficiary households and communities are routinely involved in the identification,
preparation and implementation of kampung infrastructure improvement programs (KIP) that have
been supported under Bank loans for more than ten years. Market infrastructure imnprovement
programs (MUP) have a similar participatory base. GOI's successful solid waste management and
sanitation programs also rely on participation of beneficiary households and communities and have
received increasing support under the Urban m, IV and V projects. On-site sanitation schemes
introduced under the Urban V project, for example, emphasized household financing and the use of
Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) for community management of implementation. Water
supply investments supported by the Bank now require assessment of cost recovery potential from the
beneficiary households; road investment must be based upon specific road-user needs and adequate
rates of return; and drainage investments emphasize needs expressed by communities subject to
flooding.



-10-
2.21  Most importantly, the infrastructure planning (IUIDP) process incorporated in SUDP
preparation, was designed to upgrade the effective role of local participation to: (a) begin planning
and decision processes at a level low enough in government so that beneficiaries can participate
directly; (b) start early enough so that adequate attention can be provided to subproject design in
meeting beneficiary needs; (c) emphasize local responsibility for O&M; and (d) develop local human
resource and institutional capacities through the entire project cycle.
C. Bank Sector Strategy
2.22 Qgarr The Bank and GOI strategy emphasizes improving: (a) service levels in a regionally
balanced fashion and particularly for the poor; (b) urban productivity and the effectiveness of
investments through better infrastructure planning and programming, especially at the city level and
through enhanced local government capacity for fiscai management, revenue mobilization, project
implementation and O&M; and (c) the urban environment by enhancing local govemment capacity
to plan, implement and operate infrastructure in an environmentally sound fashion and also by
enhancing community participation. The Bank supports the decentralized approach of GOI's long-
term development objectives for the sector. Bank-wide experience suggests that decentralization
combined with strong efforts to increase local government capacity offers the best prospects for
dealing with urban management constraints including project preparation, implementation and O&M
and for improving the efficiency of resource allocation
2.23 Improving Service Levels and Management Capacity. The Bank shares GOI's view that
increased access to infrastructure services, especially for the poor, is an important objective. However,
there is no simple solution to the problem of institutional capacity constraints. Furthermore, mass
delivery of standardized systems suffers from problems of inflexible design which leads to solutions
ill-adapted to local circumstances, low consumer willingness-to-pay and lack of funds and
institutional capability for maintenance. This may also hinder the contribution of urban
infrastructure to city economic development. The Bank emphasizes long-term programs to enhance
the capacity of local governments and communities to implement, finance, build and maintain
infrastructure assets. Provision of financial and managerial incentives through a properly designed
planning and regulatory framework for the local governments and the private sector is an equally
important aspect of the strategy.
2.24 The Bank's strategy supports the IUIDP concept, particularly in large cities, to improve
coordination, accounting, tax and land administration, environmental management, private sector
participation, project preparation, implementation and O&M and ultimately urban productivity. It
also recognizes that implementation of GOrs strategy depends on the institutional capacity of
individual local governments and water enterprises. Where institutional constraints are less
pronounced, as in East Java, it is possible to establish provincial intermediation, programmatic lending
and high levels of cost recovery. In other parts of the country such as East Indonesia, where local
capacity is less developed, conventional project lending is more appropriate and high levels of cost
recovery without grant assistance may be more difficult. The Bank strategy recognizes that
regionally balanced development, particularly in urban areas in Eastern Indonesia, is a legitimate
concern of GOI.
2.25 Improving The Planning and Regulatody Framework. The Bank's strategy also promotes the
establishment of an enabling regulatory and planning framework for urban land management. A
large technical assistance program funded under a series of Bank loans has assisted the Govemment
in improving its mapping, land registration, tax administration and land management in general. A
national Agency (BPN) for land has now been established and a key focus of the Bank's strategy will
be to support the Government to simplify its zoning and other regulations to facilitate more efficient
urban land use and strengthen tenure. An enabling framework for increased private participation has
to be developed, although to date, little has been accomplished on this agenda.



-11-
2.26  Ftinancing Urban Development. Based on the Banks experience that local services are most
effectively provided when responsibility and accountability lies with competent local governments,
Bank strategy ains at increasing the importance of local government resources in financing urban
infrastructure services. Measures are supported that increase local revenue, especially the reform of
the system of local government taxes and charges. and prudent borrowing by local governments.
The system of a multitude of local government taxes with very limited revenue base and yield has
already been overhauled. Also, local governments should be encouraged to establish pricing policies
to fully recover costs, thereby enabling grants to be targeted to the neediest regions with less potential
for local resource mobilization in support of GOr's regional equity objectives. If GOI's Repelita V
strategy of increasing the relative importance of credit in the sector succeeds, it will encourage more
efficient allocation of resources within the sector. However, maintaining interest rates below market
rates could hinder the long-run mobilization of funds from domestic savings. The Bank therefore
supports moving towards market-related rates of lending to local governments and enterprises.
2.27 The Bank also recognizes that infrastructure deficiencies are large and the financial capabilitv
of local governments is limited, so central government grants will continue to be an important source
of financing for urban infrastructure. However, to reduce inefficiencies, improvement of the grant
system is desirable by making it less fragmented and more equalizing, predictable and discretionary
for the recipient local governments. The superior financial resources and implementation capacity of
the central government naturally heightened the importance of grants-in-kind. For the medium term,
in view of the pressing urban infrastucture needs, there is no real alternative to that solution.
However, it is important to avoid past problems by ensuring that: (a) only projects are implemented,
which have a high priority for both central and local governments; and (b) the financial and
institutional resources to operate and maintain the infrastructure created are available at the local
govemment level.
MI. TIREPROJECT
A. Project Origin -and Formulafion
3.1    Nationwide deficiencies in urban infrastructure and services also are true of Surabaya.
Despite investments made during Urban II, III and V (Lus 1336, 1653 and 2408) the Regional Cities
Urban Transport Project (Ln 2817) and the Second East Java Water Supply Project (Ln 2632),
flooding continues, and solid waste collection does not reach all the community. Certain areas of the
town suffer from poor road maintenance and inadequate traffic management and road capacity.
Sanitation is very inadequate resulting in wide-spread river and channel pollution. Air pollution is
serious.
3.2   For Surabaya, the IUIDP process (para. 2.3) began in 1987 to assist KMS to prepare an
affordable and implementable program based on priority local needs. In 1989, an Investment Plan
and Multi Year Expenditure Program (PJM) was produced, followed by a Fmancial Development
Action Plan (FDAP) and an Institutional Development Action Plan (IDAP). Subsequently, additions
were made to the PJM and to PDAM's program to include: (i) an initial Environmental Assessment
(PIL); (ii) preparations for bulk water for PDAM Surabaya and regional water supply requirements
via a private build-operate-transfer (BOT) operation; (iii) an assessment of recent private sector
developments to the East and West of the city; and (iv) preparation of final engineering designs for
first and second year projects included in the PJM.
3.3   The 6 year program was accepted by Cipta Karya in May 1990, by the Provincial People's
Representative Council (DPRD), KMS and the Mayor, KMS and TKPP for the IDAP and Revenue
Improvement Action Plan (RIAP) and the establishment of the Urban Management Unit was
approved. KMS then wanted to proceed with the program. However project preparation required
additional time, particulatly to assure bulk water supply for the water supply component and
complete the environmental impact assessment and establish adequate provisions for resettlement.
Meanwhile, KMS and PDAM undertook pas of the program during 1991/92 and 1992/93 using



-12-
their own funds and government INPRES and APBN grants.
3.4   During the later stages of project preparation, the following significant actions took place: (a)
the Surabaya component of the Regional Cities Urban Transport Project was completed to provide
the basis for a public-transport priority traffic management sub-component in SUDP; (b) GOI
agreed to locate the Eastem Ring Road and the water ring main in the highest priority middle
alignment (now called the Middle Inner Ring Road); and (c) major arterial storm drain design and
methodological issues were resolved.
B. Pwjet Oljeqtives and Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.5   The overriding objective of the project is to improve urban: (a) service levels particularly for
the poor, through targeting poor neighborhoods; (b) productivity and the effectiveness of
investments through better infrastructure planning and progranuning, and enhanced local
government capacity for fiscal management, revenue mobilization, project implementation and
O&M; and (c) environmental quality by enhancing local government capacity to plan, implement
and operate infrastructure in an environmentally sound fashion and also by enhancing community
participation. In the context of these overriding project objectives, project and component
sub-objectives are set out below.
3.6 Institutional Development objectives are: (a) to strengthen KMS' capacity for planning,
promoting, financing and managing development; (b) to improve coordination among levels of
government for planning and managing urban facilities and services and environmental quality; (c)
where appropriate, to engage the private sector to provide urban serices and manage environmental
quality; and (d) to create models for institutional development, to replicate the SUDP experience in
other cities.
3.7   Urban Tran= gbectives are to: (a) improve accers to and within the city by progressively
reroutng through traffic and promoting public rather than private transport; (b) improve safety and
reduce conflicts between road users using different modes e.g. pedestrians, motorized and non
motorized vehicles; (c) improve pedestrian access and decrease traffic intrusion into environmentally
sensitive areas; (d) provide adequate transport services to promote commercial redevelopment of the
city center and guide land use development in the east and west of the city; (e) achieve more efficient,
environmentally sound and socially equitable transport and land use; and (e) rationalize cargo
transport routes.
3.8   Water SUPVIY iectixe are to: (a) increase piped water supply coverage from the current
57% to 84% of the KMS population, covering an additional 128,000 properties by 1999; (b) improve
services and lower the cost of water to the poor, (c) strengthen the management, staffing and financial
viability of Kotamadya PDAM Surabaya for both water supply and human waste disposal; and (d)
protect and improve water quality in the Kali Surabaya.
3.9 The Storm Drainage objective is to reduce local flooding in existing urban areas and new
development areas and economic and health losses caused by floods and expand the affordable
supply of land for development.
3.10  Human Waste gbives are to: (a) improve on-site waste water disposal for about 200,000
people equivalent; and (b) provide off-site sewerage for about 34,700 persons in residential areas
and an equivalent population of about 21,400 in the CBD; and (c) demonstrate and evaluate the
potential for conventional and low-cost off-site sanitation and cost recovery in human waste services.
3.11  The Solid Waste objective is to increase collection from the current 65% to 90% of the waste
generated and improve collecion and landfill disposal techniques with improved services for about
470,000 people.



-13-
3.12  Kampung Improvement objectives are to improve: (a) basic settlement facilities and living
conditions for about 100,000 households in about 100 low-income areas (1200 ha), land tenure for
I 10,000 households and building permits for about 200,000 households; (b) community
participation in planning, implementing operating and maintaining improvements, and (c) provide
credit to low-income households to improve their living conditions, particularly to install septic tanks
or pit latrines, water supply connections and bathrooms and improve kitchens.
3.13  Land Management objectives of the project are to: (a) increase the efficiency and social and
environmental soundness of land use for publicly and privately-owned land; (b) increase the number
and proportion of families and businesses with legal occupation rights and building permission, and
to stimulate investment in housing, commercial buildings and urban services; (c) increase government
revenues from land use and land development and to provide funds for the financing urban
development; and (d) acquire/reserve land essential for public facilities and services.
3.14 The Environmental Management objective of the project is to ensure that the environmental
impact of SUDP is positive, including particularly that important natural resources and the rights of
project-affected resettliers are protected.
3.15 Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance strategy (CAS) for
Indonesia, highlights the need for the integrated urban development concept and enhancing
coordination of planning, implementation and supervision among all levels of government, in order
to improve the delivery of urban services and enable local governments to assume greater
responsibility for urban management. The proposed project would help GOI meet these needs in the
second largest city of Indonesia by emphasizing: the decentralization of responsibility for project
management and implementation to the Municipality of Surabaya (KMS); the integration of
environmental considerations in urban development management; the strengthening of local
government institutions and human resources for urban management; the allocation of services,
priced at an affordable level to lower income groups and underserved areas, as well as new
development areas; community participation in city investment programs; and the generation of
resources for infrastructure investment from KMS' and PDAM Surabaya's internal cash generation.
The thrust of the project is also consistent with the poverty alleviation and environmental
improvement objectives of the CAS, as the project includes targeted interventions designed to
improve the standard of living and the quality of the environment in the poorer Kampung areas of
Surabaya where 70% of the population live.
C. Projct Description
3.16  To achieve the above objectives, the project would support a program of high-priority
investments in physical infrastructure, complemented by a human resources development program to
increase the institutional capability of the implementing agencies. The project comprises the
following components.
3.17 Urban Transport and Traffic Management (Rp 305 bn. US$ 147.7 m e5uivalenti. The
component includes all work to be carried out in the City of Surabaya by Dinas P.U. (KMS Roads
and Bridges Section) over 6 years with Bank funding and arterial roads with a national or regional
function to be carried out by DG Bina Marga (GOI's Roads Department) with Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) funding (Map IBRID 25015). Also included are, collector and
local roads, bridge works and road side drains as well as improvements to footpaths, signs, signals and
level crossings. The subprojects of the latter would be decided on an annual basis to support the
project as a whole. Included in the component are 199 km of roads: (a) 8 km of improved arterial
road; (b) 33 km of partial or half width arterial road; (c) 5 km of full arterial road; (d) 140 km of
local roads; (e) 13 km of improved main collector roads; (f) all non-routine operation and
maintenance; (g) area traffic management schemes in 5 central-city sub areas; (h) building and
calibrating a traffic flow model, based on a traffic management study (TMS) completed during
project preparation and including a refonnulation of Surabaya's transport strategy to emphasize the



-14-
priority of public transport; and (i) institutional improvements, including establishing a new KMS
section (Dinas Lalu Lintas) for traffic management and strengthening of the road maintenance unit
(Annex 2).
3.18  Water Supply (Rp 425 bn. US$ 206.0 m eguivalent) The component includes all the
distribution works to be carried out by PDAM Surabaya over 6 years including: (a) rehabilitation of
the existing system; (b) expansion of the transmission mains and primary, secondary and tertiary
distribution networks; (c) a major new service connections (190,000) program, 35% of which would
be in low income KIP areas; (d) Pumping Stations at Wonocolo and Putat Gede and related elevated
and ground reservoirs; (e) a public hydrant installation program targeted towards low income
households who cannot afford a house connection in poorly served areas of the city; and (f)
construction of the Karang Pilang Water Treatment Plant 2 to treat 2 m3/sec of raw water from the
Kali Surabaya (Map IBRD 25018). The program would add about 1200 hydrants to the existing
3000, each delivering about 4.2 m3/day (equivalent to about 22 lpd). The Bank and OECF would
respectively fund works in the eastern water zones 1,2 and 3 and western zones 4 and 5 (Annex 3).
GOI has confirmed that Karang Pilang 2 would be the earliest source (in 1996) of bulk water for the
PDAM distribution system. A separate project for possible Bank funding, is being prepared to
supply adlitional bulk water to Surabaya and surrounding local goverinent areas from Umbulan
Springs about 1999.
3.19  Stormwater Drainage (Rp 369 bn. US$ 178.9 m equivalent?. The project would fund new and
improved drains (Map IBRD 25015). Many existing irrigation channels (64 km) would also be
converted to drainage only and the irrigation function would cease, to enable urban development on
the drained land. The irrigation channels to be converted to storm drainage by DG Pengairen, GOI
and funded by OECF are: (i) Gunungsari (including Balongsari) Channel and Diversion (15.6 km);
(ii) Southern catchments - K. Kebon Agung & K. Perbataasan (29.8 km); and (iii) Westem
catchments - K. Balong, K. Kandangan & K. Semimi (19.1 Iam). The Bank would fund all
stormdrains to be implemented by KMS. The program also includes 7 tide gates, land acquisition
and strengthening operation and maintenance in accordance with the expansion of the drainage
system (Annex 4). Stormwater drainage design objectives and principles are shown in Annex 5.
3.20 Solid Waste Mananement (Rp 15 bn. USS 7.0 m equivalent). The component includes new
and rehabilitated collection depots and transfer stations, new containers, waste bins, hand carts and
trucks and overhaul of existing compactors and bulldozers (Map IBRD 25016). All operation and
maintenance is included. Solid waste collection works relatively well in Surabaya. Studies of
productivity, contractor performance, shift work, recycling and landfill pollution were carried out
during project preparation. Some improvements to the operation and maintenance of the landfill
sites are required to make environmental conditions acceptable, including two shift working during
1992/93 on a pilot scale and in full by 1993/94 and measures to control water pollution from
leachates at the Kenjeran Beach landfill. OECF would wholly fund the component which is however,
an integral part of the KMS IUIDP environmental program. A recently-completed solid waste
incinerator was not included in the SUDP program but forms a separate part of KMS debt service
expenditure in the RIAP (Annex 6). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that proposals
acceptable to the Bank for mitigating pollution at Kenjeran landflU would be submitted to the Bank
by September 30, 1994.
3.21   Human Waste. (RV 51 bn. US$ 24.5 m equivalent). The main part of this component (Annex
7) is a pilot sewerage project implemented by GOI and wholly funded by the Bank, to test
appropriate sanitation systems for Surabaya, in accordance with the National Strategic Plan (Annex,
Chart 1). Disposal would be to waste stabilization ponds in a Waste Water Treatment Plant at Benowo
in North west Surabaya, instead of Tandes, a site considered earlier. Ponds would also be provided
for septic tank sludge disposal but with prior treatment by anaerobic digestion. Some sludge
collecting vehicles would also be required. The project would also rehabilitate and construct public
showers, washing and toilet facilities (MCK) in new and densely populated areas, provide a pumping
station to take dry weather polluted flows from the Gunungsari channel away from the section of Fali



-                           ~~~~~~~-15- 
Surabaya which supplies raw water to the Ngagel water treatrnent works and provide for an additional
200 m3/day septage treatment plant in West Surabaya using anaerobic digestion (Map IBRD 25017).
The. additional septage plant would cater largely to the additional septage generated by the KIP home
loan program for septic tanks and twin leaching pits. GOI and KMS provided information during
negot_ations about the specific method, financing and schedule for acquiring the Benowo WWTP site.
3.22  Included in the program are: (i) MCK construction/rehabilitation (50 units); (ii) small bore
shallow sewers for Petemon (a KIP area, density - 306 persons/ha) and Sawahan (a higher income
area, 29 ha., densicy - 273 persons/ha) and a conventional sewer scheme for the central business
district (39 ha); (iii) Sludge vehicles/pumps (4/1) units); (iv) Stabilization Ponds for a Pilot Area waste
water treatment (I Train); (v) Digesters, thickeners, drying beds and ponds for septage treatment
(2/2140/2 units); and (vi) an Institutional Action Plan.
3.23  The institutional action plan would strengthen and clarify sewerage institutional
arrangements. During the project period, KMS' existing sanitation section would continue under
Dinas Kebersihan. However, by the end of the program period, Surabaya's sewerage system would
be operated and maintained by a new Divisi Air Kotor (DIVAK - Sewerage Division) in PDAM.
Funds would also be provided under-the project to support a unit in Perum Jasa Tirta (a GOI water
quality management enterprise under DGWRD) for monitoring pollution in the Kali Surabaya and
implementing a pollution control Action Program.
3.24  Kampung Improvement (KIPM. (Rp 64 _f. US$ 30.9 m equivalent). The component consists
of.: (i) a full program of KIP physical infrastructure improvements in fringe areas and rehabilitation
of some existing KIP areas (for 600,000 people); (ii) a household loan program to assist the urban
poor to install septic tanks, and imnprove homes and bathroom facilities (15,000 loans); and (iii) a
land management program to improve the granting of planning permission, land registration and
building permits (200,000 properties). Elements (i) and (ii) above are linked with increases in tax
collection, the water connection program (parm. 3.18) and the human waste component (para. 3.21).
3.25  The KIP component (Annex 8 and Map IBRD 25016) also includes: (iv) a community
development program to enable each kampung to identify its own problems, potential and resources
and through the implementation process, to develop the community's self reliance for problem
solving; (v) Community Development/Kampung Action Plans to identify specific needs and the
methods to be used to enable effective community participation in KIP. This program will comprise
of information dissemination, training, organizational management support, and advice on financial
and technical issues; and (vi) the development and utilization of sectoral agencies to implement
community-based programs designed to develop the role of women and small businesses and
increase community awareness on health and welfare issues.
3.26 Sites and Services. The project would also fund (Rp 9 bn, US$ 3.3 m equivalent) sites and
services schemes for resettlement of people effected by the project. The sites and services schemes
would cater for the resettlement of about 16,400 people mostly from the alignment of project roads
and stormdrainage schemes (para. 5.31). About 12 hectares of land would be required for
resettlement. (Other resettlement alternatives would also be offered by KMS, including serviced plots
in fringe Kampungs and walk-up apartments, or Rumah Susun). KMS acquired as a condition of
negotiations, the land needed for resettlement in FY 1994/95 projects in south east Surabaya.
Because of the importance of the timely availability of suitable land for resettlement, agreement was
obtained at negotiations that the Borrower shall cause KMS by April 30, 1995, to acquire the land
required for resettlement during the year following April 30, 1995 in a manner consistent with its
obligations under the Resettlement and Rehabiliation Plan.
3.27  Technical Assistance and Training (TAT) to KMS. (Rp 29 bn. US$ 13.9 m equivalent). An
Urban Management Unit (UMU), attached to KMS, BAPPEDA I - the local planning organization -
wouid manage the SUDP program and coordinate urban development. KMS has received TA and
has experience in administering and utilizing TA under earlier projects. This experience together



-.16-
with the considerable TA to be provided by the project, would support and strengthen BAPPEDA II
and the UMU to provide the capacity to implement the project. UMU was fonnally established,
funded and staffed by KMS for FY 1994/95 as a condition of negotiations.
3.28  TA services for the municipal services sector, in addition to requirements for engineering
design and supervision, would be provided to: (i) carry out a study to develop Surabaya Urban Policy
to the year 2010 including environmental improvement and public transportation; (ii) improve the
revenue from the tax on land and buildings PBB; (iii) develop transport and traffic management
institutional capacity; (iv) assist KMS road and drainage maintenance units; (v) develop and train
human resources in KMS; (vi) improve land management; (vii) to develop sewerage operations and
maintenance institutional capacity; (viii) to train community development workers, including
encouraging the role of women in development; (ix) the Cleansing Department for improving
methods and to implement two shift working; (x) to develop and update the sewerage and sanitation
master plan according to the sanitation strategy plan; (xi) to establish the home loan program; (xii)
develop and implement a public service information program to ensure that program information
reaches all agencies, and obtain public support, and participation; and (xiii) develop an urban freight
distribution plan. OECF would also fund TA for a task manager in UMU. Out of the total TA costs

D. Et*ct Cost
3.37 The total project/program cost for the municipal services components of the IUIDP program,
and the water supply component, over 6 years, would be Rp 1275 billion (US$ 617.6 million
equivalent), including Rp 62 bn taxes (US$ 30.0 m). Price contingencies of 3.1% and 5.5% per
annum were applied respectively to foreign and local costs during the entire project period.
3.38  For mnicip -secrs in the IUIDP program (excluding water supply) over 6 years would be
Rp 850 bn (US$ 411.6 m) including technical assistance and engineering services, Rp 78.4 bn (US$
38.0 m), price and physical contingencies Rp 159.5 bn (US$ 77.3 m) taxes, Rp 42.4 bn (US$ 20.5
m) and incremental O&M, Rp 47.8 bn (US$ 23.2 m) and land acquisition (Rp 130.5 bn (US$ 63.3
m). The total program represents an average per capita expenditure, of the estimated 1994195 urban
population, of about Rp 55,200 (US$ 28) over a six year period. Project costs are based on: (i) final
engineering designs for first year road, stormdrainage and water supply projects; (ii) recent contracts
for similar KIP works; (iii) preliminary engineering designs and contracts for similar works in hurman
waste and sanitation; and (iv) detailed draft terms of reference for technical assistance.
3.39  For the water gsuDy_ mnonent of the program, the cost over 6 years would be Rp 425 bn
(US$ 206.0 m) including technical assistance and training and engineering services, Rp 41.9 bn (US$
20.3 m), price and physical contingencies, Rp 66.2 bn (US$ 32.1 m) taxes, Rp 19.4 bn (US$ 9.4 m),
incremental O&M, Rp 32.3 bn (US$ 15.6 m) and land acquisition (Rp 3.4 bE (US$ 1.6 m).
3.40  The proposed Bank Loan of US$ 175.0 million would finance about 28.3% of program cost
net of taxes and duties. The loan and funds from an existing Bank loan (3304-IND) and OECF loans
of US$ 174.8 million equivalent, would cover 100% of US$ 208.6 m foreign exchange costs and
local costs of Rp 844 bn (US$ 409.0 m equivalent). Counterpart funding would be provided by GOI
- Rp 176 bn (US$ 85A m equivalent); by the Provincial Government - Rp 3 bn (US$ 1.3 m.
equivalent); by KMS from its own revenue surpluses - Rp 194 bn (US$ 94.2 m equivalent); by
PDAM, Surabaya from its own revenue surpluses - Rp 97 billion (US$ 47.0 m equivalent); and by
private sector contributions - Rp 60 billion (US$ 29.0 m equivalent) of which land dedicated for new
and improved roads and a sewage treatment plant forms a high proportion.
E. Finanyin Elan
3.41   For the municipal services sectors, of the program, KMS borrowing in the form of Subsidiary
Loan Agreements (SLA) would total Rp 156 bn (US$ 75.8 m) or 18 % of the municipal services
program. Of this amount, the Bank would fund via SLA, Rp 141 bn (US$ 68.3 m) and OECF would
fund the balance of Rp 15 bn. In addition, 5.6% would be financed from INPRES grant support to
KMS from GOI. The APBN/DIP total of centrally financed projects funded from GOI's own sources
would be Rp 129 bn or 15% of the total municipal sectors program. Of the total APBN/DIP, OECF
assistance is estimated at Rp 224 bn (US$ 108.4 m equivalent) and IBRD assistance is estimated at Rp
44 bn (US$ 21.1 m). There would be a small contribution from the East Java Provincial Govemment
of Rp 3 bn, less than 1% of the total. For the water supply component of the program, PDAM
borrowing in the form of Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLA) would be Rp 299 bn (US$ 144.5 m) or
70% of the water supply program. Of this amount, the Bank would fund via SLA, Rp 177 bn (US$
85.5 m) and OECF would fund the balance of Rp 137 bn (US$ 59.0 m). The total amount financed
from the proceeds of the Bank Loan via SLA to KMS and PD&C.. from GOI, would be Rp 318 bn
(US$ 153.9 m equivalent). Assurances were obtained at negotiations on the prompt provision by
GOI offunds required for the project, including counterpart funds for INPRES grants to KMS as
anticipated in the PJM.
3.42 As a general rule, costs of incremental operations and maintenance, and land acquisition for
each service ae met from local taxes & charges (PAD) and user charges. Routine O&M is excluded
from the program although it is shown as a memorandum item in the detailed investment plans for
each sector. Technical Assistance is shown as a separate part of the program and would be financed

partly from the IBRD and OECF loans, and partly from APBN/DIP and PAD/INPRES.
3.43 Parallel Financing. Parallel financing of Rp 361 bn (US$ 174.8 m equivalent) would be
provided bY loans to GOI from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, for part
of the water supply, storm drainage and roads components of the program and related technical
assistance and for all of the solid waste component of the program.
3.44 Retroactive Financing. Project preparation is well advanced, with detailed engineering designs
and land available for the first and second year program of most components. To make an early start
on the implementation of the program, retroactive financing not to exceed US$ 10 million, or less
than 10% of the Bank Loan, would be provided from February 1993, the time of project appraisal,
for first year roads, storm drains drainage and water supply schemes.

IV. FIANCIAL ASPECTS - K(}AMAI    SUMA A  MM) AND PDAM SURABAYA
A. KMS - Financial Performance
4.1    KMS' financial performance during the period 1984/85 to 1991192 was robust with the
following features: (a) in every year, KMS had a surplus balance at the end of the year of Rp 0.3 -
6.0 billion. In two of the years there was a surplus within the year of available funds over
development expenditure and in the other five years the deficit within the year was more than
covered from balances brought forward; (b) local revenues .rom taxes and charges grew at an
average annual rate of 21% to increase from Rp 13.4 billion to kp 47.7 billion in 1991/92; (c)
assigned Revenues grew by an average of 17%/yr to reach Rp 12.3 billion in 1991/92; (d) the
income from SDO Grants grew by 10%/yr to reach Rp 10.5 billion in 1991/92; (e) routine
expenditure grew by 15%/yr; (f) development expenditure increased at a rate of 18%/yr to Rp 38.8
billion by 1991/92; (g) the routine surplus available for development after meeting routine
expenditure and debt service costs, grew by 21%/yr to an estimated Rp 29.5 bn in 1991/92,
representing a real growth of about 13%/yr. In each year of the period the routine surplus increased
over the previous year, measuring the extent to which KMS has succeeded in financing its
development program from revenue cash surpluses; (h) the debt service coverage ratio was in the
range of 3.0 to 5.0 e.g. KMS had 3 to 5 times the net cash needed to meet its debt service
obligations.
4.2    During the period of Repelita IV (1985/86 to 1989/90 ) KMS financed from its own
resources, by way of routine revenue surplus and loans, 76% of development expenditure after
meeting debt service costs. Inpres grants supported nmainly transport and communications and
regional developments projects. The major APBN-funded investments were in transport and
communication, 40%, Regional Development, 20%, and Housing, 13%, with the remaining 27% being
spread over the other 15 nationally prescribed budget sectors.
4.3   MHA budget regulations require that local government must prepare and operate balanced
budgets; the overall annual end of year balances which occurred in Repelita IV were the result of
variances between budget and actual financial performa-nce. The level of balances is not significant
in relation to the total budgets involved, representing less than 1% of the total income and
expenditure budgets for the period.
4.4    KMS - Debt Service Charges. GOI has changed the measure of local government ability to
service debt charges. Previously debt service costs had to be less than 15% of the revenue available
to pay them. Currently the,debt service coverage ratio is required to exceed 1.5. e.g. how many times
the debt service costs are covered by the uncommitted revenue. The Debt Service Ratio during the
period averaged 24% which was above the then-prescribed limit. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio
(DCR) each year was also comfortably above she presently prescribed figure of 1.5. The lowest DCR
achieved in the period was 3.2:1 in 1989/90. KMS would maintain a DCR equal to at least 1.5 during
the project implementation period.

B. KMS - Recent Financial Position
4.5    Accounting Practices. As a background to KMS accounts, three accounting practices need
explanation: (a) until the year 1991192, the payment of pensions and the receipt of the related SDO
government grant appeared as balancing items only in the memorandum account IJrusan Kas dan
Perhitungan (UKP). From 1990/91, as a result of a regulation of MHA, a separate agency has been
established (PTPaspen) to pay pensions. The actual and forecast figures exclude these amounts; (b)
the annual financing costs of the incinerator, amounting to Rp 3.5 bil!ion a year, are treated in the
KMS accounts as-a development expense rather than routine costs. - In the financial forecasts the
payment is considered as equivalent to debt service costs and is included as a separate line under this
heading; and (c) most loan repayments are included in the KMS development account, although
some are regarded as revenue expenditure, however, in the projections, all debt service-costs are
regarded as a charge on revenue.
4.6    Annual Income Growth. Based on the revised budget adjusted by allocating for the above
items, the annual income growth between 1990/91 and 1991/92 continued to be strong e.g.:
(a) Local revenue - 15%; (b) PBB - 10.5%; (c) SDO Grant - 43%; (d) Total Revenue - 19%;
(e) Routine Expenditure - 30%; (f) Routine Surplus - 6%; and (g) total funds for Development -
21%. Major development investment was concentrated as in the past, in the Transportation and
Communication sector (Rp 7.5 bn) and Regional Development (Rp 18.7 bn).
C. Financial Plan for All KMS Municial Sectors
4.7   In order to demonstrate that there would be sufficient funds available to meet the proposed
IUIDP program, and the non-IUIDP sectors, the PJM forecasts the financial situation for KMS until
1998/99 and to the year 2010 to show the full impact of debt servicing after the expiration of loan
grace periods. The whole program has been included in the financial projections even where the
project is to be financed and carried out directly by Central Government and the funding is unlikely
to pass through the books of KMS. Because there is no agreed non-IUIDP program, the forecast for
the period was based on the estimated development expenditure in 1992/93 to 1998/99 with an
average annual increase of 12%/yr during the program period (Annex 12).
4.8   The projections, and KMS' ability to carry out the investment program, depend on achieving
the predicted increases in revenue. It is important that these not be over-ambitious. From 1993/94
through 1998/99, the assumed increases average 13.6%/yr for overall local revenues and 17%/yr for
PBB in particular, reflecting steady trends during the last several years. For the same period, routine
expenditure is expected to grow 11%/yr. Sensitivity tests were made for scenarios in which revenue
growth assumptions are reduced and routine expenditure growth assumptions are increased.
4.9   In one scenario, income is predicted to increase by 5%/yr (e.g. less than in the main
prediction). and in the second scenario, routine expenditure is predicted to increase by 10%o/yr more
than in the main prediction. The outcome is sensitive to both income and expenditure assumptions.
In the first scenario, there would be years (95/96, 97/98 and 98/99) in which KMS' investment fund
requirements exceed its revenues by Rp 0.2 bn, Rp 20.5 bn and 14.1 bn respectively. In this,
relatively extreme scenario, KMS would be out of cash in 98/99 using up its accumulated cash
reserves. In the second scenario, expenditure increasing at the rate of 10%/yr more than the base
forecast (e.g. 21%/yr rather than  1I %/yr), there would also be fund shortfalls in 97/98 and in 98/99
and KMS would run out of cash in 98/99. The outcome is not very sensitive to sub-loan interest rates
on which sensitivity tests were also made. There would be no fund shortfalls even if the maximum
SLA interest rate of 14%lyr (para. 3.45) occurs.
4.10 Because of KMS' need to maintain a meaningful contribution to capital outlays, the Bank
obtained assurances at negdtiations that: (i) except as the Borrower and the Bank shall otherwise
agree, KMS shall produce, for each of its fiscal years after its fiscal year ending on March 31, 1994,



-23-
funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 30% of the annual average of KMS's capital
expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred for that year, the previous year, and the next
following fisca. years; (ii) before October 31 in each of its fiscal years, KMS shall, on the basis of
forecasts prepared by KMS and satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, review whether it would
meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (i) in respect of such year and the next following fiscal
year and shaUfurnish to the Borrower and the Bank a copy of such review upon its completion; and
(iii) if any sucht review shows that KMS would not meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (i)
for KMS's fiscal years covered by such review, KMS and the Borrower shall promptly take all
necessary measures in order to meet such requirements.
D. KMS -Cost Recovery
4.1 I  KMS service costs are directly recoverable from services provided and charged for: (i) solid
waste; (ii) sanitation; and (iii) water supply. Separate financial analysis were prepared for these
services.
4.12 Solid Waste. Users would be directly charged for solid waste services on the PDAM water bill,
as in the past. Costs to be recovered include all operating and debt servicing costs, except debt service
for an incinerator put in service in 1992, and solid waste equipment funded under Urban V, which
KMS would meet from general revenues. User charges set at Rp 650/month in 1992/93, representing
about 2% of lowest household income of Rp 25,000/mo, and rising to Rp 1560/mo in 1996/97, would
cover all costs from 1996/97 onward. Up to 1996/97, KMS would have to meet from general
revenues, a gap of between Rp 2 - 5 bn/year.
4.13 Sanitation. PDAM would directly collect charges on the PDAM water bill, from properties
connected to the sewerage system to be constructed under the project. The charge would be based on
water consumption and the volume discharged (at 100% of water consumption). Costs to be fully
recovered include operating costs and depreciation. The investment in the system and debt service
costs would be carried by GOI. Sewerage system users would also bear the costs of installing septic
tanks (Estimated costs Rp 315,000/unit in 1992193 prices), which would be funded from loans under
the project, made by the Regional Development Bank (Bank Pembangunan Daerah). Loans for
30,000 septic tanks would be for 80% of the estimated costs for not more than 36 months at an
interest rate equal to KMS' borrowing rate from GOI plus 1.75%. Loan repayments (About Rp
8500/mo, or 3.4% of average hh income in Petemon) would be retained in a revolving fund and be
relent for further new septic tank loans. PDAM would also consider rolling 50% of the capital costs
of septic tanks into overall sanitation costs to be recovered through the sewerage component of the
water bill (Operational Action Plan, # 118, Annex 11).
E. PDAM - Financial Status and Projections
4.14 PDAM Surabaya is a financially strong organization. However, PDAM will require external
financial support and strong financial management in order to increase its fixed assets by 350% over
five years and rehabilitate and expand the distribution network under the proposed project, while
absorbing the costs of obtaining additional bulk water supplies supplied from the Kali Surabaya and
the Karang Pilang 2 water treatment plant and Umbulan Springs. An essential objective of the
proposed project is, therefore, to protect and improve PDAM's financial and institutional capacity to
bear the financial, managerial and operational burden of the proposed project.
4.15  Past Performance and Present Situation. Prior to 1978, the water supply operation for
Surabaya was handled directly by the city government of Surabaya. In 1978, the PDAM Surabaya
was established to manage water supply and distribution operations as a semiautonomous enterprise
within KMS. All waterworks assets previously owned by KMS were transferred to PDAM.
4.16 PDAM's financial performance (1985-1992) has been satisfactory (Annex 12). Its rate of
return on assets has varied from 14% to 27%; the contribution to capital investment varied from 38%



-24-
to 100%; the operating ratio varied from 61% to 72%, the debt over debt plus equity ratio has been
very low (13% to 27%) and debt service coverage ratio very high (6 to 22 times).
4.17  After holding tariffs constant for about four years, the PDAM implemented a tariff increase
of about 40% on I April 1989, with consequent improvements in the 1989 and 1990 financial
results, although this was followed by significant increase in average operating expenses due to sharp
increase in administration and chemical costs, possibly reflecting the deterioration in Surabaya river
raw water quality. Another tariff increase of about 20% (to an average of Rp 454/m3) was obtained
from KMS and effected on I October 1991, although PDAM requested an increase of 31% in
anticipation of SUDP requirements. With this increase (and the deferment of the start of the SUDP
program) PDAM was able to sustain its positive financial performance in 1991 and 1992. The main
elements of the very robust 1985-1991 financial results are shown in Annex 12.
4.18 Financial Management. In 1981, under the World Bank Second Water Supply Project (Loan
1709-IND), the PDAM engaged consultants for management and financial advisory assistance
including: (a) organizing and restructuring the water enterprise; (b) management, financial and
operation policies; (c) review and development of operational manuals; and (d) accounting system.
As a result of the above assignment, the PDAM has implemented recommended financial procedures
to enhance internal control, efficiency, and report generation.
4.19  PDAM is managed and operated to a significant extent as a for-profit commercial
organization and uses an accrual accounting system. It produces important information on water
consumption by customer category, and prepates financial reports in the standard format
recommended by GOI. It also regularly prepares essential management reports on, inter alia,
personnel, chemical costs, fuel and power, unaccounted for water, billings and collections and water
quality. PDAM is audited annually by government auditors and completes audits within six months
following the end of the calendar year. Audit reports are comprehensive and are reviewed by the
PDAM Board of Directors and Management; key audit recommendations are implemented.
4.20 Profit Distribution to KMS. In accordance with PERDA (Local Regulation) No. 7. 1976, the
distribution of profits of local enterprises owned by KMS are allocated as follows- (a) 55% to be paid
to KMS as contribution to its development and routine budget; (b) 15% for general reserves; (c)
10% for production bonus; and (d) 20%  for social, education and pension contribution. However,
a covenant of IBRD Ln 2632 (Karang Pilang n), required that the contribution to KMS would be.
limited to the 1985 amount (Rp 665 m) plus an increase of 5%/yr (Letter of KMS's Mayor No,
874/1115/411.61/85 dated 30 April 1985).
4.21   Since a Mayor's letter cannot change any article of a PERDA, a subsequent letter under
KMS Mayor No. 974/776/411.21 dated 31 March 1986, required the distribution of PDAM
Surabaya's net profit to follow the above PERDA and also defined the share of KMS as 55% of
PDAM net income after tax and "cadangan tujuan" (working balance) which is calculated at 25% of
net income after tax. This base amount is also used in computing profit distributions for other KMS
enterprises. In order to meet the Ln 2632 covenant, from 1986 part of the amounts paid to KMS
were reinvested as KMS's equity in PDAM. The net amounts paid to KMS, however, did not fully
meet the condition of Loan 2632. In practice, for KMS budget preparation purposes, the
Kotamadya share of PDAM net income is recorded by KMS as their budgeted revenue for the
corresponding year. In PDAM's balance sheet, this is shown as "Advance to Kotamadya" because the
actual profit distribution is done during the following year. Actual PDAM's profit distributions and
analysis of payments to KMS for the years 1985 to 1991 are shown in Annex 12.
4.22  In the financial projections for KMS, it was assumed that the net amount paid to KMS would
follow the covenant of Loan 2632; i.e., an annual increase of 5%/yr, using the 1985 figures as the
base. The overpayment (Actual Net Payment to KMS less Proposed Payment per Loan 2632-lND
covenant) from 1986 to 1991 totalling Rp 2.3 bn would be considered a receivable from KMS and
would be offset against future Kotamadya share in net income. The amounts due are small in



-25-
relation to PDAM's new debt service obligations and the Rp 425 bn (US$ 206.0 m equivalent) costs
of the whole PDAM program, or KMS program.
F. PDAM Financial Proiections
4.23 The scale of investment proposed for PDAM under SUDP would increase PDAM's asset base
by almost 400% and add substantially to debt service. Therefore, particular attention has been paid
to ensuring that PDAM will be able to provide from internal cash generation the required
contribution to the SUDP investment program and maintain a satisfactory cash position in relation to
operating expenses. To support the investment and financial program PDAM proposes for KMS
approval, to increase average tariffs over the 1991 level every two years by 35%, starting in 1993 and
35%, 30%, 25% and 15% in respectively 1995. 1997, 1999 and the year 2001 (with local price
increases assumed to be 5.5%6/yr).
4.24 The source of additional raw water for PDAM has been a major issue, but reduces to a choice
of the timing and amounts of water to be obtained from a second water treatment plant at Karang
Pilang (Karang Pilang II), drawing water from the Kali Surabaya, or from Umbulan Spring, a source
about 70 km from Surabaya. GOI has funded and constructed a temporary package water treatment
plant for PDAM at Gubeng, a heavily polluted point in downtown Surabaya. It is questionable
whether the connecting pipeline, which PDAM would finance, is justified. The OAP provides,
therefore that PDAM provide information to the Bank to demonstrate that the Gubeng package water
treatment plant is consistently delivering potable water.
4.25 To meet the additional demand from PDAM's expanded connection base through the end of
the 1990s, the project provides for expanding the water treatment plant at Karang Pilang to increase
raw water supply by 50% (2 m3/sec) from Kali Surabaya to come on stream in 1996. However, a
further increment to the city's water supply will again be needed by 1999, by which time an
additional 2 m3/sec are expected to be available from Umbulan Springs. The financial projections
for PDAM under the project assume payment of a bulk water charge starting in 1999 for Umbulan
Spring water.
4.26 Various combinations of later or earlier supply of raw water from Karang Pilang II and
Umbulan Springs were explored to evaluate their financial impact on PDAM Surabaya using the
schedule of tariff increases in para. 4.23. Also the sensitivity of alternative raw water supply
programs to a slower house connection program, higher bulk water charges and lower-than-proposed
tariff increases was explored. The basic conclusion is that in the early years of the program,
obtaining the proposed tariff increases of 35% in 1993 and 1995 would be critical. By implementing
an average increase in January 1994 of 35% in the tariff (to Rp 5761m3) charged to consumers for
water, KMS/PDAM Surabaya cleared an important financial hurdle.
4.27 Taking Karang Pilang II as the 1996 source of additional bulk water, the financial results for
PDAM are satisfactory: the operating ratio declines to 83% in 1997, but thereafter recovers to
traditional level of 65% or better by 1999; current and liquid ratios (of 4.2 and 3.8 in 1999) and the
cash position, are highly satisfactory as service improvements from the project are realized. The
moving average ratio of cash generation to the investment program is just above the targeted
minimum of 20% in 1994 and 1995, reflecting the critical need in 1993 and 1995 for adequate and
timely tariff revisions and implementation of the connections program on which required revenue
flows also depend (Arniex 10).
4.28 For SUDP, a csfferent financial objective would be applied to PDAM than was used under
Loan 2632 (para. 4.20). Because of PDAM's need to maintain a meaningfil contribution to capital
outlays, agreement was obtained at negotiations that: (i) PDAM will produce, for each of its fiscal
years after its fiscal year ending on December 31, 1994, funds from internal sources equivalent to
not less than 20% of the annual average of PDAM's capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be
incurred for that year, the previous year, and the next following fiscal year; (ii) before September



-26-
30 in each of its fiscal years, PDAM will, on the basis offorecasts prepared by PDAM and
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, review whether it would meet the requirements set forth in
(i) above in the current and the next following fiscal year and shall fumish to the Borrower and the
Bank a copy of such review upon its completion; (iii) if the review shows that PDAM would not meet
the requirements set forth in (i) for PDAM's fiscal years covered by such review, PDAM and the
Borrower will promptly take all necessary measures in order to meet the requirements; and (iv I
PDAM will not incur any debt unless a reasonable forecast of the revenues and expenditures of
POAM shows that the estimated net revenues of PDAM for each fiscal year during thte term of the
debt to be incurred will be at least 1.5 times the estimated debt service requirements of PDAM in
such year on all debt of PDAM including the debt to be incurred.
V. PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION
A. Overall Project Coordination and Monitorine
5.1    Urban Development Coordination Team (TKPP).  he IUIDP program for Surabaya involves
several central government implementing agencies and their Departments and Directorates as well as
the East Java Provincial Government, KMS and PDAM Surabaya (Annex 1, Chart 1). An apex
institution is needed for coordination of the Surabaya IUMDP program. TKPP (Urban Development
Coordination Team, chaired by BAPPENAS and composed of Director-General level officials) and
the IMG (IUIDP Implementation Group composed of Directorate-hief level officials) were
established by GOI for this purpose and would be responsible for central interdepartmental policy
coordination and guidance for the project.
5.2   Directorate General of Human SettLements The Executing agency responsible for central
technical supervision and management for SUDP would be the Directorate General of Human
Settlements (DGCK), Public Works Department (PU). The Directorates General of Highways and
Water Resources within PU, and the Departments of Land Transport and Home Affairs (in respect of
transport and local government finance and administration) would also assist in executing the project.
Finance for the project would be provided through the Departrnent of Finance. DGCK would carry
out its responsibility through its Central Project Management Office (CPMO) and Central Project
Finance Office (CPFO). The CPMO would monitor all program and subproject implementation and
arrange or coordinate technical assistance and training. The CPFO would exercise oversight of all
project accounting and auditing and monitor loan disbursement.
5.3   Policy guidance and coordination on regional issues would be provided, as necessary, by the
Provincial Government's IUIDP Coordination team headed by the Provincial BAPPEDA. The
Provincial BAPPEDA would also be responsible for approving the IUIDP, coordination with KMS for
RIAP implementation, approving and allocating local govemment manpower positions, coordination
of infrastructure across KMS boundaries with Kabupatens Gresik and Sidoarjo and providing
Provincial funds for KMS projects.
5.4   Urban Management Unit. The program would be coordinated, financially managed and
controlled by KMS' Urban Management Unit (UMU), which has been designated as the Principal
Implementing Agency and is responsible to BAPPEDA Level II. The KMS city planning agency.
KMS and its staff have had substantial positive experience under previous Bank-funded projects with
works and components which are similar to those of SUDP; the experience should give it the capacity
to bear KMS' enhanced responsibilities for the project. The arrangements for UMU, agreed at TKPP
in May 1990 and approved by the Governor of East Java in 1990, represent a significant move
towards the decentralization of responsibility for urban infrastructure to local government. GOVKMS
confirned at negotiations that UMU has been formally established, staffed and budgeted for FY
93/94.
5.5   The UMU would consolidate information from various project implementation units (PIU)
and prepare reports on the progress of program implementation for transmittal to the central



-27-
government and the Bank. The UMU will also arrange and coordinate preparation of consolidated
project account statements for annual auditing purposes. There would be five UMU sections:
Program Control, Manpower, Coordination, Finance and Land Utilization, including resettlement,,
whose functions have been detailed in the Local Institutional Development Action Plan (LIDAP)
prepared for the Surabaya IIUIDP. An Operational Action Plan (OAP, Annex I1) was developed and
applied during project preparation, and the Bank obtained assurances during negotiations that
except as GOI and the Bank may otherwise agree, KMS and PDAM will carry out their respective
parts of the project in accordance with the OAP.
B. Implemening Agencies
5.6   The program would-be implemented by agencies of the Central and Provincial Governments
and various Dinas and Perusahaan Daerah (Enterprises) of KMS, all of which are existing
organizations which are forning (or regrouping) project implementation units (PlUs) to carry out
various components of the program.
5.7   Responsible KMS implementing organizations would be: (a) Dinas Pekerjaan Umum (DPU.
Public Works Department) Roads and Drainage Sections would be responsible for the part of the
roads and storm drain program under KMS responsibility, has previous experience in the
Bank-funded Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (RCUTP, Ln 2817 - IND) and would be
assisted by foreign and local consultants funded by the Bank under the project. The section includes
a road maintenance subsection which would be strengthened with technical assistance under the
project; (b) Dinas Lalu Lintas (Traffic Management Department), has been newly formed for traffic
engineering and management on existing roads, a need identified under the RCUTP; (c); Dinm
Kebersihan (Solid Waste Department) would be responsible for procuring and implementing
equipment, services, and civil works for the solid waste program and would implement the septage
program; (d) Dinas Tata Kota (DTKD, Planning Department) would be responsible for the KIP sector
and community development with separate working groups within the PIU for each sub component.
DTKD would also implement the land management program with assistance from the land utilization
section of the UMU to coordinate Dinas Tata Kota, Badan Pertanahan Nasional (BPN, National Land
Agency) and Dinas Pengawasan (Audit Bureau) and would be responsible for implementing the
Resettlement Plan. Bappem KIP. formed for the Bank-funded Urban V (Ln 2408 - ND), would be
the basis of a working group responsible for the physical infrastructure of the KIP program within
Dinas PU; (e) Bagian Keuangan (Finance division) and Bank Pembangunan Dearah (Regional
Development Bank), through the Kecamatan and Kelurahan offices, would operate the household and
resettlement loan programs; (f) Dinas Pendapatan Daerah (Dispenda, Revenue section) would be
responsible for KMS revenue improvement program (Annex 12), particularly including property tax
(PBB) and land valuation; and (g) PEAM  SuEabaya (Local Government Water Enterprise) would
implement the water supply component. The various Dinas would be supported by services provided
under the Sekodya (Chief Administrative Officer of KMS), particular by Bagian Keuangan (Finance
services), Bagian Kepegawaian (Personnel services) and Bagian Ortala (Organization and
Administrative services).
5.8    Central Government. Existing Central government agencies, with established implementation
units (PIU) in Kanwil offices, would implement a number of important schemes in the project: (a)
Proyek Arteri would carry out the major road works for Bina Marga on: (i) the Eastern Ring Road
(linked with K. Perbatasan); (ii) Jalan Kenjeran; (iii) Jalan Banyu Urip (linked with Gunungsari
Channel); and (iv) Jalan Margomulyo; (b) Proyek Pengendalian Banjir Surabaya would carry out
major drainage works for D.G. Pengairen on: (i) Kali Kedurus; (ii) Gunungsari channel (linked with
JI. Banyu Urip); (iii) Kali Perbatasan (linked with the Eastern Ring Road); (iv) Kali Wonorejo; and (v)
Kali Kebonagung (This work is ongoing funded by OECF); and (c) Proyek PLP Jatim, which has
considerable experience of sewerage implementation in other cities, would carry out the sewerage and
sewage treatment works for the pilot area in Petemon and adjoining extensions.
5.9   Perum Jasa Tirta (GOI national Water Resources Enterprise responsible to the Directorate



-28-
General Water Resources) would receive technical assistance under SUDP to strengthen its capacity
for monitoring and analyzing water quality in the Kali Surabaya as part of a Kali Surabaya Pollution
Control program and develop a pollution fee program.
5.10  All the subprojects and implementation units would be managed and coordinated by UMU,
particularly to integrate: (a) the Eastern Ring Road with K. Perbatasan stormdrainage improvements;
(b) 11. Banyu Urip road with Gunungsari channel stormdrainage works; (c) arterial stormdrainagn
works under the separate responsibility of Proyek Pengendalian Banjir Surabaya funded by OECF
(para. 5.8 (b)) and KMS' DPU, Seksi Pematusan (para. 5.7-(a)) stormdrainage feeder channels
funded by the Bank; and (d) water supply and distribution works funded by OECF in Westem Zones
4 (North West) and 5 (South West), including Wonocolo and Putat Gedes Pumping and storage
facilities and the Bank-funded works in Eastem Zones I (South East), 2 (East) and 3 (North East).
5.11 Project Implementation Agreements. Project Implementation Agreements (PIA) would be
drawn up between GOI, East Java Province and KMS and PDAM, Surabaya to confrmn essential
understandings and committments based upon the medium term expenditure programs (PJM),
financing plans, revenue improvement action plans (RIAP) and local institutional developnent action
plans (LIDAP). Through the PIA, KMS and PDAM would commit themselves to comprehensive
sectoral investment programs (including O&M budgets), specific revenue targets and measures to
strengthen urban management. The investment and sector plans can and will be amended to reflect
changing conditions during project implementation. However, the process of preparing and later
updating the comprehensive sectoral programs is the core of the IUIDP approach. The B.-nk
obtained assurances during negotiations that PIA acceptable to the Bank would be executed
between GO! and KMS and PDAMa
C. Iplement#tion chedul
5.12 The program would be implemented over a 6 year period from April 1993 to March 1999
(Annex l, Chart 2). Assurances were obtained at negotiatons that the Borrower will carry out the
Project in accordance with an inplementation schedule agreed with the Bank A modest program
was implemented in 199211993 with GOI and KMS' own finance, recognizing that the Bank loan
would not be available until 1993/94. Detailed designs for the major road, drainage and water
distribution works in the early years of the program were completed in August 1992. For the
foilowing critical TA, Terms of Reference (TOR) and have been cleared by the Bank and short lists of
consultants for these studies were provided to the Bank during negotiations: (a) Support for UMU for
the strategic organization, management, finance and implementation of the PJM as the Principal
SUDP Implementing Agency; (b) Design, Engineering and Supervision TA for KMS roads and
drains and the pilot sewerage project, including the waste water treatment plant at Tandes; (c) support
to the Public Information Center for resettlement; and (d) Support to PDAM for strategic, financial
and technical programming. The Technical Assistance Table Annex 14 indicates that target dates for
starting critical and other technical assistance activities. The Closing Date would be September 1999.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
5.13  Procurement of civil works, goods and services contracts would follow Bank guidelines:
(a) Large contracts costing US$ 3.0 million or more for civil works and US$ 200,000 or
more for goods and equipment would be procured following International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures using the Bank's standard bidding documents
(SBD). A General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be issued in advance to
encourage participation of eligible sources.
(b) Smaller contracts valued at less than US$ 3 million for civil works with an aggregate
value up to US$ 95.3 million, and valued up to US$ 200,000 for goods with an
aggregate value up to US$ 300,000, would be procured under Local Competitive



-29-
Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank.
(c) Works and goods contracts costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent each would be
procured by prudent local shopping up to an aggregate amount of US$ 200,000.
5.14  Procurement Review. Bidding documents for all civil works contracts exceeding US$ 1.0
million equivalent in value, and good contracts exceeding US$ 200,000 in value would be subject to
prior review by the Bank. The balance of contracts for goods and civil works, including those
reimbursed under Statements of Expenditures (SOB), would be subject to selective post-review by
the Bank. Contractors for major civil and structural works would be prequalfifed in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. All technical assistance under the Bank loan would be procured
in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants and Terms of reference for all technical
assistance, including detailed engineering design and supervision, studies and other technical
assistance would be subject to Bank prior review. For conm lex time-based technical assistance
assignments, standard contract forms acceptable to the Bank, will be used. Prior review by the Bank is
expected to cover about 27 goods and 43 works contracts, amounting to about 64% of total contract
value. Further aggregation of contracts is precluded by the partial programmatic nature of the
project, its geographical dispersion and the varied nature of the work by several agencies.

5.15  Works. The total value of ICB civil works contracts is estimated to be US$ 110.1 m, of which
the value of about 4 contracts financed by the Bank would be US$ 20.2 m and OECF would fund the
remaining balance (Table 5.1). For civil works contracts costing less than $ 3 million, local



-30-
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank or a small amount of local shopping
would be used. The value of LCB civil works would be about US$ 121.1 m in about 180 contracts of
which the Bank would fund about US$ 95.6 million of contract value in 160 contracts. OECF would
fund the remaining balance.
5.16 Goos,. Large packages of goods and equipment costing more than US$ 200,000 for items
such as water distribution pipes, pumping stations and storm drainage pumps would attract foreign
competition and procurement would be on the basis of ICB procedures. The total value of materials
and equipment contracts for ICB procurement would be about US$ 77.9 million, of which the Bank
would fund about US$ 55.0 m of contract value in 24 contracts and OECF would fund the remaining
balance. Small amounts of goods and materials with a value of US$ 23.8 m of which the Bank would
fund about US$ 0.3 m and OECF would fund the balance, would be procured through local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Foreign frms would not be
precluded from bidding but are unlikely to be interested ;-1 goods procured under LCB procedures.
Government would finance vehicles and computer purchases in accordance with the Implementation
Schedule agreed at negotiations.
5.17  Domestic preference would be provided during bid evaluation at a rate of 15% (of the CIF
price or the applicable customs duty whichever is lower) for local manufacturers participating in the
ICB procurement of goods and a rate of 7.5% for local contractors participating in the ICB
procurement of civil works.
5. 18 Disbursements. Funds for project implementation would come from the following sources:
(a) IBRD loan proceeds via the MOF on the basis of Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLA) to KMS and
PDAM; (b) Rupee loans from the Provincial Government; (c) equity from Local government
(APBD); (d) grants from Central government; (e) funds generated internally by KMS and PDAM
Surabaya; and (f) Government of Japan Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) loan
proceeds, via the MOF as SLA to KMS and PDAM and grants from Central government to its
implementing agencies. OECF will cofinance the project on a parallel basis and its initial loan
became effective in March 1993. Retroactive financing would be provided by the Bank (para. 3.44).
The following are conditions of effectiveness:
(a) execution of KMS and PDAM Project Implementation Agreements (PIAs) with GOI
acceptable to the Bank (para 5.11); and
(b) execution of Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLAs) by GOI and KMS and PDAM
Surabaya.acceptable to the Bank.
5.19 Loans to KMS and PDAM Surabaya covered by SLA would have specific bank accounts in
the Surabaya office of the Nati3nal Treasury (KPKN) to meet the Bank's share of payments for
eligible works, goods and services. Each KMS Dinas (PIU) would draw funds on the basis of its
disbursement schedule. KMS, via the UMU, would also ensure that other funds are available to
Bagian Keuangan for the project as required to meet KMS/PDAM's share of payments for project
works, goods and services. All disbursements would be recorded in both the project accounts of each
Dinas and centrally by Bagian Keuangan for the UMU.



-31-
5.20 IBRD loan disbursements would be made at the following rates for expenditures categories:
(a) 70 percent of the cost of civil works executed by PDAM under contract;
(b)  60 percent of the cost of civil works executed by KMS under contract;
(c) 100 percent of the CIF cost of directly imported goods, 100 percent of ex-factory
net of tax costs of goods supplied by local manufacturers, and 65 percent of the cost
of other items locally supplied;
(d) 100 percent of the net of tax costs of technical assistance and training costs; and
(e) 60 percent of the costs of sub-loans to households for !2trines, kitchen and home
improvements and water connections.
5.21   To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be opened by the Ministry of Finance in
the Bank Indonesia for the purposes of the project. The Special Account would be used for
withdrawals against all eligible local and foreign expenditures. The account would be maintained in
US$ and established with an initial deposit of US$ 6 million (equivalent to expected average eligible
disbursements during a four month period). Withdrawals would be made on the basis of: (a) SPM's
(Orders-to-Pay in respect of APBN/DIP expenditures or SLA funded expenditures) issued by the
MOF's Directorate TUA or its relevant KPKN offices for eligible project expenditures; and (b) debit
advices issued by Bank of Indonesia.
5.22 The Special Account would be replenished at the initiative of GOI, monthly or whenever 20
percent of the initial deposit has been utilized. Disbursements would be made against Statements of
Expenditure (SOE) procedures satisfactory to IBRD for civil works contracts valued below US$ 1.0
million, equipment contracts valued below US$ 200,000, technical assistance and training costs and
loans to households for latrines and for home improvements. Supporting documentation for SOEs
would be maintained by KMS and PDAM Surabaya.
5.23  The proposed disbursement period of 6 years is a little less than the disbursement profile for
the urban sector in Indonesia, but would be achievable because a number of contracts will be ready
for award at loan effectiveness and because of the extensive experience of project implementing
agencies with earlier Bank projects. The loan project completion and closing dates would be March
31, 1999 and September 30, 1999 respectively. Disbursement estimates are shown in Annex 1, Table
3.
E. Project Accounts and Audits
5.24 UMU would be responsible for establishing and monitoring the use of a consolidated,
uniformn, project accounting system. Financial records and accounts for each component, including
PDAM water supply, would be maintained by Bagian Keuangan for UMU, based on copies of
financial and supporting documents obtained from Kanwil, KMS and PDAM PIUn managers
concemed with project funding, payments and reimbursements. UMU would transmit to the Bank on
at least a quarterly basis, up-to-date accounts consolidated into a single project account for
monitoring purposes and annually for audit purposes. The audit statements would cover funds
provided by GOI, KMS, PDAM as well as disbursements by the Bank and OECF, and would include
opinions on all expenditures, including those made against SOE. Accountants would be appointed as
part of the advisory assistance to UMU and to PDAM. The government auditor (BPKP -Badan
Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan) audits all public agencies and would be responsible for
the annual audit of project accounts.



-32-
5.25 The Bank abtained assurances at negotiations that the Borrower will:
(a) maintain or cause to be maintained records and accounts adequate to reflect in
accordance with sound accot;nting practices the operations, resources and expenditures
in respect of the Project of the departments or agencies of the Borrower responsible for
carrying out the Project;
(b) (i) have the records and accounts including those for the Special Account for each
fiscal year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently
applied, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnish to the Bank as
soon as available, but in any case not later than nine months after the end of each
such year, the audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank shall have reasonably
requested; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning the records
and accounts and the audit as the Bank shall from time to time reasonably request; and
(c) For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Loan Account were
made on the basis of statements of expenditure, the Borrower will: (i)maintain or
cause to be maintained, records and accounts reflecting such expenditures; (ii)retain,
until at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year
in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account or payment out of the Special
Account was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts and other
documents) evidencing such expenditures; (iii)enable the Bank's representatives to
examine such records; and (iv)ensure that such records and accounts are included in
the annual audit referred to in paragraph (b) and that the audit report contains a
separate opinion as to whether the statements of expenditure submitted during each
fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their
preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.
F. :roect Reorting.. Monitoring and Bank Supervision
5.26 KMS and PDAM respectively, would appoint staff for project implementation and
coordination in the UMU and in PDAM, according to an agreed schedule. For critical technical
assistance activities, TOR for the following activities have been accepted by the Bank and consultant
short lists for them would were received prior to or during negotiations: (a) Support for UMU for the
strategic organization, management, finance and implementation of the PJM as the Principal SUDP
Implementing Agency; (b) Design, Engineering and Supervision technical assistance for KMS roads
and drains and the pilot sewerage project, including the waste water treatment plant at Tandes; (c)
Support to the Public Information Center; and (d) Support to PDAM for strategic, financial and
technical programming.
5.27  UMU would be responsible for: (a) preparing and subnitting quarterly progress reports
(QPR) on the basis of inputs from national, provincial and KMS Project Implementation Units
(PIUs), including PDAM; and (b) the QPR would cover physical progress of each sub-project,
progress on institutional development action (LIDAP) and revenue improvement (RIAP) programs,
technical assistance; compliance with loan agreement covenants; administration and finance including
project cost, commitment, and the disbursement schedule; list of executive actions to be taken by each
of the parties (GOI, KMS, PDAM Surabayt and J, . a Timur Tk. I Provincial Government); an Overall
Summary; and the linkages between other loans and SUDP; and the status of the Operational Action
Plan. Key reporting responsibilities are shown in Annex 1, Chart 1. The first quarterly report would
cover the period April-June 1994 and would be submitted to TKPP, IMG, BAPPENAS, MHA, MOF,
MPW and the Bank and OECF by April 1994 and thereafter within one and half months of the end of
each quarter. On completion of the SUDP, UMU would prepare a Project Completion Report for
submission to KMS, GOI and the Bank.



-33-
5.28  The project would require 35 weeks/year of Bank staff and consultant input for supervision in
the first 2 years of the project and 20 weekslyear in subsequent years. For supervision, mainly
financial, technical (urban. infrastructure construction) institutional and environmental expertise
would be required, supplemented from time to time by expertise in community development and
land management and planning. The latter will be especially concerned with ensuring the
implementation of the environmental and resettlement management and monitoring plans.
G. Operations and Maint,nance (O&MI
5.29  Expenditure programs for KMS and PDAM include O&M budgets in every subsector in
accordance with IUIDP guidelines. MHA Ministerial Decree No 5 of 1990 promulgated
Performance based Operations and Maintenance Management Systems (POMMS) and revised local
budgeting procedures to encourage O&M. Current O&M expenditures (for existing facilities) and
incremental O&M expenditures (for improvements and new facilities under the project) O&M
expenditures are clearly separated. Adequate budgeting for current and incremental O&M is an
important objectives of SUDP. Advisory and training assistance to KMS and PDAM would be
provided under the project to consolidate the implementation of the POMMS in KMS which has
already introduced the system and to introduce it in PDAM. The Bank obtained assurances at
negotiations that the Borrower shall, conunencing in December 1994, annually review the previous
year's operation and maintenance expenditures of KMS and PDAM and, in case these are found to
be less than the amounts agreed with the Bank. cause KMS and PDAM to make up the difference in
the said expenditures during the following year.
H. Land Acquisition
5.30 A substantial amount of land would be acquired on the right of way of project roads and
storm drainage schemes and for stabilization ponds for the sanitation and wastewater components.
Land acquisition schedules for the whole program have been developed by consultants working
closely with Dinas Tata Kota, the responsible section of KMS (para. 5.7 (d)). Land acquisition has
commenced for all projects scheduled for implementation in the first and second year of SUDP. In
an important departure from past practice, GOI agreed to fund the costs of all land required for
projects in the program owned and implemented by GOI. The Bank obtained assurances at
negotiations that GOI will ensure that: (a) fivnds are available with all implementation agencies for
acquiring land required for projects in the progrom, at least one year before the scheduled start of
schemes in the following year's progranm in accordance with the Implementation Schedule; and (b)
by April 30, 1995, KMS will acquire the land required for resettlement in FY 1995196. GOIIKMS
also provided documentary evidence of the acquisition by KMS of the land required for the first
year's resettlement requirement and information regarding the location size, schedule and
arrangements for acquiring the balance of land needed for the second year's resettlement (para.
3.26)
I. Relocation and Resettlement
5.31   About 7,200 properties and 52,500 people are wholly (31%) or partially (69%) affected by
the roads and drainage programs (Annex 1, Table 5). A detailed resettlement plan, received before
appraisal and acceptable to the Bank, in combination with assurances below obtained at negotiations,
has been prepared within the framework of the environmental assessment studies. Combinations of
cash compensation and affordable resettlement options would be provided to an estimated 16,400
people on about 2,950 properties requiring complete resettlement (Annex 1, Table 6). The chief
alternative to outright cash compensation would be resettlement in sites and services schemes which
would be financed under the project and to the extent possible, located near the original properties of
resettlers. An annual amount of about 2-4 ha of land would be acquired by KMS for resettlement,
phased in accordance with scheme implementation schedules, depending on the percentage of those
whose properties were completely acquired opted for resettlement rather than outright cash
compensation. KMS surveys indicate that about 60% of those whose properties would be completely



-34-
acquired would settle for fair monetary compensation only.
5.32  The compensation, based on surveys and prior consultation with affected people, determined
the value of the properties including land and improvements, taken together with agreed (and
affordable) terms and conditions for resettlement options, would allow displaced families to
reestablish homes and employment under conditions comparable to current locations. Terms and
conditions for resettlement options would be: (a) the area of resettlement plots offered to affected
people would be at least as large as the vacated plot, but not less than 30m2; (b) the charges for
resettlement plots will not exceed the lesser of the cash compensation received by affected people for
vacated plots (exclusive of the -compensation received for structures on the vacated plot, if any), or the
cost to KMS of providing serviced resettlement plots; (c) people who are resettled will be
expeditiously issued through BPN, renewable, transferable, long term leasehold rights (in the form of
Hak Guna Bangunan) on resettlement plots for an initial period of not less than 20 years, provided
that the lease right on the resettlement plot would not be inferior to the lease right on the vacated plot;
and (d) cash compensation would be provided at replacement cost to affected people for residential
or non-residential structures acquired by KMS for the purposes of the project.
5.33 KMS would also offer resettlement in walk-up apartments (Rumah Susun) and in serviced
plots in fringe KIP areas. In the case of apartments made available to affected people: (a) the area
would be not less than 18 m2; (b) the total amount charged to an affected person would not exceed
the lesser of the total amount of cash compensation at replacement cost for the plot and the
residential or non-residential structure acquired by KlMS, or the total cost to KMS or providing the
apartment to an affected person; and (c) renewable and transferable long term leases for not less than
20 years (in the form of Hak Sewa) would be issued expeditiously through BPN.
5.34  During project preparation, people affected by the project and requiring resettlement were
consulted and their properties surveyed. Information about affected people and properties is
maintained in a computer data base which would provide a basis for monitoring the implementation
of the resettlement plan. Procedures for timely consultation with those requiring resettlement, during
project implementation and provisions to include representation from affected communities in KMS'
Land Acquisition Committee and set up a Public Information Center, have been incorporated in the
Resettlement Plan. Relocation would be the responsibility of KMS' Dinas Tata Kota (DTKD,
Planning section) and a special section in UMU and UMU's Land Utilization Section would
coordinate Dinas Tata Kota's wsettement activities in relation to the implementation of project road
and stornidrain works which require resettlement. Resettlement arrangements would be monitored
carefully with technical assistance provided under the project
5.35 The Bank obtained assurances at negotiations that KMS will: (i) carry out the Resettlement
and Rehabilitation Action Plan, with due diligence and efficiency and in a manner satisfc-tory to
the Borrower and the Dank; (ii) provide affected people adequate land, residential and non
residential structures, cash compensation, services and R&R options in locations and on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) ensure that consultations with affected people would be
carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (iv) make the Environmental Assessment Summary
(EAS) available annually, starting in June 1994, to people, affected by the project in each year; (v)
make available to affected people either serviced plots and cash compensation or adequate numbers
of residential or non-residential structures in accordance with the objectives of the R&R Plan,
people's informed preferences (para 5.34) and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank



-35-
J. Environmental Impact Assessment and Maagement
5.36 The Bank has been supporting GOI's efforts to develop economically efficient approaches to-
urban and industrial pollution abatement and environmental protection programs under previous
projects. The Third Jabotabek project (Ln 3246-IND) assisted local governments to strengthen
capacity to monitor pollution. A proposed Industrial Efficiency and Pollution Control Project would
strengthen local govemment institutional capacity for pollution control and establish a central
Pollution Control Authority. The Second East Java Water Supply Project (Ln 2632-IND) supported
monitoring and abatement of pollution in the Kali Surabaya, albeit with limited success (para. 1.23).
The East Java Bali Urban Development Project (Ln 3304-IND) finances environmental assessment
studies and advisory assistance to the provincial commissions (Komisi Daerah - KOMDA) responsible
for EAs and monitoring. The Chairmen of the Provincial BAPPEDA I also chairs the East Java
KOMDA and Provincial IUIDP Steering Committee.
5.37 For the preparation of the proposed project, an Environmental Assessment (ANDAL), and
mitigation and management (RKL) and monitoring (PIL) plans have been prepared. An English
version of the EA Summary was distributed to the Bank's Executive Directors on January 26, 1993.
Beneficial and adverse affects, mitigation measures and -monitoring provisions for the project are
summarized in Annex 1, Table 4). The principle adverse affect would be the need to resettle people
and businesses whose properties must be completely demolished to obtain the right of way for project
roads and storm drains, for which a Resettlement Plan satisfactory to the Bank has been prepared
(paras 5.31 - 5.35).
5.38   Most project activities would have a major positive impact on water quality and quantity,
sanitation through improved solid and human waste disposal, and the environment through the
Kampung Improvement Program. The project would follow up on and strengthen Surabaya's efforts
to reduce pollution and improve water quality in the Kali Surabaya and its tributaries, the largest
existing source of water for Surabaya. Public transport priority supported by the project would help
to maintain air quality. Each PIU would be responsible for ensuring that mitigation measures of the
RKL are implemented. KMS, BAPPEDA Tk I and the DGCK would have overall responsibility for
environmental impact monitoring and evaluation at respectively local, provincial and central levels
and KMS would appoint consultants to carry out continuing resettlement surveys. It is anticipated
that measures for regional enrforcement and protection of the environment would be strengthened
through the activities of the newly-established BAPEDAL (Environmental Impact control Agency).
KMS would set up a Public Information Center to disseminate information on and receive complaints
about the project and to monitor resettlement with the assistance of consultants. Adequately-
independent representatives of affected communities and NGOs would participate in SUDP land
acquisition and resettlement processes and in the KIP community development programs. The Bank
has accepted the TOR for the Public Information Center and the consultants to UMU would provide
TA for operating the Public Information Center.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Economic Analysis
6.1    Urban Roads. A Strategic Traffic Model developed for Surabaya under RCUTP, provided
inputs for assessing economic benefits and costs of the urban roads component. Economic rate of
returns (ERR) were calculated for: (a) the whole urban road sector; and (b) packages of closely
related individual subprojects. ERR, averaging 15% without passenger time savings benefits, are
acceptable for all schemes except for the Eastern Ring Road Stage 1, which, as for all other projects,
is acceptable when passenger time savings are included. As the ERR for Ji. A. Yani to Toll Road was
not acceptable and an existing parallel link to the south of JI A. Yani to Toll Road could serve traffic
to west Surabaya for a few years, J1. A. Yani to Toll Road was not included in the program; but
should be kept under review for possible later inclusion in SUDP.



-36-
6.2   The Eastern Ring Road Stage I and II and the construction and improvement of East-West
links under SUDP, will significantly improve accessibility and promote development in several
thousand hectares in West Surabaya, where existing roads are few and discontinuous. Benefits will
increase rapidly after opening Stage I and the link with the Stage II, North-South section will further
increase usage. The alignment (middle) of the Eastern Ring Road is located several kilometers from
an existing sea dike, to the East of which are several thousand hectares of wetlands that are being
considered for development - the East Coast Development scheme. The middle alignment, which is
included in the project, is preferable to and has a better economic performance than another
proposed alignment partly on the dike and partly in the wetlands. A strategic development plan is
needed, which would be sensitive to environmental conditions, the public interest in wetlands assets
and city development needs and the functional requirements of the SUDP infrastructure investments;
the preparation of the Plan and its review by the Bank, is included in the Operational Action Plan
(OAP, Annex I I # 51). In its agreed middle alignment, the Ring Road would provide a new city
arterial road, which could also serve development on Madera Island via a proposed bridge and open
up East Surabaya for development. Improvements to drainage and water supply in the SUDP are also
necessary for and linked to this expected development.
6.3   The internal rate of return calculated from the traffic flows takes no account of expected
increases in land values. However, land values will increase over a wide corridor on either side of the
Ring Road. If land values were taken as a surrogate for benefits, instead of vehicle operating cost and
time savings, to achieve a 10% ERR, only Rp 9288 per square meter is required in the immediately
adjacent 200 m (100 m each side) over the 10.9 km length of the IRR Stage II. This represents only
a 4.64% increase over the current market price of Rp 200,000 per square meter. Most of the housing
land in the area is still only ranked by the government as Class Ill due to lack of services. The 1991
government price was Rp 91,000 to Rp 178,000 per m2. Previous experience in Surabaya following
major arterial road improvements, without associated drainage and water supply improvements,
suggest that the increase in land values will be considerably more than that required to achieve a 10%
ERR and the road is therefore considered economical.
6.4 SLQnMdrain=ge. The ERR was calculated for all channels. The costs of land acquisition and
construction were allocated to the cons-uction period and operation and maintenance costs were
calculated for a 25 year period. Benefits were calculated solely from the increase in land value at
10% increase above the official government price. All costs were in 1988 prices. The ERRs are
acceptable and vary from 25% for Kali Jeblokan and outfall gate to 165% for JI. Dharmawangsa road
side drain, but are mostly in the 40% to 80% range. As the official govemment price of land is below
the commercial rate, the calculated benefit is a conservative estimate.
6.5   Rate of return calculations were also estimated as the percentage increase in property value
needed to support a 10% ERR. This increase was compared with the estimated frequency and
severity of existing flooding in specific locations. All land values of currently flooding areas need
only increase by 11.2% to achieve an IRR of 10%. Experience elsewhere suggests that the ratio of
the value of well drained to flooded land is considerably more than this. All the works are therefore
considered economically viable.
6.6   Solid Wase Managwet. An economic analysis for the solid waste management component
was not carried out. However, the financial internal rate or return calculated on the basis of the costs
and income of Dinas Kebersihan for solid waste services demonstrated that costs could be recovered
from charges levied through PDAM bills. A Household Survey Analysis demonstrated willingness to
pay and acceptable affordability.
6.7   Sanitation. Wastewater and Pollution Control. Cost recovery for this component follows
guidelines in the National Strategy. For the proposed sewerage pilot project, a household and
commercial survey was carried out. The financial analysis of the sewerage scheme shows that
operation and maintenance charges plus debt service could be recovered with an affordable monthly
charge. An internal economic rate of return (ERR) of 14% atid a financial rate of return (FRR) of



-37-
13% was estimated.Willingness to pay was investigated in an household survey and showed that about
69% of the residents favored the scheme and the proposed average tariff would be 5-6% of
household income for households using up to 15 m3/mo of water (85 lcd equivalent) and 6-7% of
household income for households using up to 27 m3/mo (150 lcd equivalent), depending on the-area
selected. The small bore sewer and conventional sewerage schemes funded by SUDP and treatment
in stabilization ponds are the least cost, appropriate and affordable technology solutions for offsite
sanitation required for most of central Surabaya by the National Sanitation Strategy Plan (Annex 1,
Chart 3).
6.8 -- Water Supply.- For the water supply component, an intemal economic-rate of return (ERR) of
22% and a financial internal rate of return (FRR) of 16.9% was estimated. Benefits to users include:
(i) savings due to improvements in water quality and decreases in water contamination or costs
avoided in boiling water or purchasing bottled water; (ii) domestic user cost savings due to the
difference between the price of piped water (Rp 454/m3 average price increase of Oct 1991) and
delivered, non-piped (vendor/carrier) prices (Rp 3000/m3); (iii) benefits to public hydrant users due
to increased tap availability and decreased vendor prices (Rp 1000/m3 plus carrier charges); (iv)
decreased prices to non-domestic consumers valued at the marginal price paid, estimated as the
difference (Rp 60/m3) between the price paid and the average non-domestic tariff. Costs included:
(i) the project investment in rehabilitation and expansion of the Surabaya water supply; (ii) PDAM
operating costs for K Surabaya water source (and Umbulan water at the end of the project period);
and (iii) PDAM's cost to develop the Karang Pilang 2 water treaument plant.
B. -Povert and Environ lImnat
6.9   The project is expected to substantially alleviate poverty and most project activities are
targeted at improving the quality of life and environment in the poorer Kampung areas of the city,
where 70% of the population live at the highest population densities. With a population of 3.5
million in the city of Surabaya, poverty remains a serious problem for approximately 600,000
inhabitants in the project area.
6.10 While previous attention had focussed on inner city areas, poverty has also been identified in
a number of fringe areas bordering the city. In these fringe areas, the kampung population density is
significantly lower than in inner city areas, but infrastructure, community, services, employment
opportunities and access to transport are worse than in inner city Kampung areas and the city as a
whole.
6.11  KR. The Kampung Improvement program is considered by GOI to be one of the principal
means of reducing urban poverty. The KIP component will improve 480 hectares, through the
self-help Supratman scheme, utilizing available facilities and beneficiary contributions, plus 720
hectares in poorer areas which the project will finance. At least 120,000 of the city's inhabitants,
including a number of fringe area kamnpungs, would benefit from the provision of basic services and
the improvement or rehabilitation of existing facilities i.e. water supply, sanitation, drainage, access
roads and paths and household improvements as well as community development programs and the
encouragement of self-help, social and economic activities.
6.12  Home Loan Proes (HLP). Included under KIP activities, a major objective of the HLP is
to stimulate continued improvement in existing informal housing and sanitation and health
conditions in very dense kampungs by providing project loans, through the Regional Development
Bank, to lower income groups for sanitation and home improvements (i.e. kitchens and toilets).
Lower income groups are defined as poor if household income is less than 100,000 Rupiah per
month (US$ 48) according to GOrs national criteria. The water connection progrm would provide
60,000 new house connections to existing kampungs of which 14,200 would be to low income
households and a further 4,800 to low income households in the informal housing sector. Also, 35%
of new PDAM water connections would be made in Kampungs. The aWitation program anticipates
that 21,300 septic tanks and resapans will be provided to households in the low income kampung



-38-
areas and 8,600 to non-formal housing areas. The heone improvement program would benefit
15,000 low income households.
6.13  Llnd Management Program (LAMP). LAMP aims to assist low income groups to obtain
certification to the land upon which housing has been constructed. It is planned that 75,000
households in existing densely populated and fringe area kampungs will have their land permits
upgraded from Petok D to certificated holding and a further 35,000 from rental rights to certificated
holding. In addition 200,000 existing permanent houses would be granted building permits. With
stronger land use tenure, poorer households would have easier access to financial assistance and better
opportunities to improve sanitation, water services and household conditions.
6.14 Stoymdrainare. Reducing flooding in low lying areas of the city and along drainage
channels and river banks, where the urban poor generally live and suffer most from flooding, would
reduce the financial losses and health hazards of the poor and raise property values.
6.15  Solid Wge. The solid waste component would increase household solid waste collection
operations to cover 90% of all KMS households by 1994/95 as against the present 65% service level.
This will be achieved by providing containers, handcarts and improving collection and disposal
facilities and increasing street sweeping from 346 km of main road to 513 kLn over the program
period. While it is expected that overall productivity will increase, considerable new employment
opportunities will also arise. In general, many of the tasks associated with street cleansing and waste
disposal are carried out by poorer people and therefore by increased employment there will be a
tangible impact on relieving poverty. It is estimated that in accordance with the Pasukan Kuning task
force some 2 - 3000 new jobs will be created.
6.16  Sanitaton and Waste W r. The Sanitation and Waste Water component would improve waste
disposal systems and upgrade MCKs (Public shower, washing and toilet facilities) in the most densely
populated areas of the city. The component would ultimately benefit a population equivalent to
250,000 people. Together with other project activities, the sanitation and waste water components
would improve the environment and health conditions of the poor.
6.17 Public Transport. Traffic Management and Roads. The project's major road construction
and improvement program and traffic management schemes' impact on the poor would be felt
firstly by creating new informal opportunities for business activities and employment, secondly by
providing better access to urban services and accommodations, thirdly by elevating the priority of
public transport on which lower income groups rely to a greater extent than higher income groups
and fourthly by reducing air and water pollution related to excessive reliance on private transport.
6.18  Water Supply. A significant part of the water supply component is targeted towards lower
income households in Surabaya through the water hydrant program, improvements in the distribution
system, particularly in poorly-served North East Surabaya, and the provision for 30% of new
connections to be in Kampung areas. Some low income families cannot afford the price of a house
connection and/or their tenure is too insecure. In 1989, there were about 2,790 hydrants in Surabaya,
delivering on average 4.1 m3/day/hydrant. The hydrants are usually privately owned and operated.
A vendor survey carried out in September 1990, shows that hydrant owners receive water at a highly
subsidized rate (Rp 90 - Rp 1401m3) and sell it to distributing carriers for about Rp 1,200/m3. The
vendors/carriers then deliver the water to households who pay a price averaging about Rp 4,500/m3
(but varying from Rp 1,700 to Rp 8,000/m3) depending on the distance from the hydrant and on the
season (dry or rainy). According to a March 1989 housing survey, 37 percent of households rely on
vendors for drinking water in Surabaya. Through technical assistance provided under the project to
PJT, water quality and monitoring would be strengthened and possibly pollution abatement fees
introduced.
6.19  The hydrant and Kampung connections program would improve the availability of-water in
water-stressed areas of the city in general, and for low income households, in particular. The



-39-
program would provide approximately 1600 public hydrants comprising of: (a) 1200 "Hidran
Umum" (water hydrants owned and operated by individuals who would pay for the facility; (b) 30
"Terminal Air" (water tank with taps provided free-of-charge by the PDAM and operated by an
individual who pays a subsidized rate for the water delivered by PDAM trucks to the facility); and (c)
10 "Stasiun Air" (outlets where PDAM sells water to private tanker trucks). The program would
substantially decrease the average distance from consumers to the nearest outlet and so lower vender
hauling charges and the overall cost to consumers of vendor water.
C. Rigks
6.20  Land Acquisition. Delays in land acquisition processing and funding, particularly for the
roads and stormdrainage components, the wastewater treatment plant site and resettlement could
effect program implementation. Where land is required for national projects in Surabaya, GOI has
agreed to fund acquisition costs, reducing the financial constraint on land acquisition. Also land
acquisition for first and second year projects is well advanced. As agreed at negotiations GOI/KMS
provided documentary evidence of the acquisition by KMS of the land required for the first year's
resettlement requirement and information regarding the location size, schedule and arrangements for
acquiring the balance of land needed for the second year's resettlement (para. 3.26). The project's
provision for resettlement options and consultation with project-affected people (para. 5.32) should
also reduce resistance to land acquisition.
6.21 Consultant Appointments. Delays in the selection and appoint nent of consultants have
slowed project implementation in the past. For SUDP, to reduce this source of potential delay, draft
TOR have been prepared for most technical assistance activities. The Bank has accepted TOR for
critical technical assistance activities and GOI submitted during negotiations for Bank review, short
lists of consultants for critical technical assistance. The schedule for their appointment was included
in the Implementation Schedule agreed at negotiations (paras. 5.4, 5.12 & 5.38).
6.22 Water Income and Demand Projections. Water demand and revenue projections have been
over-optimistic in previous projects with adverse affects on fir ncial performance. The water supply
component of SUDP runs a similar risk. However, the selectioa of Kali Surabaya, with treatment in
Karang Pilang 2, as the 1996 source of additional raw water would reduce the risk to PDAM
compared to other schemes as PDAM will be managing the bulk water supply and the distribution
system expansion. In addition, a substantial proportion of the new connections will be in existing
service areas, reducing the dependence of revenues on the implementation of the new primary
distribution system and connections related to it.
6.23 Operations and Maintenance. A need for stronger formal arrangements for O&M
financing and provision has been identified in earlier projects. The proposed project includes both
mai- tenance expenditures and institution capacity-building for O&M and assurances regarding them
(pa.a. 5.29).
6.24 KMS and PDAM Cash Generation. KMS and PDAM would contribute about 30% and 20%
respectively of the funds required for the program from their own cash generation (paras 4.11 and
4.31). KMS revenue and expenditure has been projected with reasonably conservative assumptions
based on past performance and future prospects. There is a risk that over the 6 year project period
the revenue and/or expenditure forecasts are upset. In PDAM's case, there is a risk that the
investment program will not be matched by commensurate increases in water connections and
consumption. PDAM would substantially offset this risk by ensuring that distribution system
investments are completed in under-served existing zones. In addition, a covenant is proposed to
ensure that KMS and PDAM to contribute a minimum proportion of the investment program, failing
which, revenue-generating and/or cost-cutting measures acceptable to the Bank would be periodically
discussed and agreed (paras 4.10 & 4.28).
6.25 Sewage Disposal. Increasing the water supply, would also increase the waste water to be



40-
disposed of and risks worsening sanitary conditions and groundwater quality. The project would
approach the wastewater disposal problem by: (i) implementing a substantial pilot sewerage disposal
scheme based on the national sanitation strategy as applied to Surabaya; (ii) funding sanitation
improvements in Surabaya Kampungs for 600,000 people; and (iii) funding sanitation improvements
in areas adjacent to Surabaya with funding under the East Java Bali Urban Development Project. On
the basis of (i), above a large-scale sanitation program is expected to be devised and separately
implemented for Surabaya.
6.26 Institutional Capacity. The assignment of KMSIUMU of responsibility for coordinating
overall project implementation is consistent with the decentralization objective of GOI's urban
strategy. The approach carries the risk that KMS will find it difficult to bear its enhanced
responsibilities. The project would offset this risk by providing substantial TA to KMS/UMU at the
outset of the project (paras 3.27). In addition, it is expected that KMS' and PDAM's project
implementation should benefit from extensive experience in previous Bank projects.

Surabaya Urban Development Project
!kba_ ni and Traffic ngmntL
Background
I.    The IUIDP roads progrm prepared for SUDP produced the following outputs:
(a) Transportation Strategy; (b) Strategic Traffic Model; (c) Traffic Management Action Programs
for five areas; and (d) Five Year Traffic Management Prgram
Transportation Strategy to Year 2000
2.    General. The strategy reviewed existing conditions under the headings of (i) Land Use; (UI)
Air, port and rail tuspot; (ii) Roads and road traffic; (iv) Public transport; (v) Freigh transport;
(vi) Paricng, and (vii) Pedestians. The overall assessment was that the city is expanding with
development and economic growth but that tsport infrastructure and services are failing to meet
current demands as well as future peictions. Looked at critically. the road network Is poody
structured, lacks an operational hierarchy, and has circuitous routings with significant bottlenecks.
Road traffic congestion is increasing in intensity, location and duration. Paring facilities are
inadequate, badly organized and disrupt other trffc movements. Road traffic has a negative impact
on safety and the envimnment, particularly In the central area where an extensive one-way system at
times resembles a race track. Public transport has insufficient capacity during peak periods ana the
services of the different transport modes vary in terms of accessibility and lack coordination. There
is little understanding of passenger requirements around which to build a beter system. Freight
routes and commercial delivery permits need to be reviewed, and there are few padring provisions for
commercial vehicles to serve premises. Finally, pedestrians are faced with inadequate facilities, a
particularly hostile travel environment, and low priority for movement in the central area.
3.    These problems exist despite previous studies and considerable investment and physical
improvement in the transport system. Travel demands are currently growing at around 5% per year
and, as the city evolves in complexity, so do its transport requirments, problems and solutions
needed to resolve them.
4.    The strategic tffic model was used also in the traspotation study to examine medium-tenr
trends. Without medium term improvements, peak hour vehicle-kilometers and vehicle hours would
be expected to increase by 39% and 34% respectively by the year 2000.
5.    Under the strategy, the following objectives emerged: (a) improve the efficiency of the
transport system and access to and within the city center by progressively resticdng thrugh traffic,
and by promoting public trasport in preference to private vehicle use and reduce conflicts between
incompatible road users such as pedestians, motorized and non-motorized vehicles; (b) improve the
Quality of the Transport System and promote desirable social and environmental impacts, particularly
with regard to improving pedestrian access, general traffic safety, and decreasing instruction into
envirounentally-sensitive areas; and (c) promote the economic well-being of Surabaya thrugh
commercial redevelopment of the city center and guided land-use development of new areas to the
east and west of the city through the provision of adequate transport services and improve the freight



-58-                                     Annea 2
transport system by rationalizing and upgrading routes, and by improving freight storage and
distribution systems.
6.    These objectives are to be met by the following strategy for the central area where problems
are most severe. nTe strategy for the central area is developed around the restructuring of the
existing north-south road network. The existing system is approaching the end of its useful life in
terms of system capacity, expansion potential and its suitability for meeting the future demands of
Surabaya's changing traffic pattems. Te restructuring of the road system is intended to restain the
use of inner city roads by nonessential taffic and improve accessibility for residual traffic.
7.    Parking and public transport policies are further aimed at inducing an increased modal
diversion to public transport. The broad intent of these policies, together with a g;realy improved
pedestrian envirownent, is to permit the efficient overall expansion of the city to the east and west and
to create opportunities for the redevelopment of the center. The various elements of the srategy
address the existing inner city transport problems in the context of longer tenn city transport
conditions.
S.    Road Network. Proposals for the restructuring and strengthening of the uiban road network
are based on: (i) The implementation of a functional road hierarchy in which each road in the
network is given a primay role to fulfill; (ii) The development of a road network which discourages
the movement of transit traffic through the central area; and (iii) Increasing the general level of
accessibility for all users and minimizing trip lengths and times.
9.    The proposed road hierarchy is as follows.
-     Major Arterial Svstem: This will consist of a controlled-access inner ring road formed by
the Surabaya Malang Toil Road in the west, the East-West link between the Old and New
CBDS in the north, the Jemursar-Nginden-Menur-Ambengan-Tambaksari alignment along
existing roads in the east, and a new short link from JemuarA. Yani junction to the
proposed Mojokerto Toll intersection in the south.
Minor Arterial Svstem: This wil be as existing but with the following roads changed to
collectors: Old CBD central link; Nonhem half of Westem Truck mute; 3. Pahlawan and
A. Bubutan Eastern Truck route; and Jl. Pandegiling and its connection to 31. Sulawesi will be
upgraded to provide east-west access to the New CBD.
Collector Svstm: This will largely remain as existing except that the above arterials will fonm
new collectors; and other new collectors will be A. Semut Baru in the Old CBD to assist in
distribution near the railway and reduce congestion in the Old CBD market area, IL Tanjung
Sari to the city to increase access from the west, additional collectors the New CBD from 31.
Pandegiling, and new collectors in the north of the Old CBD to serve the port
10.   Trafric Flow SystemL 'Te Traffic Flow System is to be reorgaized. In the city center
significant volumes of transit traffic will be removed in order to: (I) allocate part of the roadspace to
selected twrvel modes on a priority basis (e.g. public transport and pedestran taffic); (ii) discourage
the use of the existing wide roads within the city center for fast-moving uninterrupted traffic flow;



- 59-                                  UAlnng2
and (iii) reorganize the traffic flow system within the central area to discourage though traffic, to
reduce inefficient circuitous tuips, and to Improve accessibility.
1}.   The rationalization of road space, the convesion of selected links to two way and the
development of traffic "platon" though increased use of traffic signals will promote public and
pedestrian transport, reduce trip lengths, increase accessibility and impede through traffic.
12.   A traffic model was developed for the new CBD on which the exisdng mainly one way
system, an extreme option of all two way operation and four other progssively-developed options
were tested using the SIOSET taffic signal optimization program. It was concluded that a system of
mainly two way roads is feasible showing considerable network benefits over the existing in terms of
redued vehicle-kilometres and vehicle-hour.
13. Public Transport. The main conclusions of the strategy are: DM are the most efficient
nsport mode. Their use will be promoted along the arterial roads, bus priority measures wil be
ntroduced and a better and more frequent service provided Bemos' primaty role will remain to
feed bus routes and give access to he new CBD. B=kl should feed bus and bemo routes and to
improve safety will be confined to specific areas and crossings
14.   Mass Transit. It should be studied as soon as possible, in order to reserve rights of way as the
New CBD is being redeveloped. Mass transit is likely to be needed in the long term.
15.   Private Transport. The proposed two way system will be adequate for the medium teim and
no major rstrictions will be necessary except to deter people from travelling to work by car.
16.   Freight. The freight terminal should be moved from Sidotopo to Waru in the South and
Gresik in the West The eastem tuck route can then be downgraded and many trucks will be able to
avoid unnecessary travel in the city. Further evening peak hour restrictions are eoommended and
the introduction of loading zones.
17.   Parking. On street parking is to be discouraged and encouragement given to off steet
parking facilities. Area specific parking regulations and pricing should be developed, dircted at
deterring car usage.
18.   Pedestrians. Attention is to be given to improving the quality and safety of foot paths. The
strategy for providing pedestrian crossing oppornmies as required in the city centers and on their
approaches is to be achieved as follows: (i) instalation of controlled pedestrian crossings at
signalized junctions through pralel phasing and/or a separate pedestian stage; (ii) the creation of
vehicle platoons by increasei signalization, and therefore gaps in the traffic flow giving pedestrms
the opportunity to cross; (iii) installation of pedestrian traffic signals at selected locations where
sufricient vehicle gaps cannot be crated by nearby signals to accommodate pedestrian demand; (iv)
reduction of the effective road width to be crossed by pedestrians by reclaiming part of the roadspace
for sidewalk widening, and/or by the construction of median islands (minimum 1.2m width) to serve
as pedestrian refuges; (v) the control of crossing movements at particulady hazardous locations by
the provision of pedestrian guardrailings (outside schools etc); (vi) installation of pedestdan bridges
(and improvement of existing bridges) at selected locations wuere at-grade pedestran crossings ar

considerd to be Inapprpriat. Linked elevated footpaths in conjuncdons with pedestrian brdges
should be considered for uban ewal pjects.
19.   Relation of Transportaon Strategy to IUIP Proposl  As the stteg was developed, the
IUIDP proposals changed. The strategy report recommends provisions which have been incorporaed
into SUDP, particularly ftat all five trafic management schemes prepared were Included in the
medium tenn program. Mme stegy also recommends further studies particulady for public
transport These studies are included in te Master Plan to the year2010 under the provision for
techical assistance.
20.   Strategy Tramc Modd. A city wide model has been buil using the MOTORS SUite of
computer model programs. This was used to provide data for the calculation of economic benefits.
This was used to provide data for the calculation of the economic benefits of roads in the program.
21.   Traffic Managmenut. Five schemes were prpaed to prelimiay engineer  standard and
evaluated by a goals achievement method. All five have been included in the medium term
investment plan to be implemented by Kotamadya Surabaya llk 1, Dinas Lalu Inas. For traffic
management to be successful it must be implemented locally as so many local organizations are
involved.
22.   Urban Roads Investment Plan. The major new road planed Is the Eastem Ring Road: a
major artery. Jalan A. Yani to the Mojokerto Toll has been defierred but must be planed with the
Mojokerto Toll road by Jasa Marga and is assumed to be by private investment, late in the pogram.
Tanjung Sari to the City is a new collector road.
23.   Major Improvements AU new roads and improved roads have been graded as top priority.
second priority and special request Probably the three most important road improvements are:
Jalan Kenjeran to provide access to the North East of the city and to the Madura Bridge
gateway.
Jalan Banyu Utip to provide access to the West of the city. It must be cnstucted in
conjunction with the Gunungsaui chamneL
Inner Ring Road Jemursafi-Nginden-Menur-Ambengan-Tambaksad, which will form the
eastem side of the major artedal inner ring road system.
24. A fuither major improvement will be Jalan Pandegiling and its connection to Jalan Sulawesi
which was included to provide access from both the East and West to the new CBD. Also important is
the completion of the East West link between the Old CBD and new CBD at Iala
Jagalan-Kalianyar-Ngalik.
25.   Bridges. New, improved and widened bridges am included as follows:
-     Improvement of Genteng Kali-Undaan Kulon in the center of the city.



- 61-|s 
-     Improvement of Qenteng Besar Mustajab. (Implemented under bpes in 1992)
-     Construction of Jagir (near Wonokromo). This may be built by pnvate investors to support
adjacent development.
-     Widening of Nginden to take the Inner ring road.
-     Construction of Eastem Ring Road at half bridge width initially.
26.   Other Roads The curret anmual progam of coUectors, local roads, bridge works road
drainage, footpats, signs. signals and street lighting will condnue annually at cue  levels of
expenditure.
27.   Road Maintenance. Considerable improvements to maintenance are planned. Recurent
maintenance will be programmed through regular inspecdon of road, bridges and culverts to establish
needs for patching, sealing cracks and minor reconstruction. Also included is periodic manace
such as overlay planned on a multiyear basis.
28.   Technical Assistance. TA included which is specifically relatd to rads is as follows:
(i) SUDP policy to the year 2010 to include public transporation studies, (il) Caental Area Traffic
Management Support to assist in implemenation of traffic management schemes and assist the
parking unit develop parking pricing schemes; (iii) Road Maintenance Urdt Assistance to develop
maintenance schedules and develop and supervise yearly maintenance proams, (iv) the preparation
of an Urban Freight Distribution Plan to develop an effective freight strategy.

SUnpI  . Detild   Moent 
1.    Background and Present Situation. Perusahaan Daerah Air Mimum (PDAM) Surabaya is the
water supply enterprise operating under the City Municipality (Kotanadya Surabaya). PDAM
curently supplies piped water to about 35% of the estimated 2.9 million present population thmugh
about 165,000 direct consumer connections, about 10% of which are shared with a neighbor. A
furlher 30% of the population obtains essential supplies from PDAM public taps, either directly or via
a water vendor. The remaining population rely on altemadve and Incrasingly unsafe sources such as
shallow wells.
2.    PDAM presently has an instaled water production capacity of 4.62 cubic meters per second
(crns), 4.3 cms of which is drawn ftom the Kali (river) Surabaya, a downsteam branch of East Java's
largest river, the Brantas. This is treated at the Ngagel and Karangplang water treatment plants - 3.3
c¶Is at Ngagel units 1, 2 and 3, and 1 ems at Karangpilang unit 1. The remaining 0.3 cms comes
from upland spring sources.
3.    Allowing for maintenance downtime at the treatment plants, an average 4.3 cms enters the
distribution system. At present, 37% of this is unaccounted-for water (UFW). About 26% is
physically lost by leakage from the distribution system, while non-physical losses of about 11% occur
from meter under-registration, under-billing and theft through illegal connections. In late 1990,
PDAM began tackling the leakage problem by, (i) zoning the distribution system in readiness for
coordinated leakage control and, (ii) rehabilitation and replacement of the older tertiary distribution
pipes and consumer connections, where studies have shown that most leakage occurs. Progress has
been slow, although UFW has declined by about 2% in the ensuing period.
4.    Water pressure is low in many parts of the distribution system, constraining supply to present
consumers. Analysis of historic data suggests that present consumption is consutained by 15-20%.
In addition, real demand surveys in 1990 and comprehensive PDAM door-to-door marketing surveys
in 1991-92, show a large unsatisfied demand for direct connections in all income groups.
5.    An updated master plan for development of Surabaya water supply system was completed in
1988, simultaneously with a potable water resources study for East Java Province. The latter
proposed that immediate increase of supply to Surabaya be met by further raw water abstraction from
the Kali Surabaya and expansion of the Kamngpilang water treatment plant. From the late 1990s, it
proposed development of another major raw water source, Umbulan Springs on the slopes of Mount
Bromo, about 60 km southeast of the city.
6.    The updated master plan proposed comprehensive upgrading and expansion of the city's
distribution system, including construction of a ring main system to equalize distribution quantities
and pressures. Better control and management of distribution was proposed by zoning.
The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) decided to develop the Umbulan Springs source ahead of
expanding the existing Karangpilang treatment plant It did so because; (i) water quality in the Kali
Surabaya was declining due to pollution; (ii) extme dry season low flows appeared to limit furher
absaction until new mgulating dams and stuces upstem  on the Brantas River were completed;
and, (iii) Umbulan Springs would serve as a regional source for other demand centers, enwute to, and
near, Surabaya.

7.    In eady 1989, 001 meceived bids from private sector consoria to finance the design and
constucion of he Umbulan Springs bulk water supply scheme as a build-operate-transfer (BoTI)
project. The consortium originly selected witidrew from negotiations in mid-1989, after which
time 001 negotiated with another consortium until July 1993. when an agreement could not be
reached and negotiations were tetminated by GOL
8.    In the meantime, a Medium Term Investmem Prgram (PJM) for integrated uban
inftructure development in Surabaya, including the water distibution component based on the
Umbulan Sprngs bulk supply source, was prepared and accepted by MPW, the provincial
govemment and, in principle, the Surabaya municipality, by mid-1990.
9.    In early 1993, GOI pxvided grant funds for procurement and eecdon of a temporary
package eatment plant in Surabaya. to help alleviate present supply shortages. This plant is
designed to produce an average 02 cms initialy and is capable of expansion to 0.5 cms. It has been
erected at Gubeng, on the banks of a downstream branch of Kali Surabaya near the center of
Srabaya. The river water quality at this point is extremely poor with a substantial uweated domesdc
sewage load and it is doubtful whether taent to potable standards can be achieved solely by a
package plant of this nature.
10.   GOI has requested PDAM to design and fund construcdon of a connecting pipeline to a
convenient point on the existing distribution system. It is intended that the plant be removed for use
elsewhere in Indonesia when permanent treatm   facilities are expanded under the Project.
11.   The 4 km by 1200 mm diameter connecting pipeline will ost about Rp 4 billion (US$ 2
million). This has not been included in the Bank-flnanced part of the Project. However, the
Operational Action Plan (OAP) specifies, that PDAM regdarly provide information to the Bank to
demonstate that the Gubeng package water treatment plant is consistently delivering potable water.
Description of the Water Supply Project
12.   Service Levels The current inadequacy of some parts of city infrstructure, in particular fte
water supply system, is having an inhibiting effect on economic growth and impwvement of
socioeconomic conditions. The Project is therefore development-led rather than demand-led. By te
year 2001, it will provide safe, reliable piped water supply to an additional 1.4 million people, raising
the service level frxm 65% of the present population to over 95% of the projected 2001 population,
at the same time satisfying the constained demand of existing consumers. These Project targets will
be achieved by doubling tated water supply and expading and infilling the distribution system to
provide an additional 190,000 consuner connections and 32,000 public taps.
13.   Over the six years (1994-1999) when the Bank loan will be disbursed, an additional 1.2
million people will be served through about 149,000 new consumer connections and 25,000 public
taps.
14.   Not less than 32% of the low income group, defined by the govenunent's Central Stadstics
Bureau as having a household income of less than Rp 100,000/monti at 1990 levels, will be served by
direct house connections, in accordance with the results of the 1990 real demand sunrey. The



64                           Anmex-3
remainder will have access to public taps wihi rmonable waking distance of their homes, most of
which are in the kampungs being improved under the KIP component. It Is expected that water sales
by vendors will be almost eliminated.
15.   PDAM has agreed to inter-free payment of connection fees by low income households
spread over five years. This fact. coupled with results of the rcent PDAM marketing survey, suggests
that low income group demand and willingness to pay for individual connections is increasing. This
demand will be monitored during Project implementation and, if necessary, the number of individual
connections will be increased with a conesponding reduction in the number of new public taps.
16. Raw Water Source. Project preparation up to January 1993 was based on the Umbulan
Springs BOT bulk water supply scheme delivering water by mid-1996 and the next stage of
Karangpilang, undt 2, by 1999. Although GOI and the BOT consortium reached agreement in
principle in late 1992 on the bulk water price to be paid by PDAM, other issues caused negotiations
to be terminated and GOI is considering other approaches to developing Umbulan Springs, possibly
as a separate Bank-funded projecL GOI has agreed that the Bank should fund construction of
Karangpilang unit 2 first, drawing water from the Kali Surabaya in 1996, with supply from Umbulan
Spfings commencing in 1999.
17.   Project Components. A new outer ring main will be constructed, forming a box shape
around the city fringes outside the existing distribution network. The ring main will be connected to
the existing distribution system at several points, principally near Ngagel trament plant on the
eastem leg, at Krembangan and other points on the nordiem leg, and at the new Putat Gede
distribution center on the eastem leg. The ring main and expanded distribution system will form an
integrated network providing efficient flow and pressure distribution throughout the system.
Increased flows from Karangpilang treatment plant will enter the system at Pt Cede to the east,
while bulk supplies from Umbulan Springs will arive at the new Wonocolo distribution center, on the
southem leg of the new ring main.
18.   The existing and expanded service area will be divided into five service Zones, numbered 1 to
5 anticlockwise from the southerly Wonocolo distribution center. The Bank wiUl fund facilities in
Zones 1, 2 and 3, in addition to Karangilang 2 treatment plant OECF will fund facilities in Zones 4
and 5, together with the new distribution centers at Putat Gede and Wonocolo.
19. Details of Project components are as follows:
A.    Under Bank funding:
1. Procurement of all materials and equipment for, and construction of:
-  Karangpilang 2 water trment plant with 2 cms capacity;
- 26 km of primary ring distribution main of 600-1500 mm diameter steel or ductile

- 524 km of secondary and tertiary distfibution mains of 80-600 mm diameter pipe,
steel or ductile iron for greater than 400 mm diameter, uPVC for 400 mm diameter
and below, in Zones 1, 2 and 3.
2. Procurement of:



65
- about 92 km of 200-60 mm diameter steel, ductile iton or uPVC pipes for
rehabilitation of parts of the existing primary and secondary distribution system;
- about 450 km of 15-25 mm diameter high density polyethylene (PE) pipe, for
89,000 new consumer connections in Zones 1, 2 and 3;
- about 350,000 consumer water meters, 230,000 sets of spare parts and equipment to
upgrade the exisdng PDAM meter workshop, for new connections and a rolling 5-
year meter recalibratlon, repair or replacement program for existing meters, in all
Zones;

Sit8bay UrbalDW&M          Plootect
Urban StoEm WatW   iaga
1. - Introduction. Tle program has the following major objectives: (a) relieve regldar flooding in
the central westem arws of the city by implementng major improvements to Gunungsar canal; (b)
carry out an extensive progm of converting inigation channels In te eastem pan of the city for
urban drainage use; (c) provide new drainage chamnls in the westem area of the city to open up
industuial development oppornities; (d) commence work in the Morokrembangan area to reduce
flooding and improve the existing environent; (e) commence the program of tide gate constuction
to maintn low water levels In priority city areas; and (f) make adequate financial provision for
Dinas Pekeriaan Umum to take full responsibilities for cleandng all drainage channels in the cty.
2.    The scope of the inestment program is a major one to be able to meet ese objectives. The
dimensions and lengths of the channels to be provided are based on the design criteria for Urban III
and V. Ihe criteria have been reviewed in the light of advances made in urban drainage modelling
over the past 5 years. but the dimensions are unlikely to change significantly. The ongoing project
for KI Kedurus is not included in SUDP. It is funded seaately by OECF. Also duig the OECF
appraisal of SUDP (AprillMay 1992) frter drainage in the West of Surabaya was included for
OECP funding. It would drain the westem area prior to industial development.
3.    Gunungsari Irrigation Channel. Gunungsari chamnel is a major problem for the city which
SUDP will resolve. The proposed ifrigation/drainage function for channel improvements previously
prpared by Brantas Hlir will not be implemented because the city development objectives of
Kotamadya Surabaya now are: (a) to drain the high level catchment areas directly to the sea to avoid
flooding the lower level catcirments; (b) to encourage industial development in the lower westem
cmament of the city, part of which development is included in the roads and water supply sectors of
the six year program. Because of these developments no irrigation water is required; (c) to minimize
land acquisition by minimizing flows by (a) making part of the existing channel return to its natural
fl back to Kali Stirabaya, and (b) using the chanel as a drain only and not providing unmecessary
Irrigation or flushing water, (d) to use the Kali Surabaya resource during the dry season for potable
water supplies;and (e) to povide dry weather flow chanmels or trickle channels within drainage
chanls thus avoiding the need for flushing.
4.    By way of (e) above the downsam  problems caused by flushing are also avoided. The
flushing outlet facilities prsently provided for Petemon from Gunungsaf channel cause major
flooding in the wet sason. Such flushing will not be necessary in the future as the Petemon area is
the pilot area for a low cost sewerage system, under the six year program, which will cater for both
black and grey water.
5.    The Gumugsari hannelJalan Banyu Urip conidor is the only available corridor for
Surabaya's drainage and major road needs. As such it must be used wisely and appropriately.
Detailed designs of this corridor have been completed, integrating the new drainage chamel and
Jalan Banyu Urip. The road has a direct connection to the tol road and leads diectly to the city
ceer from the west and therefore must be upgraded.
6.    The previous Bntas Hlir channel design is based on perceived irigation needs which are
not now required and the elevation of such a design could be too high for effective drainage. The



- 71-                                     Anne4
scheme was designed to try to make the Gunungsari dam a more useful asset as the Gunungsai
irrigation chanwel has been ineffectve for at least fifteen years. It has an insufficient slope. many
leaks, blocked syphons and its invert is full of solid waste. Thu dam however wili still be utilized to
maintain the water level at the Karmgpllang water treatnent works Intake.
7.    The conversion of the system from irigation to drainage took time for all parties involved in
drainage in Surabaya to understand, although Kotamadya Surabaya, Kepala Kanwil PU and
Pengairan Level I suppoted the change for sometime. In April 1991, at a meeting in Cipta Karya,
chaired by the Director General Cipta Karya and attended by the repesentative of the Director
General Pengairan, it was agreed that: (1) Brantas Hilir Prject should implement the scheme as
Gummngsari chamnel has traditionally been a flood control conduit; (ii) Drainage (not irrigation)
criteria would be fuly applied; and (iii) Funding from OECF will be sought (and has been obtained)
prior to requesting funds from IBRD.
8.    Conversion of IrrigatIon Canals. ITe Gunungsari modification program is a special
example of converting an irigation canal. Under the six year program it is proposed to convert eight
main irnigalion canals in the eastem part of the city. Although the existing irrigation canals are
intended to fution as drainage channels, they cannot serve the development areas satisfactorily
because water levels are too high and channel capacities are inadequate. Therefore, the work
proposed for all these channels is: deepening and widening to increae capacity, lowering bank levels
to permit entry of surface water, lining to regularize/formalize the chanel; and in some cases, minor
realignment
9 The conversions are based or draiage references shown on drawings available for each
channel. These are on about 1-2 km spacing which is suffiient for estimating program costs
(couditions were examined at 500 m intervals). Detailed design will require examination/calculation
of drainage conditions every 100 meters.
10. All of the proposed conversions are in areas where irrigation has virtually ceased, and been
taken over by new development. The investment program includes all construction and land
acquisition cdst.
11. The extent of investment for conversion (and nonmalization) is large because in Surbaya's
flat tenain, the catchments must be long and narrow; and it is not possible to construct new drainage
(conversion) in the developed upsteam areas only. The outlet channels in the most eastem parts of
the city must also be converted to avoid the need for pumping.
12.   Normalization. Six existng drainage chamels wil be normalzed to increase capacity. The
wolk includes widening, deepening and lining. The prgram also includes tree smaller local
normaization projects: (i) Kali Tambak Wedi - which is obstucted at the outlet to the sea by
sediment This is an overdue major mainteance task, which will be carried out together with a
comprehensive lining program to stabilize the drainage chamnel banks at the outlet (he tide gate is
too smaU and unsuitable, and wiU be replaced). This work has priority because it obstructs the
successful drainage of part of the areas imprved under Urban Il/Vf programs; (ii) Dharmawangsa
Area - is a local drainage problem to be improved by incrasing the capacty of a large road side
drain to alleviate a local flooding problem; and (ii) Medokan Semampir - regulation of existing
drainage channel in a new development area, to be supported by private sector grups, will alleviate a



72-                                        Anet 4
futher local flooding problem.
13. Tide Gates. iTe present amfngements for protecting the low-lying areas from high tides, and
pnsvide protection from flooding, are not effective for die following reasons: existing tide gates are
suitable only for preventing sea water from enteing the old irigation systems and damaging cmps,
because the gates are dependent on a differential head of at least 0.5 meters to operate. Stormwater
drainage channels cannot operate to full capacity under tese conditions, because there is no available
head for gate operation; the gates become obsutacted due to siltation, and do not function; and even
if the tide gates were to open more easily, they wll only open partly because of the "flume" effect.
14. Under the project, a mechanical lift gate would be used, which can be electrically or manually
operated. The ondy method of ensuring that flooding never occurs when heavy stonns and high tides
coincide, is the provision of major stowmwate retention basins and/or stormwater pumping stations.
This arragement is not affordable for Surabaya at present, and therefore no new major pumping
facilities are proposed so that fwuds can be reserved for flood relief priorities. Under the intetim
arrangements for tide control in the drainage system, the following applies:
At low tides, the gates would be fuily opened to allow free drainage of the whole catchment;
As the tide lvel increases, the gates would automatically close to maintain low water levels in
the drainage channel, thereby controlling lower groundwater levels which will benefit the road
structure;
- Modest rainhll would be mtained in the drainage system while the tide gate is closed.
Automatic control would open the gate if the upstream level becomes higher than dde level.
if very high tides and heavy rainfall ocor at the same time, then there will be flooding,
unless major inestments are made to construct large stonmwater pumping facilides.
15.   For each drainage chanmel outlet. land areas have been identified for fimre construcdon of
stormwater retenton basins with or without stormwater pumping stations. However, in order to have
real impact, the retention basins may require de-watering pumps to maintn full basin capacity; this
depends on the available area. Experience of stotmwater retention in the Morokrembangan "bozem"
shows that more attention should be given to controlling the discharge of polluted water. The
prvision of de-watering pumps will help to reduce environmentally poor conditions. If the available
area for stonmwater is !imited, then stotmwater pumps would be required to provide protection against
flooding.
16.   Morokrem       n Improvent & Western Outfall Tide Gates. The existing "bozem"
Oarge stormwater retention basin) is the worst example of environmental pollution in Surabaya. The
whole area is extremely unsightly and odorous. The tide gate does not fimction, and the existing
interconnection between the two parts of the basin has not sufficient capacity.
17. The concept of providing a stormwater retention basin for protection against the incidence of
high dde and heavy rain is accepted, but the area should be envimentally improved; de-watering
pumps are requited to mainain a low water level In the basin so that capacity is reserved for peak
storm flows; a smaller basin should be reserved. and the sides should be lined after sediment has been



73-                                    hAnnem 4
dredged; the remainder of the "bozem' should be filled with ovetburden sand. This area could then
be used as a city paut or for Idustial/commercial activities. The cost of filling is not included in the
program.but should be bore by whoever is allocated the land; a new chae and mad bndge is
required to pass under Jalan Otesik; and the tide gate must be replaced with 5 vertical lift gates with
automadc control.
18. In addition to the tide gates proposed for Kali Greges channel, which discharges through the
Morokrembangan bozem, tide gates are proposed In the westem part of the city for drainage
channels Western Low Level. Tese are required to prevent high tide inundation of the proposed
Tandes industrial area.
19.   Eastern Outfall Tide Gates A total of eleven tide gate strucures are proposed for the
improved drainage channels in the eastemn and southem areas of the city (conversion and
normalization program). The pwpose of these tides gates, is to maintain low water levels in the
drainage channels and support the subsequent investments for stormwater retention basins and/or
pumping in Repelita VI or VII.
20.   The tide gates will be manufactured in Indonesia from steel plates, with imported equipment
for motorized operton and automatic control.
21.   Operation and Maintenance. Exisdng maintenance of aU drainage channels - primary,
secondary tertiary and roadside drins - is not satisfactory. Under the project it is intended to
substantially improve the service rough institutional upgrading and addidonal opetation and
maintenance budgets.
22. The changes required were identified in detail in a separate Report on "Drainage Channel
Maintenance" (January 1990 and June 1991). The report assesses the extent of maintenance and the
organization and related costs required to cater for maintenance (as included in the PJM). The
KMS drainage section of public wotks (Dinas PU) will be inceased in size and qualifications to cater
for the work Tertiary channel cleardng wiBl be coordinated with the cleansing section (Dinas
Kebersihan) and will be contracted out where necessary or under residential gsup organizations.
23. Most of the secondary channel cleaning will be contracted out, whilst primary channel
cleaning will be mainly carried out by the drainage section in erder to maintain a core of in-house
capability.
24. Land Acquisition. The drainage sector program involves a large amount of land acquisition.
The needs assessment and procedures were set out in a separa Report on "Land Acquisition - Needs
Assessment and Procedures" - February 1990. Acquisition procedures were begun in 1992. With
minor rerouting occurring when detailed design of first and second year projects was canied out,
land requrements were further improved and land ownership identfied during the ANDAL survey.
Land acquisition plans for priority ptojects wete issued in January 1992 and for remaining projects
in APfil 1992. Resettement of displaced persons is considered in a separate repont.

(iii)health improvements and
(iv) improved environment.
Urban Drainage Principles:
I1. Planning: To be based on drainage Master plans which focus on optimising existing systems,
enable local flooding to be minimized by construction of integrated primary and secondary
systems.
2.  Technical:
 Discharge based on catchment area and rainfall intensity.
* Return Storm period 5-10 years.
* Hydraulic design - Mannings Formula.
* Optimise discharge by making efficient use of storage capacities.
* For catchments up to 150 ha - Rational Method.
* For catchments over 150 ha - Hydrograph method and dynamic wave analysis using
computer model.
3.  Economic: Each scheme is to be analysed and internal rate of return checked by estimating
the benefits from either: (i) avoided flood damage, or (ii) increased land values.
4.  Environment
* Urban drainage improvements are to proceed in parallel with improvements to solid waste
and human waste collection and disposal.
* Drainage "Continuous Flushing" is not to be used in new schemes for transportation of
solid waste and human waste. It does not work as velocities are insufficient, it is visually
intrusive and has no provision for disposal. However, provision of gates to allow
occasional flushing can be beneficial.
* Drainage alignmentslimprovemeits shall minimize displacement of people, but where
displacement of people is inevitable, fi.ll equivalent arrangements shall be made for
resettlement.
 Drainage improvements shall aim to improve the environment and eliminate stagnant water.
Where existing vegetation is destroyed, replacement trees and plants shall be planted in
positions which are compatible with operation and maintenance requirements.



-75 -                                   An= -
* Where users of existing channels cannot continue to use the channel or water for informal
irrigation, full equivalent arrangements shall be made to provide replacement facilities or
compensation.
5.  Storage:
* The storage capacity of each system shall be optimised to make best use of storage or run
off during storm events and during high tides. Transient state modelling shall be used to
simulate inflows, constraints on outflows (tides and gates) and thereby to estimate stored
volumes at any moment in time during a storm event.
* Downstream retention basins (bozems) shall be avoided where possible to avoid the
problems and costs of sedimentation, smell, high land acquisition costs, and pumping and
minimise land acquisition for land dedicated to drainage only. Problems of sedimentation
and smell are normally minimal with upstream storage.
* Online storage is where the drainage channel system itself has capacity to store the design
storm for at least part of the run-off duration.

SoWd Waste Management
1.    Introduction. The KMS have, in recent years, made great improvements in the management
of solid waste, culminating in the award of the coveted ADIPURA award in 1988, 1989, 1990 and
1991. KMS wish to extend and improve their services. Accordingly the IUIDP and SUDP include
further solid waste management improvements in the city. The thrust of the improvements is to
increase the current waste collection service level from 68% to 90% by 1998/99. Street sweeping will
also be extended and a long term waste disposal strategy will be developed. The emphasis will be on
'Value for Money". This will influence the selection of the best equipment to do the job.
2.    Computer Models. A computer model has been developed and used to evaluate the
performance and cost of existing and alternative waste collection systems by calculating the unit
collection cost. This identifies the lowest cost systems for the project period. The model calculates
the capacity and replacement year for existing trucks and helps calculate the number, and year of
purchase, of new trucks needed to achieve the service level target. also produces a complete capital
investment program and 0 & M costs for the whole project period for I and 2 working shifts per
day. A similar model calculates the life of existing waste disposal sites, calculates the year-on-year
landfill needs and establishes a land requirement program which is used to calculate the capital
investment program as well as the waste disposal 0 & M costs.
3.    Waste Collection. Waste Generation. There is little data available, but from recent studies it
was estimated that the waste generated, from all sources is equivalent to 2.92 liters per person per day.
Waste generation is dynamic. It constantly changes with population growth and changes in life-styles,
which is why the waste from one town is different from another.
4.    During the implementation of IUIDPISUDP in Surabaya it is expected that the population will
grow from 2,523,000 to 3,000,000. At the same time the amount of waste that each person produces
will increase, as life styles change. It was assumed that during the 6 year project period the amount of
waste produced per person day will change from 2.92 liters to 3.13 liters. During the project period
the waste generated within the city will increase from about 7,366 m3/day in 1991/92 to 8,901 m3/day
in 1998/99.
5.    In 1990/91, the city collected 68% (5,009 m3) of the waste generated each day. By 1998199
the target is to collect 90% (8,054 m3/day) with some city center areas getting 100% service. What
happens to the 32% of waste that now remains uncollected is not known. Possibly some 15 - 20% is
dumped in rivers to be washed out to sea and another 10 - 15% is dumped on unofficial sites on the
edges of the city; undoubtedly some is burnt.
6.    Domestic Waste KMS estimate that 68.5% (3,400 m3/day) of the waste currently collected is
domestic although from casual observation it is probably much higher at about 80% or more. It is
collected in 172 Kelurahans by handcarts organized by RT or RW. The handcarts work in areas of
about 1.0 km radius of a small transfer station (STS) (Depo/LPS) provided and operated by the
Kotamadya. Each handcart collects waste from about 200 houses daily. During the project period it
is intended to build more small transfer stations and to increase the domestic waste collection service
level by gifting 256 handcarts of 1.0 m3 capacity and 94 of 1.5 m3 capacity to RTIRW city wide.



-   -   77-  - -                    Annex 6
7.    Small Transfer Stations . The STS receive waste from locally organized, handcarts, where the
waste is sorted before being loaded into large containers of 6, 10 or 12 m3. The truck mounted
container lifting equipment is specific to each size of container and is not interchangeable. The
sorted materials are sold to recycling agents. The sorters are self employed and the more they
recover the more they earn. The system is self motivating and works well at no cost to KMS and is
recommended to continue unchanged. When full, the large containers are loaded on to a truck, fitted
with special equipment and taken to either the South Eastern waste disposal site (Keputih and
Kenjeran Beach) or the South Western Site (Lakarsantri) to be emptied. Some of the small transfer
stations do not have containers and here private contractors are used to collect and transport the waste
using open trucks. They are paid Rp. 850 per m3. 25% of the daily collection volumes are collected
this way. P is cheaper than KMS lowest cost container system (12 m3 at Rp. 1 224 per m3) but it is
unhygienic and environmentall1 damaging.
8.    Rear End Loading Compactor Trucks. About 4% of waste is collected in small (0.6 - 1.0 m3)
containers placed at the roadside. The smaller size is collected by a 6.0 m3 Rear End Loader (REL)
compactor truck and the larger by a 10 m3 REL compactor truck. They are not interchangeable.
Both trucks are poorly designed and inefficient. Neither is able to 'compact" the waste. No more
should be purchased. The collection cost of these trucks is Rp. 5,569 per m3 for the 6.0 m3 truck
and Rp. 5,482 per m3 for the 10.0 m3 truck. This is about four times more expensive than the
existing 12 m3 container system or the reconmmended FEL compaction truck. (See para 10 below).
Performance of the REL can in the meantime be improved by using a 1.5 m3 container. Such a
container has been designed which can easily be made with basic workshop tools using standard size
sheet steel.
9.    Truck Chassis. Truck chassis have been poorly selected and are too expensive, the gross
vehicle GVW is higher than is needed and the container handling equipment is badly positioned. It
was recommended that all new chassis be 7.00 tonI GVW and fitted with a second (lazy) rear axle
(Tronton) to increase the GVW to 10.00 tons. With this conversion the "on the road" price of a 10.0
ton truck will be ± Rp. 53.0 million compared with Rp. 67.0 million for the usual 14.0 ton truck.
The body or container should be positioned to give the highest possible payload by maximizing the
weight distribution to the front axle to about 24%. This assumes a density of waste of 310 kg/m3 as
determined from a limited weighing program. Further weighing is needed to accurately determine
densities.
10.   Compaction Trucks. It is recommended that no more REL compactor trucks be purchased
because they are too expensive and inefficient. During a previous Cipta Karya project in Central Java
a low cost, high performance Front End Loading (FEL) truck to collect 0.5 - 1.8 m3 containers was
designed and developed. In 1992, Cipta Karya built 3 prototypes. While these had a number of
manufacturing faults it was felt that with slight modifications, the FEL could collect the road side
containers at the lowest cost, estimated at Rp. 1,140 per m3 using a 1.5 m3 container with single shift
working and Rp. 1,816 per m3 for two shift working.
11.   Extension of Service. In order to achieve the 90% service level target, more small transfer
stations will be needed. Also most of the older Depots and LPS will need to be enlarged and
improved. Some repair work to the paved areas is needed. KMS also wish to extend the small
roadside, container service from 4% to 15% of all wastes collected. It was recommended that a FEL
compactor truck be used witl 1.5 m3 containers.



-78-                                Annex
12.   Improvements to Container Trucks. By selecting the best truck chassis, i.e. a 7.00 ton GVW
(JBB) chassis fitted with a second (lazy) rear axle to upgrade it to 10.0 tons, it is possible to transport
larger volumes of waste, each trip, to the disposal site at reduced cost. A desk study suggests that a i
16 m3 container is the best size and would reduce costs from Rp 1 441 m3, for the existing 10 m3
container truck operation, to Rp 759 m3 for single shift working and from Rp 1 076 to Rp 605 m3
for two shift working.
13.   Two Shift Working. An extension of service means that many more trucks will need to be
purchased. Trucks are expensive to operate and maintain. The cost model shows that the labor cost
is small, about 8.5% of the cost of operating a waste collection truck. The only way to reduce
operational costs is to reduce the number of trucks and use them longer each day - ideally for 24
hourslday.
14.   In order to achieve savings, a 2 shift working day is recommended. Each shift working 8.0
hours with a one hour rest period. The shift work hours could be adjusted to suit the characteristics
of the city. For Surabaya the first shift could work from 6.00 am - 2.00 pm and the second shift
3.00 pm - 11.00 pm. The annual operational cost savings at the 1994 90% service level each year are
estimated to be Rp 1 308 Million and would increase witji inflation each year.
15.   The harder trucks are worked the more maintenance they need. Even with single shift
w- king, poor maintenance equates with poor reliability and high operational costs. On the other
hand good maintenance equates with high reliability lowest operation cost.
16.   Industrial. Commercial and Other General Wastes. As far as practicable the larger waste
producers are encouraged to make their own collection and transport arrangements. This works
particularly well with the large department stores. No records are yet available of quantities or
disposal routes. However it has been arranged for each disposal site to keep improved daily records
so that this information is available.
17.   Toxic and Hazardous (Snecial) Waste. To avoid emotional misunderstandings, toxic and
hazardous wastes should be referred to as "special" wastes. It is intended that a "special" waste
incinerator would be built in Cerme, Kabupaten Gresik, originally with a March 1993 commissioning
date. Many industrial wastes can, and should, be co-disposed with domestic waste. This policy is
known as "dilute and disperse". Only a small amount of "special" waste is so dangerous as to need
costly incineration. During September/October 1991 the K.MS surveyed industrial waste generation
and disposal arrangements to develop a "Special" Waste control system. A simple and effective
system has been in use in Britain for the last 18 years, could easily be introduced in Surabaya and is
based on an approvals procedure which would best be managed by the Technical Service Section of
the Dinas Kebersihan. The reporting system should apply to proposed disposals of "special" waste by
all firms and factories in the KMS administrative area.
18.   StrtClening. Some 346 km of main streets are swept four times daily of which about 35%
is done by contractors. During the project period it is intended to extend the distance cleaned to 513
km. Most of the streets are manually cleaned by men working with a handcart. They are assisted by
three mechanical road sweepers cleaning some main roads between 2.00 am and 8.00 am. KMS say
that some streets need to be cleaned four times in a 24 hour period because otherwise they become
unacceptably dirty.



-79-                                 Annex 6
19.   The KMS sweeping is organized in to 4 shifts, each working for 6 hours inclusive of a I hour
rest break. The sweeping frequency varies with the needs of each street. Private sector sweeping is
restricted to one shift working between 7.00 am to 5.00 pm. In both cases the daily work target is the
same at 750 m2/man/shift. The work specification is to sweep 0.75 m into the road, 0.75 m into the
verge and clean the open roadside storm water drain. The daily curb distance per man is 500 m.
This is remarkably small.
20.   Although cost is not the most important criteria when establishing a street cleaning standard, it
is important. It is estimated that the cost to sweep 1 km of street is:
-     By mechanical road sweeper ..................                 Rp 3,268 /km
-     By manual sweeper (KMS) ....................                 Rp 4,103 - 4 414 /km
-     By manual sweeper (private sector) ....... I...              Rp 7,200 /km
21.   There is concern about the apparent high 0 & M cost of the street sweeping service. This
service predominantly uses manual labor which is much less expensive than the use of high cost
trucks used for waste collection. It is surprising to calculate that for FY 1991/92 street sweeping, 0 &
M expenditure will be Rp. 2,077.8 m against a lowest cost Rp. 1,066 m for waste collection. Of this
some Rp. 991.5 m will be paid for private sector street sweeping. This issues needs further
investigation. By setting realistic daily work targets, which need to be confirmed by performance
studies, annual street sweeping costs could be reduced by more than 50%.
22.   Waste DisDpos. Waste is disposed at three sites, Keputih and Kenjeran Beach in the South and
East and Lakarsantri in the South West. At current infill rates Kenjeran Beach will be full by the end
of 1996, Keputih will be full by April 1994 and Lakarsantri will be full by the end of 1993. There
are no plans or cross sections at any of these sites and the remaining capacity of each site has been
estimated. There is little that can be done to extend the life of the Lakarsantri site except reduce the
input and buy more land. The life of Keputih can be considerably extended be purchasing more land
and increasing the infill height.
23.   When landfill sites are filled, and properly restored they have a sale value. The finished levels
and contours should be designed to attract potential buyers. In the financial calculations it is
assumed that land purchased for waste disposal will be ready for sale after 5 years for, at least,
agricultural values.
24.   KMS intend to purchase a new waste disposal site at Benowo in the North west of the city and
to close Lakarsantri. In principle, the policy is sound as it will: (a) reduce the inputs at Keputih and
Lakarsantri and extend working life; and (b) give potential to reduce waste collection costs in the
Northern part of the city by reducing "lost working time" due to travel to distant disposal sites in the
South of the city.
25.   Benowo is about 19.6 km from the centroid of population while Lakarsantri is about 22 km.
Until the catchment area of the new site is decided, it is not possible to calculate the effects of this
change but as the travel distances are about the same it may be assumed that it will not substantially
change the numbers of trucks needed to achieve the target service level.
26.   Probably some improvements to the public roads leading to the Benowo site will be needed.
No road improvements are proposed for Jl. Tandes and no financial provision has been made for this
in the solid waste -sector estimates. ConsideraSion of improvement to this road will be given under the



-80-                               Annex 6
Urban Roads Sector after plans for the Benowo site are firmed up. Funding could be made available
from the general Local Roads provision in the PJM.
27.   The site is located in open farmland adjacent to some fish ponds. It is probable that these will
become polluted when the site becomes fully operational during 1994 unless operations are
monitored carefully. This monitoring must therefore be specified and supervised throughout
operation. Projections show that Benowo should be operational by the end of 1993.
29.   Landfill operations are partially controlled and the KMS have abundant plant: 8 bulldozers
and two steel wheel landfill compactors. The life of this plant varies from 4 to 13 years. They all have
maintenance defects caused by problems in purchasing spare-parts. This is discussed below.
30.   Heavy plant of this type is designed for hard work in harsh and exposed conditions, much
harder and more exposed than experienced with waste disposal operations. Accordingly this plant
should last for many years. The major cost item is the strong frame and ancillary equipment. It is
usually more cost efficient to overhaul this type of plant rather than to replace it. In the estimates it is
estimated that full overhaul cost will be about 33% of the cost of a new item. Where the costs are
estimated to exceed 60% of a new replacement, new plant is allowed for.
31.   Both Keputih and Lakarsantri sites are level, uncovered and during the during the dry season,
had surface fires. With a change in operational practice both sites could be brought up to almost full
"controlled" standard at no extra cost. The "Finger" in-filling method is recommended. Covering
material is available to be excavated at Lakarsantri but none is available at Keputih. Low cost, low
technology, composting could provide a good cover material.

.  .ulman Wnst.
1.    Background. The preparton of the human waste component was based on a compsive
sanitation acion plan with the folowing objectives: (a) defintion of institutiona and cost reoery
arrangements for sewerage; (b) definition of area of off-site sewerage pilot project and descripton of
sewerage systems with justification for both based on preiinay surveys; (c) agrement for on-site
selection of wastewater treatment facilities with indiation of land acquision. The AMDAL process to
be started; (d) inestigadon of wlingness to comect to system and to pay and sablishment of
affordability; and (e) prelminary design of both sewerage an treaumen facities with cost estimat.
2.    The preparation of the component was based on three prncipa previous studies: (1)
Wastewater and Drainage Master Plan (1976) by Camp Dresser & McKee Ina Inc; (2) Waster
Master Plan (1988) by P.T. Sangkuriang and (3) Technical Plan for Wastewater  fsuuctue (1990)
by P.T. Deseroo Development Services.
3.    Sanitation Strategy Plan. In the preparation of the Sanitation Staegy Plan the needs of
each Kelurahan were considered and the appropriate technology selected usirg selection flow chars
from the National Strategy Plan (Annex 1 Chart 3). Importn assessment criteria include:
population density; residential income; percentage of residences with septic tanks; soil permeabilt
groundwater depth; topography; and water supply provision. In the selection prcess. existing
development and population only are considered.
4.   MTe esulting sanitation strategy plan divides Suabaya into four sanitation zones:
-  Zone I  shallow sewer.
-  Zone 2: smaU bore and conventional sewere.
t Zone 3 : twin leaching pits/septic tanks with leahing pits.
- Zone 4 : septic tanks with leaching pits/single leaching pits.
5.    Based on the dranage area catchment plan for Surabaya, the city is divided into two
wastewater areas: West and East Surabaya. The boundary is formed by the Kali Surabaya, the Kali
Mas and the Jeblokan canal.
6.    Both P.T. Sangkuriang (1988) and P.T. Deserco (1990) recommended Keluahan Petemon
as the prefenred location of the basic pilot project area for sewerage, using small bore sewer
technology. It is generally agreed that Kelurhan Petemon, a medium density Kampung district on
the west side of the city, is suitable becuse: it offers IUI)P infastructure integration in so far as the
drainage sector includes plans for a dainage channel to alleviate flooding and the water supply is due
to be upgraded; income levels are sufficienly high to assist in cost recovety, and the locadon has the
metit of being within a easonable distance of the business/commercial district but Is not too nar to
be threatened with any major redevelopment prposals in the foreseeable future:
7.    Two further locations were investigated and included in the pilot ptoject area (a) 29 ha high
income residental area adjoining Kelurahan Petemon on the nonheast side; (b) a pricipal
business/commercial area (the new CBD) of 39 ha located 1.5 km southeast of Kelurahan PuetmonL

B.    Household and Commercial Survey Report. A comprebensive household and commercial
survey was carried out in Kelurahan Petemon and the two additiona ameas described above. Surveys
were made between March and July 1991 and te results ad analyses documented in a final survey
report In July 1991.
9.    The principal objectives of the survey were to detenmine: (a) the pilot project area boundafies
and the most appropriate technologies within these boundaries: (b) design parameters; in particular
per capita water consumption and hence per capita wastewater flow; average number of persons per
house; household incomes; and provision of septic tand (and emptying frequency); (c) the basis of
the sewerage tariff s .cure and (d) willingness to pay and affordability.
10.   Thee types of commercial properties were surveyed: (i) Kampung Commercial: households
which operate smaU buinesses from the premises; (ii) Commercial: businesses which are not part of
a Kampung type household; and (iiI) Large Commercial: large water users in the
business/commercial district, typically hotels and large offices. A total of 23 were included in the
survey.
11. The analysis of results includes a comparison of key data for properties on road width bands
more than 65 m, less than 6.5 m and less than 3.0 m. This served to: (a) establish the numbers of
households Types A & 'B' for tariff calculation purposes; and (b) pennit an assessment of the
advantages in sewering Kelurahan Petemon in two construction phases (those properties on road
widths exceeding 3.0 m generally being in the fint phase).
12. Sewerage. Three sewerage techmology options are generally available (conventional separate
sewerage, small bore sewers and shallow sewers). Their use depends on the conditions of application.
Based on the Nadonal Strtegic Plan technology selection guidelines it was concluded that for
Kelurahan Petemon and Kelurahan Sawahan small bore sewer technology is applicable whilst for the
business/commercial district conventional sewerage is required.
13.   Projected design populations for 2007 for each Keluahan have been calculated on the basis
of the 1990 census retuns with an assumed overall growth rate of 2% per annum. (The year 2007 is
consistent with P.T. Deserco's study of 1990). The metdw of calculation is based on that used by
Mott MacDonald IntJP.T. Sehati for PDAM. This allows for a variable increase for each Kelurahan
dependent on the 1990 population in relation to the maximum assumed density as determined from
the average income bend penaining.
14. For the three types of commercial establishments (kampung commercial, commercial and
large commercial) population equivalents have been calculated based on a combination of water use
derived frm the commercial survey and the average per capita water consumptions of the adjacent
respective residential areas.
15.   For Kelumhan Petemon (Basic Pilot Project Area) the respective average per capita water
consumption and wastewater flow figures are 138 I/cap/day and 125 I/cap/day. For Kelumahan
Sawahan (Extended Pilot Project Area 'A) the corrsponding water use and wastewater flow figures
are 209 I/cap/day and 167 I/cap/day.

16.   Small bore sewer design was caried out using Mning equatlo with a peak flow factor of
2 and a mnimuwn daily peak velocity of 0.3 mls. Conventional sewer design was carded out using
the Colebrook - White equadon with a minimum daily peak veloWty of 0.6 m/s and peac flows
detemined using Babbitts formula.
17.   Four sewerage options were considered:
-  Option 1: Kelwuaha Petemon (Basic Pilot Pioject Area) sewered usig small bore sewer
technology.
-  Option 2: As Option I with the addidon of Kelurahan Sawahan (Extended Area 'A'.
- Option 3 : As Option 2 with the inclusion of the businessLcommercial area (Extended
Aea 'B).
-  Option 4:  As Option 3 but with coverage in Kelurhan Petemon reduced rough
sewering only those properties fronting trafficked roads.
18.   Option 4 was chosen for implemention because of the inherent advantages in sewering
Kelurhan Petemon in two stages of construction. The fir stage wil benefit from the higher
propordon of houses with a PDAM comection on trafficked roads. Fwther, greater water use and
higher incomes will assist affordability and result in a grear willingness to pay the tariff charge.
T'he interval between the two stages wil give time to insal further PDAM connections and for any
development prposas in the second stage areas to become apparet and taken into account in the
design. Another advantage is the digher propotion of sepdc tanks in the first stage area, thereby
reducing the need to provide them under the project's KIP home loan program.
19.   Prefened seweae Option 4 includes the followig approximate quantities:
- 41,177 meters of gravity sewer, 100 mm to 700 mm diameter.
- 6,275 meters of pressure mains, 350 mm and 600 mm diameter.
- 6,171 house connections
- 2 submersible pumping stations.
20.   Wastewater Treabtmt . Te following taent options were compared for the treatment
of wastewater from the pilot project sewerage area to a standard of 50 mg BOD (max) and 5000
Fc/100 ml (max): (a) StabiLization ponds; (b) Aerated lagoons; (c) Oxidation ditches; and (d)
Conventional (activated sludge)
21. Stabilization Ponds were chosen on the basis of: lower overall capital cost; lower operating
and maintenance costs; ease of maintenace; and greater flexibility for futre adaptatior 3f the site
for other uses.
22.   The ponds system will consist of 4 facuative ponds in paallel (total mid-depth area 40000
m) followed by 8 maturation ponds in two streams of 4 in parallel (total mid-depth area 21,900 m).
Forthe treatment of wastes for prefenred sewerage option 4, just 3 streams out of 4 wiUl be
constructed under the program, the fourth stream being constructed following the later sewering of
the whole of Kel. Petemon. Tis later sewenng is recommended to follow soon after the proposed
program.
23. Anaerobic ponds are not required due to the Welatively weak nature of the wastewater, the

maJority being fom smal bore sewets in the residental ara whe  Interceptor septic tanks wil have
removed te solids.
24. The required additional works undts and facilities will consist of: inlet works with coarse and
fine screens; admirdstraion/laboratory bullding, workshop; site wads; and security fence.
25. The minimum total site area required for stages 1 & 2 is 11.1 ha. A fill 15 ha would be
purchased to permit extension of the works to treat wastewater from part of the industrial area.
26.   Treament Sites Two location options were compared: (a) 11.4 ba green belt zone witin the
Tandes Industrial Area in west Surabaya; and (b) Morokrembagan tidal storage lagoons (Bozem)
in the north-tn part of west Surabaya.
27. Tandes Treatment Site. Option (a), at Tandes was preferred, where sufficient land is available
with room for expansion for the preferred traunent option of stbization ponds. Contrastingly, the
Momkrembangan site would require relocation of Kasnpung residents to facilitate pond construction
with a buffer zone or necessitate an altemative expensive treent system, both of which are
undesirable.
28. Septage and Septage Treatmeln Residential septic tanks are emptied by ten private
contractors who tanker an average of 65 m3/day in the dry season and 102 m31day in the wet season.
Septage disposal is either by treatment at Keputih Treatment Plan or by discharge into the Kali
Wonorejo. The private septag tanke service serves only approximately 200,000 persons out of a
1990 Surabaya population of 2.6 million. Kotamadya Surabaya (KMS) operate their own septic tank
emptying service for govement offices, MCK's and mobile public toilets, an average of 7 m3/day
of septage being delivered to Keputlh.
29.   Keputih in East Surabaya is at presen the only septage treatment facility in the city.
Treatment is by way of oxidation ditches and settlement tanks, sludge being treated on drying beds.
No laboratory test results on the effluent are available but with an absence of polishing ponds (space
is available but they have yet to be built) and with a short (24 hour) retention in the ditches, the
effluent quality will be poor.
30.   The plant has a capacity of 200 m31day (100 m3/day through two ditches), the inflow being
704100 m3/day. The per capita septage production is estimated to be 120 U/cap/year for design
purposes; this is consist  with the figure quoted in the National Stuategy Plan A 60% increase is
allowed for the wet season.
31.   It was recommended that a second proposed septage treatment plant for west Surabaya be
designed for 200 m3/day on medium term city requirements. The main source of additional septage
would be the KIP sector home 1 m septic tank and twin leaching pit program but KMS also intends
to increase the tanker emptying service to cover a much larger proportion of the population than
served at present.
32. Two treatment methods were Investigated: oxidation ditches and anaerobic digestion.
Anaerobic digestion was recommended on the basis of signifiamny lower M & E plant cost

Surabaya Urban Development Projet
1 .    In accordance with the 00rs stra  for the new comprehenive KIP, more emphasis wil be given to
community participadon in the planing, magment and maintenance of community infrastucture. The
KIP program component consists of four parts whidch are interelated and integrated with the other sectors
of SUDP.
(a)  KIP Phydcal Infkastrumture. A comprehensive KIP Progam covering (i) new un-KIPed Inner city
areas; and (i) maintenance ad extension of KIP in previously improved inner city areas; and (tii) the
inclusion of outer-cty fringe areas.
(b)  Home Loan Program. It will p      cedit facilities to low income households to insall seic
tanks or pit latrines, water suply connections and bathroom and kitchen improvements.
(c)  A Land Ma     m t               PrograL It will maximize the number of families and
businesses with legal occupation rights and building pennissions, to stimulate their investment in
housing, building and urban services, substaially improve the management of urban land whether
already developed or to be developed dufing the medium term program of six years and enable
inrAsed revenues to be collected by aU agencies involved in land mangemet to cover the cost of
services and improved urban services.
(d)  A CommunitY DeveoPmnt SuPport Program. It is made up of. (i) a Pblic riinformati
PromM. The staegic value of ths component is that It can fcltate public acept ,
paricipation and cooperation for aU programs and projects in SUDP and ths ensure higher
effectiveness and coordination of pwgram inputs. A Public Infmation Center (PIC) will provide
information to the public on all progam components and procedures; (ii) Community DeyloDmI ni
:-rajning.Tis progm  prvides training in the community development apprach to all levels of
KMS down to RW/RT and community leveL Tis is an essenta prerequisite to ensure complete
SUDP support at aU levels and the  slanabty of this new approach to the implemeion of urban
development planning; (iii) EBni   d Hental i Halth  W=K. The sanitation and other infrstuctr
of KIP need to be more strongly supported by hlth education programs to promote and educate
the community in the importance, use and maintenae of public and private sanitation, water supply
and solid waste facilities. This approach wfll be used to generate demand for individual and group
toilets, and is most effective when preceded by an intensive heath information campaign. iTis
program will be implemented by tie Family Welfare Movemen (PKI) and the Department of Health
(Dinas Keseham ); (iv) Small-Sa  F omMic Busine- Tranng. Te aim of this PograM is to
improve the productive skills and income potential of the community. It is particularly aimed at
improving women's access to credit and traing opponunities for small business ventures. Programs
will raise the communwty's (women's) awareness and skills in identifying appropriate business
opportunities and madrets, and provide traing in literacy, book-keeping, and arrange
apprenticeships; (v) S    _.gjrilg andnSurveys, monitoring and evaluation are
essential activities inherent in KIP implementation. Surveys will be done by selected
nongovernmental orgnizations (NMOs) and/or universities as well as together with kampung
comnunities as a planning tool. Monitorng and evaluation of the above components and
sub-components will assess proess and impact, leang to imprvements in prgram  stategy.

2.   KIP Physkcl Inastructure. KIP has been canied out in Surabaya since 1968 and has covered
over 300O ha In areas with a total popuaton of over 1.2 milion people. The prcgam has been cred
out under Urban I (1975-1979), Ua III (1979-1984). Uba V (1984-1990) ad a crash program
(1989-1990).
3.  It is esOmated that a further 1200 ha requires Imprvement over the SUDP progam period of 6
years, that Is, 200 ha per year: approximately the rate of imprvement achieved since 1976. Of the 1200 ha,
about 40% or 480 ha is expected to be Improved under the self help KIP Supratnan scheme whereby self
help is matched by local government assitance. The remaining 720 ha is concentated In poorer areas
where self-help is not self-startng and would be targted under SUDP.
4. Previous KIP projects have not covered all pathways in the areas as some of these are too narrow.
However, improving these would much improve the area by providing proper drainage and water supply as
well as improved fotpath services. bnproved sanitation must go in parallel to any furtier improvements
and ths would be encouaged as private investment under the Home Loan Pmgram. Post-KIP or KIP
maintenane Is esdmated to be required for about 326 ha.
5.   Based on an average population density of approximately 500 peopleare (appem-KIP data) the
number of beneficiaries over six years of SUDP KIP would total 600,000 or 120,000 households.
Approximately 40,000 households (20% and 80% female and male headed households espectively) are in
the low income bracket (less than Rp.100,000/month) and would be targeted for selected program inputs.
6.   KIP sites have been sorted on a zonal basis - a zone is defined as an Ura Development Unit
(UDU)/Unit Wiayah Pengembangan according to the RJYRK definition. This will ensure not only
systematic uban infrastructure plannig of all SUDP input, but lo complete woverage of the zone with
the synchrnzation of irastructure development for all sectors Thee zones are shown In Table xx by
implemenion year. The whole zone will be screened before KIP implementation to identfy any
kampungs which do not appear on the Lst but which need KIP.
7.   Sitekampug selection is based on three main groups of citeria: (i) the prevalence of flooding, the
availability of drinking water, sanitation and health facilities(fi) accessibility to these seices within the
kampung, community attitudes towards development aedvities, population density, Income levels, education
facilities and the age of the kampung-, and (Iii) the genesal physical condition, building layout, and the
prospective impact of improvements. A total of 103 kampungs have been selected for KIP over the six
year period (Table 3 attached). The target group for KIP remains low income families.
8.  Home Loan Progran. It consists of three packets for sanitation, water conection and bathroom,
toilet and kitchen improvements. (Che Home Loan Program is described in a publication issued by the
IUIDP muld-sectoral team eady in 1989.) The water connection funding packet has been moved from the
KIP sector to the water supply sector as it is easier for PDAM to monitor direcdy. The water comection fee
of Rp.125,000 to low income households will be paid bak to PDAM via the monthly bili at Rp.2,000 per
month taking 5 yeas and 2 If2 months to be paid off with no interest charged (Source : KIP Survey Report
September 1991). PDAM would also consider capitalizing the connection cost in water user charges. The
three packets are: (a)ohe    ot          packet assumed that sepdc tanks would be the main
form of sanitation provided eifter individually or shared. This sfill holds true for zone 2 of the sanitation
action plan for the dense and very dense kampungs which are in the ovel hidgher income central part of
the city. In the outer areas septic tanks may sti be suitable in zon 4 if affordable but for the beneficiaries



-87 -                               Anx   8
of the sanitaion loan. leahi  pits or pit latfines will be most suitable and acceptable. About 30.000
sanitation units are allowed for in the program; (b) Home imyement packeLThe baduooms, toilet md
kitchen packet was shown by the households survey to be of higher prority than either sanitation or water
supply improvements. About 15,0l.    loan units for home improvement are anticipated; (c) A  fter
packet has been included for program management of the   usehold  aw  The exisfting
kelurahm RWIRT organization currently used to collect existing solid waste charges would be set up to
advise woring groups in each kelurahan. A steering sub committee will set up under the coordinabon of
the finance and coordination sections of the UMU. Credit will be made available via the Regiond
Development Bank (BPD) and be in a similar form to existing small credit schemes which the BPD
administer in other sectors.
9. Land Management Improvement Program. The program aims to improve the area planning
process, upgrade zoning regulations and acdvides, and exend and tensify the use of the digital plotting
system to upgrade land registadon holding to cerified land rights in informal housing areas, and increase
the issue of building permits to allow easy conversion from temporary to semipermanent to permanent
construction in accordance with minimum standards.
(a)  A land planWlg and prission grnng naket wi fomalize minimum standards, prepare or
update spatial plans for some 8,000 ha of urbanized land, simplify planning pennission procedures
and extend and intensify the use of the digital plotting system and data base for use with land titles
building permits, property evaluation and infrasucture network data.
(b) A land Muegistratn packcet aims to upgrade land rghts from the semi formal Petok D attachment to
a certificate holding where possible by: (i) Preparing minimum planning standards, conditions and
qualifications to obtain the Petok D attachment for the many informal areas which do not yet have
even Petok D; (ii) Conversion of Petok D to certificate holding for about 35,000 Informal
households in existing dense and very dense kampungs and a fiurer conversion from state land
rental rights to certificate holding for 35,000 informal households also in dense and very dense
kampungs; (iii) Similar conversion of Petok D to certified holding for 40,000 informal households
on the urban fringe; (iv) Simplifying the conversion process and promodon of the scheme; and (v)
Providing land rights drawings from Agraria to Dinas TataKota for tranportation onto the digital
plotting system.
(c)  A building Wermit grantng  cket will eview the pwsent building permit conditions and simplify
procedures to allow building permits to be upgWaded from temporary to semipermnanen or from semi
permanent to pennanent. About 200,000 existing permanent houses should be granted building
permits over the program period.
10. Community Development Support Program. An essendal feaure of the new comprehensive KIP is
the attention which would be given to community development prior to each individual improvement
program being formulated; conamunity development support will be provided throughout the KIP
planrdng and implementation stages, with women's involvement e,.couraged as primary users of
infrastructure services, and, continue to the point where the community organizations are stong enou to
ensure satisfactory maitnance of the infrastructure facilities.
11. This will be accomplished by utilizing and developing existing community based semi govenmnent
(i.e. Village Resilience Committee (LKMD) and the Family Welfare Movement (PKK)) and



*88-                                      I
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at the earliest stages in KIP pogtamning and thoughout KIP
implementation so as to strengthen the community's commitment. Invulvemen and self-reliance.
12. The LKMD, an organization established by a  esidential Dec   No. 28. 1980 will also be used as a
catalyst for generati'% interest and participation of all community grups. Their role has been deflned as a
vehicle for the community's participation in planning and development. and is therefore an appropiate
organization to further activate within this role. LKMD will oversee the formadon of sanitation committees
at kanpung level, which will be responsible for working togetbet with te KIP PIU and the NGO
Community Development Adviser (CDA).
13. Prior to the selection of specific kampungs for inclusion in KIP, zonal development wilts (UDU) will
be surveyed to identify existing community organizations, their level of effectiveness and their willingness
to participate in KIP. A preiminary assessment was done of NOOs in Surabaya (KIP Sector Report
September 1991).
14. The selected NGO Community Development Adviser, the sanitation committee and the KIP PIU
Team wi}l woik with the community on a detailed community-based survey and develop a Community
Action Plan for each kampung where physical, and environmental conditions indicate that improvements
are needed, and where community willingness to participate is high
1S. Women in Development tWID). Indonesian women represent just over 50% of the tot. population
if 183 million (1990). Similarly, women comprise about 52% of Surabaya's 2.5 mimllon registered
population - a higher proportion of women are clustered more centrally in uiian business areas while men
are in higher proportions near the outer industrial areas.
16. To assess the gender roles of men and women in .uraya's kampungs, a sample survey of both male
and female headed households(3) was carTied out in September 1991 to design an appropriate WID sub-
component for KIP. This KIP Household Survey (September 1991) reviewed the socio-economic situation
of women in Indonesia, WID issues and constaints to women's fuller participation in development and
r-!evant linkages, such as NGOs, womenes groups etc., which could assist in supportng specifically designed
components for KIP. It also assessed the households heads' willingness to be involved in KIP, and their
access and control of money, resources and power. The survey shows:
the majority of female-headed households tend to fall into the low income bracket, and this may pose
certain risks to young children and women,
-    female household heads tend to have lower educational atainment thm either male household heads
or their wives,female household heads have lower literacy rates than male heads of household,
*    participation of female household heads in community prblem identification and implementation is
significantly lower than for their male counterparts,
-    female headed households have lower rates of land ownership an male headed households, and
-    access to formalized credit appears sricted by their low income levels and lack of knowledge about
credit institutions.
17. Indonesia's history and cultural traditions have generally been favorable to women The legal basis
for equal righs and opportunities for women is substntial, and have been stessed in the Basic Guidelines
of State Policy (GBHN) of 1978, 1983 and 1988. However, within the formal legal franework and despite
its generally progressive character, there are stil many hindrances tD th ful and complete integration of



-89 -                                Anm=z X
women into al aspects of Indnesian ie.
I8. Some of these problems are generic, in that they are faced by men and women alike (thase reled to
poverty), while otiers ae specific to women, such as eady maiage and unequal treatment In some
economic sects, hat stem from socio-cultural factors which cut across econo-mic strat Neverteless there
are certain conditions existent among women that a program ought to attempt to improve, and there is a
fairly wide consensus on what those condidons are: heath. urition, woddoad, access to resouves
commensurate with responsibilities rols in decision-making in the househo!d, in the community and in
the planning of program.
19. Women have key roles (wife. mother and educator of the next generadon) in finily welfare. 001
programs therefore aim to develop womenes knowledge and skills in the fields of health nutitio  social
life, family planing, and environmental saniton. Partially because of tis, the Infant mortality rates ha' 
declined impressively over the years. However, poverty and malnutrition remain key variables explaining
mortality differentials in Indonesia.
20. In Indonesia as elsewhere, lttle recogition is given to women's additional productive and commnwty
management roles. Since ehese roles are interdependent this is a critical detenninant in identifying their
needs - as reproductive and domestic work often determine the extent to which women have free time to
participate in managing work at the community level.
21. To facilitate and support KIP implemention and the fuler integmtion of women into its planning,
implementadon and maintenance the folowing components are essential. (Explained in more detail in the
KIP Sector Report September, 1991.)
(a)  A Public Service Information ProgramL The objectives are rlated to spedfic target groups which
are outlined below and would be furdher developed by TA during pmgram implementation. They
are: (i) To ensure that program infonnation reaches all relevant GOI agencies and intersectoral
departments inwolved in SUDP implementation, creating a sense of pride and potential kudos for
regional and national development accomplshments, particuarly focusing on its community
development and women in development orientation; (ii) To gain public support and interest
(stimulate a sense of belonging) in the dynamic development process necessaty to make their city,
Surabaya, a more beautiful and enjoyable environment In which their famflies can live a healthy and
prosperous life; and (iii) To provide infomation about project activities to communities in project
areas and to facilitate motivation, ensure participation and cooperation in project implementation;
and (iv) To ensure that any ptental public inconvenience caused by SUDP projects are adequately
advertised (road works for example, with altematve routes clearly indicated and to publicize
resettlement/compensadon Issues and options and infonmation readily available at the PIC.
(b) Community Development Training. This sub-component is to assist involved agencies,
organizations and individuals to effectvely contribute and participate in community development
partcularly in plan   implemenng and maintaining urban services. Training will be given to the
inhabitants of those areas where KIP is implemented, KMS officials, the KIP PIU, the local
Govemment officials at kelurahan level, locally-based organizations, non govenmmental
organizations, and other involved agencies. The objectives are: (i) to increase the communitys
awareness of KIP, (ii) to develop e o ional capacity and self-reliance of local communities
so they can fuly paticipate in the planming, management and operation of KIP urban services; (iii)



-90-                                 Annex 8
To develop the role of women In umban developntM (iv) impove the coordnation between setra
agncies in implementin commuity based programs; (v) upgade the capaities of project
implementing agenides; (vi) provide sucIenty-quallIed fleld staff, extension workers and NOOs to
support community development; and (vii) promotion of tuust aind understanding between program
implementation agencies and service bendefciades.
(c)  Environmentl Health Trahinig. This sub-component is to provide an Itnsive health informadoio
campaign before KIP implementationL CommAlhy health workers (kader), which usually aeady
exist in each kampung, will receive refresher trainn to promote and educate the community in the
lmporare, use and maintenace of public wi pfivate sanitadon. water supply and solid waste
facilities. The objective Is to generae demand for the Home Loan Program, and motivate formation
of a sanitation committee. This program will be implemented by the PKK and he Department of
HealthL
(d)  Small-Se-ale Economic Business Training. In general, the non-formal education (NFF) programs
ar designed to provide opportnities for acquiring basic litracy, improving prductive skills and
Income potential, and aising awareness of community health and associated program& An advantage
to this appoach is the aility to custom-design individual programs from among a range of topics to
refec local conditions, skiLls and weeds, and the use of peer mutual teaching techniques.
22. There are two main program themes: (a) a basic literacy program aimed at persons who have not
completed prmay school and providing not only tr     in literacy and nneracy, but also information
on health nutrition, family planning, and on simple skills usefil in community liW, and (b) a program for
iw .roving productivity in uae informal sector. Skl training "Kejar Usahaw or Income-Generating Programs
are developed to provide technical assistance and seed capital to community-based groups to increase their
skills and income. Apprenticeship and self-improvement programs, especially for women are also available.
The seed capital is maaged as a revolving loan and wil rquire management training and monitoring by
the appointed NGO.
23. Surveys, Monitoring and Evaluation. It is hoped, with this new appoach to KIP, which incorporates
with the historical physical infrastrctuare programs, hedth and economic programs emphasizing
community participation and training support, that KIP will be more responsive to communities' needs and
wll engender greater community support for maitenance and management of program inputs than in the
past. Monitoring of the KIP will reflect this approach and be designed to: (a) provide baseine data to assess
both negative and positive changes; and (b) use simple, easily collected key indicatms for a quick response
if changes in program/project implementation are required.
24. As previously descnbed, the scale of the KIP over the six year SUDP implementation period is
expected to cover 60-70 kampungs and 600,000 people. Service coverage in each kampung wiU vary
considerably as in some areas facilities were already provided under earlier KIP. The new approach,
however, while emphasizing sanitation loans. health and economic opportnties, wiU be based on
acommunity development approach for each kampung prepared in consultation with the community, the
NGO and KIP PIU team. Precise targets for number of persons affected by all individual sevices cannot be
established for the whole program. Therefore, monitoring and evaluation will be based on the Kampung
Action Plan agreed after the community-based srvey at the community planming meeting.
25. All kampung surveys must be designed witiout data ovedap. Thee wDil be three opporunities to



-91.                                   m      imI
collect d    (a) the KIP PIU yeady survey to all kecamns to identify physical infsructure problems
(b) the lTSGOAmiveSn,sy prlminsay suvey of eacb yeats target aa(s) or UDUs to asses     suitability
of specific sizes already identified in Figure 6.1 or thse whic have been mUsed wit- each UDU; and (c)
the commudty-based surney with each commnity In the selected KIP sites to Identfy problems and assess
curmnt socio-economic condidons etc., and to determine resIdense priority needs
26. Existing survey procedur  and questo     es  to be reviewed. Indicatos (gender specfic where
possible), to be used to measue existing poblems and condi    before ad after KIP have been
developed (KIP Sector Repot September 1991).
27. ImplementatIon and BenefidiarIes. lhe Community Developmet Support Program will be
implemented by the KIP PIU site team. a community-based (sanitato) committe (CDA) and btesetor
agencies such as Health Welfare, Educadon etc. as appropriate.
28.  The Commudty Development Support Prgram is targeted at approximately I0S KMS official, 300
persons from commurnity-based organizations, and an esdmated 4,000 inhabitants each year.
29. In total 26,680 persons including 24,000 kIn .ng Inabitan  from the 60-70 kampungs selected
for KIP wfll receive training and information under the progrm.
30. The progran provides for three Technical Assistane posts which are: a Commuimcations and
Promotions spedalist, a Women in Development specialist, and a Community Development specialst, as
well as procement of a mobile training unit, and funds for tmag and information events boti formal
and non-formaL

Suraya Urban DJ    pvaopme Proect
1.   Mme following paragraphs deseribe the implementation agencies in general and some of the
most important needs identified in the IDAP. Detailed assessments of staffing requirements and
training needs wer camied out and included in a separate report on human resources development
and training (May 1991). Existing Dinas Pekeziaan Umum (DPIJ) organization in Surabaya would
cany out the roads and drainage components dtough the following sections and sub-sections
2.    Roads and Bridges Section. Under the Surabaya Urban Transport Project, this
section has already benefitted from consulting engineering support Existing aimngements would
be extended to provide a senihr construction nunaemeent and supe ors  expert to support
KMS's urban roads proam  The expert would work with the Kepala Dnas PU to also support
multi-sectoral KIP activities Local DPU project construction supevision groups would be
assisted as necessary by local consultants. The head of the construction supervision sub-secon
and dle specialist would joindy supervise local project inplementation units for urban roads
progmims, and provide consolidated advice and guidance for mantamng technical standads.
3 .   For the central govemment Bina Mpga roads, the roads and bridges section would work
closely with Proyck Arteri, especially where cordinaion of land acquisition is requied.
The existing road maintenance sub-section requires strengthening and support in order to
effectively manage and control the considerable investmene. Support includes the provision of an
expatriate consultant, with the assistance of local consultants, working in accordance with the
guidelines already estabLished by Bina Marga. At least two Kotamadya personnel with a
knowledge of computers would be required, in addition to dtree more staff who would receive
`on-the-job" training in the prepation of road inventoies and condition surveys to establish
priorities for investment in road maintenance
4.   The consultants to the road maintenance section would also be rsponsible for assisting
KMS to establish a direct labor organizadon tO handle all minor maintenance activities it is
assumed that in the short term, larger maintenance and iprovement works would be contacted
out. In the initial period, four additional Kotamadya personnel should be assigned to this section
before the appointment of consultant personnel.
5.    The sub-secdon for traffic signals and road lighting also requires strengthening: an
electical engineer should be appointed with a basic knowledge of signal control procedures and
equipment. He would be responsible for assisting the sub-section head to supervise a team of
mobile staff appointed to check that aU signals ar kept in working order, and identfy quick repair
procedures involving the private sector. This sub-section must work closely with Dinas Lalu
Lintas and may be trnsfened to Dinas Lalu Lintas in due course.
6.   Finally, a substantial amount of detailed planning and preparation work will be required to
improve the flow of all types of traffic. This has a high priority, and would follow on from the
preliminary engineering produced under the RCUTP.
7.    Drainage Section (Seksi Pematusan). The new works to be carried out in this sector
are considerably larger than previous investments handled by DPU. Althogh the section is



-97-                                     Ame 9
reasonably capable, and is headed by a compotent engineeaing manager DPU will need the support
of two atditonal engineers to canry out the investment program and unprove drainage
maintenance. Suitably qualifed staff should be recruited. This new staffing level will perriit
KMS to cary out all future drainage works, but assisted as necssary by the private sector to
support planing, design and implementation of the arger proje
S.      hle smallerofth projec aw straighdfrwd and can be undertaken by KMS with less
involvement of the private sect and consultants. All of the drai   proposals can be
implementd by KMS, and there is no need for the involverent of sepaate institutions or higher
levels of govemen apart from the nomal loc government budget control and approval
procedumes. However some of the sub projects ar for drains which have been traditially the
responsibility of the cental govement under tie banner of flood control. These will be
implemented by Proyec Pengendalian Banji Srabaya. The onsultants who assi the road
sub-section will also assist the dainage maintnce sub-section i carying out condition surveys,
setting up a database with priorities for maintenance, scheduling, supervision and monitoring.
9.   Dinas Lalu Lintas (KMS). Under the Surabaya Urban Transport Project, priority
objecdves have been identfied to significantly improve the flow of traffic along existing roads.
Because of the importance attached to this new discipline, a new Dinas has been established.
This new Dinas will be responsible for: (a) receiving trsport planning guidance and priorities
from RCUTP, (b) preparation of detaed traffic management schemes, including improved traffic
signalling, prkng arrangements, bus stopping points, road signs and maring etc; and (c)
preparation of detailed designsc and conac documents to implement these proposals.
10.  DinasMusihsL Estisng &mngements. IDinas Kebersihan KMS has established and
manages a good system of soLid waste management The system includes:
-     collection of domestic waste anl htansporting it from transfer depot to disposal site;
-     opeadtons at the disposal site;
-     uaranging involvement of pnvate sector participation and contribution; and
-     cleansing of roadside drainage ehannels; collection of charges.
11. The management of these activities is cardied out by Dinas Kebersihan. Private sector
contractors are appontd to collect and tansport wastes fmom ceain aas. In such areas, where it
is economically viable to manage the wase collection and tansport to the disposal site residential
esmtes, industrial estaes and commeal centers ae invited to participate and the cooperation is
govemed by formal sareement with Dinas Kebersihan. This anrangement allows KMS to expand
its services to lower income housing, and to other parts of the city. However, the length of
contracts with the private sector needs to be longer than at present so that contractors can develop a
stronger financial base to employ more efficient equipment. Contrats have traditionally been kept
short because of concerns about peaformance. This should be overcome in longer contracts by
relating performance to payments and penalties.
12    MsoalSite?d a agementhe existmg amrangement of disposal site management is under
the Transport Section. It is recommended that responsibility be transfared to an inproved, all
embracing opeaion unit.



- 98-                                    Annex 
13.  Ea.     Semi-controLed open dumping is used at
disposal sites in Srabaya, it is recommended that this system be upgraded to contmlled land fill as
soon as possible. Fuue disposal sites and methods will be studied further with TA. The
controlled land fill method involves no more extra work nor capital invesunent: only changes in
woring practices.
14.  Mn                                                 At present, Dinas
Kebersihan is rsponsible for management of liquid waste disposal. In the medium term, this
situation must continue to arply. In the long temm, as the sewerage system develops, the
responsibility for liquid waste treatment and disposal should tuansfer to a sewerage department
together with the collection and transportation of septic tank sludges. Separate institutional
arangements have been studied for the pilot seweg area and a new Divisi Air Kotor wiL be
formed in PDAM Surabaya. Such an angement has worked well in Bandung. It will not be
possible to finalize such an anrangement or commitment before loan effectiveness but as in
Bandung, an acon plan has been drawn up to enable the new Divisi Air Kotor tO be fomed
during the sewage system construction period so that it will be ready vor take aver facilities when
completed and can operate maintain andcharge for the sewerage service.
iS.   Vehicle Maipmnanme Depot Most of the existing vehicles and equipment owned by Dinas
Kebersihan were procured under Urban V. The maintenance costs are met from Dinas Kebersihan
nternal sources. The sub-section for maintenance and supevision of vebicles is responsible for
managing the maintenance of vehicles in Dinas Kebihan's vehicle pool. In zlis workshop,
located in Asemrowo, all vebicles and containers are maintained on a regular basis, and repaired.
The coStS for maintenancerepair (including personnel costs) are met from the Operation &
Maintenance budget However, the existing workshop is not sufficient to provide a high quality
sevice. Additional truck service and rep  equipment is needed as well as additional skldled
mechanics.
16. Additignal ManpowerResur. Private sector contracts should be supervised by a new
"Operations Section". No addittonal staff are required Although the system is working well,
makng longer term contracts wth the private sector should be consied if they are to integrate
fully with the new equipment to be purchased. Supervision of operation at the disposal sites
should be under the Manager of the inciner  plant. He should have a knowledge of controlled
landfill operation pace. He may be appointed friom exisng stat. He should have completed a
speciait training course and received on-the-job training preferably in other cities in Indonesia.
Expansion of service area requires additional personnel for the New Depots and for street cleaners.
17.  Dinas Tata Kota Daerab. Dinas Tata Kota workdng in conjunction with Dinas PU and
with the coordination help of the Urban ?. - gement Uniit will be responsible for the KIP
component of the program. The main responsibilides will be through working groups as follows:
(a)  Physicalnbam=  of 1a a InwMM=   A woridng group with multi sector
duties based on the existing Bappem KIP unit, with assistance for development plans and
rights of way by Tata Kota wil be responsible for physical infiastructure. The group will
be part of DPU.
(b) Household Q iWLanmM Bagian Keuangan (Finance Section) will be responsible and
Bank Pembangunan Daerah, with coordination from the UMU finance section working



-99-                                     Annex
witd the Lurah (Head of Local Kanpung or aea) and the Non Gcvrmment Organization
Community Dewelop Advisor, probably through authorized consultants who will work on a
target and incentive basis. This is also tied to the -.v . r supply rehabilitation and house
connection progm in the central areas and previously KIP'd areas.
(c)  Landanagd m nLg Em    A working group consisting 3f representatives from Dinas Tata
Kota, Badan Pertanahan and Dinas Pengawasan will be responsible. Authorized
consultants may be used as for the Home Loan Program for each Kelurahan working on a
target and incentive basis. Coordination will be though the Land Utilization Sector of the
UMU.
(d)  C=m nilyi Develoc  Dinas Tata Kota together with Bagian Pegawaian will be
responsible for a traing program for community developmnert and will include all PlUs
aiid aU those involved in the urban developnent progratn incl':n,. Bappeda, Bangdes,
Kesehatan, Keuangan, Pemerintah-an, Kecamatan, Kelurahan, LKaID, PKK, and NGOs.
(e)     R     e  Dinas Tata Kota working in conjunction with Dinas PU and with the
coordination help of the Urban Mmagement Unit will be responsible for implementing the
Resettlement Plan, including the development of sites and services schemes.
18.  Disperda. This is the revenue and budgeting section of KMS and as such has the major
responsibilty of ensuring that Kotamady. atains its revenue targets, the main component being the
buildings and proprty tax. This will be organzed as follows:
(a)  PB  Vem.Xe t  Arrn                  with K j Insti EBB The inspector of PBB is
the authority who determines the liability for the tax. Nornmly properties are assessed every three
years, except that the assessment may be changed on the occasion of changes in the status of the
land or its environment. The tax base itself is determined by KMS through the interaction of Dinas
Arria, Dinas Tata Kota and Dinas Pengawasan Bangunan. There is therefore an obvious need
for regular and geniine coopeaon not only between the various dinas of KMS but also between
the KMS and Kantor Inspeksi PBB. The role of KMS in the measurement and value of the tax
object has recently  ireased substantiafly, and KMS will therefore head a proposed project unit
required to significandy improve PBB. Ihe information linkage required to establish and maintain
an urban data base, and to use it for the purpose of improving PBB assessment and collection is
complex. The existing program of digital mapping by Tata Kota will be continued, strengthened
and reliontized. The digital maps will form the basis of the urban data base, but dtey will be
complemented by data from many other soures. It will be necessary to arrve at new values for
land and buildcngs. For this, 2,000 - 2,500 properies would be valued in Surabaya and from this
data and similar valuation prgrams in Jakarta and other towns, values would be extrapolated for
unsurveyed properties. This work will be supervised by the PIU in accordance with central
governm'it guidelines. It is proposed that a project implementation unit be set up to control the
impler l,ttation of the PBB improvementprogramL This PIU will be coordinated by UMU. The
head of the PIU should be a staff member of Daerah ringkat I. The project will be directed by Ka.
Dispenda who, as a erember of the UMU, will receive regula reports of the project progress.
(b)  Involvement of Iaovernent Plelsonnel During out-of-office hours, a team of
part-time local goverment personnel will be assiped to carry out household surveys to determine
property boundaries, staus of land titles, site measurements, and formal agreements of occupiers
and owners to te extent of each tax object This process will also be assisted by the office of each



100-                                     &x2
Lurah in the city at a nominal cost for each property. To achieve this objecdve, DirJen. PUOD in
dte Ministry of Home Affairs would issue revised instrucdons and objectives in cooperation with
Dir.Jen. Pajak, so tha KMS will have the authority to uilize available finds from central
govenmet in a more cost effective way. This is necessary, because the involvement of the private
ser is estimated to be too cosdy for normal ty   of pmises and should be reserved for
assistance with management, computer applications, measurmvent and valuation of top' and
high value properdes, and introduction of improved documentation and data stoge.
19.   Baglan KeUnagan (Finance Services) Bagian Keuangan will canry out project
finance activities. A project finance support group will be formed to be responsible for payments,
keeping project accounts, financial recording and prepaation of consolidated project reports.
20.   Bagian Kepegawalan (Personnel Services). Bagian Kepegawaian will form a
project support unit to carry out the human resources development and training activities required
to enable KMIS to improve and sustain their urban development capabiIities
21.   Bagian Ortal (Organization and Administration Services). Bagian Ortala
O ion and Adminira Services) will be rsponsible for implementaton of the
itutional development acdon plan. lTey will draft the necesy lers of Authoity (SK) to
enable the intem  changes of gniuaton rmended for improved urban development to
become effective.

1.    Prior to 1978, water supply opertions for Surabaya weme handled drcly by the city
govarnment of Smabaya. In 1978, a semi-autonomous enterprise (Perusahan Daerh Air Minum -
PDAM) was estblid within the famework of the City Govenment to manage fte waterworks
operations. All watenw ks asse previously owned by the Governmnt have been transferred to
PDAM.
2.    PDAM Surabaya is a financialy sumng ornzato as indicated by its proven financial
resourcs. Howeer, Fai aon   d expansion of the distribution network will increase its
flyd assets by some 330 pa. -it over the six yea period of projectiementatio. An essential
objectve of the pdposed project is, therefoe, to protect and stengthen the financial and
insdtutional viability of the  terprise to manage the financial impact of dte proposed projecL
3.    Past Performance and Present Situation. The main elements of the 1985-1992
financial results are shown in Table 5.1. PDAM's financial performance to date, has been
sadsfactory. PDAM  mleented a tariff increase of about 40 percent on April 1, 1989 and a
furdter 20 percent effecdve October 1, 1991. It has maintained an operatmng raio between 61
percent to 71 pent, in recent years, and the rme of retu  on assets has increased from 14 percent
to 27 pcent. The bulk of investment requr ts, in the late 1980s and early 1990s have been
financed intemally. Borowing   ements have been modest -- debt as a prporton of debt plus
quity has increased from 13 peent in 1987 to 27 percent in 1992 -- and it has been possible to
maintain a high debt semrice coverage ratio (seven dntes in 1992).

4.    Development and hivestme"t Program. The near-term development objective for
water supply in Suabaya calls for expansion of serce to cover almost the entie population (97
percent) by the year 20011 as compared to about 62 percent in 1992. To achieve this, some
228,000 house connections wil be made during the period, including 192,000 under the project,
as follows:

Cotw   (0Os)
5.   To this end, the program involves construction of a transmission ring-main, distribution
system expansion, pumping statons, teservoirs and rehabilitation of the existing system,
buildings, purchases of vehicles and other equipment. In addition, the project provides for the
constiucon of additional treatment capacity for raw water at the existing PDAM plant at Karang
Piang by 2 m3/sec, as the most cost effectve way of increasng water supply to Surabaya City at
this time (paras. 11-15 below).
6.   The overall PDAM invesment program up to year 2001 is estimated at Rp 517.0 bn
including contingencies and taxes (Rp 425.0 billion dunng the prqject inmlementaton period
whrough 1998, or $ 205.9 million eqvalent. Major cost components include: i) distribudon
system rehabilitation & expansion (including detailed engineering design - DED) Rp 304.9 bn; ii)
Kang Pilang Water Treatment Expansion and additional interim tatment capacity - Rp 71.4 bn;
and iii) PDAM's house connection program and other capital outlays for administration and
logistics - Rp 48.7 bn.
7.    Of this total investment program for the period through the year 2001, PDAM Suabaya is
expected to finance just about 37 pcnt (Rp 188.8 ba.) fom internally generated resources,
prmarily for the house connection prograL About 62 % of investments including for the
treament plant and major distribution wors would be financed by loans from: (i) IBRD - Rp
199.2 bn. (including Rp 22.6 bn. frm existing Ln. 33042IND); and; (ii) OECF - Rp 121.8 bn.
A centrl government grant of Rp 7.2 bn. will finance construction of an interim water treatment
plant.
8.    Projected Fimancial Impact on PDAM Surabaya. As indicated above, PDAM
Surabaya has maintained a satsfactory financial performance to date. However, the scale of
investmt proposed under the proect is consideable. It will increase the asset base of the
enterprim by almost 400 percent and add substandally to ovall indebtedness and debt service
obligations. Moreover, lementation targets for distribution system imprvement and expansion
are ambitous. Under the project, the annual level of physical investments will need to expand
from about Rp 15 bn in 1991 and 1992 and Rp 26 bn projected for 1993 to a sustained annual level
of investment of Rp 60 to 100 bn for four to five years

9.    As a result, paicular attention has been given in fimancial planning for PDAMs operations
during the implementation period to ensure that PDAM is able to provkde, from intemal cash
generation, the required contribution to investment costs under the development program and to
maintain a satifctory cash position in relation to openting expenses.
10. To support these objectives a schedule of tariff increases has been proposed by the PDAM
for approal by Surabaya City of averaging 35 percent in 1993, 35 percent in 1995, 30 percent in
1997, 25 percent in 1999 and 15 percent in the year 2001. Detailed financial results are contained
in the projected Income Statement; Sources And Applications of Funds Statement; Financing Plan;
and Balance Sheet. Based on the proposed schedule of tariff increases% the financial projections set
out below indicate that the investment program is manageable for PDAM. The contibution to
capital outlays under the progrm never falls below 20 percent of requirements in any three year
period during implementation and PDAM is able to maintain a sadsfactory cash position -
significantly higher throughtout the period than a minimum acceptable level of one month operating
expenses.
11. A major issue affecting PDAM Surabaya's plan for developing water supply has been the
source of additional raw water. A study undertaken in 1990 indicated treamnt of water in Kali
Surabaya represented the lowest cost option of six altematives reviewed. More recendy, however,
interest has grown in development of the Umbulan Spring, a source some 70 km to the Southeast
of Suabaya City. A private sector developer was invited to submit proposals. Discussions have
continued duing 1992V3, on the Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) proposal submitted which involves a
fifteen year concession. An independent review contracted by BAPPENAS, identified a number of
reas where the terms and conditons proposed by the developer were inadequate in protecting
public policy and the financial and institutional interests of local public agencies including PDAM
Surabaya as well as consumers. Overall, the review  co ed a gravity flow design that
woukd more than compensate for a higher initial investment by rducing opeaion and maintenance
costs significantly. No agreement was reached over important provisions of the proposal
including, in particular, the price and flow rates of bulk water under the "tke-or-pay" affangement
proposed by the developer and alte iatve app¢oaches to tapping UmbWan Springs on a cost
efective basis being considered by Goverment from about August 1993.
12.   To meet the additional demand from PDAMIs expanded coedion base through the end of
the 1990s, the project provides for expanding the water treatment plant at Karang Pilang to increase
raw water supply by 50 percent (2 m3/sec) from Kali Surabaya to come on stream in 1996.
However, a further increment to the city's water supply will again be nteded by the end of 1999,
by which time an additional 2 m3/sec are expected to be available from Umbulan Springs. The
financial projections for PDAM Surabaya under the project assume payment of a bulk water charge
stardng in 1999 for Umbulan Spring water.

13.   Overall projected financial results indicate that the investment program is manageable for
PDAM Surabaya, provided that the schedule of tariff increases is approved on a timely basis. The
operating ratio (operating expenses and depreciation as a percentage of operating revenues) does
not exceed 65. Current and liquid ratios remain highly satisfactory throughout the project
implementation period and at a projected 2.9 and 4.3 in 1999 illustrate continued strengthening of
PDAM Surabaya's cash position as the impact of service improvements under the project starts to
be realized. 14. The scale of the investment program adds significantly to PDAM Surabaya's
indebtedness and the debt equity ratio increases to 61 % debt to 39 % equity in 1998. Coverage
from net income before depreciation and debt service costs dips to 1.8 times (compared to a
minimum of 1.3 times prescribed by the Government for local enterprises) in 1998 and 1999 when
the full fnancial impact of debt service starts to fall due on borrowings under the project following
the grace period on repayment of principal but recovers in the following years to 2.5 times. With
the cumulative effect of improved tariff revenues, gearing reduces quickly to 47 % debt to 53 %
equity by the year 2000. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that such actions as are necessary
to ensure that the debt service ratio wil not, at any time during project implementaion, fall below
1.5 times.
15.   Risk and Sensitivity. The projected financial results are sensitive to: (a) delays in
tariff adjustments; (b) failure to provide the increase in connections and marketing planned
quantities of water; (c) unforeseen increases in operating costs; (d) the fiming of first supplies of



-106-                                 Anne" 10
water from Umbulan; and, (e) the timing of first utilization of Karang Pilang II supplies.
16. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the water supply program incremental
operations as shown in table below is 16.9 %. Several sensitivity tests were performed which
showed the following results:

B,C&D                  10.9%              6.31
17.   The scale and timing of tariff increases represent the single most important factor affecting
PDAM's finances and the viability of the investment program proposed. It is in the early years of
the program when timely and sufficient tariff increases are most critical. Tariff adjustments are
presently made bi-annually. A regime of annual tariff adjustments would permit smaller and more
gradual increases, and PDAM's present policy in this respect should be considered. However, the
increase of 35 percent anticipated for 1993 is essential under all circumstances to generate the
resources needed starting in 1994, and particularly if the number house connections does not
increase as anticipated. The required tariff increase was approved by KMS and implemented by
PDAM in January 1994.
1 8.   Profit Distribution. In accordance with PERDA (Local Regulation) No. 7. 1976, the
distribution of profit of local enterprises owned by Kotamadya Surabaya (KMS) are basically
allocated as follows: (it 55 percent to be paid to KMS as contribution to its development and
routine budget; (ii) 15 percent for general reserves; (iii) 10 percent for production bonus; and (iv)
20 percent for social, education and pension contribution. However, it was agreed under the
Second East Java Water Supply Project (Ln. 2632-IND) that contribution to KMS would be
limited to the 1985 amount plus 5 percent per annum3. Since a Mayor's letter cannot change any
article of a PERDA, a subsequent letter under KMS Mayor No. 974/776/411.21 dated 31 March
1986 restated that the distribution of PDAM Surabaya's net profit should follow the above
PERDA. This second letter also stipulated that the distribution to the Kotamadya is 55 percent of
net income after tax and "cadangan tujuan" (working balance) which is calculated at 25 percent of
net income after tax. This base amount is also used in computing the other profit distributions. In
order to meet Loan No. 2632 covenants, starting 1986 part of the amounts paid to KMS were
reinvested as KMS equity in PDAM. The net amounts paid to KMS, however, did not fully meet
the condition of Loan 2632. In practice, for KMS budget preparation purposes, the Kotamadya
share of PDAM net income is recorded by KMS as budgeted revenue for the corresponding year.
In PDAM's balance sheet, this is shown as "Advance to Kotamadya" because the actual profit
distribution is done during the following year.

19.   In the financial projections, it is assumed that the net amount paid to KMS would follow
the covenant of Ln 2632-IND covenant from 1986 to 1991; i.e. and annual incease of 5%, using
1985 figures as the base. The overpayment (Actual Net Payment to KMS less proposed Payment
per Ln 2632 from 1986 to 1991 totaling Rp 2,291 m will be considered a receivable from KMS
and wil be offset against future KMS share in Net Income.
20.   In view of the need for PDAM to maintain a meaningful contribution to capital outlays,
agreement was obtained at negotiations that: (i) all actions will be taken to ensure that PDAM
Surabaya contributes not less than 20 percent of investment requirements under the program; and
(ii) to this end4 earnings wiU be retained and no distribution of profits will be made to Kotamadya
Surabaya in any year during project implementation until PDAM Surabaya has contributed not less
than 20 percent of investment capital requirements.
21    Financial Management. In 1981. under the Bank-fiaced Second Water Supply
Project (IBRD Loan 1709-IND), the PDAM engaged consultants for management and financial
advisory assistance, covering a broad range of activities including (i) organizing and restructuring
the water enterprise; (ii) management, financial and operation policies; (iii) review and development
of operational manuals; and (iv) accounting system. As a result of the above assignment, the
PDAM has implemented improved financial procedures to enhance internal control, efficiency, and
report generation.
22.   A review of the general accounting system shows that PDAM is commercially oriented and
uses the accrual system of accounting. It produces important infornation on water consumption
by customer category, and prepares Financial Reports in the standard format recommended by
G01. It also prepares Management Reports regularly; these include reports on personnel, chemical



- 108 -                              Armex I
costs, fuel and power, unaccounted for water, billings and collections.
23.   Audit of the PDAM is done annually by goverment auitors BPKP and is completed
within six months following the end of the calendar year. Audit reports are comprehensive and are
revieHed by the PDAM Board of Directors and Management and key rcnmendations have been
implemented. The 1992 audit was completed is in Februwy, 1993.
24.   Consumer Affordability. The proposed tariff increases arm significant and the
expansion in PDAM's consumer base that the progrm makes possible is expected to include a
large propordon of low-income families. Ihe affordability of the proposed trffs, particularly on
these low-income consumers was therefore assessed.
25.  CpnsumnfPaten. The Government of Indonesia national gidene for domestic
supply is presently 120 liters per capita per day for cities with a populadon over 1 million. This is
equivalent to about 23 m3 per connection per month, assuming six peasons per connection.
Average consumption per domestic connection in Surabaya over recent years h.as been significantly
higher at about 166 liters per person and 31 m3 per connection per month. Indeed, under PDAM
Surabaya's tariff structure, domestic consumers with a house connection are charged for at least 15
m3 per month, even if they use less. Consumption from public hydrants is estimated to have
averaged 17 liters per person per day or about 4 m3 per family per month.
26.  Tiff Su      . The existing tariff structe has four tariff blocks for donmtic
consumes Compared to average weighted production costs of water sold estimated at Rp 268 per
m3 in 1992, the tariff ranges from Rp 110 per m3 to Rp 710 per m3. For consumers fronting
roads wider than 6 meters, each consumption block is charged at a higher tariff. This is intended
to improve the overall progressivity of the tariff structure and assumes that these are higher-income
residents. In addition, a flat monthly charge is levied for meter rental and sewer surcharge.
27.  Hitheo, affordability of water tariffs has been assessed in reladon to a "dtreshold" 4% of
monthly family incomes, particularly for the poor who were clssified by the Government in 1989
as having a monthly family income of Rp 100,000 ($55 in 1989 prices). The impact of proposed
tariffs on this low-income group is illusatd in theTable below. As can be seen, for consumers
on tariff B, the cost of 15 m3 per month represents about 2-2.5% of monthly family incomes that
are projected to increase by about 3.3% per year in ral tems, in lne with dte experience in the late
1980s and early 1990s. For low-income consumers who aie located fronting on wider streets and
who are subject to the "high progressivity" tariff A, the cost of 15 m3 per month ranges between
2.5-3.5% of projected monthly family income.
28.   Surveys indicate that the cost of water purchased from vendors by low-income families not
connected to PDAM distribution system curendy averages about Rp 4,000 per m3. At these
prices, low-income families purchase only very small quantities for drindng and cooking and use
other, often less clean, sources for bathing and washing clothes. As illustated in the table, even a
mininal, "lifeline" supply represents a significant proportion of projected family income: 9-14%.
Use of contaminated water for bathing and washing clotes imposed health risks on these families,
as does the very low levels of consumption at present. The major effort under the project to
provwide direct house connections will, therefore, not only make water supply avalable at more



-  109                                  Annex 10
affordable prices for low-income consumers but will also reduce fteir exposure to health risks.
29.   Even so, the schedule of connection fees, which was approved an August, 19924, is
proposed to be increased from Rp 160,000 to about Rp 215,000 for the minimum size plot of
lOOnn2 with proportional adjustments for larger plots. At current connection charge rates,
installments would be approximately Rp 2,100/mo. Surveys indicate that the existing fee is
considered by low-income consumers to be too high and already limits their willingness to
connect. Even without additional "unofficial" charges, ths represents over one month's income
for these families. The proposed fee could well, therefore, constrain the house connection
program and, thereby, limit the impact of the program and inpair PDAMs financial performance.
As a result, PDAM has made a commitment to allow qualifed low-income households to pay for
service connections through sixty (60) interest-free monthly installments. Agreement was obtained
at negotiations in the OAP, that PDAM would restmucture domestic and other tarriffs to improve the
progressivity of prices in relation to quandties consumed and roU part of connection fees into the
tarrifs.

30.   As indicated above, the minimum charge under the present tariff stnzcture is for 15 m3 per
connection per month. The "lifeline" supply this is intended to relate to is generally considered to
be closer tolO m3 per connection per month. Surveys also indicate that middle and higher income
consumers are willing to pay higher prices for improved quality and reliability in water service.
PDAM therefore intends to undertake a review to assess the feasibility of further strengthening the
progressivity of the tariff structure and also with a view to constraining undue growth in demand.
