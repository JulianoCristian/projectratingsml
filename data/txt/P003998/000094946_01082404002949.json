highly\n            unsatisfactory project outcomes, with highly unlikely\n            sustainability, and negligible institutional development\n            impacts. Regrettably, both performances by the Bank, and\n            Borrower were also rated unsatisfactory. Lessons stipulate\n            that: 1) major changes in fundamental project financial\n            responsibilities MUST automatically trigger reappraisal; 2)\n            supervision resources for the initial first two years of a\n            new Bank project, are directly related to the quality of\n            project implementation, as procurement procedures, covenant\n            enforcement seriousness, and project ownership are\n            established during such period. Unfortunately in this case,\n            this was a major failure by the Bank; 3) the Bank must work\n            with the Government of Indonesia to improve the legal,\n            regulatory and policy frameworks governing land acquisition\n            for public purposes - and preferably, on broader work on\n            land tenure, and rights, as well as dispute resolution\n            mechanisms, as envisioned under the upcoming Second Land\n            Administration Project; and, 4) technical audits should\n            become part of future projects, demonstrated by the\n            usefulness of such audits in this project, though the\n            Government, and all other participants failed to follow up\n            on any of the findings. Further lessons recommend\n            assessments of external shocks; improved enforcement of loan\n            covenants; improved provisions for public information,\n            namely for cases of fraud, and corruption; and, question the\n            appropriateness of parallel financing arrangements for\n            complex, integrated operations, such as this one."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
