Development Project\n            is for urban infrastructure development and environmental\n            improvement in Surabaya and includes all expenditure in\n            Surabaya for the next 6 years on urban roads and transport,\n            urban drainage, water supply, solid waste management,\n            sanitation and kampung improvement.  It also includes\n            improvements in urban management by institutional and human\n            resources development, in financial management, in community\n            participation and in land management, as well as technical\n            assistance and training.  This report is an environmental\n            assessment of the project.  It reviews the environmental\n            impacts that each of the project component will have on the\n            environment.  These impacts are: 1) resettlement of affected\n            people; 2) traffic disruption; 3) encouragement of\n            accelerated wetland development due to influence of nearby\n            ring road; 4) changes to Brackish water ponds in East\n            Surabaya; 5) change to agriculture due to conversion of\n            irrigation channels to drainage; 6) expansion of landfill at\n            Keputih; 7) continued operation of Kenjeran Beach Landfill;\n            8) air pollution and health risks to residents near new\n            depots or transfer stations; and 9) air and noise pollution\n            due to digging sewer pipe trenches. The report also presents\n            a description of the project, the baseline data, an analysis\n            of the alternatives, the mitigation plans, monitoring and\n            evaluation, institutional needs and, finally, public participation."}, "docdt": "1992-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
