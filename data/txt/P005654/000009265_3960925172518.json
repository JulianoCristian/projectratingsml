The project became effective on\n            June 8, 1984 and was closed, as originally planned, on June\n            30, 1989. The loan account remained open until January 17,\n            1990. Ultimately, USD 22.3 million were disbursed and USD\n            2.7 million cancelled. The main objective of the disaster\n            relief project was to minimize the flood damage potential in\n            Greater Sfax by: (a) reducing the risk of loss of life from\n            floods; (b) providing the population with a greater sense of\n            security; protecting public and private property; (c)\n            reducing production losses; and (d) ensuring permanent and\n            efficient maintenance of flood protection infrastructure.\n            The project consisted of the following physical components:\n            (a) rehabilitation of the water course of Oued Ezzit on the\n            northern side of Sfax; (b) rehabilitation and extension of\n            the existing dikes along Oued Maou and Oued Khalifa on the\n            southern side of Sfax; (c) construction of an eight-km long\n            belt canal at about four km from the city center; (d) minor\n            flood protection works in neighboring villages; (e)\n            provision of equipment to maintain the flood control\n            facilities; and (f) staffing, equipping, and operation of a\n            special flood protection Section within the Regional\n            Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment in Sfax to be\n            responsible for maintenance and repairs of flood protection works."}, "docdt": "1991-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
