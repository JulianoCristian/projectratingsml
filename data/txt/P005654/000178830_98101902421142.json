permanent,\n            efficient maintenance of flood protection infrastructure in\n            Sfax and surrounding areas. It consists of rehabilitation of\n            existing water courses and extension of dikes; construction\n            of a belt canal in Sfax and minor flood protection works in\n            neighboring villages; provision of maintenance equipment;\n            staffing, equipping, and operation of a unit to maintain and\n            repair flood protection works; and provision of consulting\n            services for related design and construction supervision.\n            The beneficiaries of the project cannot be easily\n            identified, since the areas of Sfax which will be affected\n            by future floods cannot be predicted, and since these floods\n            will also have repercussions on surrounding areas as well as\n            on the national economy. The risk of slippage, and the\n            consequent escalation of costs, will be minimized by\n            supervision and close monitoring. Creation of the special\n            unit for repair and maintenance will minimize the\n            possibility of deterioration of flood protection infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
