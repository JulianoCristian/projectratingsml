{"cdata!": "Severe flooding in 1982 caused\n            considerable damage to Sfax, a major Tunisian city, and its\n            suburbs. Experts estimated the probability of re-occurrence\n            of a similar flood at 0.66 percent-in layman's terms\n            the disaster was a 130 year event. A survey assessed\n            economic losses at about US$80 million. Seventy lives were\n            lost, more than 700 houses were destroyed and 8,000 damaged;\n            along with streets, roads, bridges, railways, power supply\n            lines, and telecommunication equipment. . The Sfax Flood\n            Protection Project was the first free standing flood\n            protection project in Tunisia in which the Bank was\n            involved. The main objective of the project was to minimize\n            the damage potential of future flooding in Sfax. Secondary\n            objectives were: reducing the risk of life losses; providing\n            the population with a greater sense of security; reducing\n            economic losses to production and assets (mainly real\n            estate); and ensuring permanent and efficient maintenance of\n            the flood protection infrastructure. The project completion\n            report and audit of the project concluded that the project\n            infrastructure had reduced the risk of flood, although both\n            documents noted that the system had yet to be fully tested.\n            The operations and Operations Evaluation Department (OED)\n            evaluations concurred that, overall, the project contributed\n            significantly to the urban development of Sfax. The audit\n            noted that the need for a quick response had foreclosed the\n            opportunity for meaningful beneficiary participation in\n            project planning. The impact evaluation of the Sfax Flood\n            Protection Project concentrates primarily on those impacts\n            related to the flood protection canal and the associated\n            bypass highway, and it also assesses medium-and long-term\n            impacts on stakeholders, as well as the medium and long-term\n            impacts on the urban development of the city itself."}, "docdt": "1997-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
