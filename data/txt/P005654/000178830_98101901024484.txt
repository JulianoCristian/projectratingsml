SFAX FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. FLOOD PROTECTION AND STORM DRAINAGE
General
1.01     Tunisia is located on the southern bank of the Mediterranean sea
about midway between Gibraltar and Suez. It occupies an area of 160,000 km2
which is rather poorly endowed with natural resources. The great Atlas moun-
tain chain, which runs from west to east about 280 km south of the northern
coastline, separates the country into two distinct regions. North of the
Atlas mountain chain is a semi-arid area where the majority of the population
lives and where most potentially irrigable land is found. Industries and
other economic activities are concentrated in the northern coastal areas. The
mean annual rainfall in this region fluctuates around 600 mm. South of the
Atlas mountain chain lies arid land with an average annual rainfall of less
than 200 mm.
1.02     Administratively, Tunisia is divided into 20 governorates, 136 coun-
ties and 162 communes. Nearly half of the estimated total population of 6.4
million, which is growing at an average annual rate of 2.2%, is considered
urban. More than one-third of the urban population is concentrated in Tunis
and Sfax, the two largest metropolitan areas. The rural population is widely
dispersed into more than 3,500 locations often isolated from each other and
where low population density to a great extent impedes rapid implementation of
services.
Sector Organization
1.03     The Directorate of Urban Hydraulics (DHU) of the Ministry of Equip-
ment is responsible for urban flood protection works. The Regional Direc-
torates of the Ministry are responsible for the maintenance and repair of
these works, but until now there have been no specialized units at the
regional level to ensure maintenance and repair of the flood protection infra-
structure, or to maintain community action in the event of a flood. However,
the Ministry has decided to set up such units within its Regional Direc-
torates, including one in the Sfax area (paras. 4.03 vi. and 4.11). The
"Office National de l'Assainissement" (ONAS), which operates under the
Ministry of Equipment, is responsible for combined urban stormwater and sewer-
age systems. The Directorate of National Land Planning (DAT) of the Ministry
of Equipment oversees the preparation and execution of national and urban
plans; it is currently preparing a countrywide flood hazard map with the
assistance of Stockholm University. The Ministry of Agriculture manages all
water resources. The Bureau of Hydraulic Inventory and Research (BIRH), a
public enterprise which operates under the Ministry of Agriculture, is respon-
sible inter alia for studies and research related to rainfall and river flow.

Finally, rainfall data have been collected by the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Meteorological Service of the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.04     The proposed project would be the first Bank financed free-standing
flood control project in Tunisia. However, the Bank has been involved
indirectly in flood control in the past by financing stormwater drainage as a
part of sewerage projects. The Bank has been very active in the related water
supply and sewerage sectors.  It has helped, inter alia, to establish and
deve.lop the entities responsible for water supply and sewerage (SONEDE and
ONAS) and has maintained a continuous and close dialogue with the Tunisian
Government on sector policies and operating. practices.  In the water supply
sector, the Bank Group has made five loans and one credit totalling US$ 124.5
million and is preparing a rural water supply project. The sewerage sector
received four loans and one credit from the Bank Group. All these operations
have also helped to finance stormwater drainage components:
(i)    the Tourism Infrastructure Project (Loan 858-TUN for US$ 14.0 million
and Credit 329-TUN for US$ 10.0 million, both of September 28, 1972)
included US$ 16.64 million for sewerage in six tourist zones. The
project was revised as the result of changes in the Government's
tourism development objectives in 1975, and suffered further delays
due to related changes needed in the detailed design and additional
time needed to complete detailed land-use plans and acquire land.
The revised project was completed in 1981 and is operating
satisfactorily;
(ii)    the First Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1088-TUN of February 18, 1975
for US$ 28.0 million). The main objectives of this project were to
support the establishment of ONAS as an effective operating agency,
to clean up Lake Tunis by building a storm drainage canal along its
shores and to improve the sewerage facilities of the Greater Tunis
area. This project which is now completed has had a major environ-
mental impact because of the depollution of Lake Tunis and the sup-
pression of sewage olfactive nuisances. As a consequence, the land
value around the Lake has increased considerably and a government
agency (Société d'Aménagement des Berges du Lac) has been recently
established to develop the lake shores;
(iii)   the Second Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1675-TUN of April 13, 1979
for US$ 26.5 million).  This project is part of ONAS' Fifth Develop-
ment Plan (1977-81) to develop the sewerage sector through improve-
ment and extension of waste water collection, treatment and disposal
facilities and stormwater systems in the Greater Tunis and Greater
Sfax areas. Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily,
although three stormwater collectors are being retendered as original
bids were considerably higher than anticipated and additional local
funds had to be allocated; and

(iv)    the Third Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 2255-TUN) approved by the
Board on March 29, 1983 is part of ONAS' Sixth Development Plan
(1982-1986) to rehabilitate and extend sewerage and storm drainage
facilities in thirty medium sized towns throughout Tunisia, including
four communities in the suburbs of Sfax.
In addition, three urban development projects contain sewerage and stormwater
drainage components. Urban Development I (Loan 937-TUN, Credit 432-TUN of
October 5, 1973 for US$ 18 million), which is now completed, contained several
sewerage studies. Urban Development II (Loan 1705-TUN of May 31, 1979 for US$
19 million) includes US$ 3.9 million for the improvemenit and expansion of
water supply and sewerage systems in several low income settlements. This
project also contains a solid waste component including a study which is now
being executed by ONAS. Urban Development.III (2223-TUN of January 11, 1983),
loan of US$ 25 million, includes US$ 2.7 million for the upgrading and expan-
sion of water supply and sewerage systems in low income areas.
1.05     The Project Performance Audit Reports on the first two water supply
projects (PPAR No. 1902 of Pebruary 13, 1978) and of the third water supply
project (PPAR No. 3914 of May 4, 1982) concluded that these projects had met
their objective of providing water of acceptable quality for the increasing
requirements of the population in the areas served, and contributed greatly
towards the development of SONEDE into a technically sound and financially
viable institution. The audit for the third water supply project concluded
that more detailed engineering should have been carried out prior to Board
presentation. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) has also published a
Sector Operations Review on the Water Supply and Waste Disposal Program in
Tunisia (Report No. 4146 of October 20, 1982) which states that there have
been few examples of the Bank's involvement in the Water Supply and Waste
Disposal Sector as successful as the Tunisian experience. The reasons for the
success are stated to be the Government's commitment to its sector policy
objectives, and the harmony of the Bank's program with these objectives.

II. PROJECT AREA
General
2.01     Sfax is Tunisia's major port and second largest city with a 1982
estimated population of 313,000. It is located on the country's east coast
about 267 miles from Tunis, the capital. Greater Sfax consists of the port
area, the industrial zones located in the littoral corridor, north and south
of the port, the traditional quarter or Medina, followed to the west by
pockets of densely populated slums, the "r'bats", and more recent residential
developments. Beyond these lie low density, one family homes built on garden
lots of substantial size, the "j'neins" (IBRD Map No. 17067). Sfax has
developed at the expense of these lots which are gradually being subdivided.
Clusters of commercial activity, the "merkhez", which include craftsmen shops
and markets have appeared where major roads pass through the j'neins. Indeed,
some of the larger merkhez have eventually become townships. Greater Sfax
includes the surrounding communities of Agareb, El Aïn, Sakiet Ezzit and
Sakiet Ed Dair and covers an area of 13,000 ha. (IBRD Map No. 17067), while
the Sfax Governorate covers 708,600 ha. The majority of usable land in the
Governorate is under cultivation, about 300,000 ha. being devoted to olive
trees alone. The following table shows Greater Sfax' spatial structure.

Physical Settings
2.02     The soil in and around Sfax is composed of sandy loam with very
little humus. It is generally loose and permeable to the infiltration of
surface water. However, the water table is relatively high and cannot absorb
much rain water. Near the sea, in Sfax's inner city, the water table is only
0-80 cm below ground level. It only reaches a level of 2-10 m west of the
city. The water table is sometimes above ground level and forms swamps and
stagnant pools. Sfax' porous soil therefore does little to decrease storm-

tion, 1977.



- 5 -
water runoff. The soil storage capacity would not be increased either by
water extraction for economic activities because it would be replaced by salt
water infiltrating from the sea.
2.03      Sfax lies at the low end of a gently sloping plain which covers an
area of roug',ly 15 km by 9 km. The gradient of the slope from the sea to
about 15 km froin the coast averages about 2% to 3%. Even beyond this point
the gradient is not severe. The slope of the first several kilometers from
the coast is less than the average. This area coincides with a generally high
water table and it is therefore the area where it is the most difficult to
evacuate stormwater.
2.04      Sfax is located in a semi-arid area, and its sparse vegetation tends
to be overgrazed.  This reduces the moisture absorption capacity of the soil
and constitutes another flood enhancing factor. Furthermore, as urbanization
pushes further inland, the protective hedgerows or "tabias" built along the
large garden lots are partly destroyed because of sales and inheritance prac-
tices. These tabias, which consist of soil berms crowned with cactus hedge-
rows and which can reach a height of two meters or more, help to hold the
soil, reduce runoff and increase absorption of rain water, and are particu-
larly effective when built perpendicularly to the flow, for they then tend to
trap water, hold it in place and permit greater infiltration.
Rainfall
2.05      The annual average rainfall in the Sfax region is about 200 mm but
precipitations as low as 37 mm have been observed in 1946-47 and as high as
650 mm in 1969-70. Most of the rain falls in the months from September to
December, and to a lesser extent in the month of March.  Sunmners are practi-
cally dry.  Floods usually occur in October, undoubtedly the wettest month,
with an average rainfall of 40 mm and a recorded maximum of 463 mm.  Rains are
usually local and torrential and may have intensities as high as 20 mm per 15
minutes. Rainfall data gathered over a 100 year period have been analyzed and
a depth-duration-frequency correlation has been established (Annex 3).
Population and Housing
2.06      In the period 1975-1982, Greater Sfax' population grew from 260,000
to 313,000, or an average of 2.7% per year. However, because of its impor-
tance as a port, its industries, its agricultural base, and its strategic
position as service center for Southern Tunisia, Sfax is expected to grow
faster than the rest of Tunisia at about 2.8% per year and thus reach around
450,000 by 19951/. This appears justified because of Sfax' overall
1/ "Le Grand Sfax - Evolution Récente - Développement Futur", by Noureddine
Karray, June 1982



-6-
activity, and the fact that it has the country's highest employment rate and
that average family income is relatively high and makes it attractive to
potential migrants from the hinterland or other small towns.
2.07     Houses are typically built of clay or concrete blocks with cement
facing. The mortar used is often of poor quality and disintegrates slowly
when saturated with water. Houses are generally small, and owner-built and
occupied. This type of house is particularly vulnerable to heavy floods and
the resulting damage is often irreparable.
Flood Characteristics in Sfax Area
2.08     The typical flash flood in the Sfax area is caused by short, heavy
rainstorms concentrated on small areas and generally starts within hours of
the onset of the rain, leaving little or no time to evacuate population or
their belongings, a task which is particularly difficult when the flood occurs
at night. Because of the unpredictability of these storms, no advance warning
system is feasible.
Existing Flood Protection
2.09     There are two main dry water courses, or "oueds", near Sfax: Oued
Maou in the south and Oued Ezzit in the north. These oueds and their tribu-
taries are dry for all but a few days of the year, to the point that land-
owners plant trees and cultivate crops in their dry beds. Oued Maou has been
leveed with earth dikes whereas Oued Ezzit bas been left largely without pro-
tection. Oued Maou has a small collecting basin in association with a rock-
faced weir located where Oueds Agareb and Khalifa meet to form Oued Maou (IBRD
Map No. 17067). The left bank levee contains a "blow-out" section designed to
fail under extreme flows in order to maintain the integrity of the rest of the
system. Oued Ezzit is not leveed and its channel is cluttered in parts with
residential and commercial buildings, trees and debris. Its lower reaches are
actually occupied by a shop-lined street.
2.10     The oueds and their tributaries are rarely lined, and structural pro-
tection measures such as bridge abutments, riprap or gabions are seldom used.
There are no adequately sized retention basins and accompanying structures to
reduce the velocity of rushing waters and capture some of the sediment and
debris they carry. There has been little attempt to maintain the size of the
channels aind sediment deposited has only been removed where deposits have
created immediate problems, such as on roads or within small storm drainage
structures. The result has been a reduction of the carrying capacity of
existing channels.
2.11     The Second Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1675-TUN) includes three
stormwater collectors which would evacuate the stormwater of the internal
impluvium of the city and as such form an integral part of the flood protec-
tion measures envisaged in the proposed project. Construction has been held
up because of a cash shortfall to finance the additional local cost component
which resulted from bids being substantially higher than the original



- 7 -
estimates (TD 5.4 million vs TD 2.8 million). During negotiations of the pro-
posed project the Government confirmed the availability of the necessary funds
and its expectation that construction would start by November 1983. In view
of the importance of these collectors to the success of the project con-
tract(s) award would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.

2.12     The treatment of the land in and around the oueds has greatly
increased the effects of flooding. The thrust of development of Sfax has been
towards the garden lots where the partial destruction of the tabias (para.
2.04), the erection of walls around properties and the creation and surfacing
of new streets have all contributed to redirect flood flows, diminish soil
absorption and increase the velocity of water runoff. Although the 1975 Law
("Code des Eaux") forbids, inter alia, construction in water courses which are
declared part of the public domain, and this Law has usually been enforced,
there have been some squatters and other isolated exceptions, such as an olive
oil factory built in Oued Ezzit, contributing to the exacerbation of naturally
difficult conditions. After the 1982 flood, however, this factory was removed
at Government order. Furthermore, most homes built by squatters in the river
bed of Oued Ezzit were washed away by the flood and those remaining will be
removed during rehabilitation works.
Insurance
2.13     The history and severity of floods in the Sfax area is such that none
but a few large commercial concerns have been able to obtain flood insurance
coverage. Insurance companies have indicated that, once the level of risk
will be substantially diminished, they will be prepared to offer coverage at
acceptable premium levels (0.3 to 0.8 per thousand of capital insured).



III. THE 1982 FLOOD
Physical Characteristics
3.01     On October 30 and 31, 1982 rains of unusual intensity fell over the
areas north and west of Sfax. A total of 177.3 mm of rain was registered in
13 hours with a peak hourly rate of 45.2 mm. The storm has been estimated to
have had a frequency of occurrence of once in 150 years for the region, i.e.,
a probability of occurrence of 0.66%. The flood started a few hours after the
onset of the rain and peaked during the night of the 30th to the 31st of
October. Its intensity was such that the "blow out" section in the levee sys-
tem along Oued Maou failed as planned (para. 2.09).
Damages and Damage Estimates
3.02     Floods have been recorded as early as 861 A.D. in Tunisia. However,
useful data became available only during this century and covers the floods
which occurred in 1934, 1957, 1969, 1973 and 1982. Damage estimates were not
comprehensive prior to 1982. Records indicate that the 1973 and 1969 floods,
for instance, had a frequency of occurrence of 18 and 50 years respectively,
while damages may be roughly estimated at TD 14.5 million (US$ 23.0 million)
and TD 35.3 million (US$ 56.1 million) respectively in 1983 prices.
3.03     The 1982 flood took at least 69 lives, destroyed about 700 houses and
damaged another 8,000. It damaged streets, roads, railways, bridges and power
supply lines and telecommunication equipment. It also took its toll on
business, industrial and public buildings, equipment, materials and supplies
as well as the personal belongings of those whose houses were destroyed or
damaged.
3.04     Total October 1982 flood damages in the Sfax area have been conserva-
tively estimated at TD 47 million or US$ 75 million equivalent (Annex 2),
excluding the loss of lives. Other nearby communities, namely Jebeniana, El
Amra and Sidi Mansour also sustained severe damages for an aggregate estimated
amount of TD 3.6 million, or US$ 5.7 million equivalent. The mere threat of a
flood is costly to the economy. When people fear for the security of their
family, their home and their belongings, they are not likely to report to
work. In the Sfax area, production losses attributable to this cause alone
are broadly estimated at TD 0.9 million, or US$ 1.4 million equivalent each
year. The 1982 flood was particularly severe. In more normal years, annual
physical damages to roads, in-city transportation, railways, and post and
telecommunication equipment easily reaches an estimated TD 1.7 million, or US$
2.7 million in 1983 prices.
Flood Relief Assistance
3.05     Soon after the severity of the Sfax flood was ascertained, the
Tunisian Government and the international community responded with the
following assistance:



- 9 -
(i)  about TD 0.7 million (US$ 1.1 million) was provided by the Tunisian
Government for immediate aid to the flood victims;
(ii)  disaster aid teams arrived from France;
(iii) disaster assistance personnel, tents and blankets arrived from
Germany;
(iv)  two large pumping trucks were provided by the United States to assist
in cleaning up drains; and
(v) grants amounting to about US$ 10.5 million equivalent were received
from oil surplus countries for flood damages sustained throughout
Tunisia.
3.06     Emergency relief is a necessary but costly form of assistance in
cases where economic means of protection are feasible.  Flooding in Sfax is no
exception to this rule. The proposed project would help prevent flood disas-
ters in the Sfax area at a reasonable cost (para. 5.05).

IV. THE PROJECT
Genesis
4.01     Floods have occurred relatively frequently in Sfax, E`d the need for
providing flood protection control measures has long been recognized. In the
1950s and 1960s the situation was studied by various consulting firms and some
protection was provided with the diversion of the Oued Khalifa and the con-
struction of dikes along this Oued and the Oued Maou. In 1977 and 1978 a
French consulting firm (SOGREAH) produced a sewerage and storm drainage master
plan proposing a belt canal around the western edge of the city with a number
of collectors placed in a radial pattern outside the canal. The northern
section of this canal would carry water around the town's perimeter directly
into the sea, the southern section would empty into the Oued Maou. As no
financing was available at that time, the project could not be implemented.
'However, soon after the 1982 flood, the Government of Tunisia revived it and,
in November 1982, requested financial assistance from the Bank to carry it
out. Because of the frequency of flooding in Sfax and the need to rehabili-
tate the damaged dikes before the October 1983 rains, a feasibility study,
consisting in part of the updated 1978 master plan and making use of 100 year
hydrological data, was urgently prepared in January 1983 by a team of 14
highly qualified specialists from a consortium of French and Tunisian consult-
ing firms, under the guidance of the Bank. The Bank's appraisal is based on
this study.
Objectives
4.02     The main objective of the proposed project is to minimize the flood
damage potential in Sfax and neighboring communities. It is not economically
feasible to devise a project to provide full protection to the entire popula-
tion of the Sfax region. The aim of the proposed project therefore is to
protect as much of the population from as great a flood magnitude as can be
economically justified (para. 5.04). The proposed project would reduce the
risk of loss of life from floods, give the population a greater sense of
security, protect public and individual properties, reduce production losses
and ensure permanent and efficient maintenance of flood protection infra-
structure through the strengthening of the Regional Directorate of the
Ministry of Equipment.
Description
4.03     The proposed project consists of six components:
(i)  rehabilitation of the water course of Oued Ezzit on the northern side
of Sfax;
(ii)  rehabilitation and extension of the existing dikes along Oued Maou
and Oued Khalifa on the southern side of Sfax;



- il -
(iii) construction of an 8 km long belt canal at about 4 km from the city
center;
(iv) minor flood protection works in neighboring villages;
(v)  provision of equipment to maintain the flood control facilities;
(vi) staffing, equipping and operation of a special Flood Protection
Section within the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment
in Sfax to be responsible for maintenance and repairs of flood pro-
tection works; and
Consultant services for detailed engineering and works supervision of the
*         execution of the project components referred to under (i) through (iv) will
also be provided.
Engineering
4.04     The feasibility study for the project is of high quality and has been
carried out by a consortium of French and Tunisian consulting firms (SOGREAH,
CNR, SOTINFOR). Detailed studies of the new works are well advanced and
expected to be completed by June 1983, and the related bid documents by
November 1983. In Sfax, rainfalls have been recorded on a 24 hour basis since
1880, and with recording gauges since 1942. Correlations have been estab-
lished between the frequency, the intensity and the duration of the rainfall
and the flood intensity (Annexes 3 and 4). The design flood having a 100 year
frequency has been chosen in such a manner that the total cost of the proposed
flood protection works and the probable residual damages, both estimated in
January 1983 prices, are minimal (Annex 5). The study also covers operation
and maintenance requirements, as well as recommendations on the staffing and
equipping of a new DHU section to be created within the Sfax Regional Direc-
torate of the Ministry of Equipment, responsible for maintenance of flood pro-
tection works in the Governorate.
Cost Estimate
4.05     The estimated cost of the proposed project amounts to TD 30.24 mil-
lion (US$ 47.95 million) with a foreign exchange component of TD 17.50 million
(US$ 27.74 million) or 58% of the total cost. Identifiable taxes and duties
amount to about 21% of the total cost. The cost estimates include the front
end fee of US$ 62.344 which the Covernment has requested the Bank to finance.

4.06     The cost estimates are based on the January 1983 feasibility study
and recent bid awards for similar works in Tunisia, and are considered to be
reasonably accurate. Costs have been adjusted to April 1983 levels. Physical
contingencies for civil works have been estimated at 15%. Price contingencies
of 10% for 1983, 9% for 1984 and 8% thereafter for local costs and 8% for
1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% thereafter for the foreign cost com-
ponent have been included in the cost estimates. Annex 6 displays the esti-
mated annual project investments.



- 13 -
4.07     The project provides for 125 man months of foreign consulting
services for the preparation of the detailed engineering studies and the
preparation of the bid documents, and 200 man months of local consultants for
works supervision. The estimated cost of these services (including foreign
travel and subsistence) is TD 1.2 million (US$ 1.9 million) or an average of
US$ 9,600 per man month for foreign consultants and US$ 3,500 per man month
for local consultants.
Project Financing
4.08     The proposed Bank loan of US$ 25.0 million would finance 90% of the
foreign exchange cost of the proposed project, representing 52% of the total
cost or 66% of the total cost net of taxes, as well as the front end fee of
US$ 62,344. The loan would be made to the Government. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that the remainder of the project cost would be
financed by the Government, either totally out of its own resources, or par-
tially out of its own resources, supplemented by the proceeds of a loan which
the Government has requested from the African Development Bank. Assurances
were also obtained that, in addition, the Government will provide any supple-
mental funds required for a timely completion of the project.
4.09     Government financing would be partly provided by the following
special relief funds; (i) after the 1982 flood that affected several Tunisian
governorates, the Government received donations amounting to about TD 6.6 mil-
lion (US$ 10.5 million) from, inter alia, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the
Islamic Conference Organization; these funds have been pooled in a special
relief budget ("Fonds de concours") to cover, for the whole country, relief
and repair efforts related to the October 1982 floods; (ii) in addition, the
Government levied an exceptional national taxi'/ ("Contribution exception-
nelle pour la réparation des dommages inondations") to contribute to flood
protection works and damage repairs. This tax is expected to yield TD 5.0
million (US$ 8.0 million); (iii) finally the Solidarity Tax ("Contribution
exceptionnelle de solidarité"), instituted ten years ago (Law No. 73-72 of
November 19, 1973) to provide funds annually for disaster prevention works and
damage repairs, would produce in 1983 about TD 2.0 million (US$ 3.2 million).
Project expenditures financed by the Government exceeding the amounts to be
allocated for the Sfax region from these special national funds, will be pro-
vided through normal budgetary procedures, or partially from the ADB loan
(para. 4.08).
Implementation
4.10     The proposed project would be implemented by the Directorate of Urban
Hydraulics of the Ministry of Equipment. Consultants will be recruited, in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines, to provide assistance for detailed
engineering and works supervision when and where required. According to the
attached implementation schedule (Annex 7), which has been discussed and
agreed upon during negotiations, construction would be completed by June 30,
1988. Land acquisition for the belt canal and relocation of people actually
living on the required land is in progress and is expected to be completed
1/ Art. 82 of 1983 Finance Law (Loi de Finance).



- 14 -
by May 1984. Bids for the acquisition of maintenance equipment are expected
to be invited by May 1983 for supply by September of the same year. Bids for
the construction works would be invited by November 1983. Works would start
before mid 1984 to be completed by mid 1987 for the belt canal and by mid 1988
for the Oued Ezzit protection works.
Maintenance
4.11     By Ministerial Decision of February 2, 1983, the Minister of Equip-
ment has specifically charged the Regional Director representing his Ministry
in Sfax with the responsibility for the maintenance and repair of flood pro-
tection works in the Sfax Governorate. To execute this decision, a new sec-
tion of the DHU is to be staffed and equipped in the Regional Directorate of
the Ministry of Equipment in Sfax (Annex 1). The establishment of this new
Section is included in the proposed project. It will be staffed with one
engineer and fourteen permanent support staff, which is considered adequate
since during emergencies temporary labor can be recruited or borrowed from the
Transportation Section. The new Section will be provided with equipment
financed under the proposed project. Pending the recruitment of staff and the
provision of equipment, the Transportation Section has undertaken some of the
most urgent repair works which have to be completed before the 1983 rainy
season. During negotiations assurances have been obtained from the Government
that it will provide the new Section with adequate staff, equipment and annual
operating funds estimated to amount, in constant 1983 prices, to TD 70,000 per
year by project completion (Annex 6).
Procurement
4.12     All major civil works and equipment supply contracts, estimated to
total US$ 35 million equivalent, will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's procurement guide-
lines. For bid evaluation purposes a 15% margin of preference or an amount
equal to the customs duties, whichever is lower, would be applied in the case
of equipment manufactured in Tunisia. Small contracts, which are not expected
to attract international competition, will be procured through local competi-
tive bidding (LCB), in accordance with Government procedures which are satis-
factory. For this type of contract, individual ceilings of US$ 800,000 for
civil works and US$ 150,000 for equipment and aggregate ceilings of US$ 4 mil-
lion and US$ 0.6 million respectively would be retained. Work by force
account, after Bank approval, will be carried out by the Ministry of Equipment
for repair and rehabilitation works up to a maximum value of US$ 1.5 million.
Small works related to connections to, or deviations or protection of, tele-
phone, gas, water, sewerage, electricity, lighting and transport services and
lines, estimated at US$ 200,000, will be executed by the Post, Telephone and
Telegraphic Authority (PTT), the Electricity and Gas Authority (STEG), the
Water Authority (SONEDE), the Sewerage Authority (ONAS), and the Railroads
Authority (SNCFT) for the account of DHU according to local procurement proce-
dures for public contracts which are acceptable to the Bank. Consultants, as
and when required, will be employed in accordance with the Bank's guidelines



- 15 -
for the use of consultants by World Bank borrowers. All ICB bid documents,
amounting to about 80% of the total contracted value, would be reviewed by the
Bank on a prior to award basis. LCB and the PTT, STEG, SONEDE, ONAS and SNCFT
contracts will be subject to ex-post reviews.
Disbursements

against certificates of expenditures which would be audited according to
standards and procedures acceptable to the Bank (Annex 8). Disbursement
records would be available for review by Bank supervision missions.
4.15     Disbursement profiles show that disbursements for the water supply
and sewerage sector in the EMENA region have extended over an eight year
period while the overall disbursements for Tunisia have extended over seven
and a half years. Taking into account the urgency and the special character
of the proposed project and the simplicity of the works, it is anticipated
that the proposed Bank loan would be fully disbursed in a six year period.
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing
4.16     In view of the urgency of the project and in particular the impor-
tance of providing the new Flood Protection Section, which will be in charge
of maintenance and repair works, with the required tools and equipment,



- 17 -
advance contracting for the acquisition of equipment in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines is appropriate. No expenditure for this item is expected to
be incurred before the signing of the proposed loan. Final studies of the
flood protection works including topographical and geotechnical studies and
the preparation of bid documents are being carried out by a consortium of con-
sultants engaged in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. In order to speed
up the execution of the project the Bank would agree to retroactive financing
up to an amount of US$ 600,000 for the work carried out by these consultants
starting January 1, 1983.
Accounting and Auditing Procedures
q            4.17     The accounting system of the Ministry of Equipment has been reviewed
and found to be adequate for the recording and control of project-related
financial transactions, including those of the proposed flood protection pro-
ject, and its maintenance and repair activities. Separate accounts, including
sub-accounts to record force account expenditure, will be maintained by DHU to
record expenditures along the lines of the proposed loan categories. The
accounting and control system is described in detail in Annex 8.
4.18     Government internal control procedures, as presently applied, are
acceptable to produce the necessary audit reports; they are also relied upon
for several Bank financed agricultural and highway projects. During negoti-
ations, agreement has been reached that the Contrôle Général des Finances
carry out annual audits and provide the Bank with audit reports and financial
statements of project accounts and force account expenditure sub-accounts of
the DHU no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year.
Cost Recovery
4.19     While the benefits of the proposed project would be widespread, the
beneficiaries cannot be easily identified. First, different floods affect
different parts of the city and it is impossible to predict which residents
and the extent to which they may be affected by future floods. Second, the
public infrastructure of the entire Sfax Governorate suffers from floods.
Third, the whole Tunisian economy is affected because of the essential rail,
highway, port and telecommunication facilities through Sfax. The Tunisian
policy that the state should pay for the cost of flood prevention infra-
structure out of general revenues is therefore acceptable. In addition to the
special national relief funds (para. 4.09), part of the cost would be met by
the "Fonds communs des collectivités locales", a fund provided by the yield of
various municipal taxes including municipal property taxes (para. 5.01), and
intended inter alia to finance construction and maintenance of flood protec-
tion works.

Reporting
4.20     During negotiations assurances have been given by the Government that
the Directorate of Urban Hydraulics of the Ministry of Equipment would report
quarterly on the progress of the project. Such reports would cover all perti-
nent information related to the project including maintenance and repair works
and reference to the project implementation schedule and comment on any devi-
ations to it.
4.21     During negotiations, assurances have also been obtained from the
Government that within six months following the closing date of the proposed
loan. DHU would prepare and submit to the Bank a project completion report
reviewing the planned objectives and the achievements of the project, includ-
ing the costs and benefits derived and the performance and contribution of all
parties associated with project execution and systems operation.

V. JUSTIFICATION
Sectoral Approach
5.01     The proposed project is the first free standing flood protection pro-
ject in Tunisia in which the Bank is involved. The technical financial and
economical approach has been elaborated in close cooperation with the Direc-
torate of Urban Hydraulics and is intended to be used as a model for future
flood protection projects. The Bank is also collaborating in a study carried
out by the Directorate of National Land Planning, assisted by the Stockholm
University, evaluating Tunisia's flood sensitive areas.  This study would lead
to the establishment of a national flood hazard map and would also look into
possible increases in land values resulting from flood protection projects.
Increased land values and resulting increased property taxes would contribute
to project cost recovery (para. 4.19). A combination of the established
approach and the flood risks study may lead to future bankable projects.
Alternative Solutions
5.02     Three basic possibilities were examined:
(i) Legislative solution: This solution relies exclusively on legisla-
tive measures to prevent the population from living in high risk
areas.
(ii)  No action solution:  No action is taken and the individuals affected
by the disaster, or the Government, assume the cost of the damages
when floods occur.
(iii)  Structural solution:  The construction of flood protection works to
protect the endangered areas.
5.03     The legislative solution would depend on a strict zoning policy and
thé relocation of tens of thousands of people. This solution is economically
prohibitive and politically unacceptable. Zoning alone would not solve the
problem as all existing structures in the high risk areas would remain
exposed. A comparative cost/benefit analysis of the "no action" and the pro-
posed "structural" solutions demonstrates that the latter is the best solution.
Least Cost Solution
5.04     Considering the topographic and demographic characteristics of
Greater Sfax, an intercepting canal between the outside impluvium and the
agglomeration to be protected is the most logical solution. The level of
protection, i.e. size and capacity of the canal for a 100 year recurrence
flood, has been determined in such a manner that the marginal cost of provid-
ing the protection equals the marginal benefits. Canal design took into con-
sideration several alternatives of construction costs, types of lining, and
ongoing maintenance costs. The location of the belt canal would be particu-
larly appropriate since it would be constructed parallel to a belt road under
construction which would provide accessibility for maintenance of the canal.
Land acquisition for the combined project and relocation of the inhabitants
affected is currently in progress and is expected to be completed by May

1984.  The selected flood protection system represents the least cost solution
at a discount rate of 10%.
Economic Justification
5.05     The proposed project would have an economic rate of return (ROR) of
about 17.5%. The cost stream includes the investment, operating and main-
tenance costs (free of taxes and duties) over a 40 year period for the facili-
ties included in the proposed project augmented by the investment, operating
and maintenance costs related to three stormwater collectors which are
included in the Second Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1675-TUN) (para. 2.17) and
which have not yet been constructed but form an integral part of the necessary
flood protection works. The benefit stream consists of the damage cost which
would be avoided by constructing the proposed project. To this end, the 1982
and several previous floods were analyzed and a relationship established
between the flood frequency and the estimated damage values (in 1983 prices)
caused by these floods. The same computation was repeated with the proposed
project in place in order to obtain the curve representing the residual damage
values (Annex 4). The area between the two curves represents the probable
annual averted damages and amounts to TD 4.02 million (US$ 6.38 million) in
1983 prices. For future years it was assumed that these benefits would
increase as a result of population and GNP growth in the project area, esti-
mated at about 3% and 2% per annum respectively. As this analysis does not
consider unquantifiable benefits (life, health, environment) the above men-
tioned rate of return of 17.5% is a minimum value. A sensitivity analysis
indicates that a 10% project cost increase would result in a ROR of 16.2%, a
20% decrease in benefits in a ROR of 14.6%, and a combination of a 10% cost
increase and a decrease in benefits of 20% would result in a ROR of 13.5%.
Benefits of the proposed project
5.06     One of the most important benefits of the project, not quantified in
the analysis, would be its potential for reducing loss of life and human
trauma. It would also avoid considerable economic losses in terms of prop-
erty, personal belongings and foregone production.
Environmental Impact
5.07     The environmental impact of the proposed project would be positive.
It would contain flood waters in a designed system and reduce erosion in the
project area. It would also prevent occasional spread of overflowing sewage
and garbage over the area of inundation and drain currently stagnant bodies of
water in the city and reduce related health hazards.
Project Risk
5.08     The proposed project presents no unusual risk.  The possibility of
slippage and related cost overruns would be minimized by the provision of
consultants who would assist the DHU in works supervision. The new Section
within the Sfax Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment would minimize the
risk of deterioration of the new flood protection facilities. Furthermore,
the Bank would closely monitor the establishment of this new Section and
supervise implementation of the proposed project.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During negotiations agreements have been reached on the following
items:
(i)  the Government will provide the necessary funds to cover the remain-
der of the foreign cost requirements and the local cost of the pro-
ject as well as any cost overruns in a timely manner (para. 4.08);
(ii) the Directorate of Urban Hydraulics will implement the proposed pro-
ject in accordance with the implementation schedule shown in Annex 6
(para. 4.10);
(iii) the Government will provide the new Flood Protection Section of the
Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment in Sfax with ade-
quate staff, equipment and operating funds (para. 4.11);
(iv) the "Contrôle Général des Finances" will carry out the annual audits
of the project related construction and maintenance works within the
Directorate of Urban Hydraulics and the regional Flood Protection
Section and provide the Bank with audit reports and financial state-
ments no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year
(para. 4.18);
(v)  the Directorate of Urban Hydraulics will report on a quarterly basis
to the Bank on project progress and all other project related matters
(para. 4.20);
(vi)  the Directorate of Urban Hydraulics will prepare and submit to the
Bank, within six months following the closing date, a completion
report reviewing the planned objectives and the achievements of the
project, including the costs and benefits derived and the performance
and contribution of all parties associated with project execution and
systems operation (para. 4.21);
6.02     The award of contract(s) related to three stormwater collectors
included in the center of Sfax will be a condition of effectiveness (para.
2.11).
6.03     Agreement having been reached on the above, the proposed project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 25.0 million to the Government of Tunisia for
a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace.

ACCOUNTINC AND AUDITING PROCEDURES
A. Budgetary System
1.       The state budget comprises two parts:  Title I which corresponds to
the recurrent budget, and Title II, which is the capital budget.  Preparation
and consolidation of all budgetary proposals is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance and Planning. Approval of the budget requires legislative
action.  In particular, for Title II parliament votes on:
(a) The "loi-programme" which lists investments to be carried out and
their estimated cost to be spread over the period of execution;
(b) Annual commitment credits (credits d'engagement) which are authoriza-
tions to contract during the year for a given total amount; and
(c) annual payment credits (credits de paiement) which are authorizations
to disburse during the year for a given total amount.
After approval each Minister is informed of the commitment and payment credits
allocated to his Department. In Title II transfers of "credits d'engagement"
between headings (Articles) can be authorized only by the Minister of Finance
and Planning. Transfers within headings are authorized by the recipient
Ministers; all transfers between "credits de paiement" are also authorized by
the recipient Ministers. Following the acknowledged intention of Government
to progressively decentralize powers and functions, the recurrent budget is
being partly regionalized with allocations directly administered by local
authorities. The same policy is expected to be applied in the future to the
capital budget, the administration of which is presently still centralized in
Tunis.
B. Accounting
General
2.       A computer center, administratively attached to the Prime Minister's
office, registers all contracts and budgetary commitments. The center
receives information from the Ministries on printed data sheets which are
approved by the controller (see para. 6) prior to acceptance by the center. A
monthly listing is issued by the center and sent to each Ministry concerned
for reconciliation with their own internal accounts. However, computerized
information is limited to commitments and does not register payments. This
reduces its usefulness, as Ministries therefore have to maintain their own
internal system to control payments.

Ministry of Public Works
(a) Contracts
3.       An account is kept for each contract; on it is registered original
cost, variation of cost, amount and date of payments made, rLtention monies,
etc. At the end of the contract a reconciliation sheet is prepared for final
settlement. This document is reviewed by the controller (see para. 6). A
file is attached to each account sheet. It contains a copy of monthly bills,
statement of quantities and other financial transactions; thus allowing easy
certification of accuracy and authenticity of expenditure. For externally-
financed projects, where foreign contribution is expressed in percentage(s) of
total cost, the account sheet and supporting documents allow straightforward
compilation and control of expenses eligible for loan disbursement. Requests
for reimbursement from the external lenders are held rending receipt of pay-
ment details from the Ministry of Finance and Plannin ;. This, however, does
not affect the carrying out of projects because all funds (whether of external
or internal origin) are fully budgeted.
(b) Force Account
4.       Most maintenance and repair works financed under Title I (recurrent
budget) are carried out by force account. Three budgetary headings are
directly involved, namely:
Article 60: For materials, spares, fuel, etc.
Article 32: For salary of workers
Article 30: For overhead costs, including civil servants' salaries
Repairs and maintenance costs of flood protection works have probably been
undervalued because of current allocations of expenditures between Titles I
and II. However, this is not expected to affect Bank-financed expenditures.
The existing detailed cost accounting of expenses under Articles 60 and 32 of
Title I makes it possible to trace any expenditures incurred by Title I on
behalf of works financed under Title II.
(c) Recurrent Flood Protection Maintenance Budget
5.       The cost accounting referred to above provides detailed information
on maintenance, listed by type, performed annually in each territorial sub-
division; the accounts also show the quantities of materials used and unit
costs. The information provided under the present system is considered ade-
quate to assess whether the requirements set forth in the maintenance program
are met.

C. Control and Audit Procedures
6.       There is a corps of controllers (named "controleurs des Services
Publiques") attached to the Prime Minister's office. Controllers are respon-
sible for approval, prior to commitment, of all expenditure financed under
Title I and Title II. Controllers are assigned to one of more Ministries and
Public Enterprises or Services, but they remain administratively independent
from the entity(ies) they control. Approval by the controller is evidenced by
a visa on data sheets sent to the computer center, orders of payment to the
State Cashier (trésorier-payeur général), bidding documents, award and settle-
ment of contracts, etc. Control is usually based on the availability of
budgeted funds for the proposed allocations and the compliance with proce-
4           dures; however, sometimes the review goes so far as judging whether or not the
expenditures proposed are appropriate. If a visa is refused, the case may be
brought to tbe Prime Minister's office where final decision is taken. At year
end the controller prepares a report summarizing the inadequacies in budgetary
and financial matters noted during the year. This report is reviewed by the
concerned Ministry or the Board of Directors of the interested entity. Cor-
rections if necessary are made during preparation of the next budget. How-
ever, because of perennial dearth of staff, late or discontinued reporting in
the past and the potential risk for these "in house" controllers to have their
independence erroded with time, it is not considered that such controls meet
Bank's audit requirements.
7.       Control functions are also carried out by the "Contrôle Général des
Finances" attached to the office of the Minister of Finance and Plannin l/.
Specific investigations covering a wide variety of subjects are assigned to
the controllers in Ministries, Public Services and State Enterprises. Con-
trols are based on compliance with procedures and funds allocation and report-
ing includes opinion and recommendation on the operating capacity and organi-
zation of the controlled entities. Because of their independent position,
overall professional competence, and familiarity with budgetary and admini-
strative procedures, the "Contrôle Général des Finances" has been accepted by
the Bank to carry out the audits of Bank financed projects.
8.       Furthermore, controls carried out a posteriori by the "cour des
comptes" are done with such delay as to serve little useful purpose from an
auditing point of view.
