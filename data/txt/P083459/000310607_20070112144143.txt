Description        The proposed Third Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC
                   3) i s the first in a new PRSC series designed to assist the
                   Government o f Mozambique (GoM) to implement key policy
                   actions outlined in its Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f
                   Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA I1 by its Portuguese
                   acronym) and in the Performance Assessment Framework
                   agreed by the Government and the 18 external partners that
                   provide general budget support (GBS) to GoM. PARPA I1 i s
                   mainly focused on shared growth and on the need for
                   decentralization. Within this context, PRSC 3 i s expected to help
                   the GoM in: (a) the consolidation and deepening o f the
                   institutional reforms inthe area o f macroeconomic management;
                   (b) reforms in governance by supporting decentralization to
                   enhance public investments and service delivery at the
                   provincial and district level, and by supporting public sector
                   reform; and (c) economic development by improving the
                   investment climate, removing constraints to growth, such as
                   infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.
Benefits           The     operation   will   help           Government     maintain
                ~~                                    the
                   macroeconomic stability while it continues to pursue a reform
                   agenda that cannot be fully financed from domestic sources. The
                   reforms would enable Mozambique to make further progress in
                   reducing absolute poverty, improving the delivery o f services
                   and achieving the MDGs. The alignment with the general budget
                   support programs o f 18 other donors and a joint focus on the
                   priorities set out by the Government in its comprehensive
                   poverty reduction strategy, and on a common set o f indicators to
                   measure progress, should help improve the resource flow and
                   improve aid effectiveness, thereby enhancing the chances o f
                   progress towards the MDGs.
Risks              One set o f risks      i s concerned with the potential for
                   macroeconomic instability. Instability may arise as a result o f
                   terms o f trade shocks, deteriorating finances, or unpredictability
                   o f donor disbursements. While terms o f trade shocks and
                   regional instability are exogenous, better public finance
                   management, and the adoption o f MoU's with development

                   partners has made aid flows more predictable. A second set o f
                  risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement
                   reforms.    To mitigate this risk, the Government and donors
                   agreed during the Joint Review to develop an integrated strategy
                   for capacity development in public finance management, and to
                   strengthen the coordination and management o f reforms. A third
                   set o f risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could
                   compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. To
                   mitigate this risk, the Bank has intensified its policy dialogue on
                   governance issues in harmonization with the G18 and has
                   restructured its public sector reform project to support the
                   second phase of public sector reforms; a new component in
                   support o f capacity buildinginthe judiciary sector has also been
                   included. A final set o f risks concerns the potential impact of
                   HIV/AIDS in reducing human and institutional capacity to
                   deliver public services and may pose a contingent liability
                   regarding the future costs o f treating this disease.

                              I. INTRODUCTION

1.       Thisprogram documentproposes a Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC 3) to the Republic of Mozambique for SDR 46.6 million (US$70 million
equivalent), on standard I D A terms and outlines the triggersfor moving to PRSC 4 and
PRSC 5. The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's strategy to support the
implementation o f Mozambique's Second Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute
Poverty (known as PARPA I1by its Portuguese acronym), aided by the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the Government and the eighteen external
partners (the G-18) providing general budget support (GBS). This, the second PRSC
series, will include three annual operations to be delivered over FY07-09. While the
PRSC operations will provide financial support for implementing the whole PARPA,
they are to be disbursed against the upfront completion o f a number o f specific reform
measures identifiedinthe PAF.

2.       The first series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits was successfully
deployed. PRSC 1 was approved as a single-tranche operation by the Board o f IDA on
July 6,2004 for SDR 40.9 million (US$60 million equivalent) and PRSC 2 was approved
as a two-tranche operation by the Board on September 17, 2005 for SDR 83.3 million
(US$120 million equivalent). PRSCl and 2 supported programs covering primarily cross-
cutting issues: (i)macroeconomic stability; (ii)public finance reforms, including the
design and implementation o f a new integrated electronic financial management system
(e-SISTAFE), budget comprehensiveness, improved accounting and accountability,
strengthenedinternal controls, reform of the procurementprocess, and improved linkages
between budgeting, planning and the delivery o f service; (iii)the efficiency o f the
delivery of services through civil service reforms; and (iv) the investment climate for
private sector development. Overall progress on the reforms has been satisfactory, and
the Government continues to pursue a far-reaching reform agenda. Although there has
been progress, it was from a very low base after 16 years o f war, and significant
challenges remain.

3.       Theprogram supported by theproposed new PRSC series is well aligned with
the PARPA II. PARPA I1 i s structured around three pillars (Governance, Human
Capital, and Economic Development) and is the operational plan o f the Government's
Five-Year Program. Interms o f sequencing, the PRSC series i s designed to focus first on
key constraints in cross-cutting areas such as public financial management and the
business environment, which are the areas that provide the rationale for the prior actions
of PRSC 3. The series then evolves to support decentralization and shared growth
through the incorporation o f triggers for PRSC 4 and 5. All the prior actions and triggers



                                            - 1 -

o f the PRSC series are indicators contained in the Performance Assessment Framework
(PAF) in order to be consistent with the government's own monitoring framework and to
be inline with donor harmonization for general budget support (see Annex 1).

4.        The program supported by the PRSC series has been informed by a
signifcant amount of analytical work completed over the pastfew years. This includes
two PERs (FYO1and FY03), two Country Economic Memoranda (CEM, FYO1, FY06), a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY02), a Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR, FY03), an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA, FY03), a
Financial Sector Assessment (FY03), a Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Risk
assessment undertaken with other donors (2004),            an Assessment o f Financial
Management for 2004/05 using the PEFA methodology (2006), a Country Health Status
Report (FY05), a PSIA on the impact o f school fees (FY05), a study on the effectiveness
o f agricultural extension (FY05), a poverty profile publishedby the Government (2004),
an analysis o f changes and determinants o f poverty (FY06) and an agricultural
development strategy (FY06). Bank-IMF work on tracking public expenditures in HIPC
countries has also played a role inprogram design.

5 .       Progress on the reforms is monitored with the aid of the PAF. The monitoring
o f progress on the reforms i s done through the Joint Sector Working Groups, which also
includes Government representatives.      The assessment i s done on the basis o f the
indicators contained in the PAF (see Annexes 2 and 3), and through an annual Joint
Review conducted in April. Another review in September sets goals for the subsequent
year. The sector working groups have become a good mechanism for policy dialogue,
donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the Government and all the
donors involved in a specific sector. Furthermore, a joint Budget Working Group meets
on a quarterly basis with the Government to monitor budget execution, particularly inthe
priority sectors.

6.        Joint Reviews were completed successfully in April and September 2006. The
review o f achievements against the agreed PAF indicators in April found that there was
progress in terms o f expansion o f service delivery, but that reforms in the area o f
governance were still lagging. The Mid-Year Review o f September 2006 noted that the
pace o f these reforms should be accelerated, with the results made visible in order to
assure that popular support for the reforms become stronger and help make service
delivery expansion andpoverty reduction sustainable.



                            11.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. COUNTRYOVERVIEW

7.        Mozambique has been one of the star performers in Africa, as it recovers
steadilyfrom the damage of the civil war. Since 1992, infrastructure has been improved
and i s now approaching its pre-war levels. The economy has registeredan average annual
growth rate of 8 percent between 1996 and 2005, incomes have risen considerably; and



                                           - 2 -

the poverty headcount index has fallen from 69 percent in 1996/97 to 54 percent in
2002/03. Economic expansion has been made possible by overall macroeconomic
stability, policy reforms and continuing strong donor support, permitting broad-based
expansion across most sectors o f the economy. The sectors that contributed the most to
economic growth were agriculture, transport, communications and infrastructure, notably
roads. The decline in the poverty headcount index to 54 percent by 2002/03 beats by
more than 5 percentage points the PARPA Itarget o f reducing poverty to 60 percent in
2005. In addition, poverty levels decreased more in rural than in urban areas, making
Mozambique only the second country inthe world (other than Vietnam) to have achieved
this.Visibleprogress occurredinsocial conditions as evidence ofdecliningpoverty.
8.        Mozambique's jirst Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARPA I) was discussed by
the Board of I D A in 2001. Over the five years o f its implementation there was consistent
economic growth, averaging 8 percent per annum and a major reduction in poverty, by
15.3 percentage points between 1996 and 2003. Other progress include the following:

        e        The number of children in primary school was almost doubled from
approximately 2 million to 4 million inthe PARPA Iperiod.

        e        Maternal mortality was reduced from an estimated 1,000 per 100,000 live
birthsinthe early 1990sto 408 per 100,000 live birthsin2003.

        e        Under 5 mortality rates decreasedfrom 219 to 178 per 1,000 live births

        e        Infant mortality decreased from 147 to 124per 1,000 live births.

        e        The capacity o f the health system was expanded to start providing free
ARV treatment for HIV infection.
9.         The new Government elected in December 2004 is committed to sustaining
that process by deepening reforms to accelerate the reduction of poverty. The new
Government submitted its Five Years Program to Parliament in March 2005, where it
outlined an ambitious reform program to reduce absolute poverty. The Program
emphasizes the need to strengthen the market economy; develop a crash program for
vocational training; accelerate legal andjudiciary reforms; promote entrepreneurship for
small and medium businesses; and accelerate rural development by empowering district
administrations and communities.
10.       Mozambique's economyperformed well in 2004 and 2005. Real GDP growth
was robust in both years, at 7.5 percent in 2004 and 7.7 percent in 2005 (Table 1).
Looking back, the growth record has been spectacular, averaging 8 percent from 1966 to
2005. This performance has been driven by mega-project construction, investment from
neighboring countries and abroad, buoyant donor support, and healthy agriculture
growth'. Good rainfall, following the 2005 drought, resulted in a regular harvest season
and has improved food security. End-of-year inflation, which had shown an increase from
2004 (9.1 percent) to 2005 (11.2 percent), i s on a declining trend in 2006 as a result o f
lower food prices and the target o f single-digit inflation under PRGP-supportedprogram
i s now within reach, despite some added pressures on price stability stemming from

Memorandum o f 2005, Report No32615-MZ.

higher world oil prices. The foreign exchange rate has remained stable following the
introduction o f a temporary exchange rate band in the interbank foreign exchange market
in November 2005. As expected, the external current account deficit, excluding grants,
widened in 2005 due to a rise in cereal and oil imports, but international reserves
remained comfortable, reflecting an increase in donor inflows. The domestic primary
deficit narrowedby nearly 2 percent o f GDP in2005 (nearly 1percent o f GDP better than
programmed under the IMF-supported PRGF) compared to 2004, explained by 1%
percent o f GDP rise in domestic revenue, and expenditure restraint. Importantly, the
share o f priority expenditure inthe budget remained above the PARPA target.

11.         Public financial         management          (PFM) systems have shown               major
improvements. Substantive progress has been made through the rollout o f the integrated
financial management system (e-SISTAFE), according to the latest PEFA assessment.
The Homoine version o f e-SISTAFE was satisfactorily rolled out to six ministries
(agriculture, education, finance, health, planning, and public works) in July 2006. The six
ministries to which the system was rolled-out are now satisfactorily executing their
budgets for goods and services and capital expenditures2The authorities' medium-term
PFM Action Plan and Budget (APB) for 2006-0g3 includes the following main elements:
the rollout o f the budget execution module to all central and provincial entities, and its
customization to district and municipalities needs; the introduction o f Phase I1 o f the
budget formulation module; and the development o f new modules and functionalities.
The APB i s well-structured and the proposedphasing o f implementation is ambitious but
feasible.
12.         There is a stable relationship with the IMF, with recent collaboration
anchored on a PRGF that was approved by the IMF's Board in June 2004. The fifth
review o f the program was successfully completed in December, 2006, and the main


  Payments of salaries continue to be executed centrally by the accounting department o f the Ministry o f
Finance.
  By end-June 2006, the government and the donors reached an agreement on the AE'B for 2006-09 and a
new Memorandum ofUnderstanding (MoU).


                                                   - 4 -

conclusion o f the review was that the performance during January 2006-September 2006
was favorable. Fiscal performance for the first semester o f 2006 was better than
programmed with revenue collection above target, led by buoyant corporate VAT tax
collections, and domestic expenditures broadly in line with the program. The review also
found that public financial management reforms had made good progress with the
implementation o f a new version of the e-SISTAFEand that there had been progress in
reforming revenue administration and widening the tax base. Furthermore, the review
noted that progress on structural reforms in 2006 accelerated, particularly in the areas o f
public sector, labor market, and trade-related reform. Areas where slower progress was
noted included reforms to improve access to finance through an improved lending
environment, i.e. legal and judicial reform, as well as the deepening o f domestic debt
markets  .
B. MACROECONOMIC        CONTEXT

13.       Mozambique is likely to achieve the poverty Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs)as well as the water MDG targets. The number ofpeople who were lifted out of
poverty inMozambique is estimated at 3.7 million over the period 1996-2003. Assuming
that the current trend continues, Mozambique is expected to halve the population living in
absolute poverty by 2015. In the water sector, the share o f people with access to safe
drinking water in urban areas has increased significantly and the MDG for sustainable
coverage for urban water supply i s expected to be met. There has also been substantial
progress toward achieving the MDG targets, specifically on improving universal primary
education, gender equality and women's empowerment, reducing child mortality, and
improving maternal health. Nevertheless, more progress will be required to meet these
MDGs, while combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases remains a serious
challenge (see Box 1andAnnex 7).

14.        The government's near-term policy aims are outlined in the Economic and
Social Plan submitted to Parliament in late 2006. The policies seek to ensure
macroeconomic stability, thereby setting the platform for high and sustainable rates o f
economic growth that will reduce poverty while improving social services. kconomic
policy i s also guidedby the PARPA 11, placing greater emphasis than its predecessor on
boosting broad-based economic growth, decentralization and improving the quality o f
public spending. The PARPA I1i s to run over the longer timeframe o f 2006-10 and it
operationalizes the Government's Five-Year Plan approved by Parliament last year. It
coordinates the high level o f donor support expected to flow into the country in support
o f achieving the MDGs.
 15.      After increased demand for foreign exchange, mainly due to increasing
general aggregate demand and high oilprices, and depreciation pressures in 2005, the
exchange rate has remainedfairly stable in 2006. The widening o f the trade deficit from
9 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 10.9 percent o f GDP in 2005 created depreciation pressures
on the exchange rate. In 2005, exports grew by 16.1 percent in U.S. dollar terms; o f
which 14.2 percentage points were contributed by mega-projects (e.g., aluminum,
electricity, and natural gas). On the other hand, imports grew by more than 20 percent
(drivenmainly by higher cereal andpetroleumimports relatedto the drought and oil price
shock). The increase indemand for foreign exchange driven by changes inleads and lags
o f export and import payments contributed to a reemergence o f exchange rate
depreciationpressures inthe last quarter o f 2005 and first quarter o f 2006. Inresponse to
mounting exchange rate volatility, the Bank o f Mozambique (BM) temporarily
introduced an exchange rate band inthe interbank foreign exchange market inNovember
2005. Together with growth in traditional exports and a tighter monetary policy stance,
the exchange rate has remained stable since April 2006
 16.       The pace of expansion in credit to the economy has become more prudent.
The 12-month rate o f growth o f credit to the economy jumped from a negative rate o f    -
5.6 percent at end 2004 to an estimated 57.1 percent by the end o f 2005. A similar trend
was observed for the 12-month rate o f growth o f broad money (M3) that jumped from 5.9
percent in 2004 to 27.1 percent by the end o f 2005. A recent assessment by the IMF
suggests that the recorded increase incredit to the economy seems to have been drivenby
borrowing by domestic petroleum distributors related to the syndication o f oil import
transactions, the inclusion o f the operations o f a leasing company purchased by Banco
Internacional de Moqambique (BIM) inthe monetary survey since December (accounting
for about 7 percent o f total domestic credit) and, in part, due to structural factors
associated with banks resuming consumer credit (e.g. credit cards, loans to purchase
durable goods) following the completion o f their restructuring plans that have resulted in
healthier balance sheets. The trend was reversed in the first half o f 2006 and the rate of
growth o f base money declined accordingly.
 17.      Mozambique's debt is sustainable as confirmed by a new debt-sustainability
analysis carried out by the Bank and the Fund earlier this year taking MDRI into
account. As a result o f the MDRI, the NPV o f public external debt i s estimated to be
approximately halved, from about 25 percent to about 12 percent o f GDP in 2006. The
joint Bank-Fund DSA shows that debt dynamics remain sustainable under the baseline
and stress tests, albeit susceptible to a ratcheting up o f non-concessional external



                                            - 7 -

borrowing. In this respect, the authorities are appropriately committed to seeking non-
recourse financing for the transfer o f majority ownership o f the Cahora Bassa dam
operating company, HidroelCtrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), so as not to increase the
government's liabilities to commercial creditors. Inaddition, final agreements have yet to
be reached with Paris Club creditors (Japan and Portugal) as well as with some large non-
Paris Club bilateral creditors (e.g. Algeria, Romania, Libya, and Iraq) in the context o f
the enhancedHIPC Initiative.
18.       The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is favorable. The fifth review o f
performance under the PRGF program concluded that the prospects for 2007 remained
favorable, including for strong growth and the maintenance of a sustainable external
position, as the Government i s committed to take the necessary fiscal measures and
pursue a monetary program consistent with a further reduction of inflation. The
Government i s also committed to take measures to strengthen the banking system, foster
private sector development and revive the public sector reform. Real GDP growth i s
projected to be 7.9 percent in 2006, and is expected to remain around 7 percent in the
subsequent three years (see Table 2). The leading sector would be agriculture, followed
by construction and then by wholesale and retail trade. Cumulative inflation inthe year
through November 2006 stands at 7.2 percent, which means that the year-end inflation
should remain in the single digit. With slower expansion in credit and some leveling off
in oil prices, inflation is expected to remain in the single digit throughout the period
ending in 2009. Central to this strategy will be a gradual strengthening o f the fiscal
position underpinned by an average increase in revenue o f 0.5 percent o f GDP per
annum. Some o f the factors that have contributed to a positive macroeconomic outlook
include the adoption o f conservative fiscal policies, sizable efforts to increase revenue
mobilization, no external borrowing on commercial terms, minimal subsidies to the
productive sectors, and targeting about two-thirds o f public expenditures to priority
sectors for poverty reduction.

Despite the promising progress, signijkant challenges remain. The country remains
poor (US$3 10 per capita income); infrastructure i s inadequate; social indicators are low;
and poverty rates remain high. Adult literacy rates are low (approximately 47 percent)
and life expectancy at birth (42 years) i s one o f the lowest in Africa. The country also
relies heavily on foreign aid, which makes up about half o f its overall budget.
Additionally, the impact o f HIV/AIDS and malaria on the population has serious
consequences if not controlled. Malaria alone accounts for 35 percent of deaths among
children below five years o f age, 60 percent o f admissions in pediatric wards, and 40
percent o f overall outpatient consultations. It has been found that in Sub Saharan Africa,
malaria reduces GDP growth by an estimated average o f 1.3 percent per year. As for
HIV/AIDS, current projections indicate that in 2010 the Mozambican economy will be
14-20 percent smaller than it would otherwise be due to the impact o f HIV/AIDS. The
Government's development and poverty reduction strategy focuses on tackling many o f
these concerns.

                 111. THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM: PARPA I1

19.            I n September 2006, the Government formally adopted the Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PARPAII). PARPA I1 was prepared through broad-based
consultations with major stakeholders and civil society involving four national and ten
provincial Poverty Observatories. It i s built on the experience o f PAWA I,including the
PRSP Annual Progress Report (BdPES, or Balanqo do PES in Portuguese) presented to
the ExecutiveBoards o fDirectors of IDA and the IMFinJune 2005, along with the Joint
Staff Advisory Note (JSAN). P A W A I1 i s the operational plan for the governments'
Five-Year Program (2005-09) and for the first time includes a strategic matrix o f key
indicators, a joint effort by the government, donors and civil society. These indicators




                                                                  - 9 -

will be fully integrated into and monitored through the annual reporting instruments o f
the Economic and Social Plan (PES inPortuguese).
20.     The quality of poverty diagnosis in PARPA 11represents an improvement over
PARPA I. The definition o f poverty has been broadened to include qualitative
dimensions, largely as a result o f pressure from civil society through the Poverty
Observatories. The data used in P A W A I1i s considered to be relatively reliable and o f
good quality, not least because it was possible to draw on the second household survey
results to analyze trends over a 5 year period. Other improvements are that PARPA I1
offers both quantitative and qualitative information, information on the depth and severity
o f poverty levels, and poverty determinants.
21.        While maintaining its commitment to improve quality and access to social
services, PARPA II recognizes that the "rapid, sustainable and broad-based growth"
warrants more emphasis on the growth of the productive and private sectors. This
strategy i s reflected in a pillar approach based on the Five-Year Government Program in
contrast to the sectoral approach used in P A W A I.This shift ensures consistency with
the principal policy framework o f the Government enabling the building o f synergies
within each pillar and cross-cutting themes. In addition, an essential role is attributed to
districts as the focus of development, while small and medium enterprises (SMEs) form
the engine o f employment generation. There i s also a clear recognition o f the challenges
relatedto HIV/AIDS, with a credible strategy for accelerating the national response to the
AIDS pandemic. Overall, the priority areas for public policy to sustain growth and
poverty reduction, and improve service delivery are arranged under three pillars: (i)
economic development; (ii) capital; and (iii)
                                human                 governance.
22.        The PARPA 11 will be implemented with the aid of a medium-term
expenditure framework.        Economic growth i s expected to remain at about 7 percent
while inflation is kept to single digits. The medium-term fiscal scenario (CFMP)
translates P A W A I1 into an expenditure framework. Its approval by the Council of
Ministers for the first time in 2006 lends the CFMP credibility as a tool to guide the
preparation o f subsequent budgets and formed the basis for disseminating the 2007
budget ceilings. The expenditure framework i s based on trends in sector expenditures
compatible with the objectives and goals o f PARPA 11, rather than on a full costing of
policies and programs envisaged. There i s a needto continue improving the planning and
budgetingprocess by buttressing the information on donor-financed expenditures in the
CFMP including multi-year commitments both for program and sector level support.
These go along with the needto strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system.

A. PILLARI:GOVERNANCE

23.       PARPA 11sets out a broad and ambitious agenda of governance reforms. The
proposed reforms target the areas o f public administration, public financial management,
decentralization, the judiciary sector, as well as anti-corruption measures. These are to be
complemented by increasingpopular participation at local level, focusing on the district as
the key unit o f service delivery. The reforms in public administration will include a
complete census o f all civil servants, the unification o f the three existing databases on civil
servants, the formulation o f a new salary policy, and functional analysis o f the key


                                             - 10-

ministries to provide better services. Decentralization includes the gradual transfer of
decision making power to the district administration by allocating an investment budget to
each district, giving them more authority over human resources 'management, and
strengthening the Consultative District Councils; an increase in the number of
municipalities with elected city governments; and rethinking intergovernmental fiscal
relations. Reforms inthejudiciary sector will address inefficiencies and lack o f capacity in
the administration o f justice with the objective o f making justice more accessible to the
citizens. Key elements o f the anti-corruption strategy include the reduction o f red tape that
offer opportunities for rent-seeking, increased transparency inpublic financial management
and access to information by the public, as well as a strengthening o f the institutions
prosecutingcases o f corruption.

B. PILLAR 11:HUMAN      CAPITAL

24.       This pillar seeks improvements in human capital through interventions in the
social sectors and potable water infrastructure. Overall the approach laid out for the
health, education and water sectors in the PARPA I1text i s considered o f good quality and
consistent with the sectoral priorities and with achieving the MDG targets. For the period
2007-2009, the objective is to reduce infant and maternal mortality; almost double the
number o f people benefiting from ARV treatment o f HIV/AIDS; increase the net schooling
rate and the conclusion rate o f primary education for girls; improve the quality o f teaching
by reducing the student-teacher ratio; increase access to drinking water; and expand social
protection programs among others. This will require significant investments in expanding
primary health and education infrastructures; the hiring and training o f large numbers o f
health personnel and teachers; developing an effective outreach and treatment program for
people living with HIV/AIDS; and a strengthening o f the planning capacity to provide
sustainable water services at the local level. PARPA I1also attaches great importance to
vocational training oriented towards the job market by reforming the curriculum and the
institutional framework, and through the rehabilitation and expansion o f the network o f
vocational schools. It will also be important to consider the relative contribution o f
infrastructure interventions in human development outcomes. For example, drainage and
water are critical for malaria and cholera reduction in urban areas, as are roads and
sanitation for education and health outcomes.

C. PILLAR 111:ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT

25.      Overall, PARPA N deals with the key dimensions of a broad-based growth
strategy. PARPA I1emphasizes the importance o f a market economy and the need to
strengthen the private sector to make it more competitive by improving the investment
climate, reducing the time it takes to start a business and to make the formal labor market
more flexible. This should be achieved through the elimination o f administrative barriers;
the streamlining of the administration, such as introducing one-stop windows and the
computerization o f notarial records; and new labor legislation. It proposes public-private
partnerships where the private sector alone would not be able to succeed, particularly in
agriculture and tourism. Irrigation systems will be rehabilitated with public funds (mainly
donor financed projects) and managed by the beneficiaries, and the number o f peasants
assisted by public extension services i s expected to double between 2007 and 2009. By

                                            - 11-

2009, it i s expected that 78 percent o f the national road network, which includes
secondary and tertiary roads, be in good or reasonable conditions. PARPA I1 also
proposes job creation programs, such as labor-intensive programs for maintaining tertiary
and vicinity roads andby including women inroads projects.
26.      Thispillar addresses the improvement of the investment climate and removing
key constraints tofurther growth. Reforms and measures under this pillar are aimed at
(i)strengtheningmacroeconomic management, (ii)      improving the business environment,
(iii)development of the financial system, (iv) promoting the creation of a strong,
dynamic, competitive, and innovative private sector, (v) promoting the priority sectors,
broadening the business class, and creating jobs (this includes agriculture and agrarian
services, natural resource management, industry, fisheries, tourism, mineral extraction,
oil exploration, and several employment creation programs); (vi) improving the
integration o f Mozambique into the regional and international economy; and (vii)
promoting the integration and consolidation o f the domestic market. The latter includes
road and water transport, ports and railways, bridges, marketing systems and regulation
o f internal trade.

                IV. BANKSUPPORT TO GOM'S PROGRAM

A. LINKTO CAS

27.      The PRSC series is consistent with the CAS. Bank support to the PARPA i s
through the FY04-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 26747-Moz). The
base case scenario o f the CAS envisages programmatic support through four consecutive
PRSCs to support Mozambique's efforts in building public-sector capacity and
accountability, improving the investment climate, and expanding service delivery. The
PRSCs would support the maintenance o f macroeconomic stability and focus on cross-
cutting public sector management and governance issues, with the key challenge beingto
replicate the strong macroeconomic policy and implementation record at the sector level
to facilitate economic transformation andpermanent poverty reduction.
28.      One of the key CAS objectives is to achieve a full alignment of Bank
instruments with the principles of local ownership and leadership. As government
policies and budget are the key instruments for implementingthe PARPA, the Bank is
committed to supporting and aligning with the budget process. PRSC 4 and 5 will be a
part o f the new CAS that will be submitted to the Board o f IDA in the middle o f CY07.
Preliminary discussions with the Government and the other development partners
confirm the centrality o f the new growth agenda and the importance o f accelerating
shared growth through infrastructure, rural and private sector development, and enhanced
governance reforms. The PRSC series i s also well aligned with the Bank's principles on
conditionality, namely (i)reinforce ownership; (ii)strengthen harmonization; (iii)
customization to country circumstances; (iv) criticality o f actions; and (v) transparency
and predictability (see Box 2).

                        Box 2: Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality


Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

The proposed operation is an integral part of the Bank's strategy to support the implementation of Mozambique's Second
4ction Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (known as PARPA II by its Portuguese acronym), and the Performance
4ssessment Framework (PAF) agreed by the Government and the eighteen external partners (the G-18). PARPA II is
structured around three pillars (Governance, Human Capital, and Economic Development) and is the operational plan of the
Government's Five-Year Program. The first PRSC series was successfully deployed in 2001 and overall progress of the
reforms has been satisfactory as the government continues to pursue a far-reaching reform agenda with the new government
elected in December 2004 deepening reforms to reduce poverty. The PRSC series has also been informed by significant
amount of analytical work completed over the past few years, including two PERs (FYOI and FY03), two CEMs (FYOI and
FY06), a CFAA (FY02), a CPAR (FY03), a Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Risk Assessment with other donors
(FY04),a PEFA (FY06) among others, that have been discussed with the government and fed significant input into the policy
making process.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
Framework

Progress on the reforms is monitored with the aid of the PAF. Improved service delivery in PARPA priority sectors, i.e.
agriculture, health, education, rural water supply, infrastructure,justice and related governance sectors, is monitored through
Joint Sector Working Groups. Progress in achieving all the indicators contained in the PAF is assessed twice a year through
the Joint Review in April and the Mid-Year Review in September.The sector working groups have become a good mechanism
for policy dialogue, donor harmonization,and for reaching agreement between the Government and all the donors involved in
a specific sector. Furthermore, a joint Budget Working Group meets on a quarterly basis with the Government to monitor
budget execution, particularly in the priority sectors.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances

The PRSC series is designed to focus first on key constraints in cross-cutting areas such as public financial management and
the business environment, which are the areas that provide the rationale for the prior actions of PRSC 3. The series then
evolves to support decentralization and shared growth through the incorporation of triggers for PRSC 4 and 5. In order to
reduce the transaction costs for the Government, the Bank carries out all supervision jointly with the other donors. A Joint
Review takes place each year in April (year n). It assesses the performance of the government in the previous budget year,
which corresponds to the calendar year (year n-1). The review focuses on evaluating progress with regard to the indicators
defined in the Performance Assessment Framework and makes an overall assessment of progress. The second event is the
Mid-Year Review in September. This review is mainly forward-looking and formalizes the agreement on the performance
indicators and targets for the following year (year ntl). Programmatic lending will be complemented by investment support.
PRSC support will coexist with investment support to well-articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to
develop government systems and capacitiesnecessary for an increased reliance on them.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

All the prior actions and triggers of the PRSC series are indicators contained in the Performance Assessment Framework
(PAF) and were selected because of their criticality for achieving objectives which are consistent with the government's own
3monitoringframeworkwith 12triggers for PRSC 4 and 8 indicative triggers for PRSC 5. There are no benchmarks.
                       and to be in line with donor harmonizationfor general budget support. The results framework for PRSC
  has 7 prior actions,

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support

The Bank's supervision of the PRSC series is aligned with the supervision of the joint General Budget Support program of the
G18. Both the Joint and the Mid-Year Review are a multi-sector exercises, and Bank staff participate in all relevant sectors.
Disbursements will be contingent on satisfactory progress towards a subset of the PARPAs medium-term objectives as set
out in the PAF matrix. In addition, the review process is explicitly designed to allow announcing budget financing amount early
in the year in the budget preparationcycle and to disburse early in the budget year, a principle to which the Bank now adheres
to after a two-tranche interim PRSC 2.



                                                          - 13-

29.     Development policy lending will be complemented by investment support and
technical assistance. PRSC support will coexist with investment support to well-
articulated sector programs, and with technical assistance to develop government systems
and capacities necessary for an increased reliance on them. The share o f policy-based
lending in overall IDA financing in FY04-06 was 44 percent (or US$180 million out o f
US$407 million o f new commitments over the three years taken together).                       The new
PRSC series would increasingly embrace the new growth agenda and support the
Government's focus on development at the district level. These objectives are also
supported by several IDA projects, thereby creating strong synergies.
30.      The PRSC series serves as a vehicle for policy dialogue. The policy dialogue
focuses on public sector capacity and accountability with a strong focus on strengthening
financial management, improving the investmentclimate and expanding service delivery.
This policy dialogue has become institutionalized through the Joint Reviews with the
Government and the G18 and the 24 sector working groups that monitor the
implementation o f the PARPA. Technical assistance i s being provided through separate
projects for public sector reform program, judicial reform, regulatory reform in selected
infrastructure sectors, private sector development, financial sector strengthening, and
decentralization to municipalities and local governments. The PRSC series i s
complementary to parallel efforts to reduce poverty supported through a large IDA
portfolio o f investment projects in HIV/AIDS, education, water supply and sanitation,
agriculture, tourism, roads, railways, and other infrastructure.
31.     Strengthening governance is a cross-cutting objective of the interventions
supported by the PRSC series. The PRSC series i s contributing to this overarching
objective through several channels, including strengthening the capacity, transparency,
and accountability o f state institutions, including in key sectors, such as for example
public finance management, and at the local level through decentralization; raising the
demand for better governance by supporting participation and oversight by civil society,
as for example through the activities associated with the Poverty Observatories; fostering
a competitive and responsible private sector through interventions aimed at improving the
business environment and the investment climate; and contributing to strengthen
accountability overall through the process o f joint reviews that monitor progress in
implementation o fthe PARPAIL4

32.      There are strong synergies between the PRSC series and the investment and
technical assistance programs supported by IDA. The cross-cutting institutional and
governance reforms are supported with technical assistance and training through the
Public Sector Reform Project, while reform o f the social security system i s supported


  Overall, the PRSC series is well aligned with the Bank's strategy to enhance governance and anti-
corruption in client countries, as laid out in the paper entitled "Strengthening Bank Group Engagement on
Governance and Anticorruption", released on September 8,2006.


                                                    - 14-

through the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, which supports the
development o f a sound financial system in general. Decentralization capacity building
efforts is being supported through the Decentralized Planning and Finance Project. Rural
development including the expansion o f the transport infrastructure i s being supported
through investment operations in agriculture and inthe roads sector. Inreturn the policy
and institutional actions under the PRSC make for a facilitating framework in which
activities inthe various projects are implemented.
33.     The investment portfolio, with 23 projects, is diverse and supports the three
pillars of the CAS. As o f September 2006, total Bank commitments were US$1,009
million. Details o f the investment programs are in Annex 8. Several operations support
the pillar o f governance and macroeconomic management by supporting public sector
reform including decentralization and the strengtheningo f municipalities, public financial
management, and the improving the soundness o f the banking sector. In what concerns
economic development, support has been provided to a sector-wide assistance program
(SWAP) in agriculture that seeks to improve the impact o f public expenditures and
provide an enabling environment for sustainable and equitable growth in the rural areas.
A CDD-type smallholder development project was approved in FY06. In transport and
infrastructure there are four investment programs supporting rehabilitation and
maintenance o f roads, railways and ports, and reforms inthe energy sector. Strengthening
the investment climate and encouraging private sector participation has been supported
through projects in the communications and minerals sector, and through the private
enterprise development project (closed in June 2006; a successor operation i s under
preparation).

c.  COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF

34.      The Bank and the IMF cooperate closely within their respective mandates in
assisting the Government to implement the PARPA. The IMF leads the policy dialogue
on macroeconomic policy (including fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies), the
integrated financial management information system (SISTAFE) and tax and customs
reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on public expenditure management, sector
structural reforms, reforms o f the civil service, and poverty and social impact analysis.
Areas o f close collaboration include banking supervision, financial sector issues, trade
issues, the PARPA, and external debt sustainability.
35.      The IMF approved a PRGF in 2004 which complementsBank support. InJuly
2004 the IMF approved a new arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) to support the Government's economic program for the period 2004-
2006. The structural reforms supported by the PRGF aim to consolidate macroeconomic
stability and sustain strong broad-based growth, consistent with the PARPA. The fifth
review under the program was successfully concluded inDecember, 2006.

D. COLLABORATION/HA~ONIZATIONWITHDONORS

36.    A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the Government
and 18 donors (G18) providing general budget support. In addition to the World Bank,
the following countries and multilateral institutions are members: African Development
Bank, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Holland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK. The IMF,
USAID,Japan andUNDP are observers.
37.       This MoU is a breakthrough in donor harmonization in Mozambique. Two o f
its fundamental principles are predictability and alignment with domestic systems. To
align with the local budget cycle, support for year n+l i s based on the assessment o f the
Joint Review in year n, which looks at the government's performance in year n-1 using
the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) matrix agreed to in year n-2. The M o U
also spells out that disbursements o f general budget support can be interrupted within the
year if any one o f the underlying principles i s violated. Macroeconomic stability i s such
an underlying principle, as are the government's respect for human rights, democratic
governance, and commitment to sustainable poverty reduction.
38.       A third basic principle is that monitoring has to be donejointly and that all
"conditionality" has to be based on the common PAF. This means that prior actions and
triggers can only be drawn from the PAF, and the fundamental assessment whether the
Government's performance has been sufficient to merit further budget support will be
undertaken duringthe Joint Reviewtaking place each year inApril.
39.       Afourth principle is that no separate reporting to the donors is required. This
reduces transaction costs for the Government and enhances domestic accountability. The
agreed PAF has become an annex to the Government's annual Economic and Social Plan
approved by Parliament together with the annual budget, and the annual Joint Review i s
based on the progress and budget execution reports submitted to and discussed by
Parliament.
40.       A fifth principle is mutual accountability. A Performance Assessment
Framework for donor behavior to monitor that they are living up to their commitments.
Donors' performance i s assessed annually by an independent consultant. The criteria for
assessing donor performance have evolved since 2004. This year's donor PAF is modeled
using many o f the indicators o f the Paris Declaration, but some o f the targets here are
more ambitious.
41.       Harmonizedgeneral budget support has become an important aid instrument.
The amount o f general budget support given in 2000 was around US$lOO million, by
2005 it was US$274 million, and the amount committed for 2006 reached US$344
million, as more and more partner agencies have joined the harmonized mechanism by
signingthe MoU, as shown inTable 3.

         E. PARISDECLARATIONAID EFFECTIVENESS
                                     ON

         42.      Implementation of the Paris Declaration is monitored by the G18, the UN
         agencies and other development partners. The big challenges are to align project aid
         with the national budget system, integrate it as much as possible with the government's
         treasury and reporting system, and reduce the number o f Project Implementation Units.
         43.      There has been progress in 2006 to bring project aid on-budget. As a result, the
         budget has become a meaningful instrument for decision-making on resource allocation,
         and linking resources to results. The 2007 budget submitted to Parliament made further
         progress. External resources increased by 40 percent, most o f which due to recording
         more o f the project finance inthe budget; before these projects were off-budget.




         44.      PRSC1and 2 supported a broad reform agenda covering institutional reforms
         to achieve three objectives. They were grouped in pillars: (i)improve public sector
         capacity and accountability, (iii)    improve the investment climate, and (iii)       expand social
         service delivery. While significant progress was made justifying an overall positive
         assessment, it has to be kept in mind that many challenges remain, that capacity i s still
         weak, and that some reforms were implemented more slowly than originally envisaged.
         Reforms in strengthening public financial management made impressive progress and
         key pieces of legislation were adopted improving the investment climate; but public


                                                         - 17-

sector and judiciary reforms were slower than expected with the exception o f
decentralization.


G. LESSONS     LEARNED

45.     Ownership is important. PRSC 1 and 2 achieved their main objectives due to
strong ownership o f the reform program by the Government. The Government elected in
December 2004 renewed this commitment.            As a result, the medium term reform
strategies never sufferedreversals, despite delays in implementation. For example, there
were delays in implementing an ambitious new electronic public financial management
and information system in 2004 and 2005. But these delays have in the meantime been
overcome and the transition to the new system i s now proceeding smoothly with good
results. A similar story could be told regarding civil service reform. The first phase
produced limited results, but after a thorough external review and extensive internal
consultations, a new strategy has been developed for the second phase that is fully owned
by the Government and which has started its implementation with a lot o f dynamism. The
lesson about the importance o f ownership has been taken into account inthe design o f the
new PRSC series: all the prior actions and triggers are drawn from the PAF which is
based on the PARPA 11. They are consistent with the sector strategies, reform programs
and their monitoring frameworks. This ensures a high degree o f internalization and
ownership by the concerned institutions.
46.     Reform programs must be accompanied by coordinated capacity building
efforts. It would have been impossible to carry out the reforms contemplated under the
first series o f PRSC's ifthey had not been supported through extensive capacity building
programs. In the past, much capacity building occurred through isolated technical
assistance projects, often driven by the priorities o f a donor. This has changed in the past
years, and multi-donor sector wide approaches have been developed and common funds
have been established, also for technical assistance and capacity building. This new
approach was essential to achieve the results that are visible now. This lesson has been
taken into account in the design o f the new PRSC series, as the reform program i s
supported largely through coordinated technical assistance and capacity building
programs. One example is decentralization where a decision was taken inAugust that the
three major area-based projects for decentralized planning and finance will be
consolidated into a single national program o f technical assistance from 2008, with a
parallel mainstreamed multi-sector budget process (via formula) to finance the district
plans themselves out o f the national budget.
47.       Alignment, predictability and donor harmonization are essential to improve
the quality of the budgetplanning and executionprocesses. The MoU o f the G18 aligns
general budget support with the Mozambican budget cycle, improves the predictability o f
resource flows, and harmonizes the donors regarding policy benchmarks, the reporting
and review process. It i s a powerful instrument to improve the quality o f budget planning
and execution and enhance the effectiveness o f aid. Largely as a result o f donor
harmonization, some reforms that had long been advocated, e.g. increasing budget
coverage for externally financed projects and own revenues - this was an important
recommendation o f the 2001 PER - became implemented. Comparing the quality and


                                            - 18-

comprehensiveness o f the 2007 budget with the one o f 2004 shows remarkable progress
o f bringing externally financed projects into the budget, and reporting on budget
execution has become more complete. This lesson has been taken into account in the
design o f the new PRSC series; the exceptions which the Bank requested under the
original M o U will be reduced in order to align the Bank's support with the Mozambican
budget cycle, to enhance predictability and to be harmonized with the other budget
support partners.
48.       Integrating general budget and sector issues produces better results. The fact
that the PAF contains indicators on the performance o f all priority sectors has led to an
integration o f views on macro and sector issues. The Joint Review has become a
comprehensive stock taking exercise and the 24 sector working groups have gained in
importance and relevance due to their role in the Joint Review process. Having a strong
link between sector strategies, sector monitoring, policy dialogue and general budget
support ensures a more effective framework for planning and implementation. This
lesson has been taken into account in the design o f the new PRSC series by making the
outcome o f the annual Joint Review the main prior action for the PRSC and by choosing
prior actions and triggers both with regard to macroeconomic management and sectoral
service delivery results.
49.       Defining monitoring indicators and a results framework early helps steady
progression from year to year. PARPA Iwas approved in 2001, but the first PAF was
only developed in 2004. As some o f the choices were made in an ad hoc manner, the
indicators in the PAF kept changing from one year to the next making multi-year
monitoring more difficult. This lesson has been taken into account in the design o f the
new PRSC series. As part o f elaborating PARPA 11, a strategic matrix was established
which used a results framework. The new 2007-09 PAF i s a prioritized sub-set o f this
strategic matrix. This makes it possible to use the results framework for monitoring the
implementation o f the program. The targets for each indicator have already been defined
for 2007-09 to the extent possible.
H. ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGSOFTHE PRSC

50.      The PRSC series is built around a consistent set of analytical work. The
analytical foundations o f the PRSC seek to assess whether government policies and
institutions are adequately set up and do in fact contribute to the overall objective o f
reducing poverty and whether the systems and procedures for channeling resources to
support these strategies are appropriate. The Bank i s relying on core ESWs, including
CEM, PER, CFAA, CPAR as well as on analytical sector work and PSIAs. Table 4
presents the current status o f these analytical underpinnings. The main conclusions o f this
analytical work are summarized inthe next paragraphs.

51.      Poverty Assessment. As affirmed earlier, the poverty headcount is estimated to
have fallen from 69 percent to 54 percent between 1997 and 2003.                         These findings
indicate that the Government's poverty program i s achieving results and are also broadly
in agreement with other data sources: (i)      MINAG data indicate that the per capita growth
rate o f cereal crop production was 14 percent in the six-year period 1996-2003 (`1.e. a
little over 2 percent annually), and mean household income increased by 61 percent; (ii)                  a
qualitative indicators survey (QUIBB) in 2000/01 found that poverty had decreased by
nine percentage points, using an econometric technique to link the (purely qualitative)
QUIBB with the household survey of 1996; (iii)in the household and agricultural
surveys, dramatic increases were found in the numbers o f bicycles, radios and other
assets over 1996-2003; and finally (iv) education and health indicator surveys found
strong improvements, particularly in the areas o f primary school attendance, vaccination
coverage, and attended births, over 1996-2003. The interventions associated with the area
o f economic development in the PRSC series will contribute to the Government's efforts
to reduce poverty.

52.   Country Economic Memorandum. A new Country Economic Memorandum
completed in September 2005 reviewed the economic performance in recent years,
provided a thorough analysis o f the poverty profile in Mozambique based on the new
household survey data, and analyzed the linkages between economic growth,
macroeconomic policies, and poverty in Mozambique.            It suggests policies for the
optimal use o f Mozambique's natural resources - land, forestry, fisheries, mining and
water - and for integrating their management into the overall growth strategy. Analytical
work on rural development and tourism, supported by the Bank, has contributed to this
exercise. Many o f the findings o f these inquiries have been incorporated into the new
PARPA for the period 2006-2010 and were usedto define the prior actions for PRSC 3
and the triggers for PRSC 4 and 5.
53.     Public Expenditure Reviews. PERs were completed in FY02 (in conjunction
with the CFAA) and inFY04, in a participatory process that brought together central and
sectoral government institutions, local and international academic and research institutes,
the private sector, and a variety o f donors. The recommendations of these PERs focused
on improving budget formulation, execution and reporting to enable better tracking and
informed decision-making concerning poverty-related expenditures through reforms
which are supported by the PRSC series.
54.     Public Financial Management. A Country Financia1Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) was completed in 2001 in collaboration with several donors and the
Government, an IMF Review o f Standards and Codes (ROSC), and a joint Bank-IMF
assessment of the Government's capacity to track poverty-reducing expenditures, have
also been completed. All noted improvements and continuing challenges in
Mozambique's public financial management and fiduciary systems. They also identified
specific action plans for dealing with weaknesses in coordinating support and policy
dialogue on these issues. Government actions being supported by the PRSC series play a
central role inhelpingto implement these action plans.
55.     Procurement.      A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was
prepared in 2001, but it was only in 2004 that the Government agreed to take action. In
line with these recommendations, and with the support o f this PRSC, a new procurement
decree following international best practice will be submittedto the Council o f Ministers
for approval following extensive consultations with main stakeholders including
development partners.
56.     Financial Sector Analyses. Since 2000, the Bank has completed a study o f the
financial sector, AAA on Mozambique's compliance with the Base1 Principles, and a
formal financial sector assessment jointly with the IMF (FSAP). The May 2003 FSAP
assessment found that the potential vulnerabilities o f the banking system lie mostly in its
loan portfolio; that banks are exposed to high credit risk due to high and volatile lending
rates (themselves due to volatile inflation, high interest rate spreads and a poor lending
environment). It also found that the volatility o f the Metical threatened financial sector
stability.  The first PRSC series addressed a number o f these issues by supporting
Government action to strengthen banking supervision; improving market oversight
through transitioning the banks to international financial reporting standards (IFRS); and
improving the lending environment through needed legal reforms (including the adoption
o f a new Commercial Code).       In addition, the proposed Financial Sector Technical

Assistance investment project i s facilitating the implementation o f the main FSAP
recommendations.
57.     Legal and Judicial Sector Assessment. This Bank assessment, which i s under
Government review, found that: (i)      Mozambique's legal and judicial sector institutions
have not kept pace with economic growth in the 1990s, with the result that public
confidence inthem i s low, and they are now perceivedto be a deterrent to investment and
a hindrance to growth; (ii)   the sector's key problem i s a relative lack o f skilled human
resources; (iii) the sector needs to develop results-focused management practices and a
culture o f accountability for results; (iv) while some laws (e.g. regarding land and labor)
are a hindrance to growth and should be revised, the main effort should focus not on
legislative but on administrative reform; (v) sector institutions must fight and be seen to
fight corruption, or their reform efforts overall will become irrelevant. The dialogue
leading to the new PRSC series highlighted the issue, leading to the decision to include a
trigger that will reflect the implementation o f a results-focused management process
within Government and the benchmarking o f Government actions intended to improve
the administration o fjustice.
58.     Investment Climate Assessment.           The Bank, together with the Investment
Promotion Center and the Confederation o f Economic Associations o f Mozambique,
completed an I C A in 2003. From an analysis o f 193 firms surveyed in 2002, the I C A
found that the most severe constraints to doing businessin Mozambique included: (i)      lack
o f access to and the high cost o f finance (cited by 78 percent o f the sample); (ii)
Mozambique's uncertain policy environment; (iii) costs imposed by regulatory and
                                                      the
administrative procedures; and (iv) inadequate infrastructure. The first PRSC series took
many o f the ICA's recommendations into account and tangible progress regarding
changes in the legal framework has been achieved. The new PRSC series aims to
consolidate these reforms, particularly reducing the time and cost involved in registering
a business. Policy dialogue will also address emerging issues, such as delays in the
Government payment o f VAT refunds.
59.     Education PSIA.       A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA, FY05) has
studied the impact o f school fees on primary school enrollment and retention. It was
undertaken to fill the information gap on the impact o f direct costs (formal and informal
school fees and related schooling expenses), and opportunity costs on enrollment and
pupil retention in primary education. The main recommendations were for the
Government to: (i) the current policy on school fees, to clarify the type (if any),
                      revise
purpose, frequency o f fee contributions, payment mechanisms and accountability o f
funds; (ii)initiate public information campaigns to educate communities on the right of
children to attend primary school; (iii)   increase resources that are channeled directly to
the schools, mainly through the Direct Support for Schools program, to ease the burden
on households, especially when it comes to purchasing pupil's school materials; (iv)
ensure better deployment o f teachers so as to distribute qualified teachers, especially in
rural areas; and (v) build schools closer to the communities, so as to reduce the travel
time to school, and consolidate lower and upper primary schools into one physical place
to increase the likelihood o f continuation from one level to the next. Eventhough the new
PRSC series has no specific prior action or trigger in the field o f education, the analytical

work informs the Bank's policy dialogue on the composition o f the budget and quality o f
public expenditures ineducation.
60.     Better Public Health Spending to Reach the MDGs. The main sector issues
identified are: the lack o f adequate human resources (in 2003, Mozambique had one
doctor per 40,000 inhabitants compared to one for 22,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa) and
low pay; uneven geographic access and utilization o f health services; weaknesses in
quality o f services; irregular application o f user charges that are a disincentive to
receiving care, and low budget execution. Key recommendations include the need to be
more strategic in preparing the budget, and to focus on strengthening management and
improving the coverage and skill levels o f paramedical staff. Eventhough the new PRSC
series has no specific prior action or trigger in the field o f health, the analytical work
informs the Bank's policy dialogue on the composition o f the budget and quality o f
public expenditures inhealth.
61.     Agricultural Development Strategy. The strategy documents how agricultural
growth in the post-war period was based on the extension o f the cultivated area, rather
than increasing yields. It advocates a two-pronged approach o f enhancing productivity for
smallholder agriculture and strengthening the bargaining power o f smallholders who
participate inout-grower schemes.

         V.      THE PROPOSEDNEWPRSCSERIES:PRSC3-5

A. OVERALL     DESCRIPTION

62.     The main objective of the new PRSC series is to support the implementation of
PARPA II.Inline with this objective, the proposed operations focus on policy reforms in
two o f the pillars o f PARPA 11: Governance and Economic Development. IDA'Sfocus
will be geared at specific areas, which are a subset o f the PAF (which itself is a subset o f
the strategic matrix o f PARPA 11). Key reforms in public financial management were
treated in the text o f PARPA I1partly under the pillar o f Governance, and partly under
the pillar of Economic Development. The strategic matrix and the PAF highlighted the
importance o f these reforms by creating a fourth domain: Macroeconomic Management.
The new PRSC series will also support reforms inthis area.
63.     The PRSC series aims at helping the Government make progress towards a
strategic subset of objectivesdefivledin the PAF matrix. This strategic subset focuses on
consolidating cross-cutting institutional reforms, decentralization and accelerating shared
growth. Under the PRSC series, the Government would complete the computerization o f
its public financial management system including procurement, and substantially
strengthen audit controls. Decentralization would be accelerated to improve the quality o f
service delivery and empower communities to decide more about the investment
programs in their districts. The PRSC series would also monitor policy reforms that
would facilitate the achievement o f two key measures to improve shared growth: the
maintenance and expansion o f the national road network (which includes rural roads) and
programs to enhance agricultural productivity. In the context o f Mozambique, where
about 70 percent o f the population still lives in rural areas, shared growth necessarily
means rural development. This will be complementary to the various mega-projects inthe


                                           - 23 -

extractive industries sectors, where Mozambique has been very successful. These projects
attracted large foreign direct investments and created growth spurts during the
construction phase; but they are not labor intensive once completed. Therefore, labor
intensive rural and agricultural development i s essential to reduce poverty.
64.      PRSC 3 focuses on key constraints in cross-cutting areas such as public
financial management and the business environment. These are the areas that provide
the rationale for the prior actions of PRSC 3. The triggers for PRSC 4 and 5 then are
defined to support policy reforms in support of shared growth (infrastructure, agricultural
extension, etc.) at the local level andways to do better inthe decentralizationprocess. All
the prior actions andtriggers ofthe PRSC series are indicators contained inthe PAF. This
i s an important feature o f the proposed operations as, by relying on the PAF, the PRSC
series will remain consistent with the government's own monitoring framework and will
also be in line with donor harmonization for general budget support. As intermediate
outcomes, the PRSC series will support:
               (1) Macroeconomic management by consolidating and deepening the
                   institutional reforms inthis area.
               (2) Reformsin governanceby supporting decentralizatioddeconcentration to
                   enhance public investments and service delivery at the provincial and
                   district level, andby supporting public sector reform.
               (3) Economic development by improving the business environment,
                   removing constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting
                   agricultural gr~wth.~
B. PRSC3

65.      The criteriafor selectingprior actions and triggers are based on their criticality
for contributing to achieve the PARPA objectives. In summary, these criteria reflect the
following broad principles:
         1. The expected policy or institutional reform is critical to remove a key constraint
         to poverty reduction and growth, or i s an implementation activity o f a reform
         initiated earlier.
         2. They are part o f the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and the
         assessment can be done easily, e.g. verifying whether a law or some regulation
         has been approved. (All assessments requiring performance data and analysis are
         done duringthe Joint Review.)
66.      Thepolicy matrix and resultsframework for 2006-2008 in Annex 1presents a
sub-set of the PAF that highlights the specific areas that will be supported by the new
PRSC series. It i s worth noting that some o f the entries appear as outcomes (kilometers
o f roads in good conditions; areas irrigated). This i s done to remain in keeping with the
G18 partners and use the formulation inthe PAF. The full PAF is presented inAnnex 3.

5        The second PARPA I1pillar (Human Development) is monitored through the Joint Review and
the sector working groups. The Bank is closely involved inpolicy dialogue regarding human development
through investment operations and AAA work, but no specific prior actions or triggers will be required
under this pillar inthe next series ofPRSCs.

                                                 - 24 -

IDA will continue to monitor also the implementation of the policy actions that make
such outcomes possible. Inwhat follows, the prior actions for PRSC 3 and the triggers for
PRSC 4 and 5 are presented.


a. Prior Actionsfor PRSC 3:

        a.1 Macroeconomic Management

67.     Prior Action 1: Improve Budget Allocation for Priority Sectors: Actual
expendituresfor 2005 and budgeted expendituresfor 2006 were at least 65percent for
priority sectors. Expenditures for the priority sectors as definedinthe PARPA were 67 %
in2005, of which 55 % was for education and health, i.e. the latter two sectors received
37% o f all expenditures. The 2006 budget allocated over 69.5 % o f the resources to the
priority sectors, although some o f this increase can be explained by moving some donor-
financed off-budget projects into the budget (which i s desirable). Budget execution inthe
first semester o f 2006 was 61 % for the priority sectors, but the government is confident
that the 65% target can be achieved by the end o f the year, as the information about
externally financed priority activities was not available at the time the budget execution
report was compiled, and many priority sectors spendmore inthe second semester due to
the procurementcycle.
68.     Prior Action 2: Improve Efficiency of Public Financial Management: Rollout
of basicfunctionality of e-SISTAFE to three more ministries. The main functions o f e-
SISTAFE (treasury, budget execution, accounting) were rolled out to the Ministries o f
Agriculture, Health, and Public Works at the central and provincial level in July 2006.
They had previously been rolled out to the Ministries o f Finance, Planning and
Development, Education and Culture. As a result, the main spending ministries are
utilizing e-SISTAFE as o f July, 2006.
69.     Prior Action 3   -  Enhance Revenue Generation Capacity: Creation of the
Central Revenue Authority. The law and the regulations had been approved by
September 2006. Its president was appointed in November, 2006. This implies that an
important milestone in the multi-year institutional reform program o f the revenue
administration has been achieved.
70.     Prior Action 4   -Improve     Budget Comprehensiveness: Increase in the 2007
budget of own revenues of the Ministries of Education, Health, Agriculture, Public
Works, Tourism, Mineral Resources, and Youth and Sport. This indicator was
contained inthe PAF for 2006, and the Government has achieved it. Own revenues from
the mentioned ministries included in the 2007 budget as submitted to Parliament are
about 70 percent higher inreal terms than in2006.
71.     Prior Action 5   -  Enhance Procurement Practices: Implementation of new
procurement system up to the district level. The legal, regulatory and institutional
frameworks have been created for the new procurement system. UFSA, the unit within
the Ministry o f Finance supervising the procurement system, had its director appointed
with the rank o f Deputy National Director. The unit was given quality premises and the
hiring of staff is under way. An initial program o f courses on the new procurement


                                            - 25 -

system and regulations has been carried out at central and local level. A more systematic,
broader and sustainable training program i s being finalized with assistance o f an
international consulting firm. The procurement units in the line ministries are being
staffed. The standard bidding documents were finalized and published in September
2006.

         a.2 Governance

72.     Prior Action 6    - Decentralization: Definition    of criteria for allocation of the
investment budgetfor districtsfor the 2007 budget. Each district received a block grant
o f 7 billion Mt (Mt o f the old family; about $350,000) as an investment budget in 2006.
The priorities were decided at the district level in collaboration with the Consultative
District Councils. This was the first time that the district had any kindo f decision making
role regarding investments. For the 2007 budget, each district receives at least the same
amount as in 2006, but the actual amount i s determinedaccording to its population size,
the relative poverty of the province (poverty data at the district level are statistically not
representative), and the percentage o f a district's own revenue collection to create an
incentive for the efficient management o f public resources.

         a.3 EconomicDevelopment

73.      Prior Action 7 Strengthen the Business Environment: Simplification of the
                          -
proceduresfor starting a business.It took 153 days to open a new business in 2005. The
new Commercial Code (approved in December 2005) and the new Code for Registry of
Legal Entities (approved in March 2006) simplified the procedures. The commercial
registry has largely been computerized, which reduces the number o f days to open a
businessby at least 30 days. Furthermore, inSeptember 2006, the government approveda
decree whereby the registration becomes effective as soon as it is published on the
government's official website. This will reduce the time for starting up a business by an
average o f 80 days, the time it normally takes for the articles o f incorporation to be
published in the official gazette. Given that the registration process, including the first
step o f it (obtaining a certification o f unique name - certidao negativa) has been
computerized, the accuracy o f the registry has also increased. As a result o f these
reforms, it i s now possible to open a business in about 30 days. It i s worth noting that the
Doing Business 2007 report states that it takes 113 days to open a business; this i s based
on the information available in the beginning o f 2006; the changes that occurred since
then will be reflected in the Doing Business 2008 report. The reforms were not done at
the expense ofchangingthe requirementsfor doing environmental impact assessments.

 c. TRIGGERS         FOR PRSC4AND PRSCS

 74.         Triggersfor PRSC 4 and 5 assess whether the implementation of PARPA 11is
 on track. In line with the overall objectives and expected intermediate outcomes for the
 new PRSC series, the triggers are chosen as milestones whose achievement would
 indicate that the reform program and the implementation o f PARPA I1are on track.
 75.         The successful conclusion of the Joint Review remains as a key underlying
 condition. The successful conclusion o f the Joint Review, where the performance in all
 sectors i s thoroughly assessed according to the PAF, continues to be the fundamental
 condition for going forward with PRSC 4 and 5, and for determining the amounts. It i s
 expected that PRSC4 and PRSC5 are o f a US$70 million equivalent each under the
 condition that the Joint Review i s concluded successfully. This would represent about 40
 percent o f expected new IDA commitments in FY08-09 under the assumption that the
 envelope o f IDA resources available for Mozambique remains broadly stable.
 76.         The triggers are drawn from the PAF. PRSC4 triggers are drawn from the 2006
 PAF for all indicators that need to be assessed by the Joint Review o f April 2007 and
 from the 2007-09 PAF for the policy actions that will be carried out during 2007. The
 triggers for PRSC 5 are drawn exclusively from the 2007-09 PAF. It is worth noting that
 some o f the triggers for PRSC 4 and 5 are output/outcome indicators drawn from the PAF
 rather than policy and institutional actions (e.g., percentage o f road network in good
 shape; and number o f hectares irrigated). These indicators aim at capturing key
 milestones towards the achievement o f PRSC end-of-series outcomes. They will directly
 result from policy and institutional actions under the program supported by the PRSC
 series. In particular, a key policy measure will be to ensure that budget allocations (and
 outturns) are sufficient for improving the availability o f road transport and irrigation, in
 line with sector policies.



                                             - 28 -

77.      Under macroeconomic management, the triggers cover the areas o f resource
allocation for poverty reduction, institutional reforms to enhance domestic revenue
mobilization, budget management, procurement systems, and auditing. The expected
outcomes at the end o f the PRSC series are: (i)   the composition o f actual public spending
i s in accordance with the objectives o f PARPA 11; (ii)     revenue administration i s more
efficient; hence total revenues are a higher percentage o f GDP, despite the lowering o f
import duties; (iii)budget execution i s less time-consuming and transparency has
improved; (iv) the budget document i s comprehensive; (v) the public procurement
institutions are functioning more effectively and transparently up to the district level; (vi)
the coverage and quality o f audits at the local level have improved, and the external audit
institutionhas improved its capacity to issue opinions on more financial audit reports.
78.      Under the governance pillar, the triggers cover the areas o f civil service reform,
decentralization, and reform o f the judiciary system by making its administration more
efficient. The latter will ensure better access to justice. The expected outcomes under this
pillar at the end o f the PRSC series are: (i)districts have strengthened institutional
capacity to decide on local investment programs in a participatory manner, and more
resources are transferred to local governments; (ii)    the capacity to monitor the wage bill
o f civil servants i s inplace ;(iii) productivity o fjudges benefiting from justice sector
                                   the
reform measures has increased, as illustrated by an increase in the number o f cases tried
perjudge per year.
79.      Under the economic development pillar, the triggers cover the investment
climate, essential infrastructure, such as the roadnetwork and irrigation, the reform o f the
administration o f the national pension system, and better agricultural extension services.
The PRSC series would support the policy reforms required to make sector interventions
more effective. For example, in order to achieve the targets for the construction and
rehabilitation o f the national road network, the following key policy actions are required
inimplementingthe new integrated Road Sector Program: (i) successful restructuring
                                                                  the
o f the National Roads Administration both at headquarters and in the provinces; and (ii)
the internalization o f the procurement process with the NR4. With regard to extended
irrigated areas, among other requiredpolicy actions, an appropriate policy framework to
increase water storage and distribution and to strengthen beneficiary organizations should
be prepared by the government; and communities with access to irrigation resources have
to be strengthened.
80.      The expected outcomes under this pillar at the end of the PRSC series are: (i)
the time to open a businesshas been reduced from 153 days in2005 to 30 days in2009;
(ii)the national road network (primary, secondary, and tertiary roads) is in better
conditions thereby reducing transport costs as illustratedby an increase in the percentage
o f roads in good or reasonable conditions from 71% in 2006 to 78% in 2009; (iii)         the
pension system is on a sounder footing due to the implementation o f the
recommendations o f the actuarial study, and the National Social Security Institute has an
investment strategy defined, thereby contributing to the development o f the financial
sector; (iv) agricultural productivity i s increased and vulnerability to irregular rainfall is
reduced in areas where irrigation systems have been constructed or rehabilitated (13,600
hectares in total are expected to brought under irrigation and management by the
beneficiaries during the period 2006-2009); (v) 411,000 farmers are benefiting from
extension services compared to 193,500 in2006.

81.    Thepolicy matrix of theproposed credit highlights the linkages between policy
actions and results in support of specific objectives and actions defined in the PARPA
monitoring framework, the Strategic Matrix. The Strategic Matrix represents the results
framework o f the PARPA I1and it was prepared by a joint Government and donor team
led by the Ministry of Planning and Development and involving all line ministries, key
agencies as well as representatives o f civil society, with technical support from the Bank.
The Government is now preparing a monitoring plan to implementthe Strategic Matrix,
including reviewing the quality and relevance o f sector indicators and identifying
responsibilities and costs associated with the monitoring exercise.        At the time this
document was being finalized the Government was initiating a study to define the main
elements o f the Plan.
82.     The Strategic Matrix provides the results chain of the PARPA strategy. It
includes the links between objectives, indicators and relative baselines and targets at
results and output levels, as well as sector specific actions and responsibilities for
monitoring and it will be included as an annex and monitored through the annual
Economic and Social Plan (PES) and PARPA Annual Progress Report (BdPES),
discussed inParliament. The Strategic Matrix links the PARPA program with the budget
cycle and the democratic process through the economic and social plan, the Plano
Econdmico e Social (Economic and Social Plan, PES), discussed in the National
Assembly, and its progress report, the Balanco do Plano Econdmico e Social (Progress
Report of the Economic and Social Plan, BdPES), which assesses performance on
implementation o f the PES during the previous year.
83.    The indicators and actions of the new PRSC series are aligned with a subset of
the Strategic Matrix selected by the joint Government and donors group providing
budget support (G18) and laid out in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF).
While the 2007-09 PAF indicators will serve as the monitoring framework during the
implementation o f the PRSC series, the indicators for 2006 were taken from the 2006
PAF that was based on PARPA I.In addition, it i s expected that the quality o f the
Strategic Matrix (and PAF) indicators will benefit from the definition o f the Monitoring
Plan currently under preparation.


B. CREDIT AMOUNT AND TRANCHING

84.    The Credit i s a single tranche operation o f a US$70 million equivalent.

C. SUPERVISION

85.      The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs is aligned with the supervision of the
joint General Budget Support program of the G18. In order to reduce the transaction
costs for the Government, the Bank carries out all supervision jointly with the other
donors. It participates in the Troika Plus (consisting o f three donors/a chair/co-chair and
outgoing chair, forming the troika chairmanship -- EC and WB are permanent members,
thus forming the Troika Plus), the overall coordination mechanism set up by the G-18,
and all the relevant coordination meetings. All Bank sector missions working for the
PRSC team liaise closely with and through the respective joint sector working groups to
assure maximum coordination with all other sector partners.
 86.     The MoU dejines two key review events per year. A Joint Review takes place
each year inApril (year n). It assesses the performance o f the government inthe previous
budget year, which corresponds to the calendar year (year n-1). The review focuses on
 evaluating progress with regard to the indicators defined in the Performance Assessment
Framework and makes an overall assessment o f progress. The second event i s the Mid-
Year Review in September. This review i s mainly forward-looking and formalizes the
 agreement on the performance indicators and targets for the following year (year n+l).
 Both the Joint and the Mid-Year Review are a multi-sector exercises, and Bank staff
participate in all relevant sectors. The reviews are prepared at the technical level by the
variousjoint sector working groups.
 87.     I n addition, the supervision of the PRSC is done on a continuous basis in
 harmonization with the other general budget support donors. The Task Team Leader
 for the operation i s based inthe field, and participates in all relevant coordination and the
 monthlyjoint government-donor steering committee meetings. Progress in each sector i s
 monitored by joint government-donor sector working groups.                Bank staff actively
 participates in these meetings through its staff in the field offices and Washington
 (through missions or by videoconference).
 88.     Furthermore, the Bank participates in joint IMF-Bank missions to monitor
progress in the macroeconomicframework. The Bank and the Fund also monitor jointly
 progress inimplementing the PARPA.


 D. FIDUCIARYASPECTS

 89.     Fiduciary aspects and strengthening of the Government's own systems are key
 in this operation. The public financial management system i s considered to be
 reasonably adequate to support the PRSC series. Weaknesses are found ininternal control
 systems, the limited coverage o f the external audit, and the high-level o f off-budget
 spending mainly from external project finance. According to the latest PEFA assessment,
 the quality of the PFM is expected to continue improving as a natural consequence of
 ongoing reforms such as e-SISTAFE. The main challenges o f Mozambique's public
 expenditure management and financial accountability systems were studied in the CFAA
 and the PERs conducted in 2001 and 2003. An action plan focusing on
 comprehensiveness and financial accountability system i s being implemented. A follow
 up o f the implementation of the CFAA's action plan has been part o f the PRSC

supervision and preparation. With regard to the procurement system reform, following
the 2002 CPAR, an action plan was agreed with the Government and i s being
implemented in steps over the series o f PRSCs. A key milestone was the approval by
Cabinet o f a new Procurement Code in December 2005 (a trigger under PRSC 2) which
brought Mozambique's procurement legislation to international standards, and which
separated the regulatory and supervisory functions from actual procurement. The central
procurement supervision unit was created and staffed in 2006 (prior action under PRSC
3). Public financial management has been improving steadily in line with government
commitment to reform, and the dialogue between the Government and the donors has
been constructive. The budget can be considered to be a credible document with final
out-turns reasonably close to initial approvals and there has been a steady improvement
inrevenue collection andadministration.
90.     The Central Bank is subject to the Fund's safeguards assessment policy under
the PRGF Arrangement approved on July 6, 2004. The assessment, which was
completed on August 18, 2004, identified weaknesses in the areas o f financial reporting,
internal audit, and the system o f internal controls and proposed specific measures to
address weaknesses. The implementation o f these measures i s being monitored by staff
under the PRGF arrangement. In particular, progress is being made in making the
necessary adjustments so that the balances in the BM's accounting records match the
balances confirmed by the correspondents and other third parties. The reconciliation o f
monetary data with audited financial statements and its review by the internal audit
department will be completed by end-December 2006. A new foreign exchange law was
submittedto Parliament in 2006. Once approved, the Mozambican Government intends
to accept its obligations under Article VI11 sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund's Articles o f
Agreement.


E. DISBURSEMENTANDAUDITING

91.     The proposed credit will be disbursed following standard I D A disbursement
procedures. The credit will be released as a single tranche at the request o f the Ministry
o f Planning and Development. IDA will deposit the funds in a dedicated foreign
exchange account o f the Bank o f Mozambique inFrankfurt. It i s the same account which
i s usedby other GBS donors to transfer their GBS contributions, as specified in the MoU.
Within two working days, Bank of Mozambique will credit the Metical equivalent
counterpart funds to a specific Transitory Account o f the Ministry o f Finance. It will be
transferred from the Transitory Account to the Central Treasury Account in accordance
with the treasury plan and will be used as state budget revenue and recorded in the state
accounts as such.
92.    Auditing procedures are the same as defined in the MoU. A legally registered,
private and independent audit company meeting international standards will perform
annual audits based on the quarterly financial reports according to Terms o f Reference
attached to the MoU. The audit costs will be met by GoM. The final audit report will be
submitted annually to G o M as well as to GBS donors including the Bank no later than
three months after the year's end.

F. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIALASPECTS

93.     Theproposed series of PRSC operations will support policy actions that should
create the enabling environment to support poverty reduction. These policy actions by
themselves do not have a significant environmental impact. However, it is expected that
regular investment activities will benefit from such policy actions, and therefore are
likely to have stronger results. Potential environmental impacts of such interventions will
be analyzed and monitored by the responsible authority. For example, in the case of the
rehabilitation and construction o f the road network, the National Roads Authority has
received institutional strengthening for environmental management under the Bank-
supported Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program, in particular
through the social and environmental unit o f the National Roads Authority. A similar
situation prevails in the case of the expansion o f irrigated agriculture. The Ministry o f
Agriculture has received much support - including from the Bank - to build up its
capacity to carry out EIA's. And the institutional framework for the water sector i s
largely consistent with international good practice, and includes the ongoing
establishment o f Regional Water Administrations ( A M s ) responsible for water resource
management.
94.     Oneprior action in PRSC 3 is the reduction in the number of days required to
open a new business.This has been achieved through computerization and simplification
o f the procedures for registration o f a business. This reform i s not expected to affect the
environmental clearance process, managed by the Ministry of Environmental
Coordination (MICOA). The proposed series of PRSC operations also supports the
decentralization process, which has the potential to improve social services and trigger
economic activities at the community level as responsibilities are devolved to local levels
more in-tune with local conditions.       The Bank-supported Decentralized Planning and
Financing Project aims to improve the institutional capacity o f District Administrations,
including for environmental management.
95.     The analytical underpinnings of the PRSCseries include an Economic Analysis
of Natural Resources Sustainability, completed in FY06. This report estimated that
more effective management o f natural resources could increase rents from 5% o f tax
revenues to 10%-20%. The proposed measures will be discussed during preparation o f
PRSC 4 ind 5.
96.     Analysis has been carried out of the impacts of growth on poverty reduction.
According to the recently concluded CEM, macroeconomic stability and good public
financial management are important to keep inflation low and to secure fiscal discipline,
two important pre conditions for economic growth and poverty reduction. The C E M
estimates that if growth can be maintained at the expected levels o f 7 percent per annum
in the coming years, and inequality remains stable, the poverty rate can be reduced
significantly increasing the likelihood that Mozambique will reach the Millennium
Development Goal for poverty reduction by the year 2015 by reducing its poverty
headcount from 54 percent in 2002/03 to 31 percent in 2015. The reforms supported by
the PRSC series shouldcontributetowards that overall goal.

G. RISKSANDRISKMITIGATION

97.     One set of risks is concerned with the potential for macroeconomic instability.
Instability may arise as a result o f terms o f trade shocks, regional instability, deteriorating
financial sector performance, or unpredictability o f donor disbursements. Some o f these
risks, such as terms of trade shocks or regional instability, are exogenous and could be
more important in the long term rather than being o f concern to PRSC 3 itself.
Considering the highlevel o f reserves, the end o f the drought that affected the country in
2005, the robust increase o f exports over the past five years, a flexible exchange rate
regime and low external debt vulnerability, the likelihood o f terms o f trade shocks
causing severe macroeconomic instability i s low, even though no stabilization
mechanism exists at this point. Regarding financial sector performance, the new legal
framework for the banking sector and strengthened supervision have reduced the risk o f
banks accumulating a high share o f non-performing loans. Furthermore, the Financial
Sector Technical Assistance Project provides support to reduce the vulnerability o f
Mozambique's financial sector. Regarding the unpredictability o f donor disbursements,
the Government has made significant progress to make them more predictable in the
short and medium term, last but not least by signing the M o U with the 18 GBS donors
and several MoU's for sector support.
98.     A second set of risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement
reforms and effective decentralization.          To mitigate this risk, the Government and
donors agreed during the Joint Review to develop an integrated strategy for capacity
development in public finance management, and to strengthen the coordination and
management o f reforms. A new strategy for the second phase o f the public sector reforms
was agreed with all stakeholders including the development partners and was approved
by Cabinet in October 2006. To strengthen capacity at the district level and to improve
control mechanisms (auditing), several decentralization projects are being integrated into
a national program that i s expected to deliver capacity building and oversight more
effectively.
99.     A third set of risks concerns a deterioration in governance that could
compromise economic reforms and poverty reduction efforts. The Bank has noted that
reforms in the legal and judiciary fronts are not moving at the desired pace. A
deterioration in governance can have negative effects on economic growth and
compromise poverty reduction. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has held an active policy
dialogue with the authorities on the subject and closely monitors developments associated
with governance. In addition, the restructured Public Sector Reform Project has a new
legal sector capacity building component. A further approach to enhance accountability
o f the executive is increased disclosure o f information to the public, particularly
regarding financial management. Some progress has been made through the use o f an
official internet portal o f the Government, but more effort i s still required.
100.    A final set of risks concerns the impact of HIWAIDS. This pandemic has two
potential impacts: it can reduce human and institutional capacity to deliver public
services and it may pose a long-term contingent liability. Free ARV treatment i s rapidly
expanding financed by donors. Should donor support wane at some point, then there
would be big pressures for the health budget to pay for it. The Bank i s taking the


                                              - 34 -

HIV/AIDS pandemic very seriously and is dealing with it as an essential cross-cutting
issue in all of its projects in addition to having two dedicated HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment programs.

Subject: Letter of Development Policy for the Third Poverty Reduction
          Support Credit (PRSCIII)

Dear Mr. Wolfowitz,

   1. Iam writing on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique,
      to request a Credit (PRSC-111) in the amount of US$ 70 million from the
      International Development Association (IDA), to support the continuing
     reform programme under the proposed Poverty Reduction Support
      Credits. This request comes in the context of the Memorandum of
      Understandkg (MoU) between the Government of the Republic of
      Mozambique and international aid partners, including the World Bank
      Group. The MoU outlines the participant's approach to the provision of
      budget support, among other related measures.

  2. The aforementioned Credit will help to meet the financing requirements
      that Mozambique faces to implement the Second Action Plan for the
     Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA-II), through the Economic and
      Social Plan (PES) and the annual budget (OE) for the year 2007.

      The Programme

  3. As set out in the 2005-09 Five Year Programme, my Government has as
      the main objective the reduction of the levels of absolute poverty in
      Mozambique. To achieve this goal, PARPA-I1 presents a strategy and
      programme focused on the following key priorities areas: human capital
      development (including education, health and access to potable water):
      governance (good governance, legality and justice including public and
      legal sector reform]; economic development (including the promotion of
      national entrepreneurship and infrastructure development); and cross-
      cutting issues including environment, HIV/AIDS and gender. The PARPA-
      I1 adopted by the Council of Ministers in May 2006 is clearly aligned with
      these priorities.

  4. My Government is justly proud of the progress made under PARPA-I
     which covered the period 2001-05. The specific objective of PARFA-I was
      to reduce the incidence of absolute poverty to less than 50 percent by
      2010.                                                              531..




                                         48

                                                                      ANNEX 4



   Overview of Recent Progress

5. The implementation of PARPA in 2005 was broadly positive, as noted in
   the April 2006 Joint Review involving my Government and the
   Programme Aid Partners (PAPS)including IDA. The Mozambican economy
   continued to grow strongly achieving a GDP growth rate of 7.7 percent
   and a rate of inflation just above 10 percent in 2005. Satisfactory
   progress was made in health, education, and water and sanitation service
   delivery. The integration of the PES, OE and CFMP and the strengthening
   the Government progress report, thus Balanqo do PES (BdPES) to
   monitor the PARPA has proved to be a success. Significant improvements
   have been made in quantitative poverty analysis and dissemination.
   Steps to improve the monitoring system were also noted.

6. The monitoring of the PARPA continued to improve and there was some
   progress towards the key PES including de indicators matrix of ensuring
   the integration of the PES, OE and CFMP and strengthening the BdPES.
   The expenditures in priority sectors were 67% above the target of 65% of
   the total, of which 55 o/o went to education and health (hence attaining
   the 50% indicators). Performance against PES targets in public service
   delivery was positive. In education, performance was broadly on-track
   and all targets were exceeded. In health, the indicators matrix continue
   to show positive progress, in particular in relation to the average up-take
   of services measured by consultations per inhabitant, which surpassed
   the target defined in 2005. Positive progress was made both in indicators
   matrix and Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators. Although
   the 2005 indicators matrix targets were met, HIV/AIDS as well as
   malariaremains one of the greatest threats to Mozambique's development
   and once again a stronger and better coordinated gender sensitive multi-
   sectoral response is needed.

7. In terms of The. environment for private sector development, significant
   progress was made in 2005. These progresses are best illustrated by the
   reduction in the time it takes to start a business, which fell from 153 to
   90 days reflecting the government's commitment. In addition, to improve
   t h e investment climate in Mozambique and ensure an environment that
   encourages the private sector to drive economic growth in the country,
   the Council of Mihisters has approved a new labor law and submitted to
   the parliament for approval,, In addition, the 1888 Commercial Code has
   been revised'and a new code approved by the parliament. Furthermore,
   the reduction of the maximum duties tax from 25 to 20 and the
   commercial registry of legal entities has largely computerized associated
   with the approval, in September 2006, of a decree whereby the
   registration becomes effective as soon as it is published on the
   Government's official website, thus reduce the time for starting up a
   business.

8. The impact of this, progress on poverty reduction continues to be
   significant. The last household survey, completed in 2002/2003,




                                49

                                                                      ANNEX 4



  that poverty incidence (based on the headcount index) declined to 54
  percent in 2003 (from 69.4 percent in 1997).

9. My Government's commitment to address the Millennium Development
   Goals (MDGs) remains strong, This is reflected in the PARPA-11, whose
  key actions are summarized ina matrix, along with indicators included in
   the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) agreed with my
   Government's direct budget support partners, to permit monitoring. The
   Programme defined in these instruments will be implemented through
   Government systems with monitoring and evaluation reported in my
   Government's annual Economic and Social Plan (PES) and the annual
   State Budget (OE) that are submitted to the Parliament for approval.


10.     My Government's programme being submitted for support with
   PRSC-111 includes three main components that are an integral part of the
   wider PARPA, PES, and PAFmatrices. They are:

   Macroeconomic Management

     a) Under this component, my Government remains committed to
        maintain macroeconomic       stability,  improve   public financial
        management, and enhance governance. The Government will
        maintain macroeconomic       stability  through   adhering to an
        appropriate macroeconomic framework with consistent fiscal and
        monetary policies. It will improve public financial management
        through: monitoring closely and allocating at least 65% of its
        resources to pro-poor spending; increasing budgetary efficiency,
        transparency   and accountability by expanding coverage and
        implementing "Sistema de Administravao Financeira do Estado"
        (STSTAFE); and improving the timeliness and quality of the national
        accounts, auditing and budgetary reporting.

     b) After the successful introduction in 2004 in the Ministry of Finance
        and all the ProvincialDirectorates of Planningand Finance, the year
        2005 9aw the initiation of the use of e-SISTAFE for budget
        execution and budget accounting and reporting, and early in 2006
        e-SISTAFE was extended to the Ministries of Planning and
        Development' Education and Culture, Agriculture, Health and Pubic
        Works both at central as well as provincial level. At the present
        moment efforts are being made to roll-out to all Ministries and other
         Government institutions untilthe end of the year.

     c) In addition, my Government continues committed with the objective
        of increasing tax mobilization. The process has started through
        restructuring the Directorate for Taxes and Audit (DNIA) in to DGI
         for Domestic Taxes Administration, to be integrated with the
         Customs Directorate (DGA) under the new Central Revenue

                                                                    ANNEX 4



  Authority (ATM)which was created by law in late 2005 and whose
  by-laws were approved in 2006. Effective total revenue reached 14%
  of the GDP in 2005. Aiming to improve the efficiency in revenue
  collection, the following areas were improved: the identification and
  collection of tax arrears; audits on the larger tax payers; customs
  inspections and smuggling control;          simplification of customs
  clearance procedures; better information to the tax payers and,
  training for tax administration staff. Progress was also observed in
  the process of VAT reimbursements, with reduction of the
  processing time from 90 to 30 days, also as the result of better
  performance by the taxpayers.

Governance

d) Governance is one of the three pillars of PARPA-11. My Government
  is committed to be closer to the people and has therefore
  accelerated the decentralization process by making the district the
  pole of development. Each district has now its own budget over
  which they can decide in a participatory manner. Every district
  received the same amount of investment funds in 2006. For 2007,

  to reflect the diverse conditions,namely District Population, District
  criteria were defined for allocating investment funds for each district

  Area, Poverty Index.

  Furthermore, my Government aims to improve governance by
  bringing public procurement in line with international practice;
  restructuring its key sectoral ministries to be more responsive to
  citizen needs from the district level; decentralizing the delivery of
  specified services to local authorities, to expand community
  participation     and government        accountability;  and    fighting
  corruption.

Economic Development

f) Recognizing the main role of the private sector in the economic
  growth and employment, Government policies and reforms have
  improved the environment for the development of private sector
  activities, and reinforced the role of the market in the economy. The
  new Commercial Code, approved in 2005, and the new Code for
   Registry of Legal Entities, approved in March, simplified the
  procedures for business registration. Furthermore, my Government
  approved a decree in September 2006, whereby registration
  becomes effective as soon as it is published on the government's
  official website. As result of this reforms it is now possible to open a
  business in 30 days, compared to 153 days in 2005.

g) Growth in agricultural production in 2005 was around l.8%, partly
  due to C L a t i c problems, affecting the central and southern regions




                           5 1

            of the ,country on a large scale. This indicates a slow down in
            comparison to 2004 when the rate of growth was 9%.. The impact of
            the droughts and floods in combination with outbreak of plague and
            disease combined with other factors resulted in the loss of 7% of the
            overall sown area. Around 265,000 families were affected, out of a
            total of around 3.5 million. The 1.8% growth was due to the
            recorded increase in cash crops, especially cashew nut (142.7%),
            tobacco (33.9%) and sugar cane (190/).

  11.       My Government will continue with implementation of                             the new
     procurement system, budget allocation to priority sectors in line with the
     CFMP, decentralization by increasing budget execution in provinces and
     districts, expand coverage and efficiency of internal and external audit
     bodies, complete the actuarial study of the INSS and develop its
     investment strategy as mechanism to improve the insurance and social
     protection.

  12.       The policy framework, which aims at consolidating macroeconomic
     stability, is consistent with the medium-term goal of sustaining poverty
     reduction through strong broad-based economic growth. The Government
     is commited to continue to implement measures to strengthen revenue
     mobilization and the transparency and monitoring of the budget
     execution.

     Conclusion

  13.       My Government remains committed to the overall objective of
     poverty reduction through sustainable economic growth. It is, therefore,
     the Government's hope that IDA will grant the requested Credit to assist
     inthe implementationof the proposedprogramme.

     With highest consideration,

                                                                                        2006

"The MultilateralDebt Relief Initiative (MDIU)provides 100percent debt relief to eligible member countries that
are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 which
remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by bilateral
contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member under the
HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

Safeguards Assessment


Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Banco de Moqambique (BM) is subject
to safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF Arrangement approved on July 6,2004.
The assessment,which was completed on August 18,2004,identified weaknesses in the
areas of financial reporting, internal audit, and the system of internal controls and proposed
specific measures to address weaknesses. The implementation of these measures is being
monitored by staff under the PRGF arrangement.


Exchange Arrangements


Mozambique's exchange system is a managed float. Commercialbanks may buy and sell
foreign exchange to individual customers on a fully negotiable basis. The Bank of
Mozambique introduced a foreign exchange auction system in January 2005. Auctions are
held bi-weekly.


Mozambique still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV of the Fund
Articles of Agreement, but has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. It maintains, however,
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, as evidencedby (i) the discretionary prior
approval for remittances of family living expenses; (ii) the authorization for the purchase of
foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions; (iii) the prohibition for the
conversion of balances of nonresidents' domestic currency accounts into foreign currency or
transfer abroad; and (iv) the need of proof of performance of a service prior to authorizingits
payment. At the authorities' request, an Article VIII mission was conducted by LEG and
PDR in March 2004. The mission encouraged the authoritiesto remove all existing the
exchange restrictions. The authorities indicatedtheir intention to accept their obligations
under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund's Articles of Agreement after the approval
of the new foreign exchange law which is scheduledto be submitted to the assemblyby
March 2007.


Article IV Consultation


In accordancewith Decision No 12794-(02176),as amended by Decision No 12854-(02196),
Mozambique is on a 24-month Article IV cycle due to the approval of a new PRGF
arrangement in July 2004. The 2005 Article IV consultationwas completed by the Executive
Board on June 22,2005 (Country Report No. 051318).


In concluding the 2005 Article IVconsultation,Executive Directors welcomed the
substantialreduction in poverty realized over the past decade. At the same time, they stressed
that stepped-up efforts are needed to further reduce poverty and, with the necessary financial
assistanceof the international community,reach the Millennium Development Goals. In

particular, they looked forward to the new poverty reduction strategy paper for 2006-1 0.
They noted, however, that a second wave of reforms is needed to deepen and accelerate
structural changes to sustain high and broad-based growth. Directors emphasized that efforts
should aim at (i) increasing tax revenues; (ii) strengthening public sector operations;
(iii) reducing the costs of doing business; (iv) promoting labor intensive sectors; and
(v) implementing a rural development strategy.


FSAP Participation and ROSCs


A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Mozambique was undertaken during the
first quarter of 2003. The related Financial Sector Stability Assessment was circulated to the
Executive Board on November 19,2003 (Country Report No. 04/52). A ROSC on fiscal
transparency was issued on February 22,2001. This ROSC was updated in the context of
the 2002 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 02/140) and the 2003 Article IV
consultation (Country Report No. 04/50). A Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) data module was prepared in June 2002 and issued on March 5,2003. This
data module was updated in August 2005.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under the Three-Year PRGF Arrangement for
                    Mozambique and Approves USS2.4 million Disbursement


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth
review of Mozambique's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement for Mozambique in an amount equivalent to SDR11.36 million
(about US$17.0 million), see Press Release No. 041153.

The completion of the review enables the release of an amount equivalent to SDR 1.62 million
(about US$2.4 million), which will bring total disbursements under the PRGF arrangement to an
amount equivalent to SDR 9.7 million (about US$14.6 million).

The Executive Board also accepted, as part of the financing assurances review, that adequate
safeguards remain in place for further use of Fund resources.


Following the Executive Board's discussion on Mozambique's economic performance,
Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"Mozambique's prudent macroeconomic policies, together with a first wave of structural reforms
under its PRGF-supported program, have yielded strong economic growth, moderating inflation,
and solid progress towards the objectives set out in its poverty reduction strategy. Continued
solid policy implementation will play a pivotal role in consolidating macroeconomic stability,
sustaining economic growth, reducing inflation, and enabling the efficient absorption of scaled-
up foreign assistance, under the second wave of reforms envisaged in the PIano de Ac@o para
Redup70 da Pobreza Absoluta II (PARPA 11) for 2006-09. Donor-financed projects should be
integrated into the Treasury Single Account and e-SISTAFE with the help of the donors while
clear guidelines on the use of national systems for the disbursement of aid could be disseminated.
Over the medium term, the links between PARPA I1targets and the budget should be
strengthened to reflect comprehensive fiscal planning and costing of programs and policies.

"The achievement of these objectives will require strengthened fiscal policy and an investment
climate enhanced by lowering the cost of doing business and continuing to squarely address
governance issues. While the new draft labor law represents an improvement on the current law,
the authorities are encouraged to take steps to address the remaining rigidities to labor market
flexibility. The authorities are also encouraged to adopt a new laws on the mining and petroleum

fiscal regimes. Adherence to the core principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative should strengthen the transparency of natural resource management and megaprojects.

"In the context of scaled-up aid and acceleration of reforms, the 2007 budget envisages a
0.5 percent of GDP rise in domestic revenue with the share of priority expenditures exceeding
65 percent of total spending. The impending rollout of the new e-SISTAFE (public financial
administration system) should also ensure a better monitoring of priority expenditures. A
cautious approach is warranted in devolving resources to subnational levels, with proper
sequencing, supported by sufficient administrative capacity-particularly     at the district level.

"The reinvigoration of the public sector reform program under a new public service authority is
welcome. In particular, the installation of a clean, integrated payroll database based on a civil
service census should help rightsize the civil service in line with more comprehensive sectoral
strategies. The anti-corruption and judicial sector reform should be accelerated, in order to
improve public perceptions and strengthen the constituency for reform.

"The authorities' commitment to seek non-recourse financing for the transfer of majority
ownership of the Cahora Bassa hydropower plant from Portugal to Mozambique will avoid an
increase in the government's liabilities to commercial creditors, and to ensure transparency and
accountability.

"The Bank of Mozambique's stated policy of pursuing base money targeting in conjunction with
a flexible exchange rate regime is welcome. This framework will help keep inflation under
control, and cushion against exogenous shocks. In this regard, a more consistent monetary policy
stance will be supported by greater exchange rate flexibility, when conditions permit.
Parliamentary approval of the new foreign exchange law will allow Mozambique to establish full
current account convertibility.

"The Fund stands ready to remain engaged with Mozambique as it builds on its track record of
strong macroeconomic performance and program implementation," Mr. Portugal said.
