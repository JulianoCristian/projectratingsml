F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The goal of PRSC 3-4-5, the second of three series to date, was to support the implementation of
Mozambique's second Poverty Reduction Strategy, commonly referred to by its Portuguese acronym
(PARPA II). In support of this goal, all three operations had three specific Program Development
Objectives (PDOs):

  (i) Support the consolidation and deepening of institutional reforms in the area of macroeconomic
management;
  (ii) Support the reforms in governance by (a) supporting decentralization to enhance public
investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level; and (b) supporting public sector
reform; and
  (iii) Support economic development by improving the investment climate, removing constraints to
growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

  Expected outcomes were defined (PRSC3 Program Document, paras 77-80) for each PDO (or
component of the operations), and progress towards them was to be measured by a corresponding set of
indicators. These were drawn from the 2007-2009 Program Assessment Framework (PAF) which is
jointly monitored by the nineteen donors (G19) providing General Budget Support (GBS) to
Mozambique in the context of the donor-Government Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) first
signed in 2004 and revised in 2009. The PAF is a subset of the Strategic Matrix of Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PARPA II, by the Portuguese acronym). The only non-PAF indicators were
introduced in PRSC5 in response to the food price crisis which had emerged in 2008.

  This ICR has been prepared on the basis of information presented in the ISRs, of which the last was
archived on May 2010. There is complete information for 2007 and 2008, but end of year values for
2009 were not yet fully available.

  The PDOs and Intermediate Indicators were kept roughly unchanged over the three operations in the
series. Hence the information entered below under PRSC-3 also applies to PRSC-4 and PRSC-5. Where
there have been changes in Intermediate Indicators across the operations this is noted in the comments.

other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR, not evaluative):

1.1   Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector
background, rationale for Bank assistance)

1.      This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report covers the second PRSC series in
Mozambique, which included PRSC-3, 4 and 5. The first PRSC series had supported the implementation
of Mozambique`s first PRSP (PARPA I, according to the Portuguese acronym), adopted in 2001. Series
I consisted of two operations, but the second had two tranches, at the request of the authorities, in order
to better align disbursements with the Mozambican financial year. PRSC-1 was discussed and rated in a
simplified implementation completion report (SICR) and PRSC-2 in a full ICR (Report No 38051) with
ratings as shown in Table 1. IEG reviewed the
two ICRs and concurred with the ratings, except            Table 1: ICR ratings for PRSCs 1 and 2
that the sustainability of PRSC 1 was rated as Indicator                      PRSC 1            PRSC2

the new series was designed.                          Borrower Performance    Satisfactory      Satisfactory

2.     Political context. Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975, and shortly
afterwards fell into a protracted civil war, which finally ended in 1992. Since then, the country has been
peaceful without a resurgence of violence. The third round of presidential elections was held in 2004
without incident.1 The President was elected with 64 percent of the votes, and thus had a clear mandate.
Following the election, the new government submitted its Five Year Program to Parliament, which
outlined an ambitious program to reduce poverty. Subsequently, the operational plan of this five year
program, the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PARPA II), was approved by Cabinet in 2006.

3.      The Economic context. The country requested assistance from the BWI in the mid 1980s, to help
it replace its command and control economy with one based on market principles, and since then has
shown consistently good performance, and shown itself to be committed to the reform process. In
particular between 1993 and 2006, GDP growth rates had exceeded 7 percent per year, except for one or
two years, and an averaged nearly 8 percent annually due to a combination of factors in particular good
economic management, driven by a few foreign financed mega projects, buoyant donor support, debt
relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives, healthy agricultural growth and substantial foreign
investment in the services sector.

4.      Macroeconomic management had generally been prudent. Inflation had been brought down from
over 60 percent in the mid nineties to the 10 percent range as of 2004-06. Average per capita GDP
growth was about 5 percent over the period under consideration. The overall fiscal balance, including
grants, had generally been less than 5 percent of GDP since 2000, and had been financed mainly by
1
 Most recently, the fourth round of presidential elections was held in October 2009. The incumbent President was reelected
and obtained 75 percent of the votes, and thus has a very strong mandate. Following the election, in March 2010 the new
government submitted its Five Year Program to Parliament. The related operational plan, which will be the Third Poverty
Reduction Strategy Plan (or PARPA III), is expected to be approved by Cabinet in the Fall 2010.

                                                             1
external savings thus without recourse to monetary financing. The primary deficit was showing an
improving trend better than originally forecast, and the share of primary expenditures going to priority
sectors close to the 65 percent target.

5.     The country was considered at low risk of debt distress, given that it had reached the HIPC
completion point and benefitted from the MDRI initiative. The exchange rate showed a rapid
appreciation in real terms in 2003-2004, but this was corrected by a nominal depreciation in the first half
of 2005 which brought the rate back to its January 2004 level. Foreign exchange reserves remained
adequate. Mozambique remained on track with the IMF, with whom it had uninterrupted relations since
1987. Looking forward, there was a clear need for continued budget support, which appeared likely to
materialize from the Group of nineteen countries and institutions providing it at the time.

6.     There had been substantial reductions in monetary and non monetary poverty between 1997 and
2003, with the poverty headcount falling from 69 to 54 percent. Reduction in rural poverty was even
more pronounced although the rate of rural poverty remains higher than in urban areas. At the same
time, the southern region of the country, and Maputo in particular, seems to have experienced an
increase in poverty. However, no evidence was available on the evolution of poverty rates after 2003.
Yet social indicators showed significant improvements over the period 1990-2006, as may be seen from
Table 2. Moreover, Mozambique was making substantive progress towards achieving the MDG goals
for poverty reduction (reduction by 50 percent by 2015), and access to water supply.

7.      Nevertheless, despite this progress, substantial challenges remained, as of 2006. Mozambique
remained poor (US$ 310 per capita income in 2005), with low adult literacy rates (47 percent) and life
expectancy at birth of 42 years. Malaria accounted for 35 percent of deaths for children less than five
years of age, and there was a very serious HIV/AIDs problem which appeared likely to significantly
retard the growth of the economy.

8.      Public Financial Management (PFM) systems had shown improvements. Progress had been
made in the adoption of the new framework law in 2002, and through the rollout of the integrated
financial management system (e-SISTAFE) to six ministries (agriculture, education, finance, health,
planning, and public works) in July 2006. These ministries were satisfactorily executing their budget for

                                                               2
goods and services and capital expenditures, although payment of salaries continued to be paid centrally
by the Ministry of Finance. There was a medium term Action Plan and Budget for 2006-09 to further
extend e-SISTAFE, which was judged to be well structured.

9.      Overall progress in public sector governance had been more limited. Despite some progress,
implementation of public sector reforms, including decentralization, remained slow. Improvements in
the efficiency and transparency of the justice system remained elusive, and corruption and conflict of
interest were important issues. Government`s response had mainly focused on improving transparency
and accountability based on a comprehensive public financial management reform program.

10.     Limited progress had been made to improve the business environment and constraints to private
sector development and trade remained substantial. Mozambique was still 134th out of 175 countries in
the 2008 Doing Business survey, and 129th out of 207 countries in the 2007 Governance Survey.
According to the 2007 LPI index it ranked 110th out of 150 countries. The first PRSC series supported
private sector development inter alia by supporting reforms that reduced the start up time for new firms
from 113 to 29 days.

11.    Donor coordination. Under the first PRSC series, donor coordination had been increasing in
Mozambique following the signing of the MOU in 2004. By 2006 there were a total of 19 budget
support providers (G19) who harmonized their procedures according to the MOU. The Bank was a
signatory but like several other donors had been granted a number of exceptions which were however
expected to be eliminated over time.

12.     Rationale for further PRSC support. It was in the context of these developments that the
Government, together with its partners decided to pursue its poverty reduction strategy ­ specifically on
the basis of PARPA II. PARPA II, adopted by Cabinet in September 2006, was to continue the overall
thrust of PARPA I, although increasing the focus on conditions for sustained economic growth, and was
to be organized around three pillars (governance, human capital and economic development) and eight
cross cutting sectoral themes (including HIV/AIDs). PARPA II also highlighted the objectives of (i)
increasing donor alignment and harmonization, (ii) increasing direct support to the budget through so-
called General Budget Support; and (iii) deepening the use by all donors of a single strategic matrix of
monitorable indicators, and in particular the PAF.

13.     In their reviews of the PARPA II through the JSAN, the Bank and the IMF recognized the
strengths of the PARPA as emphasis on improving governance and capacity building, private sector
development and the recognition of the HIV/AIDs problem, but pointed to the weakness of the treatment
of the agricultural sector. The JSANs also emphasized, inter alia, the need: for (i) e-SISTAFE to
identify and effectively monitor priority primary expenditure identified in the PARPA; (ii) better and
more regular data collection in order to improve the quality of M&E; and (iii) timely dissemination of
key results to the public and obtaining of feedback.

14.     Overall context. In summary, political economic and financial risks were perceived to be
minimal, and manageable. The government`s commitment to reform appeared unlikely to waiver, G19
donors could be expected to continue their financial support, the IMF also. Thus the Bank considered
that the overall political and economic situation was conducive to further support from IDA in the form
of PRSCs. The expectation was thus that the second PRSC series would address these questions, as a


                                                   3
core component of IDA`s Country Assistance Strategy (2004-2007) and the Country Partnership
Strategy for 2008-2011.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved):

15.    The overriding objective of the second PRSC series was to help the Government of Mozambique
in implementing its Poverty Reduction Strategy, and specifically PARPA II. The PARPAs, together with
the Plano Economico e Social and the Annual Budget are the instruments for operationalizing the
Government`s Five Year Program Within this overall context, the specific objectives of the PRSCs 3-5
were to support:

(i)     Consolidation and deepening of institutional reforms in the area of macroeconomic management;
(ii)    Reforms in governance by (a) supporting decentralization to enhance public investments and
        service delivery at the provincial and district level; and (b) supporting public sector reform; and
(iii)   Economic development by improving the investment climate, removing constraints to growth,
        such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

16.    The series bridged the 2004-2007 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the 2008-2011
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The 2004-2007 CAS supported the Government`s first poverty
reduction strategy (PARPA) across three pillars: (i) Improving the investment climate and sustaining
GDP growth; (ii) expanding service delivery; and (iii) building public sector capacity and improving
governance. The 2008-11 CPS was similarly built around three pillars (i) increased accountability and
public voice; (ii) equitable access to services; and (iii) sustainable and broad-based growth. The PRSCs
were part of overall programmatic budget support provided by the Group of nineteen donors (G-19) in
the context of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of the provision of Direct Budget Support and
Balance of Payments Support, originally signed in 2004 and updated in 2006. The purpose of the MOU
was to encourage harmonization of budget support around a common set of principles, and in particular
a common Performance Assessment Framework.

17.  More specific program objectives, and expected outcomes were set forth in the PRSC3 Program
Document (paras 77-80) as follows:

         Under macroeconomic management, the expected outcomes at the end of the PRSC series
         were: (i) the composition of actual public spending would be in accordance with the
         objectives of PARPA II; (ii) revenue administration would be more efficient; hence total
         revenues are a higher percentage of GDP, despite the lowering of import duties; (iii) budget
         execution would be less time-consuming and more transparent; (iv) the budget document
         would be comprehensive, that is incorporate all ministerial own receipts and donor funds
         including from investment projects; (v) the public procurement institutions would be
         functioning more effectively and transparently up to the district level; (vi) the coverage and
         quality of audits at the local level would have improved, and the external audit institution
         (i.e. the Tribunal Administrativo or Court of Accounts) would have improved its capacity to
         issue opinions on a larger number of financial audit reports. The related triggers and
         indicators covered the areas of resource allocation for poverty reduction, institutional reforms
         to enhance domestic revenue mobilization, budget management, procurement systems, and
         auditing.

        Under the governance pillar, the expected outcomes at the end of the PRSC series were: (i)
        districts were to have strengthened institutional capacity to decide on local investment
        programs in a participatory manner, and more resources were to have been transferred to
        local governments; (ii) the capacity to monitor the wage bill of civil servants would be in
        place; (iii) the productivity of judges benefiting from justice sector reform measures would
        have increased, as illustrated by an increase in the number of cases tried per judge per year.
        The related triggers and indicators covered the areas of civil service reform, decentralization,
        and reform of the judiciary system by making its administration more efficient.

        Under the economic development pillar, expected outcomes at the end of the PRSC series
        were: (i) the time to open a business was to have been reduced from 153 days in 2005 to 30
        days in 2009; (ii) the national road network (primary, secondary, and tertiary roads) would be
        in better conditions thereby reducing transport costs as illustrated by an increase in the
        percentage of roads in good or reasonable conditions from 71% in 2006 to 78% in 2009; (iii)
        the pension system would be on a sounder footing due to the implementation of (i) the
        recommendations of an actuarial study of the National Social Security Institute (INSS) and
        (ii) the resulting investment strategy, thereby contributing to the development of the financial
        sector; (iv) agricultural productivity would have increased and vulnerability to irregular
        rainfall would have been reduced in areas where irrigation systems had been constructed or
        rehabilitated (13,600 hectares in total were expected to brought under irrigation and
        management by the beneficiaries during the period 2006-2009); (v) 411000 farmers would be
        benefiting from extension services compared to 193500 in 2006. The related triggers and
        indicators corresponded to these outcomes.

18.    All triggers were drawn from the G19 Performance Assessment Framework matrices for 2006
and 2007-2009.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

19.     The development objectives were not revised during the series. However, a number of triggers
were revised, delayed or dropped due to delays in implementation and/or because of the need to limit the
total number of prior actions. Also, two new triggers (i.e. not foreseen at the beginning of the series)
were introduced, one pertaining to civil service reform and the other to the food price crisis that emerged
in 2008 (the latter was not included in the PAF).

1.4    Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

20.     Under the macroeconomic management component, all operations focused on improving
efficiency of public financial management. Measures on the expenditure side focused on (i) the share of
expenditures going to PARPA priority sectors, as regards both allocations and actual expenditures, and
the alignment of the annual budget with the MTEF; (ii) the roll out of the computerized IFMIS system
(e-SISTAFE) at the national and sub-national (central and local) levels; and (iii) revenue mobilization;
(iv) increasing the comprehensiveness of the budget; (v) making the procurement system transparent and
efficient at the national and district levels; and (v) increasing the coverage and efficiency of the internal
and external audit bodies.


                                                     5
21.     Under the governance component, the focus was on (i) strengthening the institutional capacity
of local governments with respect to financial management, in particular pertaining to investment
increasing resource transfers to them; (ii) developing a national decentralization strategy; (iii)
improving human resource management in the public sector, in particular the development of a
personnel information management system; and (iv) improving efficiency and celerity in the provision
of justice services (speeding up number of court cases per judge per year).

22.     Under the economic development component, attention concentrated on (i) improving the
business environment (reducing the number of days to open a business); (ii) improving the insurance
and social protection sectors (completion and implementation of an INSS actuarial study and its
investment strategy); (iii) rehabilitation and maintenance of the national road network; (iv) rehabilitation
and construction of irrigated perimeters; and (iv) increased access by farmers to technologies and
extension information. More specifically, in order to achieve the targets for the construction and
rehabilitation of the national road network, the following key policy actions were required in
implementing the new integrated Road Sector Program: (i) the successful restructuring of the National
Roads Administration (NRA) both at headquarters and in the provinces; and (ii) the internalization of
the procurement process with the NRA. With regard to extending irrigated areas, among other required
policy actions, an appropriate policy framework to increase water storage and distribution and to
strengthen beneficiary organizations should be prepared by the government; and communities with
access to irrigation resources have to be strengthened.

1.5    Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

23.     The areas of focus were not revised during the series, although the reforms in the justice sector
(under the governance pillar) to improve the efficiency and celerity in the provision of justice services,
that were initially envisaged to start with PRSC5, were in fact not included under the PRSC series. In
addition, PRSC5 also supported the implementation of the government policy response to the higher
global food and food crisis which emerged in 2008, and to this end introduced a new trigger.

1.6    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

24.    None.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix):

25.     Mozambique has been a very strong performer in Africa, with rapid growth and poverty
reduction, as it recovers steadily from the damage of the civil war concluded in 1992. Looking back at
the last fifteen years, the growth record has been remarkable, averaging above 8 percent from 1993 to
2008, making Mozambique the fastest growing non-oil economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. In line with this
good track record, Mozambique`s economic growth in the years covered by this PRSC series was 8.7%
in 2006, 7% in 2007, 6.7% in 2008 (in spite of the food and fuel price crisis), and 6.3% in 2009 (in spite
of the global financial crisis). Mozambique`s rapid economic growth has been accompanied by



                                                     6
significant strides in reducing poverty.2 In addition to the reduction in poverty, other social indicators
have also shown significant improvements since the mid-1990s (see Table 2 and Table 10).

26.    The rapid economic growth continues to be made possible by good macroeconomic
management, policy reforms and continuing strong donor support, permitting broad-based expansion
across most sectors of the economy, and mega-project investments. The Government of Mozambique
has been consistently pursuing sound fiscal, monetary, and external policies, demonstrating a clear
understanding of the benefits of a solid underlying macroeconomic framework. The government has also
been implementing an active program of structural reforms, ranging across PFM, public sector reforms,
and sectoral policies, accompanying significant (donor-financed) public investments in infrastructure
and social services.

27.     There is enormous momentum for continuing the reforms program and striving to reach even
higher growth rates. Mozambique has a vast, diversified economic potential, including in mining,
energy, agribusiness, fishing, forestry, tourism, light manufacturing and services serving as a gateway to
neighboring countries. Mozambique also has a largely untapped potential in electricity production from
hydro and coal as well as in mining in general. Businesses` interest to expand and initiate operations in
Mozambique is palpable. However, while the significant progress over the past 15 years has moved
Mozambique from the bottom of the league to the average of Sub-Saharan Africa, Mozambique remains
a country with enormous challenges and needs in terms of infrastructure, human capital, public services,
and capacity of the public sector. In this context it remains critical for government to continue to
address these challenges by scaling up public investments in infrastructure and public services,
accelerating its efforts to maximize efficiency in the management of public resources, and accelerating
the implementation of growth-enhancing reforms to increase private investment. These challenges have
been articulated in the PARPA-II, and constitute the priority areas in the government program which has
been at the center of this PRSC series.

28.    Overall there is a consensus (by civil society, donors, and the population) that significant
progress has continued to be achieved in Mozambique in the past few years, in an environment in which
the number and severity of the challenges remains overwhelming. As expected, progress has moved
more rapidly than anticipated in some reform areas (e.g. PFM reforms, civil service wage reforms, roads
management), but there are also sectors where progress has been slower than expected/required (e.g.
decentralization, social security reforms). On balance, there has been visible improvement across a
number of important areas supported by the PRSCs which will play a pivotal role in accelerating
Mozambique`s development.

29.     The rest of this section discusses (i) prior actions, triggers and their implementation; (ii) outcome
indicators as per the Results Framework; (iii) major factors affecting implementation; (iv) monitoring
and evaluation, implementation and utilization; and (v) expected next phase.

  Household survey data indicate that the national poverty headcount fell from 69 to 54 percent during 1997 to 2003, and the
results of the new household survey (due in mid-2010) will show whether poverty has continued falling. The 2007 poverty
assessment suggests that poverty and inequality may not have decreased in recent years, based on the analysis of the
agricultural panel survey data (Trabalho de Inquerito Agricola, TIA, 2002-2005), but highlights that this preliminary result
may also be related to the impact of the drought in 2005. If confirmed, this result would indicate that the rapid GDP growth
in recent years has been less broadly shared than during the past decade. The recent dramatic spike in world agricultural and
fuel prices may also have contributed to set back at least some of the gains achieved during the past decade.

30.      All three operations were            Table 3: Board distribution dates, approval dates and
implemented on schedule. Preparation of                    disbursement dates for PRSC3-5

were always transmitted to the Board in
quarter 4 of the calendar year n (and seeking Board approval for budget support in year n+1).
Disbursements were made in the first quarter of the budget year being supported, except for PRSC5
which was disbursed right at the end of the preceding budget year in response to the government`s
request to accelerate the disbursement in order to assist them cope with the impact of the food and fuel
prices crisis (Table 3).

31.    In all years, the prior actions were completed before Board Approval and the reform program
continued to be on track with a clear focus on the three areas of the PDO: better macroeconomic
management, governance reforms, and a better investment climate, albeit with delays (though no
reversals) generally in governance and the investment climate. These delays were always noted in the
Joint Annual and Mid-Term Reviews of April and September 2007/2008/2009 and the IMF PRGF
review of June 2007 and PSI reviews of June 2008 and December 2009. The government showed strong
ownership and has been willing to take corrective actions when delays occur. The Joint Monitoring with
the G19 GBS donors made this program and the policy dialogue more effective.

32.     Performance with respect to prior actions and triggers. Table 4 presents the prior actions for
each of the three operations as well as how they were implemented, that is whether they were
implemented on time without modification; delayed without modification; modified without delay;
modified with delay; or dropped.

33.     As originally conceived, in the area of macroeconomic management, most focus was put on
PFM issues and in particular on: (i) the share of the budget for and/or actual expenditures on priority
sectors as per PARPA; (ii) ensuring the continuing roll out of e-SISTAFE with a view to continuing to
improve expenditure management; (iii) improving revenues through the creation of the Central Revenue
Authority and better incorporation of own ministerial receipts to ensure a more comprehensive budget;
(iv) continuing implementation of the new procurement system at the national and the local level; (v)
improving internal controls and audits; (vi) improving external audits. In general, these triggers
constituted policy or institutional actions, although they had little or no policy content. They were
however underpinned by a significant program of reforms and directly related to the desired end of
series PFM outcomes. They represented a continuation of the reforms begun under PRSCs1-2. They
were accompanied either by corresponding quantitative targets for 2007-2009 or, in the case of
procurement, an indicator requiring that implementation of the reform plan was on track (as determined
by specific milestones and/or quantitative indicators).

34.    There were seventeen macro/PFM triggers in all, of which one was dropped to reduce the total
number of prior actions in PRSC5, pertaining to the requirement that the revenue to GDP ratio should
increase by 0.5 percent per year. Of the remaining 16 triggers all except one were implemented on time
and without change. The one that was missed pertained to the share of central and provincial level
bodies with operational internal audit units (also referred to as internal control units`), for which the

                                                   8
original target for 2007 was 30 percent. However, only 25 percent was realized and the corresponding
PRSC5 trigger was reduced accordingly (ex-post). The original target turned out to be too optimistic
given the resources available to IGF, and that simultaneously IGF was in the middle of an internal
reorganization. The shortfall relative to the original target (15 percent reduction) may be considered a
moderate shortcoming, especially since substantial progress has been made in 2008 and 2009 such that
the share of central and provincial level bodies with operational internal audit units reached 75 percent
by end-2009.

35.      In the area of governance, the focus of the prior actions and triggers was on: (i) strengthening the
institutional capacity of local government through the determination of criteria for use of district grants;
(ii) the preparation of a decentralization strategy; and (iii) improving human resource management in the
public sector through a census and the creation of a single personal information system (CAF). The first
two triggers were relevant to improving governance at the local level, and within the public service. As
in the case of macroeconomic management, the triggers were generally associated with indicators for
2007-2009 as well as the desired end of series outcomes.
                                                                10
36.      There were seven governance triggers in all, of which one was deferred from PRSC4 to PRSC5,
pertaining to the preparation of a National Strategy for Planning and Finance at the district level, and
one was dropped, which called for the completion of the National Decentralization Strategy which is
now expected to be approved in 2010. The deferral of these measures points to over-optimism in terms
of the speed of preparation of the related actions. The decision to drop the decentralization strategy also
suggests that it was premature to have introduced this trigger in the first place. It is even more
unfortunate that it was decided not to actively pursue this issue in the context of the third PRSC series,
given that it is an essential component of the government`s strategy for poverty reduction at the local
level. Given the importance of decentralization in the PARPA, the one year delay in the approval of the
NPDP target can be considered a moderate shortcoming, due to overoptimistic planning. In fact, the
plan has since been used as the blueprint for a sector wide approach, underpinned by a donor common
fund, which has become operational in 2010. On the other hand, the delay in the completion of the
Decentralization Strategy is to be considered a major shortcoming, all the more so that it has not been
followed up in the third PRSC on the grounds that the political economy questions surrounding the issue
are not yet well understood. This suggests that it may have been premature to include the trigger in the
first place. It should also be noted that the donors and government have continued to work on preparing
the decentralization strategy, and it is expected to be approved in 2010.

37.    In the area of economic development, the focus of the triggers was on measures to: (i) facilitate
the creation of enterprises; (ii) strengthen the insurance and social protection sector; (iii) improve
connectivity (improving the percentage of roads in good or fair condition); and (iv) improve agricultural
productivity (increasing irrigated areas rehabilitated and put under the control of beneficiaries;
improving the use of improved technologies by farmers with the assistance of extension services;
improving access of farmers to extension services; and increasing agriculture`s share of the budget).

38.     There were initially eight triggers, of which two were dropped as being incompatible with OP
8.60 (roads, irrigation) and to reduce the total number of prior actions in line with best practice. A new
one was added under PRSC5, even though not in the PAF (increasing agriculture`s share of the budget)
pursuant to the food price crisis. Of the seven triggers finally retained, four were implemented in a
timely manner without change, one was delayed from PRSC4 to PRSC5 (related to the Social Security
Institute, INSS), while the other two were also implemented in a timely manner but modified
downwards to reflect slower progress than originally anticipated. The PRSC4 trigger pertaining to the
INSS (an actuarial study and preparation of an investment plan) was deferred from PRSC4 to PRSC5
when it was successfully completed ­ a moderate shortcoming. Two PRSC4 triggers pertaining to the
agriculture were met on time, but modified (reconstruction and rehabilitation of irrigated areas put under
beneficiary management; and adoption by farmers of new technologies with the assistance of extension
services). In the event, the original target of 3,000 hectares was reduced to 2,500 hectares, a reduction
of almost 17 percent (a moderate shortcoming); and the number of farmers adopting a new technology
was only 21 percent as compared to a target of 30 percent, a significant shortcoming.

39.     Table 5 provides an overview of the number of triggers by component and by operation. There
were initially 32 triggers of which were 3 were dropped by the Bank in PRSC5 to reduce the total
number of prior actions, in line with best practice recommended by OPCS. In addition, two of these
triggers were judged by OPCS as inconsistent with OP 8.60 because they were related to physical
investments, rather than constituting policy or institutional actions. It should be noted, however, that all
these triggers remained in the PAF and continued to be jointly monitored with the G19. In addition, one
new trigger was introduced under PRSC5. This trigger, which was not in the PAF and thus strictly not
in compliance with the undertakings of the MOU, pertained to increasing the budget to the agricultural
sector in the wake of the food price crisis and was introduced after discussion with G19 donors. Overall,
24 of these triggers were introduced in a timely manner and without modification, whereas the
remaining six were either (i) introduced in a timely manner but revised downwards, or (ii) deferred or
dropped for technical reasons. In overall terms, judging by the number of triggers met without
modification, there was an 80 percent success rate, with corresponding rates of 94 percent for
macro/PFM, 71 percent for governance and only 57 percent for economic development. This is a very
strong performance, especially when considering that the Macro/PFM pillar was by far the most
important both in terms of the strategic focus of the series and also in terms of the much larger number
of triggers. It is also worth noting that the macro/PFM pillar included a significant component of PFM
reforms, which can also be considered part of the broader governance agenda.

40.     To make an overall assessment of performance taking account the nature of modifications and
deferrals, etc, performance with respect to triggers has been rated, as per ICR Guidelines, from highly
satisfactory (HS, no shortcomings, score of 6) to highly unsatisfactory (HU, severe shortcomings, score
of 1).3 The results indicate that overall performance was satisfactory (score of 5.5). Performance in
macro/PFM was highly satisfactory (score of 5.9), while governance (5.1) and economic development
(5.0) are right on the cusp of moderately satisfactory (5) and satisfactory (>5). The same kind of
calculation for each of the PRSCs reveals that PRSC3 performance was highly satisfactory (score 6.0);
PRSC4 was moderately satisfactory (score 4.9), while PRSC5 was at the upper end of satisfactory (score
of 5.8) and close to highly satisfactory. Overall, performance was satisfactory with a score of 5.5.

41.     Program implementation. The purpose here is to report on program implementation and make an
assessment of the extent to which (i) annual targets were met for each Credit, and (ii) the overall
program development objectives were met. To this end, use is made of Annex 7, which uses the same
information as in the Results Framework Analysis, and the Policy Matrices used in the operations.
Annex 7 summarizes the program implementation by theme during each of the PRSC operations (i.e.,
after board approval), that is 2007 for PRSC3, 2008 for PRSC4 and 2009 for PRSC5 (the
correspondence is not exact, but it is close, since the closing dates of the operations occur before the end
of the year). An assessment of program implementation during each PRSC can then be obtained by
reading down the columns, while reading across the rows gives an appreciation of program
implementation by theme during the PRSC series as a whole. The penultimate column of the Table gives
the expected outcomes as set forth in the PRSC3 Program Document (paras 77-80). The last column of
Annex 7 includes an assessment of the extent to which targeted outcomes have been fully achieved or
less than fully achieved ­ that is in the first case achieved with no shortcomings and in the others
achieved with minor, moderate, significant, major or severe shortcomings. The column then includes
the corresponding performance rating as per ICR guidelines ­ highly satisfactory (HS), satisfactory (S),
moderately satisfactory (MS), moderately unsatisfactory (MU), unsatisfactory (U), or highly
unsatisfactory (HU). The same approach is used to rate performance for each operation, the ratings
being presented at the bottom of the corresponding column. As in the preceding section, numerical
scores of 1-6 are associated with each ranking (HS=6, etc).

42.    PRSC3. During its implementation (2007), eight targets were met or exceeded; two were met
with minor shortcomings, four had moderate shortcomings and one had major shortcomings.

43.     With respect to the targets that were fully met the targets were considerably exceeded (macro
management/PFM, number of days to open a business and the number of farmers assisted by public
extension services). In such cases, a rating of highly satisfactory was recorded (that is the same as if the
target were fully met and no more). Two of the targets missed pertained to the PFM, two were related
to decentralization, and the remaining one to the Economic Development pillar: (i) the share of public
3
  Triggers that were met on time without modification were rated highly satisfactory (HS, with a numerical score of 6).
Deferrals without modification were considered to have been implemented with moderate shortcomings and rated as
moderately satisfactory (MS, with a numerical rating of 4). Timely realization of triggers but with reduction of targets were
considered to have exhibited minor shortcomings if the reduction if the reduction was less than 10 percent (rating satisfactory
-- S --with a score of 5). Reduction of 11­20 percent were considered as moderate shortcomings (rating of moderately
satisfactory ­ MS ­ with a numerical score of 4). Reductions of 21-30 percent were considered significant and rated as
moderately unsatisfactory (MU with a score of 3). A 31-40 percent reduction in the target was considered a major
shortcoming and associated with a rating of unsatisfactory (U, with a score of 2). Reductions of more than 40 percent were
considered as severe leading to a rating of Highly Unsatisfactory (HU with a rating of 1). Abandonment of a trigger was
considered as equivalent to unsatisfactory performance.

                                                             13
expenditure going to priority sectors (62 vs 65 percent) ­ a minor shortcoming, hence a rating of
satisfactory; (ii) the share of central and provincial bodies with operational internal control units (target
30 percent, actual 25 percent) ­ a moderate shortfall of 17 percent, hence a rating of moderately
satisfactory; (iii) a one year delay in the finalization of the NPDP, a moderate shortcoming and a rating
of moderately satisfactory; (iv) a three year delay in the approval of the decentralization strategy ­ a
major shortcoming, an unsatisfactory performance; (v) completion of the actuarial study of the INSS
and preparation of its implementation which was delayed by one year to 2008 ­ a moderate
shortcoming, hence a rating of moderately satisfactory; and a shortfall of 12.5 percent in the acreage of
irrigated perimeters to be rehabilitated and transferred to beneficiaries (target 4000 hectares, realized
3500) ­ a moderate shortcoming and a rating of moderately satisfactory. Two indicators could not be
rated, pertaining to (i) the audits of districts and municipalities for which no target was set, because it
had been decided by donors not to monitor this indicator; and (ii) the number of cases tried per judge
which was supposed to exceed 150 and for which no information was available. Regarding the latter, it
should be noted that while the inclusion of justice sector reforms was considered as a possibility at the
time of PRSC3 and an indicative trigger related to reforms in the justice sector had initially been
envisaged for PRSC5, it was later decided in PRSC4 that the justice reforms should not become part of
the PRSC series in order not to dilute the focus of the operations. Hence, the indicator related to the
number of cases per judge (a measure of the efficiency of the justice system) was also dropped.

44.    This leads to an overall score of 5.1, that is satisfactory, albeit somewhat marginally. But in order
to form a definitive judgment, account should also be of performance with respect to the joint donor
PAF and under the IMF program.

45.     Joint Donor Review. The JR review of PAF performance for 2007 was successfully concluded
(in April 2008), with 24 out of 40 targets (i.e. 60 percent) being met, 11 not met but progress being
made towards their satisfaction, and 5 not met at all. Using a numerical rating system of 6 for targets
which are fully met (highly satisfactory), 4 for those which are not met (moderately satisfactory) but
with progress and 2 that are not met (unsatisfactory), the overall rating would be 4.95, that is below the
cusp of moderately satisfactory and satisfactory under the ICR system. Corresponding ratings by
components are: (i) macro/poverty, 5.1; (ii) governance, 5.6; (iii) human development, 4.6; (iv)
economic development, 5.0; and (v) cross-cutting issues, 4.0.

46.    Progress with respect to the IMF Program. Implementation of the IMF program was satisfactory
during 2007 notwithstanding a small number of waivers.

47.     Overall Conclusion. Putting together the information from assessments of the PRSC per se, the
common PAF, and the IMF program, it can be seen that the overall ratings indicate performance which
is satisfactory or slightly better. For these reasons, the final assessment that PRSC3 implementation
performance in 2007 was satisfactory.

48.    PRSC 4. During its implementation in 2008, 11 targets were achieved as planned or exceeded,
thus highly satisfactory, six were missed with minor shortcomings (satisfactory), and two had major
shortcomings (unsatisfactory).

49.     In the macro/PFM area, there were ten targets in all of which one could not be assessed. Of the
remainder, all were realized except for that pertaining to the share of central and provincial bodies with
operational internal control units where the target (65 percent) was missed by 9 percent. Nevertheless,
this was considered to be satisfactory performance. In the area of governance, the delays observed in
2007 with respect to decentralization were made up with respect to the finalization of the NPDP, which
had caused the corresponding PRSC4 trigger to be delayed until PRSC5. In other words, the non-
performance of 2007 in this area was caught up, so that the PRSC5 trigger could be met in a timely
manner. Performance was thus rated satisfactory. On the other hand, performance with respect to the
completion of the decentralization strategy continued to be unsatisfactory, given that no corrective
actions had been called for in 2008. In the economic development component, performance was mixed.
As regards the INSS, the actuarial study, whose completion had been deferred from 2007, was
completed on schedule, hence a rating of highly satisfactory. But the implementation of its
recommendations could not begin because not yet ready, so this had to be deferred to 2009 ­ a moderate
shortcoming hence a combined rating of satisfactory. There were also shortcomings with respect to the
other triggers ­ minor for roads (shortfall of 4 percent relative to target, so a rating of satisfactory, but
major for access to irrigated areas (major shortfall of 40 percent, whence a rating of unsatisfactory). On
the positive side, one should note that access by farmers to extension service exceeded the target, a
highly satisfactory performance. And finally, in line with the authorities` intent to improve the policy
response to the food price, the 2009 budget for agriculture was significantly increased, this being
considered as implemented during 2008 since the budget for 2009 was prepared and voted in 2008.

50.     Overall, the weighted average of all rated indicators for 2008 was 5.3, a satisfactory
performance, with the best performance in macro/PFM, followed by governance and then economic
development. Furthermore, overall performance in 2008 was notably better than in 2007, for which the
overall rating was 5.1.

51.     Joint Review. The review of PAF performance in 2008 (completed in April 2009) indicated
somewhat weaker performance than in 2007, with only 20 (i.e. 50 percent) of the 40 triggers being met
or exceeded, 14 not being met but with progress, 5 not met, and 1 not rated (Table 7). As may be seen,
performance was strongest in cross-cutting areas (HIV, Gender, Rural Development, and Environment)
where 3 out of the 4 targets were met, followed by Macro/poverty (6 out of 9 targets met), then
Governance and Human Development (4 out of 9 met in each case) with Economic Development
showing the weakest performance (only 3 out of 9 targets fully met). It may also be noted that, of the
three components, which concern the PRSCs, macro/poverty, which includes the PFM indicators, was
the best performing component, which followed by governance and economic development.

                                                     15
Performance scores were as follows: overall (4.8), macro/poverty (5.3), governance (4.4), and economic
development (4.0). On average, the overall rating is 4.6, that is moderately satisfactory, with ratings of
5.3 for macro/poverty; 4.4 for governance and 4.0 for economic development ­ thus the same tendency
towards best performance in the area of poverty/macro, followed by governance and economic
development. Furthermore, performance in poverty/ macro improved relative to 2007, while it
deteriorated in the other two sectors.

52.    IMF program. Performance in 2008 with respect to the IMF program under the PSI instrument
was judged fully satisfactory (apparently without waivers).

53.     Overall conclusion. The analysis for PRSC4 indicators indicates a solid satisfactory performance
in 2008 (5.3), somewhat better than in 2007 (5.1), with a continuation of the tendency for performance
in macro/poverty to be better than in governance and economic development. However, in accepting
this assessment for the PRSC, it appears important to note the potential disconnect with the finding of
the overall JR for 2008 of lower overall performance (4.8) compared to that for 2007 (5.0), and a notable
deterioration from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory in governance (5.6 to 4.4), and economic
development (5.0 to 4.0). This may be in part due to differences in composition of the overall indices,
but the finding appears relevant because of the emerging concerns expressed by donors in 2009 about
deteriorating overall performance, and in particular with respect to governance.

54.    PRSC 5. It is currently possible to report only partially on performance under PRSC5, as little
information is currently available for 2009 ­ the Joint Review of performance will only occur in April
2010. At the present time, available information indicates that eleven targets have been met or
exceeded, four have been missed with minor shortcomings (pertaining to procurement, the alignment
between budget and MTEF, and the targets on irrigated areas and the reach of extension services), and
two are unsatisfactory (decentralization and social security). On the basis of currently available
evidence, performance is satisfactory (numerical rating of 5.2).

55.     Overall performance for the series as a whole. Turning now to overall performance of the series
as a whole, aggregating the results for PRSCs 3 and 4 for 2007-2008 shows that there were a total of 34
rated targets, of which 19 (56 percent) were fully met or exceeded, 8 (24 percent) were met with minor
shortcomings, 4 (12 percent) had moderate shortcomings, 3 (9 percent) showed major shortcomings and

                                                          16
12 (35 percent) could not be rated. This makes for an overall rating of 5.2, which is satisfactory
performance, albeit closer to moderately than highly satisfactory. Inclusion of the available results for
2009 indicators confirms this finding on the basis of available evidence as of March 2010.

56.    Summing up, the implementation ratings for the individual operations and the series as a whole:

                           PRSC3:         Satisfactory
                           PRSC4:         Satisfactory
                           PRSC5:         Satisfactory
                           Overall:       Satisfactory


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

57.      A number of factors contributed to the broadly successful implementation and outcome of the
second PRSC series: (i) alignment with government policy instruments; (ii) government ownership; (iii)
effectiveness of donor coordination; and (iv) a sound analytical basis. On the negative side, the main
influence was the impact of the food and fuel price increases of 2007-2008, which however was
skillfully handled by the authorities.

58.     Alignment with Government Policy instruments. The PRSCs were well aligned with the
government`s poverty reduction strategies, especially PARPA II (covering 2006-2009) and its key
pillars (i) macroeconomic management, in particular the reform of the PFM and procurement system;
(ii) governance including decentralization; and (iii) economic development. Furthermore, all of the
PSRC monitoring indicators were drawn from the PARPA strategic matrix and related Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF), with one exception however. The exception pertained to PRSC5, where
a non-PAF indicator was included in response to the food and oil price crises of 2007-2008 ­ whose
importance demanded an immediate policy response but for which the PAF, prepared in 2005-2006, had
no indicators. At the same time, the PSRCs were intended to be aligned to the Government`s policy
review and budget processes, particularly the latter. Indeed, starting with PRSC 3, all PRSCs in calendar
year [n] have been processed on a time schedule permitting the government to effectively incorporate
the related resources into the national budget, as approved by Parliament, for year [n+1]. Furthermore,
disbursements have all occurred in the first quarter of the budget year being supported or immediately
before its commencement (PRSC5).

59.     Government ownership. The above factors have all contributed to strong government ownership,
all the more so that they have been prepared with thorough consultations with government and key
stakeholders. Indeed government ownership has grown over the life of the PRSCs, which has led to the
fact that, notwithstanding some delays in politically sensitive areas, none of the reforms have been
reversed.

60.    Effectiveness of donor coordination. The PRSCs are prepared in the context of the harmonized
General Budget Support mechanisms used by the group of 19 donors (G-19), whose relations with the
Government of Mozambique are governed by a Memorandum of Understanding initially signed in 2004
and revised in 2009. The MOU sets the ground rules for the preparation and review processes of all
budget support operations prepared by signatories, and have undoubtedly helped to improve

                                                   17
predictability of the transfer of funds as well as the quality and coordination of analytical support to
capacity building. Also, donor coordination helped to address issues, that would not otherwise have
been addressed, for example increasing the comprehensiveness of the budget through inclusion of
ministerial own receipts and donor projects other than budget support operations. This being said, donor
coordination has posed two problems which have somewhat hampered the design and implementation of
PRSCs namely: (i) reticence of some donors to grant (a) the merits of revising the PAF during PARPA
implementation to reflect emerging issues (e.g. the food and oil price crisis of 2007-2008); and (b) more
use of policy and institutional actions as triggers/prior actions, which are called for by the Bank
Operational Policies (OP 8.60); and (ii) the large number of working groups and task forces (in 2009
they reached a total of 71, of which 29 groups are joint with government, 42 are inter-donor only),
which fragments policy discussions and can retard the building of consensus (PRSC6 Program
Document, paras 41-43, 52).

61.    Quality of the Analytical Basis. The second PRSC series, like its predecessor was designed on
the basis of an extensive amount of analytical work undertaken since 2000 and well prior to the
preparation of the series. This included two Public Expenditure Reviews (2001 and 2003), two Country
Economic Memoranda (CEMs, 2001, 2005), a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (FY02), a
Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR 2003), a Financial Sector Assessment (2003),
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA 2003) Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review
(PEFA 2006), Government Poverty Assessment (2004); Education and Health sector reports (2005), as
well as work on agricultural extension (2005 and the Agricultural Development Strategy (2006).

62.     The analytical basis was further deepened by work undertaken during the second series,
including a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR 2008), Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Review (PEFA, 2008). In addition, analytical work has been undertaken by other donors
or jointly with them, including the IMF, pertaining in particular to Public Finances (both on the revenue
and expenditure side) and Natural Resource Management. Other relevant work includes the integrated
Poverty Social and Gender Assessment (2007) and the 2009 CEM, for which work began in 2007.
Work on private sector development has also been informed by the annual Doing Business Surveys.

63.     Of particular importance was the work done at the behest of the Government in 2008 on the
response to the rise in international prices of food and fuel in 2008 (Report Number 47455), which
seems to have had a direct impact on the preparation of PRSC5 which included a specific trigger even
though there was none such in the PAF. With the exception of this report, it cannot be said that specific
reports were prepared as inputs into specific operations. All of them were designed to support the PRSC
process rather than specific PRSC operations.

64.     Capacity Building. The PRSC series in itself did not entail capacity building components, and
was limited to providing budget support to support the Government`s progress in the reform program.
However, most of the reform areas were supported by parallel Bank technical assistance projects (such
as the Public Sector Reforms Project which supported the work on improving the human resources and
payroll management of civil servants or the multi-donor Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project
which supported the measures related to the INSS), or by technical assistance provided through donor
common funds (such as the e-SISTAFE common fund which supported the implementation of the e-
SISTAFE roll out, and the PLACOR External Audit Common Fund which supported the strengthening
of the Supreme Audit Institution, or the PROAGRI which supports agricultural sector institutions, or the
Road Fund which supports the institutional strengthening and physical investments in the roads and

                                                   18
bridges). In general these parallel sectoral projects or common funds provided for coordinated technical
assistance, which was instrumental in ensuring the success of the reforms in the respective areas.

65.     Political and External Factors. External factors were not a major influence on PRSC
implementation, with the exception of the food and fuel price shocks. These caused some domestic
unrest in 2008 which necessitated the introduction of emergency compensatory measures which were
managed well without major adverse fiscal impact, in net terms.

66.    Design of PRSC series. In hindsight, the design of the series in PRSC3 was excessively
optimistic with respect to the speed with which the decentralization strategy could be prepared. The
same was true with respect to the strategy for reforming INSS and rehabilitating rural infrastructure.
These issues could have been given more attention in the preparation process.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

67.     M&E design. The Program Document for PRSC3 introduced a Results Framework as well as
monitoring indicators for the series as a whole. This policy matrix of PRSC3 highlights the linkages
between policy actions and results in support of specific objectives and actions defined in the PARPA
monitoring framework, the Strategic Matrix. The Strategic Matrix represents the results framework of
the PARPA II and it was prepared by a joint Government and donor team led by the Ministry of
Planning and Development and involving all line ministries, key agencies as well as representatives of
civil society, with technical support from the Bank.

68.      The indicators and actions for PRSCs3-5 are aligned with a subset of the PARPA Strategic
Matrix selected by the joint Government and donors group providing budget support (G19) and laid out
in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) for 2007-2009. Normally these indicators are taken
only from the PAF, in accordance with the prescriptions of the MOU, and their indicative values are
initially set in year n for year [n+2], on the occasion of the joint Mid-Term Review, held in September.
The values are then finalized one year later in the midterm review for year [n+1]. Thus in principle
indicators are established with a two year lead. However, exceptionally, the PRSC-5 results framework
has been adjusted to include two non-PAF indicators to monitor the implementation of the main food
crisis measures adopted by the Government, and which resulted in additional financing being provided
through PRSC5 to the Government via the Bank`s Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund.

69.     Thus, the PRSCs have attempted to make good use of the monitoring and evaluation framework
for the PARPA, notwithstanding its weaknesses, which have been pointed out in recent JSANs. The
PRSC results framework does attempt to retain policy and institutional measures which are related to
desired outcomes. But these links are frequently partial.

70.     At the same time, the Government, with technical assistance from IDA and other development
partners, has been working since the beginning of 2006 to strengthen the monitoring system of the
Strategic Matrix of PARPA-II, in the context of the development of an integrated national Monitoring
and Evaluation system. Sector working groups, including representatives of each relevant Ministry,
Ministry of Planning and Development, donors and technical assistance, worked to select the key
PARPA II objectives in each sector and corresponding results indicators, actions, and output indicators.
A Quality Control Group led by the Ministry of Planning and Development and by the chair of the G19
was set up to oversee finalization of the Strategic Matrix and identification of key indicators.

                                                  19
Implementation of sector specific matrices is carried out by line Ministries and sector agencies, while
the overall poverty monitoring is the responsibility of the National Statistic Institute (INE). In addition,
following finalization of the PARPA Strategic Matrix with technical support from the Bank, in July
2006 the Monitoring Team within Ministry of Planning and Development began preparation of
Technical Notes for each indicator. A national workshop involving M&E units in ministries was
planned for early 2008, but had to be deferred until later in the year (July). Following this meeting, the
team has subsequently prepared a working plan to define decentralized level of responsibility in
monitoring indicators involving provincial level of government.

71.     In addition, an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant has recently been approved to assist
the government in strengthening the overall monitoring and evaluation framework for the upcoming
PARPA III, and in particular the government`s capacity to coordinate the overall M&E framework and
strengthen results orientation at the sector level, in a sustainable manner. To this end, the Ministry of
Planning and Development commissioned a study get a deeper understanding of issues underlying the
impediments to a functioning national M&E system. This study has pointed to the following issues: (i)
fragmentation of the M&E system in a multitude of different systems and instruments at national,
sectoral, provincial and district level without standardization or integrated methodology; (ii) insufficient
support by MPD in regard to institutionalization of structures, clarity of methodology and processes; and
(iii) absence of a strong statistical system and integrated mechanism of data production and
dissemination to support the preparation of the annual BdPES. Activities under the IDF grant would
pick up the analysis of the study and target specific areas: namely: (i) improving the results orientation
at sector level by strengthening the logical linkage between different levels of results and relating them
to budget and policy actions as well as provincial plans; and (ii) improving the linkage between M&E
and planning, by strengthening the coordination mechanism and production cycle of the annual PARPA
progress report.

72.     Various other activities are underway to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity of
government. Notably, the government with support from DANIDA has also started a training program
of government officials at central and decentralized level in the preparation of Log-Frame matrices and
the carrying out cost-benefit analysis of projects and activities.

73.      M&E implementation and utilization. Very limited direct information is provided in PRSC3
documentation and very little in the G19 Joint Reviews as to progress with respect to (i) improvement of
the PARPA M&E framework; nor (ii) its implementation and utilization. It is however apparent from
the documents that data are effectively collected and in a timely manner so permitting their effective
utilization in the context of the PRSCs, and that they have been used to assist the government in decision
making. Notably, administrative data on the progress towards PARPA (and PAF and PRSC) indicators
is collected annually and published in the Balanco do PES' (BdPES) report. In addition, specific
reports on individual reform areas are also produced on a regular basis (e.g., annual e-SISTAFE reports,
annual report by Supreme Audit Institution, etc.).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

74.    Following the successful completion of the second PRSC series, a third series (PRSC6-8) has
been initiated, and intends to continue to support a key subset of objectives from the PARPA II results
matrix focusing on improving public financial management and adopting growth enhancing reforms to
increase private investment. The first operation (PRSC6) was approved by the Board November 12,

                                                    20
2009 and focuses on: (i) the consolidation of the institutional reforms in the area of the budget process,
the quality of public financial management systems, the transparency and efficiency of the State
procurement system, and the coverage of the internal and external auditing system; and (ii) economic
development by removing constraints to growth, notably by reducing constraints to growth, notably by
reducing structural constraints to financial intermediation. Thus the third PRSC series focuses on the
same areas as the second series, except that: (i) there is no longer a specific component on governance
and public sector reform; and (ii) in the area of economic development a new theme ­ reducing
structural constraints to financial intermediation ­ is added. Governance of course remains an issue and
is treated in the component of PFM, procurement and auditing, to which civil service reform has been
added.

75.     The new series intends to take account of lessons drawn from the second series, in particular
relating to the need for (i) a good analytical foundation for policy reforms, (including their political
economy dimension) which should have been fully appropriated by government before their
implementation; (ii) improved harmonization with donors; (iii) accompanying coordinating capacity
building efforts; and (iv) avoiding forcing the pace on reforms where their political economy was not
fully understood.

76.     The third series should be careful to focus more on ensure better monitoring of (i) poverty and
expenditure monitoring, which was a weakness of earlier series; (ii) decentralization and public sector
reform, in particular the decentralization strategy which was dropped as of PRSC3. At the same time, it
would be important to avoid forcing the pace on reforms in these areas before their political economy is
fully understood.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities,
and Bank assistance strategy):

77.      The operations were all highly relevant to Mozambique`s Poverty Reduction Strategy, in regard
to all three components (Macroeconomics/PFM, Governance/PSR, and Economic Development). While
there were some weaknesses in the design of the PRSC3 (see below), these did not lead to significant
implementation difficulties in the three operations. Hence, the design of PRSC3, PRSC4 and PRSC5 are
all rated satisfactory.

78.      There are three aspects with respect to the design of PRSC3 which could have been improved.
First, the design of the decentralization component was optimistic in terms of timing which led to a
delay in the implementation of the triggers pertaining to the NDFDP and the decentralization strategy
and subsequently the abandonment of the decentralization as a trigger and as a theme for the third PRSC
series. This was unfortunate given the importance of the issue for implementation of the PARPA.
Perhaps the operation could have been designed differently by setting triggers pertaining to ensuring that
preparation of the strategy was on track.

79.     Second, the design with respect to the justice sector was lacking in that there was only an
indicative trigger for PRSC5, the last in the series. It makes the issue appear to be of marginal
importance, in which case it would have been better to omit it. It would have been possible to design a
better component related to justice sector reforms, and there are issues that would have merited

                                                   21
systematic treatment throughout the series and were referred to in the PAF, for example the number of
corruption cases. In fact, the justice sector reforms were dropped from the series (already in PRSC4), as
it became clear that the PRSC series already covered too many areas of reform.

80.     Third, the component pertaining to economic development certainly addressed some of the right
issues (roads, irrigation, access of farmers to extension services and new technologies) but the inability
of the government to attain the targets particularly in the area of irrigation in a timely manner indicates
that the constraints to implementation had not been properly appraised when the operation was designed.
The same considerations pertain to the reforms dealing with pensions and social security.

81.     PRSC4 and PRSC5 were adequately designed and tried to address the shortcomings highlighted
above. A further problem was that during the preparation of PRSC4, it became clear that the obligation
to use triggers drawn only from the PAF was an increasing constraint to adjusting program design to
changing circumstances and emerging issues. This problem was effectively solved in PRSC5 when the
Bank obtained agreement from donors and the government to introduce a subcomponent pertaining to
the food price crisis.

3.2   Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal linkages
between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

Rating: Satisfactory

82.     Outcomes by operation were assessed in section 2.1 through the lens of implementation
performance and the realization of annual indicator targets. The overall conclusions were as follows:
PRSC3 ­ satisfactory; PRSC4 ­ satisfactory; PRSC5 ­ satisfactory and PRSC3-5 overall ­ satisfactory.
The present section assesses the extent to which expected end-of-series outcomes (i.e. development
objectives), as set forth in PRSC3, were attained using the rating methodology in the ICR guidelines,
and the quality of those achievements.4 Furthermore, an attempt is made to assess the extent to which
the results are causally linked to the PRSC operations. In this connection, the relevant information is
summarized in Annex 7.

83.     Available information, as of March 2010, enables ratings to be made for 19 out of 23 specified
development outcomes (albeit in some cases for only 2 out of the 3 years), and indicates that 12
outcomes were highly satisfactory (in that the specified targets were met or exceeded), three satisfactory
(attained with only a minor shortcoming), one was moderately satisfactory (moderate shortcomings);
one was moderately unsatisfactory; and two were unsatisfactory. Using the 0-6 rating scale (see
footnote) implies an overall rating of 5.2, that is at the low end of satisfactory. A rating of satisfactory is
therefore proposed.

84.     The evidence from the JRs for 2007 and 2008 also indicate that at the end of 2008, a total of 44
out of 80 triggers had been met, 25 not met but with progress (i.e. partially met), 10 not met at all, while
1 could not be rated at all (see Table 8). Sixty-one percent of PFM triggers were fully met, but 100
percent fully met or partially met, etc.. On this basis, using a rating scale of 1-6, the overall rating for
compliance with PAF indicators in 2007-2008 would be 4.9, that is moderately satisfactory, albeit close
4
  According to which objectives are attained with no shortcomings (highly satisfactory), minor shortcomings (satisfactory),
moderate shortcomings (moderately satisfactory), significant shortcomings (moderately unsatisfactory), major shortcomings
(unsatisfactory) or severe shortcomings (highly unsatisfactory). To permit an aggregation, the present document assign

                                                            22
to satisfactory. The same assessment results from making the same calculations just for the components
pertaining to macro/poverty, governance, and economic development, i.e. omitting indicators related to
human development and cross cutting issues which were not specifically covered by the PRSC series. A
total of 11 macro/poverty indicators were fully met, and 7 partially so, which gives a global rating of
5.2. The corresponding figures for governance were 11 met, 5 partially met, and 2 not met, while for
economic development, they were 8, 5 and 4. This gives an overall indicator compliance rating of 4.9,
with individual ratings of 5.2 for macro/PFM, 5 for governance, and 4.5 for economic development. On
balance, an overall assessment of moderately satisfactory for implementation of PAF indicators in the
areas addressed by the PRSCs in 2007-2008.

85.  Significant outcomes, and their importance in development terms, are presented below and
summarized in Annex 7.

86.     Macroeconomic management. No development objective was clearly specified in the PRSC3
project document, but it was clearly expected that (i) the IMF program would remain on track; and (ii)
that the macroeconomic policy framework would be conducive to growth and poverty reduction. These
objectives were clearly attained, since growth remained strong and the IMF PRGF and PSI reviews were
concluded in a timely manner generally with only minor waivers. Mozambique`s economic growth
continued to be strong. GDP growth was 8.7% in 2006, 7% in 2007, 6.7% in 2008 (in spite of the food
and fuel price crisis), and 6.3% in 2009 (in spite of the global financial crisis). This is in line with
Mozambique`s remarkable growth record over the past decade, averaging just below 8% from 1996 to
2008, making Mozambique the fastest growing non-oil African economy over the decade (ADI 2007,
page 2). In terms of the IMF program, Mozambique has been on-track with IMF program since 1987.
It was also one of the first African countries to graduate into a PSI program in June 2007. The 6th PSI
review mission was successfully concluded in March 2010, and confirmed that the macroeconomic
performance in 2009 has remained good. Although the economy was adversely affected by the
international financial crisis, the impact has been successfully mitigated by accommodating fiscal and
monetary policy, successfully seeking access to IMF ESF resources to maintain a prudent level of
reserves, while at the same time allowing the exchange rate to depreciate gradually (to compensate for
the appreciation in 2008).


                                                          23
87.     In fact GOM has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to mitigate the impact of internal and
external shocks with rapid and flexible policy responses. The impact of higher oil and food prices in
2008 was successfully mitigated by tightening monetary policy, limited adjustments to foreign reserves,
and fiscal measures to alleviate the social impact and to support the productive sectors of the economy.
Similarly the 2005 drought and the damage from the 2007 floods and cyclone in 2007 were dealt with by
reallocations in the budget and much better preparedness in the case of the floods.

88.     Fiscal policy has been consistent with macro stability and debt sustainability, and GOM medium-
term fiscal strategy objective is to make room for private sector credit by avoiding recourse to domestic
financing. In 2009, the fiscal response to the crisis is expected to lead to a positive Net Credit to
Government, for the first time since 2003. In fact GOM has made large domestic debt repayments since
2003 (but was unable to make repayments in 2007 because of the need to fill the gap resulting from
shortfalls in external aid due to donor administrative delays). Monetary/exchange rate policies clearly
target price stability. Annual average inflation decreased from 13.2% in 2006 to 8.2 in 2007, then
increased temporarily as a result of the international food and fuel price spike to 10.3% in 2008, and
decreased to 3.5% in 2009, as a result of the subsequent fall in commodity prices. The Balance of
Payments was projected to deteriorate by approx US$350 million between 2008 and 2009, as a result of
the financial crisis and also reflecting movements in the exchange rate. However, Mozambique`s
balance of payments has been temporarily bolstered as stronger capital flows (notably due to the
acceleration to 2009 of PRSC6 budget support, the Fund resources under the ESF and the Fund SDR
allocation), that have largely offset the deterioration in the current account. The current account has
worsened because of a deteriorated trade balance, associated with a substantially weaker trade balance in
2009, as lower commodity prices reduced export receipts by more than the import expenditures. The
foreign exchange market has remained fairly stable. The real effective exchange rate appreciated
significantly in 2008, but depreciated towards equilibrium in 2009. Real interest rates are still high, but
continue to decrease. International reserves remain at a comfortable level and as of end-December 2009
were around 5.5 months of import cover which is above the IMF program target. Credit to the economy
has continued to grow rapidly, at above 30% nominal growth in the past 2 years. Public and private
investments continue to grow, with a notable surge in FDI in recent years.

89.     In the area of public expenditure management, expenditure in priority sectors continued to
fluctuate within a narrow band around 65 percent of total primary expenditure, which is the PARPA
target (Prior actions for PRSC3 and PRSC4). In terms of the provision of public goods for growth,
substantial improvements have been registered in most areas. Significant progress has been made in
rehabilitating the roads network since 1992; also, significant improvements in providing access to water
in urban areas since 2002, accompanied by some improvements in access to water in rural areas. Rapid
expansion of mobile telecommunications throughout the country with the leading operators achieving
over 4 million customers, and internet using fiber optics being available in all major cities. The main
ports and railway lines have been concessioned, and rehabilitation of the Maputo-RSA railway line, and
the Sena railway line to Zimbabwe are almost complete. The electricity grid has been extended to the
last two provincial capitals in 2005, and two thirds (98/128) of district capitals by 2009, but business
people complain about erratic electricity in some areas, notably outside Maputo and main cities.
Authorities are partly covering periodic maintenance in roads from fuel taxes, and water supply for
small piped systems is poor. Recent studies have shown that public agricultural extension service is
effective in increasing farmers` productivity. There has been a massive expansion of the education
system at all levels. Provision of public goods is in many areas is sufficient to support further growth.
Nevertheless, the gap in infrastructure needs (including for social services) remains substantial.

                                                    24
Although significant progress is being made across a large number of sectors as a result of well targeted
public investments/expenditures, it would be important for the PRSCs to delve further into the structure
of expenditures and to seek to improve their poverty orientation, their quality so as to ensure more value
for money. In this regard, it is regrettable that more attention was not paid to the use of PETS.

90.     Establishment of the MTEF. The second PRSC series has supported the Government`s efforts to
put in place an MTEF that is directly linked or derived from the PARPA and to ensure that annual
budget allocations correspond to the first year of the corresponding MTEF (Prior Action for PRSC5).
The government goal has been to strengthen the MTEF to use it as the basis for the sectoral budget
allocations, and support programmatic implementation of PARPA II. The quality of the MTEF has
undoubtedly improved over the years since its introduction in 2006, when the 2007-2009 MTEF was
subjected to Cabinet approval for the first time. In this context, the government is working to better
develop the role of the MTEF as a planning tool which can be adapted to changing circumstances, while
continuing to work to improve the underlying processes of budget preparation and medium term
planning. The most important aspect is that the development of the budget reconciles with the baselines
developed in the MTEF, especially for outlying years, and deviations should be justified (in budget
formulation as well as execution). Despite the progress made in the elaboration of the MTEF over the
years, some significant challenges remain in order for the budget to be more closely aligned with the
PARPA and to contribute more to poverty reduction. There are still a number of weaknesses associated
with this instrument, as reflected in the relevant 2008 PEFA indicator (score of C+ for PI-12, multi-year
perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting, including a D on the dimension related
to linkages between investment budget and forward expenditure estimates), as well as the Joint Review
aide-memoire. The MTEF has still not progressed to being the instrument used to facilitate strategic
allocation and operational efficiency of resources. This is due to the lack of clarity on the medium term
resource envelope, notably for external funding. In fact, there is a significant gap between the scope and
quality of data in the MTEF pertaining to the domestic versus the external component of the budget.
This matters a great deal for the strategic impact of the budget, because in Mozambique, the actual
composition of spending differs significantly from budget allocations (over 5 percent variance in excess
of aggregate deviations for two out of the three years under review in the PEFA, justifying a C on
indicator PI-2), and most of this variance can be attributed to the external component of the budget.
Therefore, in order to increase the likelihood that the budget as a whole contributes to the PARPA
objectives, it would be important to focus not only on appropriations of the domestic component, but
also on its execution as well as on the appropriation and execution of the external component of the
budget.

91.     Overall, while performance in this regard was less than perfect, it bodes well for the future
because it will set a tighter link between the PRS and budget allocations for priority sectors. Going
forward, it would be preferable to pursue the gradual introduction of the programmatic approach that is
contemplated by the authorities. This should help to focus attention on the issue of budget execution,
which is an important part of strategic alignment, as well as on the effect of the execution of donor
projects on the overall performance of the budget, as a policy instrument.

92.      Revenues. The development objective of better revenue generation was achieved, in terms of
attaining overall targets. More broadly, the performance of the tax reform process has been very good,
and characterized by continuous efforts to improve the efficiency of the tax administration, the
consolidation of the taxes and the modernization of customs procedures for trade facilitation. As a
critical part of the reforms, the government successfully established the Central Revenue Authority

                                                   25
(AT), which integrates the general administration of taxes and customs in one single entity, and became
operational and started to function formally when its president took office in November 2006 (Prior
Action for PRSC3). As part of the reforms, the Information Technology Plan (PDTI) for 2007­2010 of
the new Central Revenue Authority was elaborated by end 2006 and approved in June 2007, and will
ensure the development of an adequate system to manage and control information that supports all taxes
(Prior Action PRSC4). Tax legislation is also being strengthened. Following the December 2006
approval by Parliament of new legislation on the fiscal regimes for the mining and oil sectors, the new
laws have become effective in mid-2007, and regulations have since been approved to implement them,
including model contracts. In December 2007, the Parliament also approved new tax laws on Value
Added Tax and Personal Income Tax. The new VAT Code replaces the previous Code and the
dispersed enactments that amended it, and clarifies the list of VAT exempt transactions and exemptions
for specific goods. The new Personal Income Tax Code simplifies the system of direct income taxation,
and updates the income thresholds and tax brackets.

93.     Government efforts in consolidating the tax reforms and strengthening the management of AT,
are resulting in significant increases in total collected revenues, without raising any rates (Prior Action
for PRSC5). Total revenue to GDP ratio rose from 13.1% in 2004 to 14.1% in 2005, to 15.6% in 2006,
15.9% in 2007, 16% in 2008 (due to a 0.6% loss of revenue as a result of the temporary tax removal on
diesel and kerosene between June and December 2008), and 17.8% of GDP in 2009 (in spite of the
impact of the financial crisis).

94.     e-SISTAFE. There continues to be real progress as regards the roll out and use of e-SISTAFE
(which is the Mozambique IFMIS), as is evident from Annex 7. It is clear that the development
objectives, as set forth in the PRSC3 program document, of making budget execution less time
consuming and more transparent are being achieved ­ in that the specific indicators pertaining to the
roll-out and use of e-SISTAFE have been met. More broadly there has been very good progress in the
implementation of the overall PFM reforms program. The 2006 PEFA assessment (published in 2006
and assessing performance in 2004) highlighted the weakest areas of public financial management
systems to be accounting, auditing, and procurement. Based on the 2006 PEFA assessment, the
authorities prepared and have been implementing (during the course of this PRSC series) the medium-
term Public Financial Management Action Plan and Budget` (PFM-APB) for 2006-2009, which has
been agreed with the donors and is financed through a multi-donor common fund. The 2008 PEFA
assessment (assessing performance up to 2006) highlights that significant improvements have been
made in the quality of PFM during the period 2004-2006, in particular with the implementation of the
integrated electronic financial management system (e-SISTAFE). The areas that showed the most
significant progress included payroll, procurement and internal controls, cash management, revenue
collection and management and donor practices, whereas there was less progress on the indicators
pertaining to credibility of the budget and external oversight, and a slight deterioration on reporting due
to the lack of a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) in the last three years. Areas for
improvement (rated D+ or below) included the oversight of aggregate fiscal risk in the public sector, the
effectiveness of tax collection, the availability of information on resources received by service delivery
units, and the scope, nature and follow-up of external audit. This overall assessment was confirmed by
the fiscal transparency ROSC conducted in 2007 by the IMF.

95.      The cornerstone of the authorities` action plan to strengthen Public Financial Management has
been the implementation of the integrated electronic financial management system (e-SISTAFE).5 The
implementation of the e-SISTAFE has been proceeding rapidly, and the system became operational in
2008. Following an initial pilot in 2005, the full version of the Direct Budget Execution Module was
finalized and gradually rolled out to all ministries at the central and provincial levels by end-2007 (Prior
Actions for PRSC3, PRSC4 and PRSC5).6 Additional roll-out as of end-December 2008 led to the
inclusion of a total of 50 districts (which had the prerequisite infrastructure) and 25 autonomous
institutions at central level. Hence the e-SISTAFE system has now been comprehensively introduced
across central government. The roll-out was accompanied by an extensive training program, involving
1850 users (more or less 6 users per Budget Execution Unit). Users have acquired good operational
skills and are now at a level of being able to formulate requests for additional functionality. Following
the roll out of e-SISTAFE, the government has started to make the transition towards a modern system
of direct execution of the budget. Within the e-SISTAFE reform, one of the results with the highest
impact in terms of improvement in Public Finance Management is direct budget execution (according to
the sequence of commitment, verification, and payment directly by bank transfer from the Single
Treasury Account), as this increases transparency, improves information on public spending and reduces
the risk of diversion of funds.7 The roll out and implementation of e-SISTAFE in all Ministries at
central and provincial level has allowed the transition from the previous system of advance payments
towards a modern system of direct budget execution. As of end-2007 budget units started to make their
payments directly by bank transfer from the Single Treasury Account, such that as of end-2009 over 95
percent of goods and services and investments transactions of budget execution units are carried out live
through e-SISTAFE, leading to significant benefits in terms of improved information on public spending
and build-up of arrears, predictability in the availability of funds for expenditures and commitments by
budget holders, and in internal control and transparency.

96.    The roll out of e-SISTAFE has exceeded the targets set for it in the PRSC series, both at the
national and sub-national levels. Implementation is therefore rated as highly satisfactory. The system is
beginning to produce significant benefits which are expected to increase over time. In particular, there
has been an improvement in the credibility of the budget in terms of the deviation between actual
expenditure outturn compared to the budget (PEFA indicator P-1). There is improved monitoring of

5
  The reforms started with the approval of a new financial management law in 2001 and accompanying regulations in 2002,
which set the basis both for modern accounting procedures and for procurement reform.
6
  By end 2007, e-SISTAFE had been rolled-out to all 25 Ministries and 7 State Organs (out of a total of 32) at central and
provincial level, and a total of 544 Budget Execution Units (UGEs, Unidade Gestora Executora) across the whole country.
Further, by March 2008 e-SISTAFE was successfully rolled out to 31 districts.
7
  From September 2007 budget execution by direct execution` became obligatory for all State institutions with access to e-
SISTAFE, and for all expenditures except overseas transfers and certain subsidy payments (for example, payment of funeral
expenses). The direct budget execution modality stands in contrast to the legacy system of advances to spending units, which
is still in vigor for the parts of government that are not connected to e-SISTAFE. Direct budget execution involves three
phases or distinct steps in the expenditure authorization process: the commitment of the expenditure, its liquidation` when
resources are assigned for payment and the actual payment, when funds are transferred directly from the Single Treasury
Account (CUT) to the bank account of the supplier of goods or services. When it is adequately implemented, the direct
budget execution modality ensures that the commitment, liquidation and payment of expenditure are authorized within e-
SISTAFE by three different agents. These three agents are respectively in charge of budget execution (initiates the
commitment and liquidation process), internal control (verifies compliance of the process and supporting documentation with
rules and regulations), and financial execution (authorizes payment at the end of the process). The segregation of duties
between these three agents is embedded in the design of e-SISTAFE, as the three user profiles are mutually incompatible.
The direct budget execution modality should also ensure that budget commitments remain within their respective ceilings, as
the system blocks excessive commitments.

                                                            27
expenditure arrears which have been reduced in volume. The authorities are now able to obtain, in a
timely manner, much better information on budget execution which in turn enables them to better plan
the use of resources for the remainder of the budget year. For example, analysis of information from e-
SISTAFE enabled the authorities to identify the potential for saving $46 million in travel expenses. This
was of critical importance in finding the resources necessary to finance additional social protection
expenditures in 2008, following the social unrest that followed the increase in food prices. In year
budget reports are now produced much faster than in earlier years. There is also increased predictability
in the availability of resources for budget holders, and improved cash flow management. Finally, e-
SISTAFE should reduce the risk of funds being diverted away from their intended use. All in all
sustained implementation of e-SISTAFE is likely to increase fiscal space, the efficiency of expenditure
and the availability of public services to the population.

97.     While the introduction of the direct execution through e-SISTAFE is already bringing the above
benefits, there are challenges related to the introduction of the e-SISTAFE system in an existing paper-
based culture, which limit its effectiveness. There is evidence that the actual use of the system is not
always as envisaged in that the execution of goods and services often undergoes a dual process, partly
manual and partly automated. More generally, following the successful introduction of the e-SISTAFE,
the government has started working on complementary reforms designed to make full use of the benefits
that the e-SISTAFE can deliver. In particular, the second generation of reforms will include integrating
the payroll management and the revenue collection management in the e-SISTAFE information
management system. Further progress is required under third PRSC series, in order to improve
governance and reduce corruption in the area of financial management. In this regard, it can also be
added that the government is preparing a new strategic public finance management vision which is
expected to be finalized in mid-2010 and will guide the next phase of PFM reforms.

98.     Procurement. Substantial progress was achieved since 2006 in the implementation of the
procurement reforms, and making them more effective at the national and local levels ­ the desired
development objective. Revised regulations governing procurement were approved in December 2005
so as to promote competition and transparency. With the approval of the regulations, from an outdated
and fragmented legal and regulatory framework, Mozambique became equipped with a modern legal
and regulatory framework, which is generally aligned to international good practice. A manual and a set
of (nine) standard bidding documents and contracts based on international standards exist. A new
central procurement institution, the Functional Unit of Supervision of Acquisition (UFSA), was
established and staffed, and became operational in 2006 (Prior Action for PRSC3). A director, staff and
consultants     have     been    appointed,     and      a      website    is   also      operational       (at
http://www.concursospublicos.gov.mz). In addition, following the initial identification of location for
Units for Execution and Management of Acquisition (UGEAs) at central and provincial level, a first set
of 472 UGEAs was established as of end-2007 and a total of 950 UGEAs was been established as of
end-2008. Hence, most of the activities envisaged as part of second phase of implementation of the
procurement reforms have been completed (Prior Action for PRSC4). These reforms were accompanied
by a comprehensive process of capacity building in the application of the new procurement regulations,
aimed at increasing the number of specialized procurement technicians. Specifically around 1860
technicians have been trained at central, provincial, district and local municipality levels to facilitate the
adoption of the new procurement system at the decentralized level. As a result of these reforms, from a
situation where the standard procurement method was a noncompetitive process (contractors selected
from a list) and a nontransparent evaluation process, Mozambique has now moved into a system based
on open competition as the default setting, and where transparent and objective evaluation and

99.     While significant progress has been made, yet there remain substantial challenges to make the
procurement system operational. As part of the reforms, the government has started the development of
a monitoring system to allow measurement of the performance of the reforms (Prior Action for PRSC5).
Available data on the methods of procurement applied for acquisitions above the small purchases
threshold suggest a rapid increase in the use of competitive procurement systems, although there has
been a drop in 2009 (the reasons for which are currently being examined). As highlighted in the 2008
CPAR, however, there is as yet no system in place to ensure that all UGEAs systematically report
procurement information to UFSA. This highlights the need for a more robust M&E system, which is
one of the major recommendations of the CPAR update report. In this context, to enable effective
procurement management and public monitoring, the government is working to develop a simple but
strengthened Management Information System (MIS), with a web interface to allow UFSA to collect
data directly from UGEAs through an electronic submission system, and track the procurement
performance of the key ministries. Such a Management Information System (MIS) will allow UFSA to
track the procurement performance of the key ministries to ensure compliance and best value for money.

100. Internal auditing, progress towards the development objective of increased coverage and quality
of audits is moderately satisfactory. The internal audit institution (IGF) has been substantially
strengthened in recent years and audit coverage is expanding. In 2006 the Government recruited 54 new
technicians, thus improving the inspection capacity for the coming years. Also, IGF finalized the basic

                                                     29
internal auditing manual. In parallel, there has been substantial progress in recent years in expanding the
coverage of auditing at all levels of government (Prior Action for PRSC4). The number of audits
completed by the IGF in 2006 was almost double compared to 2005, and IGF carried out almost all
planned audit activities. From the total target universe (districts and municipalities) 32 percent was
audited. In 2007 the Government also made a significant effort to expand the internal audit system, such
that the Government established Internal Audit Units in 25 percent of all central and provincial level
bodies by end-2007 (Prior Action for PRSC5, which however was below the target of 30 percent), and
this percentage has since increased to 75% as of end-2009. While the PRSC target was not achieved on
time, it should be noted that there were no operational internal audit units in 2006, and therefore
progress has been substantial. Further, the progress has been all the more significant when considering
that: (i) the IGF is both reforming itself and structuring the internal audit system for the whole of GOM;
(ii) there is substantial heterogeneity of sectoral internal audit/inspection bodies, which need to
harmonized; and, (iii) it is difficult shift from a traditional inspection culture to an internal audit
approach. In hindsight, therefore, it seems fair to conclude that the trigger was overly ambitious. In
terms of the quality of the internal audit process, IGF has been monitoring the follow up of audit
recommendations and in 2007 formally carried out an evaluation of the compliance on the part of the
audited entities with the recommendations formulated by the IGF. As part of the evaluation, the
Government has reviewed follow up on some 200 of the most relevant recommendations included in
previous audit reports, and it found that approximately 70 percent of these recommendations had been
adopted.

101. The sense of the reforms is clearly in the right direction, with an increasing number of
operational internal control units being created. But the speed of their introduction has been somewhat
slower than forecast, so leading to a moderate shortfall relative to targets both in 2007 and 2008. The
program was overambitious relative to the capacity of IGF, which was responsible for overseeing their
introduction while at the same time undertaking its own reorganization. In addition, areas of weakness
remain in the functioning of the internal control systems. First, there are delays in the full
implementation of the Subsystem for Internal Control (SCI), including the institutionalization of the
Internal Control Units (OCI) in some State organs. In general, the performance of the Subsystem for
Internal Control is still fairly weak, and moving forward the elaboration and implementation of the SCI
plans should be a priority. Second, the internal monitoring and evaluation system is still weak and the
sharing of information between the different OCIs and the IGF is not well defined yet. It is necessary to
develop a model for coordination, supervision and reporting of the activities developed by the OCIs.
Third, there remains a need to improve the links with the UTRAFE, in particular with respect to training
and access to e-SISTAFE by the auditors.

102. External auditing. There has been excellent progress towards the development objective of
increasing the coverage and quality of external audits. Strengthening external auditing and the Court of
Accounts (Tribunal Administrativo) is a key component of the Government`s strategy to increasing the
efficiency of the PFM system and the accountability of its staff. The Report and Opinion on the Annual
State Accounts are regularly completed within the terms stipulated by law and is available on-line. The
Annual State Accounts (Conta Geral do Estado, CGE), which are audited every year by the TA,
includes full information on revenue, expenditure, financial assets and liabilities, at all level of
government. The good performance in this dimension is marked by the regular submission of the Report
and Opinion on the Annual State Accounts (Relatório e Parecer sobre a Conta Geral do Estado) to the



                                                    30
Parliament within the term stipulated by law since the State Accounts of 2004.8 These reports have also
been made available on the web page of the TA.9 In a well functioning system, as part of the
preparation of the audit of the Annual State Accounts, the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) carries out
audit activities to verify the data in the State Accounts. The scope of the audit indicates the entities and
sources of funds that are audited in any given year. Substantial progress has been made over the past few
years in improving the capacity and performance of (verification) audit activities. To inform the
preparation of the audit of the Annual State Accounts, the Mozambique`s Supreme Audit Institution
(Tribunal Administrativo, TA) regularly carries out verification audits of the accounts of various public
institutions at central and decentralized level. To this end, two sets of measures have been undertaken in
the course of PRSCs 3-5: (i) increasing the number of audits undertaken completed and judged; and (ii)
increasing the share of the budget being covered by these audits. On both scores, the targets set in the
PAF were exceeded, so the desired development outcome of increasing external audits has been
achieved in a highly satisfactory manner. Thus, the initial target were that that the TA should complete
70 audits in 2006 (Prior Action for PRSC4) and 90 in 2007 (Prior Action for PRSC5), but the prior
actions were adjusted upwards in line with performance since these targets were widely exceeded at 115
in 2006 and 281 in 2007. The number of audits carried out has since increased to 350 in 2008 and 491
in 2009. While the increase in the number of verification audits by the TA is impressive, the scope of
these audits remains limited, as it is estimated that in 2007 they covered approximately 26 percent of
total expenditures. Building on the recent progress, in line with the findings of the PEFA assessment,
the TA has therefore shifted the focus from the number of verification audits to expanding the share of
the State Budget covered by the verification audits (in terms of the budget administered by the entities
subject to the audits), such that the TA will continue to expand its coverage of the State Budget in
accordance with the technical norms of INTOSAI and according to the Mozambican legislation to at
least 30 percent in 2008 and at least 35 percent in 2009. Results to date are that the 2008 target was
exceeded (33 percent) and the 2009 target was met (35 percent). Beyond this focus on increasing the
scope of the external audit, it will be important for the TA to move towards a risk-based approach to the
selection of the institutions audited and the size of the verification sample in each given institution.
While the TA is interested in moving toward a risk-based approach, at present the TA`s auditors lack
familiarity with risk-based audit techniques. Further, none of its staff are qualified as chartered
accountants or accounting technicians, and as a result the TA`s financial audits are not conducted in
compliance with international standards on auditing. In this context, the TA is working with
development partners to create the capacity necessary to provide its auditors with international technical
and professional qualifications so as to better carry out its mandate. In particular, the Bank has recently
approved an IDF grant in support of the training and certification to international standards of the TA`s
auditors.

103. More broadly, there has been visible improvement in the external scrutiny and external audit
function in recent years. The TA is involved in a process of continuous improvement embedded in a
strategic action plan, with the technical assistance of AFROSAI-e and other Supreme Audit Institutions
(SAIs) and the support of a multi-partner common fund. The 2008 PEFA report indicated that the

8
  Since 2004 the Annual State Accounts (Conta Geral do Estado, CGE) has been audited each year by the TA and an audit
report has reached the National Assembly within 6 months of receipt of the financial statement (CGE) by the TA, that is 11
months after the end of the corresponding fiscal year, which is compliant with Mozambican legislation (Article 50, Law
9/2002). This performance is very good in the African context.
9
  Following approval by Parliament, the Annual State Accounts and the relevant audit report by the Supreme Audit Institution
are made available at the following internet address: http://www.sislog.com/ta/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=5 At present,
this website makes available the reports and opinions for the years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

                                                            31
performance of the TA had improved between the 2006 and 2008 assessments on one of sub-dimensions
of the relevant indicator (PI-26), namely the timeliness of submission of the audit reports to the
legislature (from C to B). Yet there remains room for improvement in the scope and nature of the audit
performed (from D to D), particularly in the compliance of the TA`s audit work with international
standards and the breadth of work undertaken, and also in the follow-up on audit recommendations
(from C to C).

104. The response to the audit findings remains limited, however, which can reduce the accountability
of financial managers and hence the credibility of the PFM system as a whole. In recent years there has
been substantial coverage of the audit findings, and the related Parliamentary discussion, in the local
media. Further, a comparison of the most recent audit opinions (on the CGE for 2007, 2006 and 2005)
with the earlier ones shows a significant improvement in the comprehensiveness and quality of the
analysis. This is partly due to improvements in the quality of the CGE itself but also seems to reflect a
strengthening of the capabilities of the TA. In terms of the audit of the CGE, it is the Parliamentary
Committee on Finance and Planning that recommends follow-up measures and a report on their
implementation is included in the TA`s audit report (parecer) for the following year`s CGE. In practice,
however, the follow up is largely limited to future audits by IGF and by TA specifically to verify the
implementation of such recommendations. Credibility requires that sanctions be imposed in the event of
irregularities and the initiation of prosecution in cases of criminal negligence or behavior. In this area,
IGF is creating a data base that will facilitate the monitoring of the implementation of TA
recommendations of preceding years` audits. The April 2009 JR reporting that financial sanctions have
been imposed on 280 managers. Going forward, the TA and Parliament will need to build on the
existing mechanism to ensure a more in-depth follow-up of audit findings, including detailed statistics
on rates of implementation of the TA`s previous recommendations.

105. Strengthen the institutional capacity of local governments. In this area, expected end of series
development outcomes were that (i) more resources would be transferred to local governments, in
particular for investment; (ii) their capacity to manage these resources would be improved; and (iii) that
a national decentralization strategy would be approved. The corresponding prior actions and triggers as
set forth in the Program Document for PRSC3 were that (i) criteria for the allocation of investment
budgets for districts would have been defined in the 2007 budget (PRSC3 prior action); (ii) that the
national program for planning and finance at the local level had been approved (PRSC4 Trigger); and
(iv) the national decentralization strategy had been completed (PRSC4 Trigger). But there were no
triggers pertaining to the amount of increases in transfers, although targets were met, and in the event,
exceeded.

106. As has been seen in the section on implementation there were substantial slippages in this area.
The PRSC3 trigger was met in a timely manner, but the two PRSC4 triggers were deferred. The NPDPF
trigger was deferred to PRSC5, thus the program was approved with a delay of a year. The plan has
since been used as the blueprint for a sector wide approach, underpinned by a donor common fund,
which has become operational in 2010. This can be considered a satisfactory outcome, all the more that
all the targets for transferring resources to the districts were met, and in fact exceeded.

107. The finalization of the decentralization strategy was put off to third PRSC series where in fact it
has been dropped. It is argued that the political economy dimension of the decentralization strategy had
not been well understood, so the Bank intends under the third PRSC series to eschew any the inclusion
of any specific actions or triggers ­ thus limiting itself to participation in the policy discussion. To

                                                    32
which it may be added that the PAF for the period 2009-2011 does not refer to the decentralization
question either. Nevertheless, the Bank and G19 have continued to follow up on the preparation o the
decentralization strategy, and the approval of the strategy is now expected in 2010.

108. Overall, therefore, the expected outcomes of this PRSC area were partially attained as of end
2009, and it is likely that they will be attained fully as of end-2010. The inexistence of the
decentralization strategy is a major shortcoming relative to the development objective of its approval. In
hindsight, it seems that the inclusion of the trigger for the decentralization strategy in the PRSC series
was premature and should have been avoided. It was a design weakness to have included it in PRSC3
and seems to have reflected insufficient preparation. This, together with the delay in the approval of the
NPDPF, points to a rating of moderately satisfactory for the corresponding component of the PRSCs.

109. Improving Human Resource Management in the Public Sector. There has been important
progress in the area of civil service reforms. The government created the Ministry of Civil Service
(MCS) in October 2007. The MCS is responsible for the policies related to the management of the
human resources in the public sector, control and inspection of the public service, organization of the
public administration, as well as the program of reforms of the public sector. The expected outcome in
this area was that the capacity to monitor the wage bill would be in place by the end of 2009 with prior
actions and triggers being established as follows: (i) completion of civil service census and creation of
an integrated payroll database (PRSC4 prior action); and (ii) development and implementation of the
unified Personnel Information System (Cadastro Unico dos Funcionários Publicos ­ CAF; PRSC-5
prior action). As part of its activities the MCS carried out a detailed census of civil servants in 2007.
The realization of the census has allowed the creation of the single registry of State Officials and Public
Servants in 2007 (Cadastro Unico dos Funcionários Publicos, CAF). The CAF is an integrated
database that allows the development and implementation of features that support the strategic
management of human resources, including the payroll.10 As a result, the government is now able, in
real time, to tell how many civil servants there are, by grade and region, and ministry. Hence, the
PRSC triggers were met in a timely manner and available evidence points to the fact that the coexistence
of the CAF and a payroll module within e-SISTAFE has enabled much improved controls of salary
payments, and in particular the (potential) elimination of salary payments to ghost workers, and the
direct payment of salaries through e-SISTAFE. Achievement of development objectives is thus rated as
highly satisfactory.

110. In addition, these reforms are being followed up in the third PRSC series. In particular, the
government has also begun a reform of public sector wages and pensions, and a new medium salary
policy approved in September 2008 which is built around the following guiding principles: (i)
simplification and rationalization of salary scales across ministries, increased transparency; (ii)
decompression of salary scales, better alignment of remuneration with qualifications, experience; (iii)
reform of locality subsidies; and (iv) harmonization of the salary and the pension systems. These issues
will be followed up throughout the third series. All in all, these civil service reforms are significant
achievements, which if sustained, can be considered as major improvements in governance.

10
   The government is in process to move towards a fully computerized Human Resources system including payroll. Such a
system would involve several components: (i) a database (called e-CAF) with information on all public service employees
was created in 2007, based on the data from the 2007 census of civil servants; (ii) a human resources management system
(called e-SIP), which is in process of being developed; (iii) payroll system for calculating salary entitlements and issuing
payment requests (called e-folha), which remains to be developed; and, (iv) a facility for making salary payments, which
already exists within e-SISTAFE.

                                                              33
111. Improving the social security system. The government has undertaken a broad program to
strengthen the social security system in Mozambique. PRSC3 included triggers for PRSCs4 and 5,
according to which an actuarial study and investment strategy would be prepared for National Institute
of Social Security (INSS) (PRSC4 trigger) and implemented (PRSC5 trigger). The expected outcomes,
as specified in PRSC3, were that (i) the pension system would be on a sounder footing due to the
implementation of the recommendations of the actuarial study and that (ii) the INSS would have a
defined investment strategy. The preparation of these reports was delayed by one year and completed in
early 2008 (originally a trigger for PRSC4, deferred to a PRSC5 prior action), and the implementation of
the recommendations of the reports (originally a trigger for PRSC5) was deferred to the following series.
The PRSC6, the first operation of the third PRSCs series, reports that the actuarial study revealed
significant data gaps at INSS: (i) records being kept in manual form, although an IT system was under
preparation; (ii) financial statements had not been published since 2004. The lack of reliable financial
data precluded an accurate financial situation of INSS, but it raised the possibility of that the system may
be financially unsustainable given the present level of contributions. Hence, the third PRSC series
envisages support to a comprehensive, structured set of interventions to improve the situation at the
INSS, which is the backbone of the pension system.

112. In the overall then the most positive development during the PRSC3 series was that a new law on
social security had been developed in 2007 during PRSC3 implementation, although this is only
mentioned in passing in the PRSC program document. All of the triggers initially set for PRSC4
(completion of study and preparation of investment strategy) and PRSC5 (implementation of strategy)
had to be deferred. The actuarial study was eventually completed prior to PRSC5, and showed that the
situation of the INSS was far worse than initially thought and that a new study would be needed to
properly assess the institution`s viability, once more reliable data had been developed. Moreover the
INSS investment strategy which was prepared in 2008 has not yet been approved for implementation.
Thus the end of series outcomes (pension system being on a sounder footing, INSS has a defined
investment strategy) were not attained. In retrospect, the objectives were excessively ambitious, and the
component ill prepared. There were major shortcomings relative to objectives, hence an outcome rating
of unsatisfactory.

113. Improving the business environment. The expected outcome in the area of business climate was
that the number of days to start a business would be reduced from 153 days in 2005 to no more than 30
days in 2009 (PRSC3 prior action). Information available shows that the 2009 target had already been
exceeded in 2008 and improved further in 2009, so that the PRSC outcome rating is highly satisfactory.
Nevertheless, the 2009 CEM highlights that the overall regulatory framework in Mozambique remains
very unfriendly to small and medium enterprises and that Mozambican firms continue to be subject to
excessive operational licensing, inspections (labor, health, environment), and red tape that constrains the
ease of doing business. The government approved a new strategy to improve the business climate in
early 2008. However, while some progress has been made in improving the business environment (and
Mozambique was among the top five reforming countries in SSA in the 2008 Doing Business report),
nevertheless the implementation of the strategy has been slow. For instance, while Mozambique`s
Cabinet has repeatedly stated the goal to be best among SADC countries in the Doing Business
indicators by 2015, Mozambique actually dropped one position in the DBI ranking amongst SADC
members from 2007 to 2009. This indicates that other countries have improved their business
environment faster than Mozambique. In this connection, it should be noted that the PAF indicator in
this area was changed, beginning in 2008, to the number of days for the completion of export and import
transactions. According to the JR for 2008, the targets for this indicator were not met (for exports the

                                                    34
average delay was 26 days; and for imports 32 days, in both cases well in excess of the target of 20
days). Also, as regards the cost of hiring and firing workers, Mozambique was expected to attain 80 th
position in the Doing Business Survey (DB) ranking, but in fact the actual ranking turned out to be 161st.
This suggests that the PRSC outcome rating, which is based on one indicator, may be excessively
generous. Indeed, it may be noted that the ISR for PRSC3 pointed to the weakness of performance in
this regard, bemoaning in particular the delays in restitution of the VAT, failure to advance with reform
of the labor code, etc.

114. It can also be noted that improving the business climate is a key component of the third PRSC
series, which has introduced a trigger for PRSC8, namely the approval by the Council of Ministers of a
legislative proposal to simplify all business related licenses and eliminate all unnecessary licenses. This
appropriately recognizes the fact that Mozambique has to address a number of constraints to improve the
business environment via a reduction in the complexity of the regulatory framework. In this area, the
government is planning to fast track a certain number of reforms, improving the procedures for private
sector firms in starting and running a business, trading across borders, registering property, dealing with
licenses, and closing a business, of which several have been implemented before the end of 2009 and the
remainder are envisaged for implementation before the end of 2010 (PRSC 6 Program Document, Box
6). In fact, this approach, which is akin to that taken with respect to procurement (multi-indicator action
plan on track) seems more appropriate as a means of tracking progress in such a diffuse area.

115. Improve conditions for road traffic. Infrastructure, notably roads, has been identified as one of
the top constraints to increased private sector activity in Mozambique. In the context of Mozambique,
where about 70 percent of the population still lives in rural areas, shared growth is necessarily linked to
rural development. With regard to improving road conditions, the objective was to improve the
percentage of roads in good and fair condition from 64 percent in 2006 to 73 percent by end 2009
(PRSC4 prior action and PRSC5 trigger, subsequently dropped). The target for 2007 was exceeded
while that for 2008 the annual target was missed by 3 percent (67 percent vs 70 percent), and for 2009 it
was missed by 2 percent (71 percent Vs 73 percent). This can be interpreted as a minor shortcoming
relative to the expected end-of-series development outcome, so that the outcome rating is satisfactory.

116. In terms of the factors which explain these developments, the PRSC4 and PRSC5 Program
Documents indicate that substantial progress has been made in the road sector since 2006. In order to
improve the quality of investments in the road sector, the Government has been reorganizing the
management and strategic priorities of the sector, with the adoption of the new Road Sector strategy
(RSS) for 2007-2011, and the finalization of the Integrated Strategy for the Road Sector (PRISE) which
is based on the RSS. In addition, in 2007 the Government also completed the restructuring of the Roads
Authority (http://www.ane.gov.mz ) which had started in 2006, including the recruitment of staff in
accordance with the new organic structure of the Roads Authority (including the appointment of the
Director General, four Department Directors, and ten provincial managers).

117. The PRISE foresees a common approach to the planning and reporting of all activities in the
roads sector, and it requires donors to focus their funding on projects that are part of the sector program.
Attention in the PRISE is also drawn to the need for the government to provide counterpart funds (a
weakness also raised by the energy sector team within the Bank during the ROC on PRSC3) and speedy
refund of the VAT, and to proceed apace with the institutional reforms which are necessary for further
progress in this sector. The G19 Joint Reviews for 2007 and 2008 add that there has been relatively good
performance with respect to bridge construction and rehabilitation, but regrets the slow pace of

                                                    35
launching major rehabilitation works. Looking forward, this subject has been dropped from the next
PRSC series, and indeed it was decided to drop the roads trigger from PRSC5 both to reduce the total
number of prior actions and also because this PAF indicator was formulated as an outcome indicator
related to physical investments in roads quality, and thus not in compliance with OP 8.60 which calls for
prior actions and triggers to take the form of institutional or policy actions.

118. Promote the construction and rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure. In order to maintain
the pace of agricultural growth it will be necessary to enhance productivity, and therefore, it is critical
that the government supports the development and expansion of irrigation and of extension services. It
was foreseen that the second PRSC series would support an increase in the acreage of irrigation
perimeters that would be rehabilitated and put under the management of beneficiaries. Targets were set
in the form of triggers for PRSC4 and PRSC5, with an end of series outcome of 13,600 hectares being
so rehabilitated and transferred between 2006 and the end 2009. However, there was systematic
underperformance from the start. The PRSC4 target was initially set at 3200 hectares in 2006, but this
had to be reduced by about 22 percent to 2500 hectares when it became clear that the original target
could not be met. While performance improved to 3500 hectares in 2007, this still represented a
shortfall, albeit moderate, of 12.5 percent relative to target of 4000 hectares. In 2008 performance
deteriorated sharply to 1778 hectares, which is a 40 percent and major shortfall relative to the annual
target. Similarly in 2009 performance was 2062 hectares compared to a target of 3000 hectares. The
overall performance for 2006-2009, gives a total of 9840 hectares, which represents a significant
shortfall (28%) relative to the target of 13,600 hectares and, accordingly the outcome is assessed as
moderately unsatisfactory. It should be noted, however, that the PRSC5 trigger was dropped due to the
need to reduce the total number of prior actions for PRSC5, and also on the grounds of its
incompatibility with OP 8.60 (as in the case of roads).

119. PRSC4 and PRSC5 attributed the lower than anticipated progress to several constraints, namely
(i) the administrative delays in processing these projects, partly due to their complexity; (ii) the lack of
quality control services for the construction of the irrigation works; and (iii) the high unit costs for the
construction and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. But efforts to tackle these problems do not
seem to have worked well given that performance worsened in 2008 relative to 2007 and indeed 2006.
This suggests that it was premature to include these targets in the PRSC3 series, and that its inclusion
was a design weakness. Indeed it is striking that neither PRSC4 nor PRSC5 included institutional and/or
policy measures of a corrective and binding nature to try and rectify the situation. This reflects the fact
that the introduction of such measures would have been difficult given that such measures would have
been outside the PAF and thus not normally allowable under the terms of the MOU. The only recourse
of the PRSC team was to elevate the issue to the highest levels of Government (PRSC5 Program
Document, paragraph 80).

120. Increase access to agricultural technologies and extension services. To increase the reach of the
extension services the government in 2007 the government prepared and approved a new extension
services strategy aimed at further strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of public extension
services. As part of the strategy, the government also aimed to significantly extend the scope of the
agricultural extension services (Prior Action for PRSC4 and PRSC5). The expected outcome was that
411,000 farmers would be benefitting from extension services in 2009 as compared to 193,500 in




                                                    36
2006.11 A PRSC5 trigger set a target of 222,300 for 2007, the same level being maintained for 2008,
and increasing to 411,000 in 2009. Outcomes have exceeded targets by 28 percent in 2007 and 59
percent in 2008 (354,000 in number), but the 2009 target was missed as the total reached was 365,000
which was only 88% of the target. In terms of the PRSC there were no shortcomings, given that
outcomes through the end of 2008 exceeded targets. More generally, while the 2009 target was missed
by 12%, the number of small-scale farmers assisted in 2009 corresponds to a 90 percent increase with
respect to the level in 2006. Correspondingly, the assessment of achievement of outcomes is highly
satisfactory. It would have been useful to include a more in-depth attempt in the PRSC documents to
establish the reasons for this very good performance, and draw lessons from it. The same is true for the
JRs for 2008 and 2009.

121. Increased response to higher food prices. The Government`s policy response to the higher food
and fuel prices in 2008 focused on promoting economic growth, and agricultural production in
particular, as the best means to achieve poverty alleviation, while also taking action to protect the
vulnerable population from the impact of the price shocks. Hence the Government opted for a
sustainable response that builds on the agricultural potential of Mozambique (being a fertile land
abundant country), that is to help increase agriculture production in the short and medium term starting
from the 2008/09 production season. In this context, in June 2008 the Government approved the Action
Plan to Increase Food Production (Plano de Acção Para a Produção de Alimentos), which articulates an
aggressive push to increase agricultural production over the 3-year period 2008-2011, and is intended to
reduce Mozambique`s future vulnerability to increases in food prices.

122. This policy response was introduced into the PRSC series in 2008 and led to the specification of
(i) a prior action for PRSC5 calling for an increase in the budget for the agriculture; (ii) targets for
2008/09 and 2009/10 agricultural seasons pertaining to increases in: (a) the production of certified maize
and rice seeds; and, (b) the area under cultivation for the same crops. The trigger and the targets are
drawn from the Government`s June 2008 Food Production Action Plan, and not from the PAF. Their
inclusion into the PRSC was at the request of the authorities notwithstanding the fact they are not in the
PAF. At the present point of time, no evidence is available as to whether the targets for 2008 and 2009
have been attained. Meaningful rating of performance with respect to these targets is thus not possible.
However, the PRSC6 Program Document reports that the government skillfully managed the response to
the 2008 crisis by (i) focusing on promoting agricultural production, while (ii) also protecting the
vulnerable population, including through a temporary scaling up of social protection measures, and
measures to support the productive sectors of the economy. In order to finance the measures, the
government realized expenditure savings from non-release of 10 percent of the budget for recurrent
expenditures in selected programs and the domestically financed investment expenditures, while
protecting expenditures in PARPA priority sectors and programs.

123. Link between PRSCs and development outcomes. While there is no direct discussion in the
Program Documents pertaining to the impact between PRSC triggers and the Project Development
Outcomes for the PRSC series, in most cases the prior actions already constitute intermediate outcomes
towards the development objectives, and therefore the links between the PRSC triggers and the
development outcomes is strong. In a few cases, however, the links between the triggers and the

11
  There was a change of the indicator used in the PRSC-4 and the PRSC-5: the percentage of farmers assisted by extension
services that adopted at least one new technology (trigger in PRSC-4) can only be measured every three years; the number of
farmers assisted by public extension services (trigger in PRSC-5) can be measured every year.

                                                            37
development outcomes are not as strong, such as for instance regarding the PAF/PRSC indicator used
for the business environment. Overall, there seems to be agreement that the PARPA/PAF/PRSC
triggers, together with the analytical work and capacity building efforts in support of the PRSCs and the
PARPA has had a general influence in certain areas, particularly with respect to e-SISTAFE and
procurement reforms, and the management of civil service human resources. This is true not only for
Bank financed work but also for the work undertaken jointly with other donors. It corresponds to the
reality that GBS is a package of three elements: (i) dialogue; (ii) specifically funded capacity building;
and (iii) financial support to the budget.

3.3         Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs):

Rating: Satisfactory

124. Overall outcome ratings for the series as a whole are expected to reflect the ratings for relevance
of design and outcomes. The table below (Table 9) combines this information using the annual outcome
ratings for PRSC3, 4 and 5, as well as the end of series outcomes for the assessment of overall
outcomes. In each case both the design and supervision are rated satisfactory, leading to the conclusion
that the operations were satisfactory, overall.

3.4    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

125. Evidence on monetary poverty shows a sharp improvement between 1997 and 2003, but no
evidence is available since then. A Poverty Perception Survey for 2006 indicates that a majority of
people felt that poverty had stagnated or worsened over the period 2001-2006, both in rural and urban
areas. The 2007 Poverty Gender and Social Assessment suggests that poverty and inequality may
actually have increased in recent years, based on the analysis of the agricultural panel survey data (TIA
2002-2005), but highlights that this preliminary result may also be related to the impact of the drought in
2005. If confirmed, these results would indicate that the rapid GDP growth in recent years has been less
broadly shared than during the past decade. The recent dramatic spike in world agricultural and fuel
prices may also have contributed to set back at least some of the gains achieved during the past decade.
Data collection for the new national household survey was completed in September 2009 and the main
results are expected by mid-2010, and will clarify whether poverty has continued to decrease. At the
same time, evidence on non-monetary poverty suggests significant improvements with respect to health,
education, as well as access to water and sanitation between 2000-03 and 2006-08 (Table 10).

126. Mozambique has made substantial progress towards achieving some of the MDG goals and in
particular has a reasonable chance of those pertaining to (i) a reduction in the share of the population
living in absolute poverty (MDG1); (ii) the achievement of universal primary education (MDG2); and
(iii) sustainable access to potable water at least in urban areas (MDG7). However, there is little prospect
of attaining the goals relative to (i) reduction in child mortality (MDG4); (ii) reduction in maternal
mortality (MDG5); (iii) reduction in the incidence of malaria and HIV/AIDs (MDG7); and (iv)
improving access to water in rural areas (MDG7).

127. As indicated, it is impossible to assess whether there has been a reduction in poverty during the
first and second PRSC series. Furthermore, contrary to what might have been expected, the operations
have focused only on whether the target for the share of expenditure (65%) going to priority` sectors
has been respected without any examination as to the pro-poor structure of public expenditure. While
efforts have been made to introduce a functional budget classifications of expenditure (which would
permit analysis of the pro poor structure of expenditure), this is still not adequately used. The most that
can be said is that PRSCs may have contributed to improved social outcomes to the extent that they have
contributed to the growth of expenditures going to priority sectors, and that this increased level of
expenditure is responsible, at least in part, for the improved social outcomes alluded to above.

128. An additional issue is that the PRSCs 3-5 did not focus on improving the poverty monitoring and
evaluation framework and increasing the role of civil society organizations in this regard even though (i)
this was a specific goal under PRSC1; and (ii) there is a related PAF indicator which could have been
used in the PRSCs or at least alluded to in PRSC documentation.

129. The 2007 Poverty Gender and Social Assessment (PGSA) offers an interesting perspective in
these areas, suggesting that, notwithstanding an effective increase in access to public services (in fact
since before the advent of the PRSCs), much more needs to be done. In particular, not enough is being
done to expand public services that directly increase the income of the poor (PGSA, page 23).
Wealthier households currently receive a much higher share of the budget because of their better
physical access to and use of public services. Accordingly, the government should ensure that larger
share of the budget and effective public spending should go to the poor and vulnerable, and their quality

                                                              39
be improved. The PGSA also recommends that there should be more regular household surveys, and
public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS). Yet the PRSCs have not monitored the PETS even though
there is already such an indicator in the PAF which has not been well respected (see JR 2008 and 2009).
Furthermore, the State needs to get closer to the poor through: (i) the provision of better access to the
judiciary, including reduction of corruption therein; (ii) making increasing use of Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) as a means of overseeing of public service provision; (iii) making decentralization
work for the poor through effective transfer of more resources to and control thereof by districts and
municipalities; and (iv) making poor peoples` land rights real. Yet, PRSCs backed away from the justice
sector and decentralization (delays in the trigger pertaining to the decentralization strategy in PRSCs4-5
and exclusion from the third PRSC series, on the grounds that it is too sensitive in terms of political
economy). On the other hand, the third series does include a trigger (PRSC 8) pertaining to the
implementation of a reform of land taxation.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
capacity and institutional development):

130. There has been substantial institutional development under PRSCs3-5, especially in the area of
Public Financial Management and Civil Service Reform. These developments appear sustainable all the
more that they appear to be enabling the government to manage financial and human resources more
effectively in general and to be providing benefits in the form of more efficient resource use, the
identification of budgetary savings (travel, etc) and lower corruption. These savings helped financed the
increase in subsidies to vulnerable groups during the food and oil price crises of 2008-2009.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

131. PRSCs3-5 have pointed to some limitations of the PARPA, the PAF and the MOU governing
donor coordination. In particular the PARPA and the subsequent PAFs were designed in 2005-2006. It
proved difficult to adjust the PAFs to effectively incorporate triggers pertaining to important issues that
emerged following the adoption of the PARPA, in particular (i) the very pressing ones which emerged
during the oil food and financial crises of 2007-2009; and (ii) the growth related ones identified in the
analytical work done over the period 2006-2008. This culminated in PRSC5 when the Bank was forced
to insist on the introduction of a new non-PAF trigger to reflect the government response to the food and
fuel crisis, notwithstanding the reticence of some other signatories to the MOU. At the same time, the
staff consider that the very large number of working groups (71 in all, of which 29 core ones)
complicate the policy dialogue the quality of which can even be eroded. The result is an unfortunate
tendency for issues which are demanding in terms of political economy to be addressed outside of the
PAF or be dealt with by non-PAF signatories.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate for all three operations.

                           Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
                       PRSC3                 PRSC4                PRSC5
                       Moderate             Moderate              Moderate

133. The risks to development outcomes are rated as moderate for all three operations given that they
all had the same end of series objectives. The ultimate goal of the PRSCs was to spur reduction of
poverty at the national and sub-national levels, although the contribution of the PRSCs was indirect
coming through (i) an increase in the level of poverty related expenditures; (ii) an improvement in public
financial management; and (iii) an improvement in the environment for economic development. The
keys to this were and remain: (i) the maintenance of adequate fiscal space to accommodate the growing
needs of the population; (ii) efficient utilization of these resources to increase access to and use by the
poor of public services by the poor and vulnerable.

134. The Program Documents systematically set forth four categories of risks: (i) macroeconomic
instability resulting from external/exogenous economic or non-economic shocks terms of trade
variations, lack of rainfall or floods, regional instability, or lack of predictability of donor disbursements,
or from (ii) internal/endogenous pressures to increase expenditures at electoral periods or inability to
maintain the level of priority expenditures, especially those of a pro-poor nature; (iii) lack of capacity to
implement reforms; and (iv) deterioration in governance that could compromise economic reforms
and/or poverty reduction efforts, as well as their external financing.

135. On the first category of risks, macroeconomic management over the last decade indicates that the
government has been able to handle these risks well, albeit with assistance from the IMF, the Bank and
other donors, as the handling of the recent oil and food price spikes shows. There is no reason to
suppose that this will change in the future, providing donor assistance remains as forthcoming as in the
past. There is however a risk that this may not be the case either because of a general shortage of funds
pursuant to the financial crisis or because of donor disinclination to continue support at present levels
because of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform and/or a deterioration in overall governance. This risk
should be considered as moderate given that the G19 aide memoires of 2008 and 2009 consider that
performance with respect to improving governance, except for PFM, has been lagging over the last few
years.

136. With respect to internal shocks, particularly those of a fiscal nature, experience over the last few
years indicates that the government has done a good job in terms not only of overall expenditure control
in macroeconomic terms but also the distribution of expenditure between prior and non-priority sectors,
with the level of expenditures in favor of priority sectors rarely falling significantly below the agreed 65
percent. But again, this has depended on adequate availability of fiscal resources including external
assistance from donors. The ability of government to manage in a world of reduced resource
availabilities has yet to be seriously tested.

137. With respect to weak administrative capacity, the government and the donors have been working
assiduously over the last few years to build capacity in the different areas of the reform program, and
these efforts will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, IDA in particular is supporting the

                                                      41
second phase of the government`s public sector reform efforts. Furthermore to strengthen capacity at
the local level, the government has finalized its program for capacity building at the local level, and
donors have recently agreed with government on a common fund to support the implementation of this
national decentralized planning and finance capacity building program.

138. On the issue of governance, it has to be noted that improving governance is at the heart of the
PFM reform program, procurement and improved HR management, all of which have now been
functioning increasingly satisfactorily for several years, and there seems no reason to assume that this
will change in the foreseeable future. Also there has been progress towards improving management of
natural resources, with the country having been accepted as a candidate to join the EITI initiative. The
G19 Joint Reviews for 2008 and 2009 have pointed to the need to also improve governance in other
areas (such as anti-corruption, mega projects, elimination of conflict of interest for civil servants) and to
accelerate reforms on the legal and judicial fronts. Slow progress in these areas may lead to lower donor
assistance in future years (as already happened in 2008/2009 on the part of the Swiss and Swedish
Governments, who reduced disbursements under the variable tranches of their GBS because of concerns
about limited progress in the governance reforms).

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)        Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: PRSC3 ­Satisfactory; PRSC4 Satisfactory; PRSC5 Satisfactory

                                          Assessment of Design
                     PRSC3                        PRSC4                        PRSC5
                   Satisfactory                 Satisfactory                 Satisfactory

139. PRSC3. Design was satisfactory to the extent that it was aligned with the PARPA, the Bank CAS
and lessons from the preceding series. At the same time, PRSC3 had some minor design weaknesses
which have been already been alluded to. These issues did not affect significantly the performance of
the series as a whole, hence the satisfactory rating. However, the design of PRSC3 could have paid more
attention to the structure of pro-poor expenditure or on the traceability of expenditures in key sectors.
While this was difficult because of the lack of related triggers in the PAF for pro-poor expenditure and
the lack of a corresponding budget classification, attention was drawn to these challenges in the policy
dialogue with Government and support provided to rectify the weaknesses (as discussed in the Program
Document for PRSC5). Also, the timing envisaged for the decentralization triggers (the NDFDP study,
and the preparation of the decentralization strategy) turned out to be excessively optimistic. This is
particularly unfortunate given the importance of this to the implementation of the PARPA. The risk of
serious delay could have been better identified, as well as mitigating measures, during preparation of
PRSC3. The same issues pertain to the design of the economic development pillar, where delays were
incurred with respect to the INSS studies and there were significant shortfalls with respect to irrigation
targets in particular. All of this indicates that these components had not been adequately prepared.
Finally, the treatment of improving efficiency and celerity of justice services was not adequately


                                                     42
designed, leaving the impression that this component was not very important (in which case it would
have been best not to include it at all).

140. PRSC4. Although four triggers had to be modified because they could not be met as originally
specified in PRSC3, the preparation of PRSC4 was satisfactory, essentially because it took an active
stance towards treating the above mentioned design issues for the rest of the series.

141. PRSC5. The preparation of PRSC5 is rated satisfactory, as only one trigger had to be modified,
a minor shortcoming. Further, the proactive introduction of a new component addressing the food crisis
should be commended. In this regard, PRSC5 benefitted from the quality of supervision of PRSC4,
when Bank proactively reacted to the food price crisis and designed a new component for PRSC5 to
specifically address this issue (PRSC5 Program Document, paras 18-22).

(b)        Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

142. In general design and supervision are closely linked for PRSCs, to the extent that the supervision
of operation n occurs side by side with the preparation of n+1. In this connection, the institutional
arrangements for supervision of the PRSCs were part and parcel of the overall G19 procedures as set
forth in the MOU governing GBS operations. The G19 review process is continuous with two main
reviews per year, April and September. The April review looks at performance in the preceding year,
while the September one reviews performance during the current year and prepares the program for the
following year. There are 29 joint donor-government working groups, most of which also meet on a
monthly basis. To ensure full and regular participation, the PRSC TTL and other core specialists are
based in Maputo. Supplemental missions are undertaken as necessary. The Bank also participates
regularly in IMF program review and technical assistance missions.

143. PRSC3. The quality of supervision of PRSC3 was satisfactory, although a more active stance
could have been taken towards treating the above mentioned design issues and help the government to
meet the targets as originally defined.

144. PRSC4. The evidence from the PRSC5 Program Document indicates that the quality of
supervision of PRSC4 was satisfactory in general and that it proactively sought to identify the issues
needing to be addressed in each the areas supported by the PRSC series and a timetable for them. The
program documents could have provided more detailed analysis of the reasons for these shortcomings
and of the corrective measures to minimize risks to development outcomes and sustainability in related
development outcomes, however. These may be considered as minor shortcomings, and so a rating of
satisfactory is proposed for government performance. The quality of supervision of PRSC4 was also
very good in that it proactively helped the government to design a strategy and action plan to effectively
combat the potentially negative effects of the food and oil price crisis on fiscal sustainability, social
stability, and the structure of priority expenditure (PRSC5 Program Document, Section D, paras 18-24).

                                                   43
In this regard, the Bank convinced donors and government, notwithstanding their initial reservations, of
the need to introduce a new non-PAF trigger for PRSC5.

145. PRSC5. The evidence from the PRSC6 Program Document indicates that the quality of
supervision of PRSC5 continued to be satisfactory in general and that it also continued to proactively (i)
identify the issues needing to be addressed in each of the areas supported by the third PRSC series and a
timetable for them; and (ii) assist the authorities in the elaboration of their response to the international
financial crisis of 2009. Hence it is rated satisfactory.

(c)        Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Ratings: PRSC3 Satisfactory; PRSC4 Satisfactory; PRSC5 Satisfactory

146. According to ICR Guidelines, the overall ratings are dictated by the combination of ratings for
Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision. A combination of moderately satisfactory rating and a
satisfactory or highly satisfactory implies a combined rating of moderately satisfactory. Overall
satisfactory performance requires that both quality at entry and quality of supervision be satisfactory.
The following Table summarizes the ratings for all operations, one by one and for the series as a whole.

            Overall Performance        Satisfactory Satisfactory Satisfactory Satisfactory


147. There are two lessons for assuring quality of entry and supervision. First, good preparation of
the first PRSC of a series, and realistic assessment of implementation speed, is very important to the
implementation and outcome of the series as a whole. A further lesson is that the PAF, as originally
designed, can quickly become obsolete and rigid. These two facts can be a real constraint to the
effective incorporation of appropriate triggers to addressing problems not identified in the original PAF.
These issues were effectively and proactively addressed/resolved during the preparation and supervision
of PRSC4 and PRSC5.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

Rating: Not rated, because government and implementing agency are indistinguishable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:


                                                     44
Rating: Satisfactory

148. Government ownership and commitment to achieving development objectives. The good
implementation of the program supported by the PRSC reflects strong ownership and commitment by
the government to the reforms. This performance results from the fact that the PARPA is the
government`s strategy and that the PAF indicators (and PRSC prior actions) are drawn from the PARPA
strategic matrix. The overall amount of progress made, especially with regards to the PFM reforms is
impressive, and underscores a significant commitment to advance the reforms. While a few areas have
suffered delays, it can be argued that these are complex policy areas, such as decentralization and the
social security system, which entail complex political economy realities. Nevertheless, even in these
areas, the commitment to the reforms is underscored by the fact that there have been no reversals.
Hence, Government performance could be considered as highly satisfactory, if it were not for a few
reform areas where progress has been slower and commitment has not been as determined. For this
reason, a rating of satisfactory is proposed.

149. Enabling environment. This was also satisfactory. The political situation was stable at the
beginning at the beginning of the series, and remained so throughout. The social unrest that emerged in
the wake of the food and oil price hikes in early 2008 was well handled. Performance with respect to the
IMF programs was satisfactory. Relations with other donors remained broadly satisfactory throughout
the period.

150. Readiness for implementation. Government performance has been characterized by sound
macroeconomic management (including the handling of the high food/fuel prices in 2008 and the
financial crises in 2009) and reasonably good progress in implementing the PRSC reforms agenda in all
its components. Good macroeconomic management is reflected in the fact that all reviews of the PRGF
and the PSI were satisfactorily concluded (although some waivers were required), and that
macroeconomic performance continued to be strong during the period (in spite of the external
shocks/crises). The overall rate of on time completion of PRSC triggers was 80 percent ­ but this
reflects a rate of 94 percent for Macro/PFM triggers, 71 percent for governance and 57 percent in the
area of economic development. This is a very good performance, especially when considering that the
Macro/PFM pillar was by far the most important both in terms of the strategic focus of the series and
also in terms of the much larger number of triggers. It should also be mentioned that the macro/PFM
pillar included a significant component of PFM reforms, which can also be considered to be part of the
broader governance agenda. While a few areas have suffered delays, the overall amount of progress
made, especially with regards to the PFM reforms is impressive. Hence, Government performance
could be considered as highly satisfactory, if it were not for a few reform areas where implementation
has been slow. The shortcomings in implementation performance, suggest that certain aspects of the
program were not entirely ready for implementation. It is clear that the PFM component of the PRSCs
was ready for implementation. However, this was not the case for the decentralization strategy and the
reforms pertaining to INSS. The overall satisfactory performance in implementing the PRSC program
has been mirrored by substantial progress towards implementing its PARPA II. Overall performance
with respect to the PAF indicators was judged by the G19 to be satisfactory for the continuation of GBS,
notwithstanding mixed performance in some areas. In fact, as in the case of the PRSC, the full success
rate was significantly lower for governance and economic development than for the macro/PFM
component of the PAF (Table 8). On balance, performance with respect to implementation can be
considered satisfactory.


                                                  45
151. Fiduciary arrangements. Performance in this regard can be considered satisfactory to the extent
that the government has paid considerable attention to improving PFM arrangements, and that these are
considered adequate by donors to support budget support operations. The reforms appear sustainable
and risks to development outcomes low.

152. Consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries. A specific process for consultations with
potential stakeholders and beneficiaries was not put in place for the PRSCs. This is not necessary given
that the triggers and policy measures are in principle all drawn from the PAF which is itself part of the
Strategic Matrix of PARPA II, which was prepared by government through broad-based participatory
consultations with major stakeholders and civil society. In addition, PRSCs are regularly discussed in
the working groups of the G19. This can be complemented by specific consultations, as needed, with
stakeholders affected by the PRSC in question. Similarly monitoring of implementation is open to
participation of the public and representatives of Civil Society Organizations, created in 2003, through
the work of the Development Observatories and their participation in the two annual G19 reviews.
Notwithstanding the weakness of the consultation arrangement with civil society, Government
performance in this regard is satisfactory.

153. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. The overall availability of data on the indicators and the
PAF triggers is good, and allows the monitoring of progress with the reforms program on an annual
basis. However, as indicated earlier, the M&E system is in need of substantial strengthening.
Moreover, the government has paid insufficient attention to the establishment of mechanisms for
monitoring whether public expenditure is pro-poor, and whether resources are effectively transferred in
full and a timely manner to service delivery units. Rating is moderately satisfactory.

154. The overall rating is satisfactory given: (i) a good performance with respect to triggers for
PRSCs3-5 and the PAF; (ii) the basic but functional monitoring and evaluation systems which has
allowed annual monitoring of progress with the implementation of PARPA reforms program and the
PAF and PRSC indicators. Nevertheless, there are three areas where Mozambican performance could
focus its improvement efforts: (i) governance, particularly as regards the capacity to implement reforms
and implement decentralization; (ii) public service delivery; and (iii) structural reforms at the sectoral
level, notably in agriculture. Improvements in these areas are essential for sustainable improvements in
service delivery. In a nutshell, service delivery requires more than just transferring financial resources
to service delivery units. Financial resources must be properly used by competent, well-trained
professional staff, and these seem to be in short supply. The civil service reforms component of the
PRSCs is aiming to address some of the root causes of these shortcomings

6. Lessons Learned

155. Key lessons pertain to: (i) importance of Government ownership, taking the time to nurture it,
through dialogue an analysis of the political economy of reforms; (ii) working together with the rest of
the donor community through the G19 is helpful, notwithstanding the difficulties and tensions resulting
there from; (iii) the PAF, as currently used, is too rigid to permit rapid and flexible response to emerging
issues; (iv) the political economy of sensitive reforms needs to be well understood; and (v) coordinated
capacity building is essential.

156. The PRSC series achieved its main objectives due to strong ownership of the reform program by
the government, which is based on PARPA II, the PES and the BdPES. As a result, notwithstanding

                                                    46
some implementation delays and weaknesses in the area of governance and structural reforms, the
medium term reform strategies never suffered reversals. For example, following initial delays in
implementing the ambitious new electronic integrated financial management system (e-SISTAFE) in
2004 and 2005, the progress since then has more than compensated the delays. The transition to the new
system has proceeded smoothly and with good results. Similarly, the first phase of the civil
service/public sector reform produced limited results, but after a thorough external review and extensive
internal consultations, a new strategy has been developed for the second phase that is fully owned by the
government and which has started its implementation with renewed dynamism. A third example is
decentralization, which was deferred during Series II and is not being addressed in the third series
because more preparatory work is clearly needed. The same political economy approach is being
pursued with respect to land taxation. It is important to give the authorities the time and the space to
prepare credible and sustainable reforms in sensitive areas.

157. Working together with the rest of the multilateral and bilateral donor community through the
G19 is helpful, notwithstanding the inherent difficulties and tensions resulting there from and in
particular the rigidity of the PAF. There has been a positive impact from the highly harmonized policy
dialogue across donors providing budget support. The MoU of the G19 aligns general budget support
with the Mozambican budget cycle, improves the predictability of resource flows, and harmonizes the
donors regarding policy benchmarks, the reporting and review process. It is a powerful instrument to
improve the quality of budget planning and execution and enhance the effectiveness of aid. Largely as a
result of donor harmonization, some reforms that had long been advocated, e.g. increasing budget
coverage for externally financed projects and own revenues, have been implemented.

158. However the PAF, as currently designed and used by the G19, is excessively rigid needs to
become more flexible and quickly adaptable to (i) changing government priorities and programs; and
(ii) external shocks unforeseen when the PAF was originally designed at the time of the preparation of
PARPA II in 2005/2006. The difficulties of introducing a non-PAF trigger into PRSC5 in the wake of
the 2008/2009 food and oil prices shocks are examples thereof. Looking forward, it would be important
to continue using the PAF, as derived from the PARPA, its sector strategies and monitoring frameworks,
as the core policy matrix given that PAF can act as a safeguard against the introduction of purely
opportunistic conditionalities on the part of one or more donors. Yet a means must be found to make it
more easily adaptable during the PRSP implementation period, in light of changing circumstances and
priorities. In this regard, looking forward, it could be appropriate to give more attention to the fact that
the PARPA is an instrument which has been designed to complement the implementation of the
Government`s Five Year Plan (FYP). The key instruments for implementation thereof are the PES and
the BdPES, which must be presented to Parliament, and greater use thereof could facilitate revision of
the PAF during PARPA implementation given that the PAF is common not only to the PARPA but also
the PES and BdPES.

159. Progress has been slower in reform areas where the political economy context was critical, yet
not adequately understood. In terms of the reform areas supported by the past PRSC series, progress has
been slower in areas such as decentralization and public sector reforms, where the political economy
realities appears to have been little understood and underestimated. Reforms in the area of PFM (that in
other countries have proved to be just as difficult to implement as those related to governance and public
sector reforms) have fared much better reflecting very strong commitment by the Minister of Finance
and the entire Cabinet.


                                                    47
160. Reform programs should be accompanied by jointly financed capacity building efforts. Capacity
building is essential, but in the past has often been uncoordinated, reflecting the priorities of individual
donors. This has changed in the past few years, and multi-donor sector wide approaches have now been
developed and common funds established and has show positive results in terms of results on the ground
(e.g., the common fund for public financial management reforms, the multi-donor Financial Sector
Technical Assistance Project). It would be desirable to pursue the same approach in the area of the
business environment, but there is as yet no common fund or sector wide approach, even though donor
efforts are being coordinated.

     JOINT COMMENTS FROM THE ECONOMISTS OF THE G19 PROGRAMME AID
                           PARTNERS (PAPs) *

 Implementation Completion and Results Report on the Poverty Reduction Support Credits 3-5


   1. We appreciate the opportunity to share the results analysis of the three PRSC operations, which
      by and large has been a common budget support operation with all G19 partners in Mozambique.
      When possible, the time given for partners to participate and consolidate comments to these
      types of assessments should for future processes be extended. Nevertheless, we agree with the
      overall assessment made by the Bank that the overall performance of the PRSC series has been
      satisfactory. We further note in the Banks` PRSC VI document where it is cited:

      "The positive results of the PRSC series can be attributed to two main factors. Firstly, the
      strong Government ownership of the program supported by the PRSC, which is directly drawn
      from the PRSP. Secondly the positive impact of the highly harmonized policy dialogue across
      donors providing budget support to the Government of Mozambique, which has streamlined
      the donor dialogue with Government."

   2. We welcome the continued engagement of the Bank within the harmonised framework of the
      G19. Reflecting this, the Bank has been a key partner within the system since 2004 and signed
      the new MOU on GBS in 2009, clearly agreeing and endorsing the common approach to GBS.
      Throughout the PRSC series the Bank has held a permanent seat in the Troika+ helping to
      coordinate the G19 structure and in a prime/unique position to influence the process from within
      and propose any reforms to it.

   3. We would like to underline that the PAF as much as the triggers selected for the PRSC series
      have been a flexible tool to monitor the implementation of the Poverty reduction Strategy. Our
      own analysis shows that in 2006-2008 over 43 changes were introduced. We would also like to
      note that there are no restrictions on the use policy actions within the PAF and it is not restricted
      to output and outcome indicators.

   4. We are therefore concerned that the Bank chooses to focus on the inflexibility of the PAF. The
      Bank may in some instances have failed, as in other countries, to engage early enough in the
      indicator setting process and an active participation in sector working groups which would have
      allowed for high quality indicators reflecting emerging concerns together with stronger
      government ownership in a harmonized approach.

   5. There has been a positive tendency over the series of PRSC operations to further delink the
      PAF/PRSC targets from specific on-going bank or other partner`s operations with recognition
      that the PRSC series is more of a process than outcomes from specific Bank operations. This
      tendency has also enhanced the space for coordinated approaches within sectors. We also note
      that many of the successful reform programmes identified (e.g. SISTAFE reform and Tribunal
      Administrativo) have been supported by joint capacity building programmes with a high degree

                                                    59
       of ownership and flexibility and less of rigid operations.

   6. We agree with the observation that efficiency of the working groups can be further improved,
      which is why the G19 has put together a series of proposals not only to reduce the number of
      working groups but also to streamline and prioritise the dialogue with government. It is our wish
      that the Bank will continue to participate actively in that endeavour.

   7. Donors feel that progress in key areas of political and economic governance is not simply due to
      a lack of understanding of the political context. Donors have been well aware of the ongoing
      trends in the area of political and economic governance. In fact, lack of tangible progress in the
      broader governance area, in particular, the legal and judiciary reform, the fight against corruption
      and slowness in reforming the business environment have been in the last three to four annual
      reviews, as issues for special attention and focus.

   8. The conclusion that certain reforms need deeper understanding of the political economy for
      change is certainly true and investments in further analytical work by the Bank and other
      partners jointly should be done to achieve results in some of the less successful reform areas.

   9. This is also why we previously have expressed some concerns, that leaving some of the less
      successful (public sector) reform areas from the PRSC 3-5 behind in the new PRSC operation
      may neglect the fact that progress in the broader governance area remain one of the most critical
      challenges for the country and risks the sustainability of any progress on economic development.
      PFM reform is one area where we welcome the Bank to become an even more visible partner
      within PFM-reforms, while recognizing the valuable contributions made by systematically
      sharing analytical studies and mission reports with the wider donor group.

 Date achieved
                                Comments     Progress to date has been satisfactory, as evidenced by the satisfactory completion of (i) all IMF PRGF (2007) and PSI (2008, 2009)
                   (incl. % achievement)     reviews; and (ii) Joint Donor Reviews for 2007 and 2008, completed in April 2008 and April 2009 respectively. All 16 prior actions
                                             were met on time, but one of them ­ pertaining to the share of the budget being audited by the Court of Accounts was modified
                                             downwards. There have been notable improvements in revenue generation and administration, expenditure management,
                                             procurement, internal controls and external audits. Performance with respect to intermediate outcome indicators has generally been
                                             highly satisfactory (only satisfactory for internal control units). Overall performance in this component has been highly satisfactory
 2. Strengthen reforms in governance by      As the PRSC consists of a series of annual operations, no specific values were defined at this level. Only intermediate indicators in
 (a) supporting decentralization to          the form of prior actions and triggers were defined (see below)

 delivery at the provincial and district
 level; and (b) supporting public sector
 reform

                           Date achieved
                              Comments       Five out of seven triggers were met on time and without modification. Those missed pertained to the National Program of
                   (incl. % achievement)     Decentralized Planning and Finance Program (NPDPF) and decentralization. Decentralization is gradually proceeding, districts
                                             were receiving increased revenues, above target, hence highly satisfactory performance. However, there was a one year delay in the
                                             preparation of the NPDPF which was finalized in September 2008, hence performance is rated satisfactory. The finalization of the
                                             decentralization strategy was delayed by three years to 2010, such that performance has been rated unsatisfactory. On balance,
                                             performance for the decentralization reforms can be considered moderately satisfactory.
                                             Civil Service reforms have progressed well. The Ministry of Civil Service was created in 2007, a Census was also done in 2007, and
                                             a single Personnel Registry in 2008. New medium term wage policy was designed and approved in 2008, implementation beginning

                                            in 2009. Performance satisfactory.
                                            Overall performance for this component is moderately satisfactory. It should be noted that the inclusion of justice sector reforms
                                            was considered as a possibility at the time of PRSC3 for later operations in the series and an indicative trigger on improving
                                            performance of the justice sector was envisaged for PRSC5 (in the PRSC3 Program Document); however justice reforms were not in
                                            fact included because it was later decided to narrow down the focus of the PRSC series, and the trigger was therefore dropped.

improving the investment climate,           the form of prior actions and triggers were defined (see below)

                                            but still small. Food price response is on track. Four out of seven triggers met on time w/o modification. Those delayed/missed
                                            pertained to INSS studies, and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. Overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Date achieved                         12/31/06                           12/31/2007                                                  12/31/2009
Comments (incl. % achievement)        The baseline value for 2006 was initially set at 65% in the PRSC3 PD, but then revised down (PRSC4 ISR). In 2007, the actual was 62
                                      percent, because delays in disbursements of donor funds led to under-pending on investment in priority sectors. Government has
                                      addressed issue with donors of how to avoid such issues in the future. The share rose to 64.5 percent in 2008, but then decreased back to
                                      62% in 2009. On basis of available information, there have been minor shortfalls compared to target, so performance is satisfactory (S).

Comments (incl. % achievement)        This measure was introduced as a trigger for PRSC5, according to which the aggregate budget allocation for priority sectors for the 2008

Comment                               This was originally a trigger for PRSC4, but was deferred to PRSC5, and met. Given the delay of one year in meeting the target,
                                      performance is rated moderately satisfactory (MS)

Comments                              This was originally a target for PRSC4, but could not be met. It was decided to defer it to the third PRSC series. Because of the three year
                                      delay in completion, performance is rated unsatisfactory (U)

Comment                               This indicator was initially included as part of the results framework (in PRSC3) as the program envisaged an indicative trigger in the
                                      justice sector for PRSC5. The latter was dropped, and this indicator was not monitored. Hence not included in rating calculations.

                                      Targets exceeded in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Given that targets were exceeded, rating is highly satisfactory (HS). In the PAF, this indicator
                                      has since been replaced by one pertaining to number of days to complete export and import transactions.

Comments                              These were both originally triggers for PRSC4, which were deferred to PRSC5. In the event, it turns out that the situation is worse than
                                      originally thought, so further work is required to put INSS on a sound financial footing. On basis of annual performance, implementation
                                      is moderately satisfactory (MS), but performance relative to expected outcome is unsatisfactory (U).

Comments                 Very good performance in 2007 and 2008, with targets being largely exceeded. Performance is thus highly satisfactory (HS). Performance
                         in 2009 was moderately satisfactory (shortfall of 11 percent). Overall performance however was highly satisfactory, since overall target
                         was exceeded.
                         Note also that there had been a PRSC4 trigger which called for 30 percent of farmers, assisted by extension services, to adopt one new
                         technology in 2006. The actual was 21 percent, and the trigger modified accordingly without deferral. No targets were set for 2007-2009
                         so the indicator was not modified. Hence it is not included in the Results Framework Analysis.
