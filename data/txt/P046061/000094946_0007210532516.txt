The test is conducted before the commencement of excavation. The Contractor involves Moscow Sanitary and Epidemiological Inspection Centre, which takes samples and analyses them in compliance with current
regulations. The parameters determined are radioactive contamination and concentration levels of heavy metals and petrochemicals. A report is issued by the Centre on the basis of the results of analysis which
indicates contamination found and the amount by which they exceed the MPC. The report is kept in the Contractor's office. Cost of test of soils of a confined area is about $300.
