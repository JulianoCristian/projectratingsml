Some lessons learned included:\n            experience under this project is a worthwhile contribution\n            to the long-standing debate on whether Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) should be set as separate units,\n            to maximize implementation efficiency, or within partner\n            institutions, to contribute to institution building. This\n            project opted for the former. The rationale for using the\n            Moscow foundation as a PIU was based on their excellent\n            performance under the Bridge Rehabilitation Project (then in\n            the final phase), and on the fact that the major agreed\n            investment under the new project was a large-scale bridge\n            complex. It will have been both risky and counter-productive\n            to give the inexperienced Traffic Management Center (TMC),\n            which had just been set up, the responsibility to manage the\n            implementation of a large-scale investment, especially since\n            this type of investment was not going to be within their\n            future purview. The project's main concern was to have\n            TMC with sufficient and properly qualified staff, the right\n            premises and equipment, authority and organization to carry\n            out a set of essential traffic management functions, and\n            entry into decision making processes of Moscow City\n            Government (MCG). Early missions noted that the agreed\n            staffing quotas were met by TMC, but not proper\n            qualifications and experience. Later missions focused on the\n            transfer of staff versed in traffic signal control from the\n            police to TMC, and much less on the matter of exact\n            qualifications for other traffic management activities. The\n            project certainly did well in this respect, especially\n            regarding the traffic police component, where the new skills\n            supplemented by modern equipment raised qualifications\n            relatively quickly. Still, much more intensive training and\n            of longer duration is needed to re-educate civil engineers\n            for careers in traffic management. For future projects that\n            focus on institution building of this type, it is\n            recommended to take the education and career aspects as\n            seriously as engineering, financial and economic aspects.\n            This will require enlarging the scope of preparation to\n            include national universities and technical colleges,\n            possibly resulting in project-funded support for an\n            expansion of the relevant course programs, within the same\n            or under a separate project."}, "docdt": "2009-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
