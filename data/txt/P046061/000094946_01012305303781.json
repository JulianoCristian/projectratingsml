The\n            components will: 1) finance the establishment of a traffic\n            management center (TMS), responsible for planning traffic\n            management schemes, including the operation of traffic\n            signals.

Upon approval, completion of detailed\n            engineering schemes along the above mentioned area, will be\n            financed; 4) widen the Donbasky Bridge, to accommodate an\n            eight lane roadway on either side of the bridge, and,\n            eliminate the existing tram track bridge; and, 5) conduct a\n            traffic enforcement program, ensuring adequate training to\n            staff, and implementation of operational plans to maximize\n            equipment, construction, and advisory investments."}, "docdt": "2001-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
