Contaminated\n            soils will be disposed of at approved sites, by specialized\n            agencies to recover, and dispose contaminated waste. Trees\n            and vegetation damaged as a result of road widening, will be\n            protected in accordance with regulations, and standards,\n            replaced, and/or replanted; 2) noise, and dust disturbance\n            should be abated by limiting working schedules, as\n            restricted by the project design, and, equipment should have\n            noise-suppression devices; 3) adversity on cultural heritage\n            sites will be avoided through careful project design, and,\n            protective archaeological measures will ensure those sites\n            thus far unknown; 4) alternative measures for safe traffic,\n            and accessibility will be provided, and enforced by city\n            officials, including promotion of public transit use; and,\n            5) in the case of land acquisition, adequate compensation\n            will be provided to landowners, in accordance with city\n            regulations, and World Bank guidelines."}, "docdt": "2000-06-01T11:19:01Z"}
