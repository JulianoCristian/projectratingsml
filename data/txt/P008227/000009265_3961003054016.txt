MEMORANDUM AND PECCMHKUDATION
Or THE PRESIDET
OF THE ZBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOA TO THE REFTJDLIC OF VENHZUELA
FOR AN ENDEMIC DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Republic of Venezuela for the equivalent of US$94.0
million to help finance a project for ensemic disease control. The loan would
be at the Bank's standard variable Interest rate, with a maturity of 1S years,
including five years of grace.
2.    BJSkggAd.  Endemic diseases, both vector and water-borne, are still an
important cause of morbidity among the poor In most developing countries. The
most prevalent is malaria. Although mortality from endemic diseases like
malaria is 1ow, the economic impaet of these debilitating maladies is
significant. Economic studies of malaria have estimated that between five to
fifteen days of labor are lost for each bout of illness and in farming areas
this impact is aggravated by the coincidence of peak malaria transmission with
the peak labor demand of harvests. Economic calculations must also consider
the long-term impact of parasitic diseases on school-age children and their
capacity to learn. Other important costs include the maintenance of control
programs to halt and reverse epidemics, as well as the costs of treatment at
the household level. Despite the continuing epidemiological significance of
tropical diseases and despite technological advances that have Improved the
possibilities for more effective disesse control, most developing countries
and International agencies have not afforded adequate attention to these
problems. There are a few noteworthy exceptions such as the Onchocorciasis
Control Progr_mme in West Africa (OCP), the WHO/UNDPIWorld Bank Research and
Training Programme in Tropical Diseases (TDR), and a handful of disease
control projects in Brasil, China, the Philippines, Laos, Madagascar and
others, all of which have been supported by the Bank. During the last two
decades, health sector development has focused largely on other, equally
important goals: expanding primary health care coverage and modernizing the
hospital sector. However, the simultaneous neglect and consequent decline of
disease control program has contributed, most notably, to a major resurgence
in malaria incidence worldwide. Venezuela is a classic example.
3.   Funding for endemic disease control In Venezuela (which covers malaria,
denguc.and dengue hemorraghic fever, Chagas diseae, schistosomiasis,
intestinal parasites, yellow fever, leishmaniasis, leprosy, onchocercisiss and
others) declined from over 122 of Ministry of Health and Social Assistance
(MSAS) expenditures in 1972 to less than 32 in 1992.  During the same period,
malaria incidence rose dramatically from 4,200 cases in 1982 to 47,000 in 1990
and, although transmission is presently restrieted to a few problem areas, the
potential for its rapid spread to many other parts of the country is high.
Although demographic and environmental factors are also important, the malaria
epidemic is very clearly associated with a gradual decline in funding for
entomological and epidemiological surveillance. Epidemics of dengue and
dangue hemorraghic fever can also be linked to the neglect of adequate vector
control and viral surveillance. Over 12,000 dengue cases (with 73 deaths)
were reported in 1990 and in the continued absence of a dengu4 control
program, the potential for wider and more frequent epidemics is great. Now



2
the threat of cholera hs placed even further demands oan the scarce resources
available for diseaso control. Although only 15 cases of cholera appeared in
1991, 869 coses were reported by June of 1992.
4.   Underfinancing is the most serious constraint to endemic disease control
in Venezuela; adequate coverage cannot be maintained at present funding
levels.  Control programs need to be revitalized through invostment in
epidemiological surveillace and treatment, vector control, health education,
community participation and infrastructure. Furthermore, the quality and
cost-efficiency of programs can be inroved through investment in Information
system technology, training of specialized staff end operational research to
develop new approaches and technologies.
5.   The USAS executes endmic disease control programs through: (i) the
General Sectoral Directorate for Environmental Sanitation (DGSS._) which is
respons ible for the control of malaria, Chagas disease, intestinal paraites,
schlstosomiasis, dengue, cholera, yellow fever and other diseases; sad (ii)
the BDiomdicine Institute (IB) which is responsible for onchocerciasis,
leasbmania.is and leprosy control. The proposed project was identified as a
high Government priority early on in the Venezuela Health Sector Study, which
emphasised the need for more efficient resource allocation in the sector.
Strengthening endemic diseae control would be a first step in an important
shift in health sector spending away from curative and hospital-based health
care and towards more cost-effective disease prevention and health promotion
programs.
6.   Rationale for Iank Involment. The Bank's assistance strategy in
Venezuela is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic
growth and social development in a context of macroeconomic stability. Our
emplasis is ci efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the
public sector, support for private sector development, and the appropriate
targeting and delivery of support system to the poor. The proposed project
would directly support this strategy by Improving the planning and management
capacity of public health Institutions to control endemic diseases, improving
the health status of low-income populations, and reducing economic losses due
to lowered productivity. Purthermore, disease control projects have high
externalities; reducing malaria incidence in one region, for example, reduces
the risk of its spread to populatiovn in other regions as well. This project
will complement other Bank efforts in the sector, specifically, a Hospital
Modernization Project in preparation and the primary health care component of
the ongoing Social Development Project (Ln. 3270-VE).
7.   Leson  L4arned. Although the Bank has no completed health projects in
Venezuela, lessons can be drawn from ongoing projects and other health
projects in genersal (i) The Social Development Project has demonstrated the
GOV's I4aited experience in project Implementation. Therefore, greater
attention to training in Bank guidelines and supervision by Bank staff will be
needed. It has also demonstrated that care should be taken to ensure that
project-related Public Credit Laws are consistent with the loan agreement;
(it) Senior staff turnover in Venezuela is high and assurances of continuity
in the Project Implementation Units and other key positions should be sought;
(iii) 8ank experience in Brazil (malaria) and West Africa (onchocercisis) has



3
demonstrated that a large measure of operatioaal flexibility, supported by
strong operational research and training, allows disease control programs to
respond more effectively to epidemiological and te¢hnological chage; (iv) The
proposed project, like the Rondonia Health Project (Ln. 2061-BR), will be
exccuted in remote areas and will foce difficulties in staffing, training,
management and supervision. Frequent and flexible programming of Bank
supervision, as well as special attention to the preparation, supervision,
maintenance and compensation of staff who work In these areas will be needed;
(v) Bank experience in tba sector has demonstrated that a few separate and
simple projects are better than a very large and complex project that tries to
solve many problems at oLce. Thus, the proposed project will focus narrowly
on strengthening disease control programs and institutions; (vi) In the Bank's
past experience, project implementation has sometimes been slowed by delays in
civil works. Therefore, agreement on detailed construction plans and building
sites was required prior to nogotiationst (vii) The Brazil Northwest
Integrated Development Project (Ln.2061-BR) showed that maintenance is a key
factor in sustaining project impact. The proposed project will support all
maintenance costs and help strengthen institutional capacity to better manage
regular and adequate maintenance of buildings, equipment and vehicles; (viii)
Finally, the ongoing Ammzon Basin Malaria Control Project (Ln. 3072-BR) in
Brazil is demonstrating that strateglic adjustments in malaria control can
reduce disease incidence and the costs of control through more selective and
better targeted vector control.
8.    Project Obiectives and Descrltion   The proposed project will: (i)
reduce the incidence and impact of endemic diseses ln Venezuela; and (il)
strengthen the institutions responsible for endemic disease control.
9*   The project will include two components:
(a) An Endemic Disease Control Comonent (712 of total costs) will
support: (i) new and ongoing epidemiological surveillance activities for all
of the endemic disease control programs; (il) treatment of cases and
preventive treatment; (li) entomological surveillance and vector control to
interrupt the transmission of maleria, dengue, and other vector-borne
diseases; (iv) rural housing improvements to eliminate the habitat of the
Chagas vector and thus reduce transmission of Chagas disease; (v) health
education activities to enlist Individual and community participation in the
control of endemic diseases; (vi) education and water treatment activities for
cholera prevention; and (vii) innovative measures identified through
operational research.
(b) An Istitutional Strenathenina Comnonent (292 of total costs) will
supports (i) training activities to strengthen human resources at all levels,
from central management to house visitors and spraymen in the field; (i$)
development of Information systems to strengthen epidemiological analysis
(Including computerized epidemiological mappitg) and logistics management;
(iii) an operational research fund for special studies to develop and test new
control aesures or to Improve on existing strategies and technologies; and
(iv) construction of new operational bases, training facilities, and central
and regional headquarters (for DGSSSA) to support expanded program coverage.

10.  The project will support both components through provision of vehiclAs,
equipmet, construction materials, supplies and fuel; davelopmenc a:A purchase
of educational materals; and payment of costs for vehicle operation,
maintenance, technical assistance, salaries, per diem., travel and project
supervision. The Endemic Disease Control Component will also support the
purchaso of drugs and pesticides. In addition, the Institutional
Strengthening Component will supports contracting of civil. orkst provision of
furniture, computer equipment and software; and payment of costs for training
and in-service training courses, domestic and foreign fellowships and
operational research.
11. The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$188.0 million,
net of taxes and duties, of which US$83.9 million is expected to be in foreign
exchange. Istimted costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the schedule of disbursements are shown
in Schedule B. The timetable of the project's key processing events is
summarized in Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Venezuela is
shown in Schedule D. A map of Venezuela (IBRD 24017) is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 10937-VE, dated October 1, 1992, is also attached.
12.  Aneed AgIlMo          At neaotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Borrower will: (a) by March 1 of each year i) submit a report to the Bank, for
its review and comments, on progress in implementation of all project
components and any 7roposals for adjustments in project implementation; and
1i) submit to the Bank, for its review and approval, a proposed annual
investment program providing for the activities, implementation schedule and
targets, and proposed project budget for the then upcoming year, based on the
implameatation schedule in Annex 5 of the SAR; (b) participate in annual
reviews (by March 30 of each year), jointly with the Bank, focusing ont i)
evaluation of progress in project execution and achievement of project
objectives, based on the implementation schedule and agreed monitoring
indicators (see Annexes 5 and 6 of the SA); ii) review of proposed annual
budgets for tbe project and for endemic disease control programs for the
subsequent year; iii) say changes in project design and Implementation that
may be necessary (including the possible effects of decentralization in the
health sector); and iv) the mechlnism providing for the management by DGSSSA
of all funds for payment of DGSSSA's field workerst (c) follow Bank rules in
auditing of project accounts and procurement and submit sudits within six
months of the eand of each fiscal year; (d) Implement the operational research
subaomponent In accordance with the Operational Research Regulationst (e)
maiutain the Project Ilplementstion Units, Project Steering Committee,
Procurement Committee and Research Steering Committee throughout the execution
of the project; (f) follow standards and procedures for the selection and use
of pesticides under the project which are consistent with WHO standards and
procedures and, taking into account the results of comprehensive studies,
discuss and agree with the lank on any changes in such standards and
procedures; (g) through the DGSSSA: i) carry out a mangement study, not. later
than March 31t,1993, to review the organisation and management structure of
DGSSSA snd make recommendations to isprove such structute; 11) not later than
June 30, 1993, based on the management study and the Bank's comments thereon,
present and carry out an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank; (h) carry out
studies, not later than March 1, 1993, to develop appropriate indicators of



the IMpact of istitutional developmnt activities 'supported under the
project# (i) in respect of endemic disease control progrms: I) snually,
echbange views with the Bank, through the executing agencies, on budgetary
needs; ii) In each fiscal year, furnish evidence satisfactory to the Bank
showing that the final proposed VSWS budget includes adequ.,te allocations in
the opinion of the Bank; iiI) not later than May 31 in each fiscal year,
furnish evidence satisfactory to the Bank of the final proposed budget for
endemic disease control programs for the then following fiscal year, submitted
by the Bo-rover's Executive Branch to the Borrower's Congreoss and iv) not
later thas March 1 in each fiscal year, furnish evidence satisfactory to the
Bank showing the amount of expenditures incurred for endemic disease control
programs in the tIan previous fiscal yeart and (j) maintain a mechanism,
satisfactory to the Bank, providing for the management by DGSSSA of all funds
for payment of DGSSSA's field workers.
13.  As conditions of disbursementt (a) no withdrawals shall be made for
expendituren under the project unless the expenditures are included in an
annual action plan approved by the Bank; (b) no withdrawals shall be made for
expenditures for pesticides unless they are included in an agreed pesticide
list; and (c) no withdrawals shall be made for expenditures for drugs unless a
procurement services agreement, acceptable to the Bank, has been signed with a
procurement agent.
14. * nvironmental Asipects* The proposed project does not require an
nv-ironmental assessment, although the project has a OB" environmental rating
due to the use of pesticides in the malaria control progra. As Indicated In
para. 12 above, assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower
will select and use pesticides in accordance with standards and procedures
acceptable tc the Bank.
15.   enf  its. The principal beneficiaries ef this project would be low-
Income populations in rural and peri-urban areas throughout Venezuela where
endemic diseases are still an important cause of morbidity. These populations
would benefit directly through decreaaed risk of disease and improved health
status, and indirectly through improved productivity. Reducing malaria, in
particular, has a positive economic impact in agricultural areas where peak
malaria transmission tends to coincide with peak labor demand. In addition,
school-age children will benefit from reduced incidence of intestinal
parasites which can have an important impact on learning. The benefits of
controlling disoases which have the potential for rapid dispersion (especially
malaria, dengue and cholera) are especially great and early intervention to
halt major epidemics is much less costly than attempting to reduce disese
transmission that is already widespread. In addition, the institutions
responsible for endemic disease control will benefit from improved management
and technical capacity. tn particular, the project would help the IB and
DGSSSA to improve the design and evaluation of control strategies and the
cost-effectiveness of disease control interventions. Finally, the project
will begin to reverse the decline in endemic dises"e control financing as part
of a wider commitment by the Government to upport a shift in spending away
from curative, hospital-based care and towards preventive health actins.



6
16.  JUsks.  The major risk to successful project implementation is from
labor strike whiach in rocent years have resulted from long delays in payment
of VWA8 field workers. These workers, throughout the country, are paid out of
a l'?ge, centrally managed 'Laborers' Collective Contract". The MMAS and the
executing agencies agree that the flow of funds would likely Improve if the
DWS8SA and IB vere permitted to manage the Laborers' Collective Contract funds
directly. In fact, the MAS has already acted on the matter and provided
evidence that tbo executing agencies have been delegated the power to manage
funds for payment to the field workers. Although such a measure will not
eliminate all of the underlying causes of recent labor conflicts, DGSSSA and
ID officia' J are confident it wi'. help to ease a large part of the problem.
There is also a risk of delays in project Implementation due to the borrower's
lack of experience with Bank-financed projects. To help address this problem
the Bank will: (i) conduct a project launch seminar to review Bank procedures
with all of the institutions involved in project liplementation; and (ii)
llocate greater resources to project supervision.
17.   ftStaJWkd1J1y.   Sustainability of the project is expected to be high.
First, the Government clearly recognizes that the project will help to return
drastically reduced endemic disease control spending to a level suited to
present and future needs. It also recognizes that a comitment to greater
spending on endemic disease control represents one step in an important and
permanent shift in resource allocation In the health sector away from curative
and towards preventive care. Second, more than 85S of the Incremental
recurrent costs will be financed by the Government. Third, the number of new
persoannl supported by the project is relatively small (motnt of the increase
is spresad out among the 28 states which will each hire three or four new staff
to support expsanded IB programs) and, with the exception of project
anagement, their salaries will be financed entirely out of counterpart funds.
'ourth, the future costs of disease control can be expected to decline over
tine to the extent that: ti) project investments in disease control operations
successfully reduce disease transmissiong and (1i) project investments in
operational re,oarch lead to the development of more cost-effective
interventions.
18.  Rcmmendt_gio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
