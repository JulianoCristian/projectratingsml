Community\n            Development Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) Project for\n            Argentina were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: The project demonstrated\n            unequivocally that indigenous communities have the capacity\n            to make decisions and to manage their own development,\n            including the conservation and recuperation of their natural\n            resources. This requires appropriate technical support,\n            training, participatory mechanisms which transmit\n            information, and rational procedures appropriate to a\n            decentralized operation. Of equal importance, indigenous\n            communities showed they can collaborate effectively with\n            public authorities in maintaining and protecting natural\n            resources in national parks and represent their own NRM\n            interests within the wider institutional and political\n            framework. Beneficiaries acquired knowledge and skills\n            empowering them to manage financial resources and\n            subprojects interact with national and provincial\n            institutions, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and\n            international organizations, and obtain benefits beyond the\n            Project. This was a major project achievement. Beneficiary\n            communities in several APIs have already leveraged this\n            capacity as well as their bridging and bonding social\n            capital to obtain additional benefits, including roads,\n            energy, and schools, from public programs and authorities.\n            Indigenous groups involved in the Project are better\n            informed, trained,and organized, and no longer hesitant\n            about advocating for their priority interests."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
