Project\n            for Papua New Guinea was suspended only 15 months after the\n            effectiveness; hence, the actual implementation was very\n            limited and so was the outcome. The project had a difficult\n            start, because shortly after loan negotiations, a new\n            government took power. This note concludes that the evidence\n            is inconclusive whether the Bank should have persuaded the\n            government to restructure the Loan rather than cancel it.\n            There were debates within the Bank to consider\n            restructuring. However, evidence was accumulating that the\n            new government's lack of capacity, governance, and\n            common strategy with the Bank (despite some committed\n            government staff within the sector) would have led to\n            cancellation by the Bank in due course. In addition, the\n            government clearly indicated to the Bank that it did not\n            want further Bank involvement in Papua New Guine's\n            forest sector, and requested cancellation of the loan."}, "docdt": "2006-10-13T00:00:00Z"}
