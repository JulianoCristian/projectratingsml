The\n            project has four main components. The first develops and\n            implements a process whereby landowners will become more\n            aware of options in using their forests. Its three\n            sub-components comprise consultative activities to improve\n            landowner access to information and discussions of\n            development options prior to any land-use decisions;\n            improved processes and systems for landowner representation\n            and organization to allow improved resource decisionmaking\n            will be developed and implemented; and policy and\n            legislative development. The second component establishes a\n            Conservation Trust Fund with GEF support, and develops a\n            co-financing strategy. The third component augments the\n            efforts of the forest authority and other institutions\n            involved in sustainable management of the country's\n            forests. It improves capacity specifically by improving\n            forest operations, inspection, and monitoring; forest\n            management planning; and expanding activities that maintain\n            forest production as well as ecological potential. The\n            fourth component provides technical assistance for\n            environmental assessment and monitoring while building\n            apacity within the Office of Environment and Conservation."}, "docdt": "2001-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
