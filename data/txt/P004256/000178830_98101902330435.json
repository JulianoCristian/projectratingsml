through\n            improved water management in those parts of the Muda\n            irrigation area which are least adequately served by the\n            existing irrigation and drainage network. In addition, by\n            strengthening agricultural support services, the yield and\n            incomes of all 60,000 padi farming families in the Muda\n            area, or 340,000 people, will be improved. To achieve these\n            aims, the proposed project would provide financing for: (a)\n            construction of tertiary canal and drainage systems and farm\n            roads in 37 discrete irrigation blocks; (b) improvements to\n            major outfall drains and natural channels; (c)\n            rehabilitation of coastal bunds; (d) construction of tidal\n            gates, water control structures and escape structures; (e)\n            upgrading of the existing water control communications\n            system; (f) construction of workshops, administration\n            buildings and seed stores; (g) pilot projects, engineering\n            and management studies, a groundwater study and a rural\n            development project feasibility study; (h) purchase of\n            vehicles and equipment for project works and studies; and\n            (i) consultant services and training."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
