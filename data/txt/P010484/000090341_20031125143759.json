The lessons learned\n            indicate that in order to facilitate progress monitoring and\n            measuring of the Project objective achievements, it is\n            crucial to formulate the development objectives clearly. The\n            objectives should be simple, focusing on the Project's\n            principal outcomes that are direct results of the activities\n            financed by the Project. The Project achieved satisfactory\n            and sustainable outcomes primarily because it empowered the\n            communities and women stakeholders through making them the\n            decision makers and operators of the infrastructure schemes.\n            Such empowerment efforts have led to the choice of more\n            affordable and appropriate technological options that are\n            better suited to the needs of the villages, reduction of\n            drudgery, and increase in the villagers' ownership and\n            motivation to perform Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of\n            the schemes. Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) and GOUA\n            plan to scale up the Swajal concept in rest of the states.\n            In implementing such reforms, Gram Panchayat (GPs) will be\n            the implementing agencies and Jal Nigam will play the\n            Support Organizations (SO) role. Significant capacity\n            building for both GPs and Jal Nigam, and continued\n            involvement and empowerment of the village communities will\n            be important to maintain the Swajal principles. Significant\n            investments in the human resource development brought about\n            high quality leadership and teams of dedicated and competent\n            professionals. The Project should accommodate the time it\n            takes to plan and implement different technological options,\n            such as tube-wells, dug-wells or piped water supply schemes.\n            It is also important to adopt different community\n            mobilization efforts that could vary depending on the\n            technical options - for example, the level of awareness\n            required of the village communities could be different for a\n            dug well serving a few households, compared to a gravity\n            system serving the whole village."}, "docdt": "2002-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
