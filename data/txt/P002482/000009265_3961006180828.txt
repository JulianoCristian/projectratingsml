MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject:      Project Completion Report on Somalia
Livestock Health Services (Credit 1647-SO)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Somalia-Livestock Health Services (Credit
1647-SO) jointly prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Africa Regional Office.
There is no Part II. The quality of the report is satisfactory given the lack of field data.
The main goal of the project was to reduce the economic losses which resulted from animal
diseases, strengthen the institutional capabilities of Government's Animal Health Department, and
involve the private sector in the delivery of veterinary drugs. The underlying strategy of the project
was to have a first phase operation of three and a half years during which pilot activities would be
tested, followed by a second phase of three years during which successfully tested pilot operations
would be implemented. The project was to draw on the experience of other livestock projects under
implementation in northern Somalia.
The implementation experience from this project is limited because the project ceased
effective operation due to civil insecurity only 13 months after the credit became effective in April
1987. Despite difficulties and uncertainties due to security problems, the project made a good start.
Govemment staffed the project unit as envisaged, technical experts were appointed on time and some
construction took place.
Two lessons can be drawn from the project experience. The pilot nature of the project design
was flexible enough to likely meet project objectives except during the height of civil war. The
project included an adequate force majeure clause. Such clause assisted considerably in an orderly
winding down of operations without penalizing the involved parties.
The project is rated as unsatisfactory, sustainability as unlikely, and institutional development
as negligible.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMEPLETION REPORT
LIVESTOCK HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT
(IDA CR, 1647-SO & [FAD LN, 182-SO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Livestock Health Services Project
(LHSP) in Somalia, for which IFAD Loan 182-SO, in the amount of SDR 5.8 million, and
IDA Credit 1647-SO, in the amount of SDR 4.1 million were approved on 5 February, 1986.
The Loan and Credit were suspended in December 1990, two and a half years before the
official closing date of 30 June, 1993, due to civil war. About SDR 8.2 million remained
undisbursed.
Parts I and III of this PCR were prepared by the staff of the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program (CP) for the Agriculture and Environment Division, Country
Department II, Eastern Africa Region of the World Bank. Since Somalia is still in a state of
civil war, a draft of this report has not been sent to the Borrower for comment.
No field visits were undertaken for the purposes of this report because of the security
situation in the country. The report is therefore based entirely on the Staff Appraisal Report,
the Loan and Credit Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA, IFAD
and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda, and consultations with Bank staff associated
with the project.

LIVESTOCK HEALTH SERVICES PROJECT
(IDA CR. 1647-SO & IFAD LN, 182-SO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The main goal of the project was to contribute towards the reduction of economic
losses in the livestock sector which resulted from animal diseases, and to strengthen the
institutional capabilities of the government agency concerned with the livestock sector. The
Agricultural Sector Review of 1981 had identified livestock as one of the areas which could
quickly generate increased production and exports. A subsequent Development Plan also
assigned the highest priority to livestock development with particular emphasis on the
reduction of losses caused by disease. The major constraint to the improvement of livestock
health was the lack of well-defined and regionally focussed disease control programs which
were economically justifiable, cost effective, and monitorable as to their effectiveness in
achieving established objectives. LHSP was designed to address this need, targeting three
northwestern districts of Somalia where livestock farming was the most important economic
activity. The underlying strategy of the project was to have a first phase operation during
which pilot activities would be tested followed by a second phase operation during which the
successfully tested pilot operations would be implemented.
Implementation Experience
The implementation experience from this project is understandably very limited because
the project ceased effective operation due to the civil war only 13 months after the
Loan/Credit became effective in April 1987. Project life at appraisal was expected to be
some six and a half years.
Despite difficulties and uncertainties due to security problems, the project made a good
start. Government took the necessary first steps to facilitate implementation including the
establishment and staffing of a Project Management Unit (PMU). The technical assistance
(TA) activities were sub-contracted to a consulting firm and the majority of the long-term
consultants were in post by early 1988. After considerable delay, the construction contract
was awarded to an international construction firm; a local engineering firm was awarded the
contract for the supervision of construction work. Construction work was also initiated in
early 1988.
ii



The security situation however continued to deteriorate. In May 1988 the project
activity was completely disrupted by the civil disturbances. Operations were halted and
consultants and senior project management had to be evacuated from the project headquarters
in Hargeisa. The civil works program was equally affected. After making good progress and
with an estimated 20% of the construction work completed, the contractors were forced to
abandon the sites. Reportedly, much of this construction work undertaken was destroyed.
GOS decided to terminate the construction contract at the end of December 1988 and the
contractor was compensated. For the next few months, the project was kept as a holding
operation. With no improvement in sight, the technical consultants were subsequently given
notice and their employment was terminated on 31 March, 1989. Only the Technical
Director remained, but his contract too was terminated on 30 June 1989.
An IDA supervision mission which visited the country in March 1989 recommended that
if the situation did not improve and the project area remained inaccessible by the end of
December 1989, a firm decision should be taken by all concerned parties on the desirability
of continuing attempts to implement the project. As the situation did not subsequently
improve, the Loan and Credit were eventually suspended in December 1990. They however
could not be formally closed because a serious outbreak of fighting in Mogadishu disrupted
the closure procedures.
Project Results and Impact
Because of the early interruption and subsequent termination of operations, the project
achieved no concrete results in physical terms, or in the planned technical investigations and
animal health programs.
Sustainability
As the bulk of the project's programs were never implemented, it is not possible to
determine their sustainability or otherwise. However during the short period that the project
was operational, problems of inadequate counterpart funding were already evident.
Findings and Lessons
No significant lessons can be derived from the project because the implementation period
was too brief. Perhaps the very important lesson is whenever during project implementation
the project area suffers serious protracted strife, the lenders and the borrower should put in
place a contingency plan including arrangements for the possible closure of the project.
Another lesson learned is that procurement contracts should include adequate force majeure
clauses. In this project the presence of such clauses assisted considerably in the orderly
winding down of operations.

2. Background and Sector Context
Background
2.1    The Livestock Health Services Project (LHSP) was identified by [FAD with the
cooperation of the FAO Investment Centre (FAO/IC) in June 1983. A subsequent FAO/IC
mission was mounted in mid-1984 to prepare the project, and issued a preparation report in
July 1984. The report formed the basis on which IDA, at the request of IFAD, appraised the
project in November/December 1984. It was approved by the IFAD and IDA Boards in
February 1986. The project became effective in April 1987, following delays by
Government in fulfilling the conditions for effectiveness, particularly those relating to the
recruitment of consultants. The project was scheduled to be implemented over a six and a
half year period through 30 June, 1993. However, due to the escalation of the civil strife into
a war, project operations were suspended at the end of December 1990.
1



Sector Development Context
2.2    Since the early 1970s, a series of internationally funded projects supporting
Government policy and strategy in the agricultural sector had been initiated in Somalia.
Within the livestock subsector, increasing degree of attention was being focused on the
management and preservation of critical range resources and involved two large projects - the
Northern Rangelands Development Project (financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development) and the Central Rangelands Development Project (supported by multi-donor
financing including IDA, IFAD, USAID, WFP and GTZ). A pilot epidemiology study was
undertaken under the Central Rangelands Development Project, which later formed the basis
for some of the animal health activities in the livestock subsector.
2.3    The Agricultural Sector Review of 1981 emphasized the need to strengthen and
develop certain key areas within the agricultural sector, such as livestock, which could
quickly generate increased production and exports. In 1983 when LHSP was being
identified, it was estimated that about 50% of the country's population were nomads or semi-
nomads and depended on livestock for their subsistence. About 80 percent of the country's
exports were being generated from sales of live animals, and nearly 40 percent of GDP was
related to the livestock subsector activities. The subsector therefore had a pivotal role in the
Somali social and economic life. However, despite its importance, in 1984 only some 4% of
the national budget was devoted to the sub-sector. Given its vast potential (in boosting the
country's foreign exchange earnings and as a source of revenue through taxes and cost
recovery), Government decided to allocate more resources to the subsector.
2.4     The Government's Four Year Development Plan 1982-86 also assigned the highest
priority to the livestock sub-sector, focusing on the reduction of waste caused by disease and
the expected subsequent increases in the level of offtake. The major constraint to the
improvement of livestock health was the lack of well-defined and regionally focussed disease
control programs which could be simultaneously economically justifiable, cost effective, and
monitorable as to their effectiveness in achieving established objectives. The strengthening of
the technical and organizational base for animal health planning in support of the formulation
of regional disease control programs was therefore an immediate priority. LHSP set out to
address this need, targeting the north-western districts of Awdal, Galbeed, and Togdheer
where livestock farming was the most important economic activity.
3. Project Objectives and Description
Objectives
3.1    The gcals of the project were to contribute to the reduction of economic losses in the
livestock sector which resulted from animal diseases and to strengthen the institutional
capabilities of the Animal Husbandry Department (AHD) in the Ministry of Livestock,
Forestry and Range (MLFR).
2



Description
3.2    The project was comprised of the following 5 components:
(a) Laboratory Services: the construction of a new central veterinary laboratory at
Hargeisa and the rehabilitation of an existing laboratory at Burao; financing the
services of an internationally recruited senior laboratory technician; and funding
incremental local staff and operating costs for laboratory services.
(b)    Field Services Investigation: financing the disease investigation program
including the provision of technical assistance, incremental local staff costs,
4-wheel drive vehicles and trucks as well as their operating costs and
consumables.
(c)    Field Services Development: rehabilitation of a small number (unspecified) of
AHD veterinary district offices, provision of drugs and financing incremental
operating costs.
(d)    Training: provision of overseas training for 9 staff of AHD and local on the
job training of veterinary and other staff.
(e)    Project Management: employment of an internationally recruited technical
advisor to the post of Project Director; provision of staff housing for 6
internationally recruited advisors; purchase of two 4-wheel drive vehicles;
financing short-term consultancies and incremental local staff salaries and other
operating costs of the Project Management Unit (PMU).
3.3   Project activities were to be implemented over a two phase period. During Phase I,
which would cover the first three and a half years, the project would concentrate on disease
investigation activities and livestock health services planning on a pilot scale to establish the
future plan of action. During Phase II, which would cover the last three years of the project,
emphasis would be put on implementing the beneficial results of pilot scale operations
conducted in Phase I.
3.4 Total project costs were estimated at US$ 11.6 million, of which [FAD would finance
US$ 6.3 million or 54% of the total, and IDA would finance US$ 4.3 million or 37% of the
total. Government of Somalia (GOS) was to finance the remaining US$ 1.0 million.
4. Project Design and Organization
Design
4.1 The project concept was well understood by all concerned parties. However, the lack
of a baseline survey meant that the data and assumptions used were not necessarily current.
The project planned to address this issue by carrying out such a survey at Mid-Tern Review
(MTR). The six and a half year period given for implementing the project appears to have
3



been unusually long, but is justified given that the project had to be implemented in two
separate but interdependent phases so as to be able to attain the maximum desired impact.
The two stage implementation concept was an innovative approach.
Organization
4.2 The responsibility for project implementation was assigned to a Project Management
Unit (PMU) which was created within MLFR. The PMU was located in Hargeisa and was
headed by a Somali Project Director assisted by an internationally recruited Technical
Director. An Inter-Regional Committee (IRC) was set up to secure cooperation with other
Government and non-Government institutions; its members were the regional representatives
of those institutions. The Project Director acted as Secretary to the committee. A Project
Committee (PC) under the chairmanship of the Minister or Vice Minister or Permanent
Secretary of MLFR was set up to supervise project implementation and oversee the PMU.
In the short period during which the project was operational, these arrangements worked
satisfactorily.
5. Project Implementation
5.1 The project became effective on 2 April, 1987, some nine months behind schedule,
largely because of GOS delays in finalizing recruitment of consultants which was a condition
of Credit effectiveness.
5.2 The project got off to an uncertain start due to security problems. The first IDA
supervision mission which visited the country in February 1987 was unable to visit the
project area because armed conflicts had broken out on the Somalia-Ethiopia border. The
next two supervision missions which visited Somalia in October 1987 and March 1988 were
able to visit the project Headquarters in Hargeisa and reported a good start on project
operations; however, the security situation continued to deteriorate. In May 1988, just over
one year after effectiveness, project activities were completely disrupted by the civil
disturbances. Operations were halted and consultants and senior project management had to
be evacuated from the project area. With no improvement in sight, the technical consultants
were subsequently given notice and their employment was terminated on 31 March, 1989.
Only the Technical Director remained, but his contract too was terminated on 30 June, 1989.
5.3 The civil works programn was equally affected by the insecurity which hit the project
area. After bureaucratic delays, the construction contract was awarded to an international
construction firm and a local engineering firm was awarded the contract for the supervision
of construction work. Construction work started in early 1988 and the contractor was
making good progress when, at the end of May 1988, the civil works had to be abandoned
because of insecurity. By then about 20 percent of the construction of the laboratory and staff
houses at Hargeisa had been completed. Reportedly, much of this construction work
undertaken was later destroyed. As the possibilities for resuming work continued to recede
GOS decided to terminate the construction contract at the end of December 1988.
4



5.4 With all the construction work abandoned, the consultants gone, and the 6 vel
procured by the project lost or damaged beyond repair, the project's planned progra,
been dealt a severe blow. An IDA supervision mission which visited the country in ]
1989 therefore recommended that if the situation did not improve, (and an IDA revit
mission could not visit the project area), by the end of December 1989, a firm decis
would have to be taken by all concerned parties on the desirability of continuing atte
implement the project. A review mission which visited Mogadishu in December 198
unable to reach the project area because of the worsening insecurity there. At a mee
top Government officials including the Minister, MLFR, it was decided to terminate
project by the end of that month. Subsequently the Minister of Finance wrote to IDS
IFAD requesting the termination of the project "due to the unconductive environmen
project area". A serious outbreak of fighting in Mogadishu disrupted the project clob
procedures. The Loan and Credit therefore could not be formally closed.
6. Project Results and Impact
6.1  Project implementation effectively lasted only 13 months to May 1988. That t
short slice of a planned six and a half year project life, no concrete results or impac
achieved either in physical terms or in the investigative and animal health programs.
financial and economic benefits of the project were supposed to be analyzed at the n
review planned for the beginning of the fourth year of the project. However, the M
not be undertaken. An opinion cannot therefore be forrmed as to whether the propose
interventions would have resulted in significant financial and socio-economic benefit
project beneficiaries.
7. Sustainability
7.1  The sustainability of the planned project activities cannot be determined as the
the project program could not be implemented. It is however likely that had the proj
allowed to run its full course, it would have met considerable problems of counterp*
funding - as was already becoming evident. The project had a large expatriate TA e;
with long-term consultancies totalling almost 30 staff-years which implies there was
substantial lack of these skills locally. The continuation of the scientific and technical
programs of the project would therefore have depended on how quickly the TA staff would
have passed on their expertise to their local counterparts.
8. Bank Performance
8.1  The Bank's performance during the various stages of the project cycle was
satisfactory. The SAR was well documented and clearly laid out what interventions
undertaken at various stages of project implementation. The civil war which broke c
1988, well over 3 years after project appraisal could not have been foreseen by the;
mission. The project area was at the time considered fairly safe and the only risk re
in the SAR was insecurity along the international borders with Ethiopia and Djibout
5



8.2  As shown in Table 8, the project was actively supervised. Seven supervision missions
visited the country although only two were able to reach the project area due to insecurity.
When hostilities broke out in the project area and elsewhere, the Bank Resident
Mission was very helpful and worked closely with the visiting supervision missions in
keeping abreast of developments and in preparing GOS for the eventual closure of the
project.
8.3   As the PCR mission was unable to visit the country for discussions with the local
officials who were closely associated with the project, it is not possible to obtain their
assessment of Bank performance.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1   GOS showed strong commitment to the project up to the very end. However, there
were emerging problems of unavailability of counterpart funding. The PMU performed
satisfactorily during its short tenure. Many local staff stayed on at Hargeisa, even after
project operations basically came to a stand-still in May 1988, until project closure in
December 1990.
10. Project Relationships
10.1  Although the project was implemented under very trying conditions, the relationships
between IDA, IFAD and GOS remained amicable throughout. The parties collaborated
together even upon reaching the difficult decision to close the project.
11. Consultant Services
11.1  The project engaged long-term consultants in the fields of veterinary investigations,
laboratory techniques, range ecology and pastoral systems. Their input was however limited
as they had to be evacuated a few months after commencing their work. During that period,
their performance was rated satisfactory. A local consulting engineering firm hired to
supervise the civil works construction, also performed satisfactorily.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1 Without a field visit to the project headquarters, it is not possible to ascertain the
quality and adequacy of data and documentation at field level. However, quarterly progress
reports and interim work plans and budgets were submitted to IDA on time. This indicates
the existence of a reasonable data and documentation system in the field. At IDA, the SAR
was well documented. No issues of interpretation arose out of the Loan and Credit
Agreements which implies that they were clear and well understood by all parties concerned.
6



12.2 At MDA, some key documents such as a signed copy of the IFAD Loan agreement were
not available.
Lessons
13.1  Project implementation was too brief to afford any significant lessons. Perhaps the
key lesson is that whenever during project implementation the project area suffers serious
and protracted civil strife, the lenders and the borrower should put in place a contingency
program with various action plans. In any case the two parties should reduce the level of
operations, start sorting out outstanding contractual obligations, and update financial records
for the probable closure of the project. It may be fruitless to continue operations in the hope
that the situation might improve.
13.2 Another lesson learned is that procurement contracts should contain adequate force
majeure clauses to protect both parties and to allow a quick winding down of project
operations. In this project, this aspect was extremely well covered, which facilitated the
closure of project activities in a smooth manner.

TABLE 6: PROJECT RESULTS
A: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
No economic and financial analysis were done at appraisal because at that time project benefits
could not be quantified due to lack of key data like livestock mortality and morbidity rates in the
project area. A rate of return analysis was planned to be done at the Mid-Term Review but the
MTR never took place because of the war situation in the country.
