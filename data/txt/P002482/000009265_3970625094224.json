The project will strengthen the Animal Health\n            Department (AHD) of MLFR. The project will be complementary\n            to ongoing projects in animal health. It will serve as a\n            basis for planning further improvements in veterinary services."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
