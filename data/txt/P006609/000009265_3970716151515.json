Specifically, the project aims\n            to:  (i) improve information, criteria, analyses,\n            organizational arrangements and control relationships for\n            decision-making within the public sector; and (ii) to\n            support the Government's technical assistance program\n            to small- and medium-sized exporters.  The project, itself,\n            would consist of technical assistance in several different\n            areas.  These areas include:  (a) improving the\n            decision-making process in the public sector; (b) improving\n            the potential medium- to longer-term performance of the\n            public enterprises in terms of efficiency and their\n            contribution; (c) improving the quality of economic\n            information and statistics used in public sector\n            decision-making; and (d) developing a program of assistance\n            to the country's small- and medium-sized exporters."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
