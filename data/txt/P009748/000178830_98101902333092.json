       Thal, in the State of Maharashtra, with a daily capacity of\n            about 2,700 tons of ammonia and about 4,500 tons of urea,\n            including the provision of infrastructure, auxiliary, and\n            offsite facilities required for the efficient maintenance\n            and operation of the plant is proposed. Possible risks\n            facing the Thal Fertilizer Project are in the form of\n            technical problems, implementation delays and cost\n            over-runs. These risks are minimized by the use of\n            commercially proven technologies supplied by internationally\n            recognized engineering firms and by the use of the services\n            of the Fertilizer (Planning and Development) India Ltd. and\n            RCF staff who are experienced in building and commissioning\n            similar plants. Potential risks associated with the timely\n            availability of required infrastructural facilities will be\n            reduced by the Government of Maharashtra's confirmation\n            that these would be provided and arrangements made for\n            monitoring the execution of this work."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
