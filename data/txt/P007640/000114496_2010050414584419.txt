               preparation,  can  be  relied  on  to  support  the
               related withdrawals.

                             SCHEDULE
       Banxico Lending Policies and Procedures for Sub-loans
I.   Medium-and Long-term Sub-loans
A.   General
1.   Banxico, acting as trustee  for FIRA, shall finance Sub-loans
made  by  the   Participating   Banks.   FIRA's  determination  of
eligibility for such financing  shall  be based primarily upon the
appraisal as to technical  feasibility  and satisfactory return on
investments. Each  Sub-loan  shall  be  appraised  and approved by
qualified technicians of, or acceptable  to, FIRA before such Sub-
loan is made.  In  addition,  appraisals  of Sub-projects shall be
reviewed from time to  time  by  FIRA,  in order to determine that
appraisals by such  technicians  show  the technical, economic and
financial viability of the  Sub-projects  and that the appraisals,
approvals and supervision  are  in  compliance with FIRA's Lending
Policies and Operating Manual.
B.   Lending Policies and Procedures
2.   Banxico shall make available  to the respective Participating
Banks, promptly as needed, amounts sufficient to cover the balance
remaining on each Sub-loan  after  the Participating Bank has made
the required contribution  in  accordance  with paragraph 3 below.
The financing made  available  by  Banxico  to Participating Banks
shall have the  same  payment  terms regarding principal, interest
and  other  charges  as  the  Sub-loans  financed,  and  shall  be
evidenced by negotiable  instruments  representing the Sub-loan to
be financed, signed by the Beneficiaries.
3.   In financing Sub-loans, the following rules shall apply:
     Minimum                 Minimum
   Beneficiary            Participating
  contribution            Bank contri-
   (percentage            bution (per-                Maximum
   of cost of              centage of               percentage
   Sub-project              Sub-loan                of Sub-loan
    financed)               financed)            financed by FIRA
       10%                     10%                   up to 90%
4.   No Sub-loan shall be  made  to  an individual Beneficiary for
investment if the amount  of  the  proposed Sub-loan together with
the aggregate principal amount  outstanding  of Sub-loans made for
investment to such Beneficiary  and  financed  by FIRA exceeds the
equivalent of $260,000, or  such  other  amount as shall be agreed
between the Bank and Banxico.  In case the Beneficiary is composed
of a group of  persons,  such  amount  shall  be multiplied by the
number of members of such group.
5.   The lending terms and grace periods  shall be as set forth in
the technical and financial plans for each Sub-project. Repayments
of principal of Sub-loans shall range from 2 to 15 years and shall
include grace periods of 1 to  3 years; provided however, that any
Sub-loans made for a Sub-project under  PVP shall not have a grace
period and in calculating  the  economic  rate  of return for such
Sub-project, capitalized interest shall  be included in investment
cost.  In exceptional cases  only  and with the prior agreement of
the Bank, repayment of principal  for  Sub-loans may extend for up
to 20 years and, if not made  under PVP may include a grace period
of up to five years.
Page  7
6.   Interest  rates  on   Sub-loans   shall  be  established  and
periodically readjusted in accordance  with  the provisions of the
General Interest Rate  Agreement.  In  financing Sub-loans made by
Participating Banks, Banxico shall allow a margin to such Partici-
pating Banks of up to 10%  of  the Reference Rate (as that term is
defined in the  General  Interest  Rate  Agreement,  also known as
"CPP") for the month preceding the making of the Sub-loan, or such
other percentage of the Reference  Rate or percentage point margin
as shall  be  agreed  between  the  Guarantor  and  the Bank, with
respect to Sub-loans to Beneficiaries.
II.  Short-term Sub-loan Policies and Procedures
A.   General
1.   The appraisal and approval of Sub-projects to be financed out
of the proceeds of  a  Short-term  Sub-loan and the supervision of
the same  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  FIRA Lending
Policies and Operating Manual.
B.   Lending Policies and Procedures
2.   Banxico shall make available  to the respective Participating
Banks, promptly as needed, amounts sufficient to cover the balance
remaining on each Sub-loan  after  the Participating Bank has made
the required contribution  in  accordance  with paragraph 3 below.
The financing made  available  by  Banxico  to Participating Banks
shall have the  same  payment  terms regarding principal, interest
and  other  charges  as  the  Sub-loans  financed,  and  shall  be
evidenced by negotiable  instruments  representing the Sub-loan to
be financed, signed by  the Beneficiaries. In financing Short-term
Sub-loans, the interest rate  to  be  charged to the Beneficiaries
shall be as provided for  in  the General Interest Rate Agreement;
repayment of principal shall not exceed two years.
3.   In financing Short-term Sub-loans,  the following rules shall
apply:
                                    Minimum
                Minimum bene-     Participating      Maximum
                ficiary contri-   Bank contri-      percentage
                bution (percen-   bution (per-      of Sub-loan
                tage of cost of   centage of Sub-    financed
                Sub-project       loan financed)     by FIRA
                financed)
                _______________   _______________    __________
                     10%              10%            up to 90%
4.   Short-term Sub-loans to be  financed  out  of the proceeds of
the Loan shall be  incremental  to FIRA's total short-term lending
for the previous year. By  November  30  of each year, starting on
November 30, 1989, FIRA will provide  the Bank with an estimate of
its incremental short-term lending  for  the subsequent year. Such
amount shall be revised  against  FIRA's actual incremental Short-
term Sub-loans financed under  the  Project during each such year,
as audited, and any difference  resulting therefrom shall be added
to or substracted from, the estimated amount to be financed out of
the proceeds  of  the  Loan  as  Short-term  Sub-loans  during the
following year.
