well as improving existing\n            services, and (ii) strengthen the Borrower and the\n            participating water and sewerage regional/municipal\n            companies. Of the project investments about 35% would be for\n            sewerage works, 20% for distribution pipes, 17% for water\n            production, 11% for engineering and administration, and the\n            remaining 17% for pumping stations, storage tanks, meters\n            and operation equipment, and technical assistance. The\n            project would provide water through house connections to\n            about 473,000 people in 19 cities by 1983, and sewerage\n            services to 654,000 people in 14 cities by 1983; about half\n            of this population belongs to poorest population earning\n            less than one third of the per capita national income. The\n            project presents higher than usual risks in that it may not\n            be implemented in the intended period, principally because\n            the borrower and the participating water and sewerage\n            companies may not be able to achieve the forecast\n            institutional and financial improvements within a short\n            period of time. It is to be expected that the\n            Government's commitment to strengthening the\n            institutions in the water and sewerage sector together with\n            close supervision"}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
