This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) covers the implementation of two
programmatic operations, the Punjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan and the Second Punjab
Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of the preparation of the first Punjab Irrigation Development Policy Loan, Pakistan's
economy seemed to be well on the path to sustained economic growth. After a long history of wavering
commitment to, and poor implementation of, economic and structural reforms, which led to
implementation delays or pre-mature termination of a number of International Monetary Fund (IMF)
programs,1 the Government was able not only to fully implement the reform program supported by the
Fund under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), but in many areas surpassed the targets
set under the program. Successful implementation of structural and economic reform program helped
transform the economy from a highly regulated to a more open, market economy. This, together with
more transient factors like good weather conditions, contributed to a sharp acceleration in economic
growth. The economy showed a healthy growth performance in 2003/04 as the GDP growth reached
6.4%. The IMF2 reported that medium term outlook for Pakistan's economy remained favorable with a
national growth rate projected at 6% in the short to medium run. With a relatively sound macroeconomic
environment, the province of Punjab took a bold decision to undertake key policy reforms for improving
governance by enhancing the accountability of state institutions; improving social service delivery
systems; accelerating growth and generating employment through enhanced focus on productive sectors;
and enhancing the effectiveness of public expenditures through budgetary and institutional reforms3. This
commitment set rolling a comprehensive and multi-sector reforms process for fiscal and financial
management, taxation, procurement, education, and agriculture and irrigation.

Agriculture being the mainstay of Punjab's economy ­ accounting for 26% of its output and providing
employment to 45% of its workforce ­ received serious attention. In particular, the province recognized
that the uneven growth pattern was partly contributed by the serious challenges faced in agriculture sector
including: (i) input intensification for only a few crops leading to serious environment and health impacts;
(ii) low productivity with the rate of total factor productivity (TFP) growth at a mere 1.5% in comparison
to other countries of the region; and (iii) significant decline in water productivity and increased land
degradation due to poor water quality and mono-cropping. However, over 90% of Punjab's agricultural
production is dependent upon irrigation system. As in the rest of the country, Punjab also faced several
challenges in the irrigation and drainage systems limiting its full potential in contributing to the
agricultural productivity.

Punjab's commitment to reform water sector had enjoyed a rich history of initiatives and policy changes
starting with the National Drainage Program (NDP) jointly financed by the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). Although the program
achieved modest results, it set forth a series of reforms in Punjab in particular for the Irrigation and Power
Department (IPD). In 2004, the reforms agenda received an added boost with the change in provincial

1 During 1988-2004 IMF supported ten programs in Pakistan. All of these, except the last two, suffered from substantial policy
slippages. Of the SDR 4.7 billion committed during 1988­2004, 55 percent was not drawn as programs went off-track soon after
their start. Programs were either extended to accommodate delays in the completion of reviews, or were ended prematurely, to be
replaced by new arrangements. In contrast, both the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) and the 2001 three-year arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were successfully completed without any extensions.

leadership and a new "reform minded" team placed the water sector amongst the province's key
development priorities. The Chief Minister appointed a senior level Committee with Chairman Planning
and Development Board as its head and key members of the provincial departments including Finance,
Agriculture, Environment and Irrigation to develop a comprehensive Irrigation Sector Reforms Program
along with an implementable action plan. The Committee's key achievement was setting out a long-term
vision for the irrigation sector and finalizing a strategy for implementation of the Punjab Irrigation Sector
Reforms Program (PISRP). The PISRP built on extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders
within and outside of the government as well as the World Bank and other multi- and bi-lateral donors
active in the sector. The strategic vision for PISRP supported both a focus on institutional and policy
reforms as well as on critical investment for rehabilitation and system improvement. The PISRP was
designed to address the key fiscal, institutional and sector issues and was aligned with the Bank's Country
Water Resources Assistance Strategy (CWRAS) for Pakistan ­(Grey cover Report No. 34081-PK, dated
November 14, 2005).

To support the GOPunjab in its major reforms agenda for improving fiscal management and service
delivery, the World Bank agreed to support a series of Development Policy Loans (DPL) over a period of
three years from 2006 to 2008. Based on the past experience, both GOPunjab and the Bank agreed that
new approaches and instruments will be needed to meet the diverse set of challenges facing the water
sector. The DPL instrument was therefore considered a more suitable instrument for supporting the
reform agenda set out in the PISRP. In addition, the DPL series was in line with the priorities of the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2006 to 2009. The DPL was informed by the
lessons learnt during the previous CAS period, including among others: the need for a programmatic
approach which provides the flexibility to support reforms while managing risk; greater attention to
capacity building; and the need to focus on results.

The 2006-09 CAS sought to deliver a substantial increase in the volume of lending to Pakistan based on
the Government's priorities for sustaining growth and accelerating poverty reduction. The Irrigation
Sector DPL was specifically identified in the CAS and directly contributed to the following CAS
outcomes: (i) improved management of irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (ii) improved irrigation
service delivery through increased participatory management and cost recovery; (iii) and transparent and
more equitable water allocation and distribution. The specific CAS milestones and indicators of progress
towards the above outcomes included: (i) preparation of Asset Management Plan with increased funding
for M&R; (ii) establishment of Farmer Organizations and collection of Abiana4; and (iii) reduction in
water losses at on-farm channels. These CAS outcomes and indicators were directly supported by the
DPL and were included in Policy Matrix along with baselines and targets.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The purpose of the Punjab Irrigation DPL series was to support the Government of Punjab's medium term
Irrigation Sector Reform Program (PISRP). The key pillars of the PISRP were: (i) Institutional and policy
reforms to improve the management and maintenance of the irrigation system to ensure its long term
sustainability; (ii) Water resources management reforms to make intra-province water allocation and
distribution more transparent; (iii) Irrigation service delivery reforms to improve the quality, efficiency
and accountability with which irrigation services are delivered; and (iv) Reforms to improve water use
efficiency and on-farm productivity. The key pillars and objectives of the reforms program supported
through DPL series are described in section 1.4.

The key elements of the PISRP that were supported under the DPL included: (i) public finance reforms to
increase public spending and its efficiency for key priority sectors while ensuring fiscal sustainability; (ii)
reforms that strengthen devolution and service delivery, and (iii) reforms that improve the fiduciary and
governance environment. Achievements against indicators and targets for DPL 1 and 2 are given in
Tables 1 and 2 in Section 2.1 below.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The Development Objectives were not revised during implementation.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

The series of two DPLs supported GOPunjab's PISRP under the following four pillars:

Pillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms: to improve the management and maintenance of the
irrigation system to ensure its long term physical and financial sustainability
Outcomes: Hydraulic infrastructure progressively made safer and sustainable; enhanced financial
accountability of the executive assured.

Pillar II: Water Resource Management Reforms: to emphasize the nexus of entitlements, measurements and
transparency and build on Punjab's existing platform of water entitlements to make intra-province water
allocations and distribution more transparent, and to ultimately extend the system of entitlements to
groundwater as well.
Outcomes: Capacity and system created for transparent administration of water entitlements and
sustainable management of water resources.

Pillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms: to improve the quality, efficiency and accountability with which
irrigation services are delivered.
Outcomes: Improved equity of water distribution in accordance with entitlements. Delivery Performance
Ratio ­DPR (ratio of authorized and actual discharges at the head and tail outlets increased from 50%
(baseline in FY06) to 75% by FY08 for distributary canals for which IMTAs were signed and physical
improvements implemented.

Pillar IV: Reforms: to encourage new technology to improve water use efficiency and on-farm productivity
Outcomes: Increase in water productivity, employment and incomes of participating farmers. Water use
efficiency (field application efficiency) 25% to 40% increase, depending on the kinds of technologies
applied on the plots in FY08; Diversification and shift into high-value crops.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

None of the policy areas were revised during the implementation of the DPL program.

1.6 Other significant changes

Originally a series of 3 DPLs were envisaged. DPL 1 was followed by DPL 2 as planned, however DPL 3
did not materialize due to adverse changes in Pakistan's macro economic conditions.

2.1 Program Performance

Since the start of PISRP in FY05/06, there has been good progress in reducing the back-log of deferred
maintenance, making intra-province water allocation and distribution more transparent; and improving
service delivery in canals with O&M transferred to farmers. The first two years of the PISRP supported
under the DPL 1 and 2 witnessed progress under all pillars.

Below are the highlights of key achievements:

(i)      A complete inventory of the IPD's assets and assessment of deferred maintenance and
         rehabilitation needs was prepared;

(ii)     Yardsticks for estimating budget requirements for routine and preventive maintenance were
         rationalized;

(iii)    Against a target of 5% reduction in deferred maintenance, the DPL 1 achieved 6.6% reduction
         while by the end of DPL 2 the cumulative reduction in deferred maintenance reached 14.5%.
         Subsequently, during FY 2007-08 Rs 7.41 billion were spent on rehabilitation of irrigation and
         drainage systems and barrages, and Rs 2.06 billion on M&R, which together constituted
         approximately 7.9% of the accumulated deferred maintenance. During FY 2008-09 Rs 6.32
         billion were spent on rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems and barrages, and Rs 2.65
         billion on M&R, which together constituted about 7.5% of the accumulated deferred
         maintenance. More recently, in the FY 2009-10, Rs 4.53 billion have been spent on rehabilitation
         and Rs 2.8 billion on M&R, which together constituted approximately 6.1% of the accumulated
         deferred maintenance. With this performance, the total reduction in deferred maintenance has
         amounted to around 21.5%;

(iv)     A two-fold increase was achieved in maintenance and repair (M&R) budget. There has been a
         continued trend in M&R allocation over the past three years after completion of the DPL series ­
         the allocation for FY 2008-09 was Rs 2.453 billion; for FY 2009-10 the allocation was Rs 3.04
         billion and for FY 10-11 Rs 3.088 billion;

(v)      The M&R cost sharing policy was formulated with public sector financing and users'
         contribution;

(vi)     Delivery Performance Ratio ­ DPR (ratio of actual and authorized discharge at the head and tail
         outlets) of distributaries were being measured by Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit
         (PMIU). DPR values showed improvement in equity of distribution of water. DPR values in LCC
         East & West, LBDC, Eastern Sadiqia, and CRBC showed improvement, and average relative
         DPR was 0.87 for Kharif 2007 as compared to 0.78 for Kharif 2006

(vii)    The non performing saline groundwater tubewells were closed and divesture of public sector
         owned tubewells and their closure/ transition was achieved;

(viii)   Electricity billing for the year 2007-08 reduced by Rs. 462 Million as compared to 2005-06.

(ix)     A system for M&R performance evaluation was established and made operational;



                                                    4
(x)      IPD launched a website and prepared a communications strategy to ensure that reforms are better
         understood and supported; beneficiary feedback, especially from tail-end users, was incorporated
         in IPD media campaigns;

(xi)     A new procurement unit to oversee implementation of new projects was established;

(xii)    The financial management capacity and accountability of IPD was enhanced; and

(xiii)   Substantial reduction (45%) in the backlog of advance audit observations was achieved.

The Table 1 above shows that overall good progress has been made towards the program targets set under
the GOPunjab's PISRP. In summary, it is now evident that:

·   There was an increased emphasis on moving away from past policy of build-neglect-rebuild, which
    resulted in gradual deterioration of the hydraulic infrastructure in the past. The budget for M&R and
    for rehabilitation as well its utilization increased substantially and the Asset Management Plan was
    fully funded. Some of the interventions covered the entire system like improved transparency in water
    distribution, metering/monitoring of the entire canal system; increased budget allocation for M&R;
    Quality control on implementation of M&R works, reduction in backlog of audit paras, management
    of environmental and social risks, watercourse improvement etc. While the implementation of Asset
    Management Plan over the entire system may take more than 10 years, rehabilitation works have been
    completed on (i) Taunsa Barrage; and (ii) LCC East Canal. Further rehabilitation works are under
    progress on: (i) Balloki Barrage; (ii) LCC West; (iii) Lower Bari Doab; and (iv) Bahawalpur, DG
    Khan and Faisalabad zone. In addition, rehabilitation and up gradation of Jinnah Barrage is about to
    start while rehabilitation/up gradation of following structures is in the pipeline: (i) Islam Barrage; (ii)
    Khanki Barrage; (iii) Suleimanki Barrage; (iv) Trimmu Barrage; (v) Panjnad Barrage; (vi) Pakpattan
    Canal; and (vii) Thal Canal system.
·   The intra-province water entitlements were made more transparent. Punjab embraced the principle of
    "what is not measured is not managed" and the province embarked on the process to make
    administration of water entitlements progressively more transparent with information on entitlements
    and actual delivery made readily available for distributary canals.
·   The IPD's communication strategy focused on internal and external communications of the reforms
    program and IPD's ability to seek and incorporate feedback of stakeholders in particular farmers at
    the tail-end of the system.
·   The quality, efficiency and accountability of irrigation services improved in the areas served by
    canals where reforms were implemented. The number of FOs increased dramatically from 3 in FY05
    to 186 and the DPR values improved. However,
·   The Abiana collection performance in non FO areas improved to 70% of the assessed amount. While
    in the FO areas there was a downward trend. This was due to a number of factors including the socio-
    political setting and a general lack of recognition of the FOs by the local administrative set-up and
    support from local administration and police. Another factor contributing to decline in Abiana
    collection in FOs areas was the overall shortage of water; when farmers did not receive allocated
    share there was an increased reluctant to pay Abiana.
·   Investments in water conservation technologies proceeded on or were ahead of targets with visible
    improvement in water use efficiency and productivity.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

There was high level of political and administrative commitment towards the reform program and the
implementation of the DPL program proceeded smoothly. As the DPL series culminated, there were
significant changes including the political transitions at federal and provincial levels and a sizeable
downturn in the country's economic growth rate ­ the later leading to abandonment of the third DPL. The
good implementation progress of the DPL series resulted from a combination of factors:

Commitment of the government for reforms program: The PISRP was an ambitious agenda, but one
with equally high level of commitment within the bureaucracy as well as in the political leadership and
the farming community. The GOPunjab's ownership of the reforms was evident from a number of steps
taken to support the program including formulation of a high level Inter-Departmental Reforms Steering
Committee headed by the Chairman Planning and Development and reporting directly to the Chief
Minister's office. This raised not only the profile of the reforms program but also steered high impacts
decisions including scaling up of irrigation management transfers to farmer organizations from one to
three new canal systems and a near doubling of resources allocated for maintenance and repairs as well as
system rehabilitation and performance audits.

From the outset of the PISRP, there was an alignment in the senior political management and
bureaucracy, which facilitated implementation. The interest from the highest level official including Chief
Minister, Chief Secretary and the Chairman Planning and Development Board kept the momentum of
reforms. The IPD and PIDA teams were forward looking and continuity of management teams at the
IPD/PIDA and at Planning and Development Board amplified government's seriousness towards the
reforms. At the same time, high level interest by the Finance Department helped maintain the integrity of
the reforms program.

Also resulting from the seriousness of government's commitment was the emerging transparency of water
entitlements with a robust communication and MIS system that sought and incorporated feedback from
farmers at tail-end of the system to evaluate program effectiveness. Similarly, the GOPunjab in its efforts
to support the reforms program took note of the federal government's announcement of a perverse
subsidy for electric tubewells that required 50% of the costs to be borne by provincial governments. The
GOPunjab took a bold step by suspending the tubewells power subsidy and making a detailed revision of
its implementation in the province.

Regularity of dialogue with the stakeholders: The reforms program experienced a continuous and
transparent exchange of issues and information at all levels not only with the IPD and PIDA officials but
also with the AWBs and FOs. This ensured credibility and predictability of Bank's financing.
Participation of stakeholders remained central to the reforms with an extensive consultation process
undertaken from the design stages of PISRP. Open dialogue with water users/farmers, during the process
of social mobilization for establishing FOs and capacity building activities, and implementation of a
comprehensive communication strategy was an integral part of the reform process. Similarly, a valuable
relationship between the Bank and the GOPunjab was enabled as the DPL series allowed for focus on
policy level discussions, and adding value on the direction of reforms rather than the micro aspects of
implementation.

The regular dialogue also created an enabling environment for donor harmonization and facilitated the
inter-agency donor coordination amongst the Bank with other donors including ADB, Japan and the
Netherlands Government. The Bank closely coordinated with full alignment on the sector assistance
strategy, with these partners resulting in complementary programs such as the ADB financed multi
tranche financing facility (MFF) for a Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Program (PIAIP) with


                                                    20
an estimated cost of US$900 million. Similarly, in 2005, the Netherlands Government approved a
Pakistan- specific free standing trust fund for supporting Bank Group's advisory services and technical
assistance in the water sector, which also contributed to technical assistance for Punjab's irrigation
reforms program. The PISRP also benefited from the reforms supported by ADB under the Punjab
Resource Management Program. In addition, ADB provided technical assistance for preparation of IPD's
Modernization Program and preparing the framework for Integrated Water Resource Management.

Design appropriateness of the reforms program: The four reforms pillars were responsive to the
prevailing challenges of water and irrigation sector in Punjab and were designed with a focus to address
development priorities of the provincial government. In particular, the challenge of long term physical
and financial sustainability of Punjab's irrigation infrastructure guided the PISRP strategy of improving
asset management and progressively reducing the accumulated deferred maintenance; reducing operating
and administrative costs; rationalizing and improving recovery of Abiana through user participation in
assessment and collection; implementing a more transparent policy for sharing cost of M&R (budgetary
allocations and user charges); and developing institutional capacity for efficient M&R with due regard to
social and environmental aspects. Similarly, with the aim to improve irrigation service delivery, the
PISRP adopted measures such as decentralization of responsibilities to FOs as well as contractual
arrangements for delivery of bulk water supplies, whereby rights and responsibilities were clarified and
accountability mechanisms improved, and an effective strategy to communicate with stakeholders both
within and outside the IPD.

In addition, the Bank financed DPL series was designed to contribute towards the outcomes specified in
the Country Assistance Strategy for 2006-09 and was specifically identified therein. The CAS milestones
and indicators for progress assessment included preparing asset management plans with increased
allocations for maintenance and repairs; establishing FOs and collection of Abiana; and visible reduction
in water losses at on-farm channels. These CAS milestones were directly supported by the DPL and were
part of the Policy Matrix along with baselines and targets. This alignment provided reciprocity to the
GOPunjab's reform program and strengthened its implementation arrangements.

Assessment of risks to the program and effectiveness of mitigation measures: The reforms program
remained cognizant to a number of sectoral challenges and designed specific strategies to mitigate key
risks. At the time of processing of the first development policy loan the history of uneven high level
support to the irrigation reform agenda was identified as a high risk. However, GOPunjab remained
strongly committed to the reform program, which continued to receive strong political support. Water
users/farmers also continued to participate in the implementation of reforms with enthusiasm and
witnessing the positive outcomes of participatory irrigation management. The change of political
government in 2008 and the subsequent abolition of local governments did create a slowdown effect on
the reforms program. However, the current government in Punjab retains commitment to prioritizing
irrigation investments. Nevertheless, while there have not been any public statements against the reforms
­ in particular the PIDA ­ no further expansion of decentralized irrigation management took place and the
FOs formation process has also stalled.

Similarly, a significant risk at appraisal was related to staff redundancies resulting from the devolution of
O&M responsibilities to FOs coupled with anti-reform lobbying by those who may stand to lose as a
result of the reforms (e.g. farmers who benefit from the current inequities in water deliveries) may bring
to bear political pressures on the government to slow down the process of change. The GOPunjab
mitigated this risk by adopting a strategy of natural attrition as well as retraining and redeployment. The
redundant staff were not to lose employment rather they would either be absorbed in other vacant
positions within IPD or transferred to the provincial "surplus pool" where they would continue to receive
salaries and benefits until retirement. In addition, another significant risk was IPD's capacity for
managing social and environmental issues associated with asset management activities. This risk was


                                                     21
partly addressed through training inputs for strengthening IPD's, AWB's and FOs institutional capacity
on these issues. Particular attention was given to addressing issues associated with canal closures required
for maintenance and rehabilitation activities. The Social and Environmental Management Unit (SEMU)
was provided with additional staff for conducting initial social assessments (ISAs) and social screening of
M&R and rehabilitation works. The screening procedures and guidelines for ISAs were developed by
SEMU as part of the social and environmental guidelines.

External factors contributing to continuation of program: Deterioration of macroeconomic conditions
placed heavy burden on continuation of all provincial reforms and became the basis for discontinuity of
the third year program. Although the policy stance of the government has remained appropriate, inflation
and external trade deficit indicate significant excess liquidity in the economy, and call for resolute actions
to contain money supply and improve export competitiveness. While evaluating the performance of the
DPL program, the wider economic context needs also to be considered, as a combination of factors that
impacted the economic conditions in the country. The period between 2007 and 2010 witnessed mounting
economic problems with fiscal deficits and an energy crisis followed by the recent massive floods.. Given
the resource constraints, and the low levels of revenue generation, there could be renewed pressure on the
irrigation management system to raise Abiana rates, as well as collection efficiency and intensity.
Moreover, the 2010 floods added to the challenges of water infrastructure across the country. The floods
Damage Needs Assessment9 estimated that an expenditure of approximately US$ 10 billion will be
required for the recovery, rehabilitation and medium- to long-term reconstruction process. The cumulative
irrigation and flood management reconstruction costs are estimated at US$ 982 million with
approximately US$ 51 for reconstruction in Punjab.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design
In accordance with the government's program approach, the government of Punjab selected a few
relevant and focused outcome indicators corresponding to each of the four Pillars. The outcome indicators
had set targets against which baseline information was identified. Progress monitoring against the
outcome indicators was carried out through various means including:

i. Monitoring by the Strategic Planning and Reform Unit (SPRU):
The SPRU was established consisting of four teams, one each for the oversight of the four pillars. These
pillar teams were responsible for day to day monitoring and follow up actions. The SPRU was primarily
responsible for: (a) strategic planning and implementation of the reform program; (b) monitoring and
reporting on the key performance monitoring indicators; (c) maintaining close oversight of the progress of
all aspects of the reform program, including among others:
     - Arrangements for M&E, including third party validation;
     - Expansion of capacity for social mobilization for establishing FOs;
     - Preparation of a communication strategy and its implementation;
     - Building capacity for social and environmental assessment;
     - Operationalizing the Irrigation Management Information System (IMIS);
     - Preparation and implementation of a groundwater strategy;
     - Surface water quality monitoring program; and
     - Preparation of progress reports.

ii. Monitoring by a Website Oversight and Monitoring Committee (WOMC)
The WOMC was headed by the Secretary IPD and included representatives of Agriculture Department,
FOs, RSPs, representatives of the academia and civil society, and PIDA officials involved in social
mobilization for establishing FOs. The WOMC ensured that the information provided on IPD website is
easily accessible, user friendly, clear, accurate and regularly updated.

iii. Monitoring by the Inter-Departmental Steering Committee (IDSC)
The IDSC was headed by the Chairman, Planning and Development Board (P&D) with Senior Member
Board of Revenue, Secretaries of Finance, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment Protection
Departments, and Member Engineering (P&D), as its members. The IDSC provided strategic and policy
guidance and monitored the overall outcomes of the DPL program. The Secretary IPD was the secretary
to the IDSC and the forum met at least once every quarter or more frequently if the issues requiring
resolution were submitted for its consideration.

iv. Independent Third Party Surveys (ITPS)
The SPRU commissioned independent consultants to conduct Third Party Surveys to verify
implementation of program interventions and evaluate outputs and outcomes through random surveys as
well as case studies, including the following monitorable indicators, inter alia:
    - The equity (measured by the delivery performance ratios ­DPR), timeliness of water distribution
        amongst members of FOs, cost sharing and O&M arrangements, and performance on collection
        of Abiana;
    - The performance of IPD/AWBs and FOs in M&R of the irrigation system;
    - Performance Evaluation/Engineering Audit of M&R works
    - Functioning of FOs (meeting, participation, performance of executive committees; how decisions
        are made; internal information flows; book keeping), financial viability and sustainability; and
    - Impact on small farmers, women, tenants, and landless.

v. Monitoring by the Agriculture Department
The Agriculture Department was involved in implementation of the Pillar IV of the DPL program and
collected data for monitoring indicators set for Pillar IV. The information collected and assessment of
progress and results was collated with the progress reporting for the remaining of the program by
providing details to the SPRU that was responsible for preparing progress reports for the overall reforms
program.

M&E Implementation
The SPRU continued to perform its key monitoring responsibilities for regular progress reporting
including preparation of: (i) an annual internal monitoring and evaluation report; (ii) annual O&M
evaluation report for M&R works; and (iii) quarterly progress reports for DPL reforms activities. In
addition, a Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) was established which continues to
monitor equity and transparency in water allocations and distributions.

A key achievement of the PMIU has been establishment of a website linked under the IPD's website
which provides information about accounts of 24 main canals regarding entitlements, deliveries and
balance shares. This has enhanced IPD's capacity for transparent administration of water entitlements and
sustainable management of water resources. The data on the website continues to be updated every 10
days. The website also provides online complaint tracking facility. PMIU is also managing a Toll Free
Number for the water shareholders to register their complaints regarding water distribution, water theft
and other related issues. The WOMC, headed by the Secretary IPD with representatives from FOs and



                                                   23
other water users, is also continuing to function and monitors quality of the information provided on the
IPD website so that it is readily accessible, user friendly, clear and accurate.

Another key achievement of the DPL program was establishment of the Inter-Departmental Steering
Committee (IDSC). During the DPL series this Committee convened several meetings and actively
participated in providing policy guidance and monitored overall outcomes of the DPL Program.

M&E Utilization
The data collected through the PMIU and SPRU monitoring system served several purposes. For the first
time IPD was able to win the trust of farmers and other water users by making available on the IPD
website the delivery performance ratio (DPR) at the head and tail outlets of distributaries in LCC East.
The data was collected by PIDA and PMIU and verified by Third Party Consultants. As a result the DPR
values in head and tail reaches indicated increases in supplies to tail end farmers. IPD is continuing the
good practice of joint measurement of discharges at head of distributaries by IPD and FOs where FOs are
regularly monitoring the discharges of outlets. PIDA and PMIU officials consult with FOs whenever
corrective measures are needed. These steps have resulted in improved equity of water distribution. FOs
resolved more than 2,800 disputes including some 1,758 disputes related to unauthorized water use/ water
theft. IPD also commissioned independent third party surveys to verify implementation of program
interventions and assess improved equity of distribution. In this regard, Third Party Monitoring of DPR
values in FO managed channels, case studies of FOs, and performance evaluation ­ engineering audits of
M&R works ­ were carried out by the independent consultants.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

Originally a series of 3 DPLs were envisaged. The Third DPL was under preparation in 2008 when
deterioration in the macro-economic situation of Pakistan, warranted a re-evaluation of continuing with
the DPL series and ultimately resulted in the cancelation of the third DPL in June 2009. However,
dialogue with the GOPunjab continued on the need for furthering the reforms program by exploring
options for replacing DPL with a Results-Based Lending operation. A Bank mission visited Punjab in
December 2008 to discuss the status of GOPunjab's Irrigation Sector Program, and identify a framework
for Bank's support for a medium term sector program building on the achievements already made under
past programs, including the DPL series.

The GOPunjab and Bank team agreed that while the implementation of first phase of the reform has
brought about significant positive changes and outcomes, numerous challenges remain, and Punjab is still
far from realizing the full potential of its water resources and irrigation infrastructure. In particular, the
areas for future programming need to include:

·   Strengthening the overall institutional architecture for water management in the province to make it
    conducive for integrated planning and management of water resources;
·   Whereas a modest start has been made in addressing water quality and groundwater issues, these
    technical areas need further concerted attention;
·   The irrigation/water research institutions need to be strengthened to bridge the current knowledge gap
    in this vital area; and
·   Exploring the scope for increased water use efficiency and productivity through policies and
    incentives for water markets and public private partnerships (PPP).




                                                     24
While the DPL series achieved progress in strengthening irrigation institutional management, during the
renewed dialogue with GOPunjab, the proposed framework was overshadowed by the Government's
focus on elections and later the new Government's need to win broad-based political support and the
rising security threats in the country. The discussion on policy-based lending program for Punjab
irrigation had to be deferred as project preparation slowed down during the political transition and
creditworthiness considerations eliminated Pakistan's access to IBRD financing.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design and implementation of the DPL program remained valid throughout the program.
The past experience of Bank with investment projects including the National Drainage Program had
shown that policy reforms require support beyond sector line ministries. Development Policy Loan served
as an appropriate instrument to facilitate policy dialogue, attention, and decisions at the highest levels of
government. The GOPunjab's PISRP required significant financing; and the DPL instrument managed to
influence government's financing levels for the sector by providing the necessary budget support in a
timely manner.

In addition, the Irrigation Sector DPL was specifically identified in the 2006-09 CAS, which sought to
deliver a substantial increase in the volume of lending to Pakistan during the next four years. The DPL
contributed to the following outcomes in line with the Bank's CAS: improved management of irrigation
and drainage infrastructure; improved irrigation service delivery through increased participatory
management and cost recovery; and transparent and more equitable water allocation and distribution. The
milestones and indicators of progress towards the above outcomes included: preparation of Asset
Management Plans and increased funding for M&R; establishment of Farmer Organizations and
collection of Abiana; and reduction in water losses at on-farm channels. These CAS outcomes and
indicators were directly supported by the DPL.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Punjab Irrigation Development Policy Loan (DPL 1)
The initial monitoring of the DPL Program indicated that the hydraulic infrastructure was progressively
being made safer and sustainable; there was a sizable increase in M&R budget and investments to take
care of deferred maintenance of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. Operation and maintenance of
distribution system in LCC East; LCC west and CRBC were handed over to FOs, who were also made
responsible for collection of Abiana. The collection of Abiana in FO areas was initially higher as
compared to non-FO areas, which was envisaged to contribute to financial sustainability. FOs in LCC
East carried out maintenance and repairs work of distributaries out of their 40% share of water charges
and are reported to have spent over Rs. 12 Million on O&M. However, later the Abiana collection
performance in non FO areas improved to 70% of the assessed amount. While in the FO areas there was a
downward trend. This was due to a number of factors including the socio-political setting and a general
lack of recognition of the FOs by the local administrative set-up and support from local administration
and police. Another factor contributing to decline in Abiana collection in FOs areas was the overall
shortage of water; when farmers did not receive allocated share there was an increased reluctant to pay
Abiana.

Capacity and system was created for transparent administration of water entitlements and sustainable
management of water resources. Water accounts for 24 main canals regarding entitlements, deliveries &



                                                     25
balance share were posted on the website. Data on the website was being updated on 10 daily bases.
Distributary discharge data was posted on the IPD website.

Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR) of distributaries in LCC East were measured by PIDA and PMIU and
verified by third party consultants. PIDA completed the baseline pre condition survey of all channels in
LCC (East) Circle. The observations by PMIU indicated that the average DPR for April to September
2006 was 0.64 in Burala Division; 0.65 in Upper Gugera; 0.85 in Lower Gugera and 0.68 in Khanki
Division. The overall average DPR in LCC East system was 0.71.

In addition, unnecessary burden of operating public sector drainage tubewells was reduced through an
Action plan based on the assessment of the field conditions and TW performance. Joint measurement of
discharges at head of distributaries by IPD and FOs was started. The FOs started regular monitoring of
the discharges of outlets and coordinated with PIDA M&E staff for corrections. These practices only
improved equity of water distribution but also strengthened FOs to themselves address the issues of
unauthorized water use/ water theft. Preliminary Department of Agriculture (DoA) estimates indicated
that 5014 watercourses improved in 2005-06 saved about 0.81 MAF, which was estimated to have
resulted in 15% increase in cropped area and 26% increase in cropping intensity in the command of
improved watercourses. About 3.23 million person months of direct and 3.9 person months of indirect
employment were created due to the National Program for Watercourse Improvement. An average
increase of 24% in yield is attributed to improvement of watercourses. 500 Laser units were provided to
the service providers during 2005-06 which carried out leveling of 29,419 ha up to end October 2006. The
land leveling is estimated to increase the irrigated area by 2% (588 ha) due to reduced length of field
ditches and dikes. A 20% increase in crop yields is estimated for the leveled area.

The specific achievements under various pillars of DPL 1 included:

Pillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms:
(i)      M&R Budget was allocated according to revised yardsticks. Rs. 2.136 billion was allocated in
         the FY06/07 M&R budget on the basis of revised yardsticks as compared to the allocation of Rs
         1.2 billion in FY05/06.
(ii)     1,617 saline tubewells were closed as of February 2007. Notice for closure of 550 FGW
         tubewells as of October 2007 was issued. The annual electricity payment for electricity in 2007-
         08 was reduced by Rs 461.98 million as compared to Rs 941.9 million in 2005-06.
(iii)    System of fortnightly (twice monthly average) meetings of the Departmental Accounts
         Committee (DAC) was institutionalized. 20.7% of the back-logs of advance audit observations
         were reviewed and resolved during the DPL 1.
(iv)     Performance on Abiana collection in non-FO canals for Rabi 2005-06 increased from 52% to
         58% of the assessed amount. In FO managed areas the Abiana collection for Rabi 2005-06 was
         78%.
(v)      During 2005-06 GOPunjab spent Rs 6.45 billion on rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage
         system and barrages, which constitutes about 6.6% reduction in the accumulated deferred
         maintenance of Rs 120 billion in FY06.
(vi)     Performance Evaluation system for M&R was approved by GOPunjab and its implementation
         started.
(vii)    A realistic and transparent policy for M&R cost sharing between budgetary allocations and user
         charges for various tiers of the system was approved by the Government.

Pillar II: Water Resource Management Reforms:
(i)      IPD posted water accounts for 24 main canals regarding entitlements, deliveries & balance share
         on the websites on its website www.punjab.gov.pk and http://irrigation.punjab.gov.pk Data on the
         website is updated on 10 daily basis.


                                                   26
(ii)    Installation of flow metering gauges in the LCC East AWB was completed. Distributary
        discharge data was posted on IPD website.
(iii)   Surface Water Quality Monitoring Plan defined and its implementation started.
(iv)    A GW Management Plan was completed. The plan envisaged pilot groundwater management
        schemes including: stakeholder participation; economic incentives; strengthening of knowledge
        base and regulatory measures. GW information was made available on the web site of
        Government of Punjab http://irrigation.punjab.gov.pk. FOs in LCC East started water depth and
        quality groundwater monitoring. Monitoring of biological and toxic parameters was introduced in
        the monitoring of groundwater quality in the pilot zones to anticipate possible health hazards and
        undertake resource protection measures.
(v)     Criteria for : i) allocating additional water that becomes available under the Accord, and ii)
        sharing water shortages among canal commands, was prepared and made public.
(vi)    Water accounts for all distributary canals in LCC east were posted on IPD website and updated
        every 10 days

Pillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms:
(i)      A Strategic Planning and Reform Unit (SPRU) was established in IPD. The Unit prepared
         internal M&E reports of the Reform Program.
(ii)     A Communication strategy was prepared.
(iii)    IMTAs were signed with 103 FOs.
(iv)     To raise awareness of environmental and social risks, guidelines were developed for their
         identification and control in operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure.
(v)      LCC (East) AWB was made operational and two new AWBs (LCC West and LBDC) were
         notified.
(vi)     Rehabilitation of 80 channels in LCC east AWB managed by 27 FOs was carried out.
(vii)    Benchmarking system for FOs was introduced by PIDA.

Pillar IV: Reforms to encourage new technology to improve water use efficiency and on-farm
productivity:
(i)     Water conservation programs of watercourse improvement and provision of Land Laser Leveling
        continued and following targets were met:
        · 5,014 Water Courses were improved
        · 500 Laser Leveler Units delivered
        x Project proposal prepared for promoting pressurized irrigation systems
        x The actions relating to Amendment of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Ordinance, 1978;
            Restructuring of research and preparation of models of economic incentives (cost sharing,
            matching grant, regulations, policies, institutions) were pursued outside the ambit of DPL.

Second Punjab Irrigation Development Policy Loan (DPL 2)
The initial monitoring of the DPL Program indicated that the hydraulic infrastructure is progressively
being made safer and sustainable; there was a sizable increase in M&R budget and investments to take
care of deferred maintenance of irrigation and drainage infrastructure.

Capacity and system has been created for transparent administration of water entitlements and sustainable
management of water resources. Water accounts for main and distributary canals regarding entitlements,
deliveries & balance share continued to be posted on website. Data on the website was updated on 10-
daily basis.

Delivery Performance Ratio ­ DPR (ratio of actual and authorized discharge at the head and tail outlets)
of distributaries were being measured by Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU). DPR



                                                     27
values showed improvement in equity of distribution of water. DPR values in LCC East & West, LBDC,
Eastern Sadiqia, and CRBC showed improvement, and average relative DPR was 0.87 for Kharif 2007 as
compared to 0.78 for Kharif 2006. The DPR values were verified by third party consultants.

Based on the pragmatic assessment of the field conditions and existing drainage needs; 2,777 public
sector tubewells were closed/transitioned. The operative tubewells were transferred to the farmers at
token price ­ as virtuous incentive - for supplementing irrigation supplies from canals.

The impact of physical and management interventions on irrigation systems was monitored using RS/GIS
tools.The preliminary findings of the study included:
    · Improvement of overall ETa in cropping year 2006 ­ 07.
    · Low spatial coefficient of variation (CV) in the cropping year 2006 ­ 07 which depicted better
        equity in the water distribution due to Reforms.

Department of Agriculture (DoA) estimates indicate that improved watercourses have resulted in
improved delivery of irrigation water supplies to the farmers fields thereby leading to enhanced
agricultural production. DoA has estimated that improvement of watercourses has resulted in reducing
seepage losses by about 1.049 MAF. Additional crop production due to watercourse improvement has
been estimated by DoA as follows: Wheat 928,000 Tons, Rice 175,000 Tons, Cotton 96000 Tons,
Sugarcane 1.56 million Tons and Maize 128,000 Tons. About 3.23 million person months of direct and
3.9 person months of indirect employment were reported to have been created as a result of
implementation of the National Program for Watercourse Improvement.

Some 1500 Laser units were provided to the service providers since the start of the Program in FY 05/06.
As of June 30, 2007, land leveling of 634,613 acres (256,928 ha) acres was carried out. DoA estimated
that land leveling resulted in saving of about 140,000 AF in field losses due to reduced length of field
ditches and dikes and is estimated to increase the irrigated area by about 3750 ha and additional crop
production of about 138,000 Tons.

The specific achievements under various pillars of DPL 2 included:

Pillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms:
(i)      A 10 - year Asset Management Plan (AMP) was prepared and its implementation started for
         improving the integrity of existing assets of IPD by progressively reducing, and ultimately
         eliminating the large back log of deferred maintenance through (a) allocation of adequate
         resources for M&R, reflecting realistic yardsticks, for improved upkeep of the system; (b)
         allocation of adequate resources for system rehabilitation in the development budget in
         accordance with the MTFB; and (c) making efficient, transparent, and judicious use of resources
         from both sources, in accordance with priorities. The total cost of AMP was estimated as Rs 132
         billion. As per requirements of the AMP, the government spent Rs 8.8 billion during 2005-06 and
         Rs 11 billion in FY 05/07 and allocated Rs 15.9 billion in FY 07/08. The cumulative expenditure
         by the end of FY 08 will amount to Rs 35.7 billion (27%) of the total requirements of AMP.
         Punjab Government assured that adequate funding will continue to be provided for implementing
         the Asset Management Plan through ADP, PSDP and funding from the World Bank, ADB and
         JBIC.

(ii)   Yardsticks for allocation of M&R budgets were revised and approved by government. The
       revised yardsticks were based on market prices instead of the CSR, as was the case earlier and are
       to be revised annually on the basis of market rates. Budgetary allocations for M&R for FY05/06
       were increased from Rs 1.2 billion to Rs 2 billion; an amount of Rs. Rs . 2.371 billion were
       allocated for M&R during FY07/08.


                                                  28
(iii)    1,577non-performing saline tubewells and about 1200 FGW tubewells were closed. 418 FGW
         TWs were transitioned through transfer mode. The annual electricity payment in 2007-08 was
         reduced by Rs 461.98 million as compared to Rs 941.9 million in 2005-06.

(iv)     System of fortnightly (twice monthly average) meetings of the Departmental Accounts
         Committee (DAC) continued. In the two years of the DPL Program 45% of the cumulative back-
         log of advance audit observations was reviewed and resolved.

(v)      As part of its policy to decentralize and improve irrigation service delivery, 183 FOs on
         distributary canals in 4 canal systems were established and irrigation management transfer
         agreements (IMTAs) signed with each of them. FOs were empowered to collect and retain a part
         of the Abiana. IPD continued with capacity building of FOs on various skills and activities
         (O&M/M&R planning, contract management, water measurement, business planning, Abiana
         collection, accounting and conflict resolution, etc).

(vi)     The government prepared a strategy for improving Abiana collection in areas where FOs had not
         been established. As a result not only the declining trend was arrested but also Abiana collection
         improved to 70% in Kharif 2006 as compared to 47% in 2005-06.

(vii)    The government introduced a more realistic and transparent policy for M&R cost sharing
         between budgetary allocations and user charges for various tiers of the system.

(viii)   The IPD developed institutional arrangements for implementation of rehabilitation and M&R
         works. A Performance Evaluation System for M&R works prepared during 2005-06 was
         implemented. IPD appointed consultants for third party monitoring of M&R works.

(ix)     IPD carried out a detailed institutional analysis to review the organizational setup, functions,
         procedures and human and financial resources required, and to identify key areas for institutional
         reform. Preparation of a modernization Plan for the Department was started with technical
         assistance from ADB.

(x)      IPD established Units for financial monitoring and procurement. Notices of contracts worth Rs
         0.5 million for M&R works and Rs 10 million for ADP works were placed on the website.

Pillar II: Water Resource Management Reforms:
(i)      Water accounts for 24 main canals regarding entitlements, deliveries & balance share were posted
         on the websites www.punjab.gov.pk and http://irrigation.punjab.gov.pk Data on the website
         was updated on 10 daily bases. The web site was improved and made more users friendly.

(ii)     The Irrigation Management Information System (IMIS) for monitoring of key indicators of the
         system, including designed and actual discharges in the system continued to function.
         Distribution program for entitlements and deliveries of distributary canals continued to be posted
         on the website.

(iii)    Preparation of a decision support model was started. The Model would provide support to the
         senior management to monitor the key indicators of the system including the discharges at
         various canals and distributaries and take water allocation decisions more transparently.




                                                    29
(iv)     Installation of flow metering gauges and calibration on 12 canal systems was completed and
         linked with the IMIS. The canal discharge data for the system continued to be posted on the
         website.

(v)      An IPD website oversight committee was formed to ensure that information provided on the
         website is responsive to the users' needs, accessible, user friendly, clear, accurate and timely.

(vi)     IPD analyzed feasible interventions to make groundwater use sustainable. Activities undertaken
         included: selection of three pilot areas for participatory GW management, preparation of
         inventory of TWs, arrangements for monitoring groundwater table depth and quality, review of a
         draft regulatory framework prepared earlier, incentives for user participation, conjunctive use of
         surface and groundwater, and introduction of modern and more efficient irrigation technology.
         Groundwater level and quality data have been placed on http://irrigation.punjab.gov.pk and
         www.punjab.gov.pk. The implementation of groundwater strategy in critical areas for
         participatory groundwater management through awareness and involvement of farmers continued
         even after the DPL Program was terminated.

(vii)    A program for surface water quality monitoring program was developed, approved and
         implementation started. The program included tests for drinking water quality in brackish
         groundwater areas where canal water is also used for drinking purpose. The monitoring
         parameters also include residues of commonly used pesticides and fertilizers.

(viii)   Criteria were developed for allocating any additional water that became available under the Inter-
         provincial Water Accord (as well as for sharing water shortages) and was posted on the website.
         All new water allocations are made public.

Pillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms:
(i)      An IPD Reform Unit covering key functions of strategic planning and M&E of the PSIRP was
         established which included qualified and experienced staff recruited on market based salaries.

(ii)     IPD started decentralization. Three Area Water Boards (AWBs) were established. 300 FOs were
         established on distributary canals, and Irrigation Management Transfer Agreements (IMTAs)
         were concluded with these FOs.

(iii)    Rehabilitation of FO managed distributary canals was carried out to ensure that FOs get these
         canals in a functional state. This resulted in improved water distribution equity as well as better
         M&R.

(iv)     Consultants were appointed for third party monitoring of the PISRP.

(v)      To raise awareness of environmental and social risks within IPD, AWBs, and FOs, social and
         environmental guidelines were developed for their identification and control in operation,
         maintenance and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. A Social and Environmental
         Management Unit (SEMU) was established to ensure compliance with social and environmental
         guidelines.

(vi)     A communication strategy was prepared and launched to publicize the reform impact and win
         stakeholders' support at all levels

Pillar IV: Reforms to encourage new technology to improve water use efficiency and on-farm
productivity:


                                                     30
(i)     The government encouraged investments in on-farm water management and services (land
        leveling, watercourse lining, and new technologies) which are essential for agricultural
        diversification, for improving the amount of crop, income and jobs and for reducing overall costs.

(ii)    5,004 water courses were improved in FY06-07.

(iii)   1500 Land Laser Leveling equipment were given to service providers by June 2007 and another
        1000 units were planned to be provided by end of FY 08.

(iv)    A project for promoting pressurized irrigation systems was started. High efficiency irrigation
        systems (drip/ sprinkler) have been installed on 9,964 acres (4,034 ha).

(v)     Separate Agriculture marketing department was created to formulate and implement strategies for
        market reforms. A private sector led Punjab Agri-Marketing Company (PAMCO) was established
        to promote private investment in this sector. GO Punjab continued to pursue reform of
        agricultural markets and is processing a Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act.

(vi)    Punjab Agriculture research Board (PARB) was reactivated. Five (5) corporate research bodies
        were established.

Sustainability of Reforms Program
The DPL 1 had 6 prior actions and 31 milestones. The policy matrix for DPL 2 was rationalized on the
basis of experience gained during DPL 1 and it included 10 prior actions with 19 milestones. Some of the
important milestones of DPL 1 were converted to prior actions while some were eliminated. Most of the
interventions of DPL 1 and DPL 2 were sustained at completion of the DPL program. A summary of the
sustainability of various agreed prior actions/milestones is shown in Table 4 below.

The milestones not sustained during DPL 1 included: i) preparation of divestiture program for
workshop(s), which was prepared but action on its implementation stopped after completion of DPL
Program and ii) Approval of the strategy and program that uses public private partnerships to deliver
services to farmers, which was not prepared.




                                                    31
The partially sustained milestone during DPL 1 included "A draft policy for O&M cost sharing that
makes the O&M financing plan explicit about the requirements of public sector financing and (Abiana)
prepared and submitted for Government approval". A draft policy for O&M cost sharing was prepared
and approved but is not being followed after completion of DPL Program.

After completion of DPL 2 the two prior actions which were partially sustained included: (i)
communication strategy prepared, approved and launched; and (ii) 100 new FOs established in new
AWBs and IMTAs signed. The communication strategy was prepared, approved and launched but lost
momentum after the end of DPL 1. However, 100 new FOs were established and IMTAs signed during
DPL 2. The Process of FO formation and transfer of management slowed down considerably and little
progress was made after completion of DPL series. The two milestones which were partially sustained
included: i) "approval of Policy for O&M cost sharing". The policy for O&M cost sharing was approved
but is not being followed after completion of DPL Program and ii) IPD modernization plan developed,
including strategy and action plan, approved by GOPunjab. An IPD Modernization Plan was developed
with technical assistance from ADB but was not implemented.

Proportion of Punjab's Irrigation System Covered under DPL Series
Interventions covered under the DPL program that extended to the entire province's irrigation system
included: (i) improved transparency in water distribution; (ii) metering/monitoring of the entire canal
system; (iii) increased budget allocation for M&R; (iv) quality control on implementation of
M&R works; (v) reduction in backlog of audit paras; (vi) management of environmental and
social risks; and (vii) watercourse improvement.

While the implementation over the entire system of the Asset Management Plan developed under
the DPL series may take more than 10 years, key rehabilitation works that have been completed
include: (i) Taunsa Barrage; and (ii) the LCC East Canal system rehabilitation. Further
rehabilitation works are under progress on: (i) Balloki Barrage; (ii) LCC West; (iii) Lower Bari
Doab; and (iv) Bahawalpur, DG Khan and Faisalabad zone. In addition, rehabilitation and up
gradation of Jinnah Barrage is about to start while rehabilitation/up gradation of following
structures is in the pipeline: (i) Islam Barrage; (ii) Khanki Barrage; (iii) Suleimanki Barrage; (iv)
Trimmu Barrage; (v) Panjnad Barrage; (vi) Pakpattan Canal; and (vii) Thal Canal system.

Budget Allocation for M&R
One of the key reforms was reduction in deferred maintenance and a visible trend in continued budget
allocation for M&R. While these actions were fully achieved during the DPL series, the M&R budget
allocations have continued in the last 3 years after completion of DPL program. The budget
allocation for FY 2008 -9 was Rs 2.453 billion; for FY 2009-10 the allocation was Rs 3.04 billion and
for FY 10-11 Rs 3.088 billion.

The accumulated deferred maintenance also continued to show a reduction trend as during FY 2007-08
Rs 7.41 billion were spent on rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems with Rs 2.06 billion on
M&R, which together constituted about 7.9% of the accumulated deferred maintenance. In FY 2008-09
the rehabilitation expenditure amounted to Rs 6.32 billion with Rs 2.65 billion on M&R, which together
constituted about 7.5% of the accumulated deferred maintenance. More recently, in FY 2009-10, a total of
Rs 4.53 billion have been spent on rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems while Rs 2.8 billion
on M&R, which together constituted approximately 6.1% of the accumulated deferred maintenance. With
these the total reduction in deferred maintenance has amounted to approximately 21.5%.




                                                   32
Sustainability of FOs and Abiana Collection
While the targets for formation of 100 new FOs was successfully completed and IMTAs were signed with
these FOs during the second DPL program, the process of FO formation and transfer of management
slowed down after completion of DPL series. There have been several contributing factors to this
downward trend in participatory irrigation management. The IPD completion report also pointed to these
factors including a significant decline in Abiana collection by the FO as compared to non-FO areas; weak
institutional capacity of FOs in maintaining accounts and records; and increasing inequity and elite
capture.

Another key issue contributing to the difficulty in sustaining Abiana collection by FOs, was their inability
to deal with water theft and defaulters. The soio-political conditions partly contributed to this challenge
however a major reason was a general absence of FOs' recognition by the local administration system.
Similarly, the lack of prioritization of rehabilitating FO-managed channels also weakened their stance in
Abiana collection as the dilapidated channels seriously constrain their ability to efficiently operate the
system.

The sustainability challenges therefore was that of optimizing the timing of system modernization and the
management transfer and the improvement strategies should have addressed the need for capacity
building and mainstreaming of FOs, closer coordination and support by AWB / PIDA, and improved
monitoring systems for identification of problems and timely course corrective measures. Another
strategy for improving Abiana collection should have considered the on-job training to FOs for Abiana
assessment and maintaining clear record of collection and recovery of Abiana with some incentives for
good performers as well as mass awareness and communications program.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

The overall assessment of the program's objectives for the series of the two annual DPLs is rated as
Satisfactory for the two year period as compared to the Highly Satisfactory in the interim status reports.
This change in rating is based on: (i) sustainability performance of prior actions and milestones under
DPL 2; and (ii) cancelation of the DPL 3. The DPL program resulted in: (i) improved efficiency and
sustainability of hydraulic infrastructure, (ii) greater transparency and equity of water distribution in
accordance with entitlements; (iii) greater participation and empowerment of water users in irrigation
service delivery; (iv) improved capacity in the Irrigation and Power Department (IPD), and farmer
organizations (FOs) for dealing with social and environmental issues; and (v) improved productivity.

There were good progress and positive outcomes since the launch of PISRP in FY05/06. A 10-year Asset
Management Plan (AMP) was prepared and its implementation started for improving the integrity of
existing assets of IPD by progressively reducing, and ultimately eliminating the large back log of deferred
maintenance through: (a) allocation of adequate resources for M&R, reflecting realistic yardsticks, for
improved upkeep of the system; (b) allocation of adequate resources for system rehabilitation in the
development budget in accordance with the MTFB; and (c) making efficient, transparent, and judicious
use of resources from both sources, in accordance with priorities. The cumulative expenditure by the end
of FY 08 amounted to Rs 35.7 billion (27%) of the total requirements of AMP. The monitoring and
evaluation mechanism was introduced for M&R works to ensure judicious use of M&R budget.

Non performing saline groundwater tubewells, which were no longer required, were closed and fresh
groundwater tubewells were transitioned. As a result the annual electricity payment in 2007-08 was
reduced by Rs 461.98 million as compared to Rs 941.9 million in 2005-06. Collection performance of


                                                    33
FOs was 78%, for Rabi 2005-06 and 79% in Kharif 2005. Abiana collection in non-FO improved to 70%
in Kharif 2006 as compared to 47% in 2005-06. In addition, water accounts for main and distributary
canals continued to be posted on website and data was updated on 10-daily basis. Finally, the DPR of
distributaries was regularly monitored and showed a relative improvement in equity of water distribution.


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
In Punjab, most rural livelihoods and household incomes depend directly or indirectly on agriculture, and
agriculture productivity depends importantly on the availability of water for irrigation ­ specifically the
public provision of canal water. The poverty count increases manifold in those rural areas which are
suffering from inefficiencies and inequalities of the irrigation system. Tail-end farmers generally receive
less than a third of the water compared to the framers at the head of the canal. As a consequence, farmer
income is considerably higher at the head reaches and it reduces significantly at the lower reaches of the
canal. The incidence of income poverty in some irrigation system of Punjab is as high as 40 to 77%10.

The reforms under DPL series focused on improved asset management, water resource management,
irrigation service delivery and productivity, with envisaged positive impacts on poverty reduction and
social development. Increased availability of irrigation water, especially at the middle and tail reaches
directly supported agricultural productivity thus benefiting the rural poor. While preparatory work for the
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) of the policy and institutional reforms was planned as part of
the third DPL operation, this was not formerly carried out due to cancelation of the DPL 3 operation.
However, informal assessment indicated that the interventions under DPL resulted in improved asset
management, water resource management, irrigation service delivery and productivity thus significantly
contributing to social outcomes from the reforms process. In addition, the Pakistan Poverty Assessment

x Ownership of a plot within a watercourse command area conferred access to irrigation water, but did
undertaken by the Government and the World Bank in September 2002 had found that:


x Water use varied systematically with the location of the watercourse along the main channel
     not guarantee canal water availability.

     (distributary or minor) as well as the location of the farmer's plot on the watercourse command area ­
     specifically, water availability decreased significantly if the watercourse was located near the tail of
     the distributary or minor, and/or if the plot was located near the tail end of the watercourse.

This location effect has been well known, but the Assessment suggested that the interplay of at least two
factors was important in affecting water availability: (i) deteriorated and silted condition of many
distributaries, minors and watercourses, and their related structures such as gates and outlets ­ seepage
losses along these canals remained often high and their hydraulic performance low with the result that the
system did not function as it was designed or intended; and (ii) availability of canal water increased
significantly where farmers reported informal payments for water; where there was less inequality of land
ownership, and where the land holdings of the largest cultivators on the watercourse was high.

The DPL Program resulted in better management and distribution of water as capacity and system created
for transparent administration of water entitlements and sustainable management of water resources,
contributed to more equitable distribution. In addition, while the improvement in Abiana recovery could
have been seen as imposition of an additional burden on farmers11; the increased farmer participation in

10
     IMMI, Pro Poor Interventions in Irrigated Agriculture. Issues, Options and Proposed Actions, Pakistan, August 2004
11
   There is anecdotal evidence that small and marginal farmers generally pay Abiana, and the defaulters are mainly influential
farmers


                                                               34
management of irrigation services was also envisaged to reduce hidden costs of water that farmers had to
pay for ­ thus directly resulting in a single payment which is less than the informal payments farmers
were making. The impact of physical and management interventions on irrigation systems was also
monitored with remote sensing and GIS tools and the study findings suggested that:

x
x
       There was net improvement of overall ETa in cropping year 2006 ­ 07.
       The low spatial coefficient of variation in the cropping year 2006 ­ 07 depicted better equity in the
       water distribution due to Reforms.

The Agriculture Department estimated that improved watercourses had resulted in improved delivery of
irrigation water supplies to the farmers' fields thereby leading to enhanced agricultural production and
reduced seepage losses by about 1.049 MAF. In addition, incremental crop production as a result of
watercourse improvement was estimated as follows: Wheat 928,000 Tons; Rice 175,000 Tons; Cotton
96000 Tons; Sugarcane 1.56 million Tons and Maize 128,000 Tons.

About 3.23 million person months of direct and 3.9 person months of indirect employment were reported
to have been created as a result of implementation of the National Program for Watercourse
Improvement. Similarly, the provision of 1500 Laser units to the service providers since the start of the
Program in FY 05/06 resulted in land leveling of 634,613 acres (256,928 ha) as of June 30, 2007. The
Agriculture Department reported that the land leveling resulted in saving of about 140,000 AF in field
losses due to reduced length of field ditches and dikes which was estimated to have increased the irrigated
area by about 3750 ha and an additional crop production of about 138,000 Tons.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The series of DPLs supporting the GOPunjab's PISRP was based on and led to a number of integral
institutional changes in the IPD in particular. The introduction of new business processes and improved
access to information by farmers and other water users available through the IPD website has contributed
to similar interventions being planned in other provinces as well as departments. Similarly, as part of its
policy to decentralize and improve irrigation service delivery, Punjab established 186 FOs on distributary
canals in 3 canal systems and all of these FOs signed Irrigation Management Transfer Agreements
(IMTAs). In addition, the reforms program empowered FOs to collect and retain a part of the Abiana
collected.

IPD continued to build capacity of FOs in a wide range of skills and activities (O&M/M&R planning,
contract management, water measurement, business planning, Abiana collection, accounting and financial
management, conflict resolution, etc). The key revamped business processes, institutional changes and
results under the reforms program are as following:

i.         IPD developed efficient institutional arrangements for implementation of rehabilitation and M&R
           works. A Performance Evaluation System for M&R works was prepared and was being followed.
           IPD has appointed consultants for third party monitoring of M&R works.

ii.        IPD carried out a detailed institutional analysis to review the organizational setup, functions,
           procedures and human and financial resources required, and to identify key areas for institutional
           reform. A modernization Plan for the Department was prepared.

iii.       IPD started decentralization. Three Area Water Boards (AWBs) were established. 186 FOs
           established on distributary canals, and Irrigation Management Transfer Agreements (IMTAs)
           concluded with these FOs; and capacity building programs for FOs implemented.




                                                      35
iv.       IPD established Units for Strategic Planning, Financial Management and Procurement. Notices of
          contracts worth Rs 0.5 million for M&R works and Rs 10 million for ADP works were posted on
          the website.

v.        IPD introduced the system of fortnightly Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) meetings to
          progressively reduce the back log of audit observations and enhance financial accountability.

vi.       IPD prepared an Irrigation Management Information System (IMIS), which allowed monitoring
          of key indicators of the system, including designed and actual discharges in various parts of the
          system. Distribution program for entitlements and deliveries of distributary canals have been
          posted on the website. Water accounts for 24 main canals are also posted on the website and data
          is updated on 10 daily bases. A system for registering complaints on toll free number and
          monitoring the status of these complaints has also been introduced.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
The irrigation reforms program in Punjab initiated a major shift in business processes and institutional
changes in the province. The following impacts are specifically mentioned:

·     The PISRP reforms process not only made a significant impact on the irrigation management in
      Punjab but also had a demonstration effect in other provinces. In particular, the province of Sindh is
      following a similar program structure for the irrigation sector improvement which is based on the
      principles of decentralizing irrigation management, formation and capacity building of FOs and
      introducing transparency in water distribution and sharing.
·     Another specific intervention supported by the reforms which directly contributed to the prevalent
      issue of salinity was the closure of saline groundwater tubewells. This step was envisaged to
      contribute to improvement of soil quality as well as larger impact on the water quality and ecosystem.
·     The effectiveness of inter-departmental coordination under the reforms program resulted in an
      enhanced understanding between IPD and the Finance Department over the issue of perverse subsidy
      for electric tubewells. Under this subsidy the provincial governments were required to cover 50% of
      the costs of agricultural tubewells. This subsidy had serious implications for the groundwater policy
      approved by the GOPunjab under the reforms as it was: (i) promoting excessive pumping by the
      farmers not only for their own use but also for sale to other farmers; (ii) benefitting primarily large
      land holders and thus enhancing inequities; (iii) placing an unnecessary financial burden (>Rs 1.7-2
      billion per year) on the provincial budget; and (iv) representing a major retrograde step in the sector
      policy environment as well as increasing the power deficit in Punjab. The GOPunjab took a bold step
      by suspending the tubewells power subsidy and making a detailed revision of its implementation in
      the province. Later the Government decided to completely withdraw this subsidy on all agriculture
      tubewells with a retroactive effect from July 1, 2010. The federal Ministry of Water and Power
      carried out consultations with the provincial governments to do away with this subsidy. While the
      governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and the federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture
      opposed discontinuity of the subsidy, the finance bill of FY 2010-11 is finalized with an
      envisaged zero subsidy on power sector to take retroactive effect as of beginning of the
      financial year 2010-11.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

In 2008, IPD carried out a Perception Survey with a cross section of stakeholders in FOs and non-FO
areas. Another study was carried out by the IPD in Muzaffargarh in FY2007­08, which was the area of
major tubewells transition.



                                                      36
The Perception Survey concluded that while the reforms program is viewed as a positive sign by the
external stakeholders there are mixed views as to the proportion of Departments' interference and PIDA's
joint management. While a small number of respondents expressed they were in favor of total autonomy
of FOs, the majority of respondents were in favor of retaining joint management of PIDA and FOs. In
addition, the Survey also found that water availability has increased and incidences of water thefts have
reduced to a considerable extent which reflects highly successful impact of the reforms program.

The Survey also concluded that whereas the spillover of long-term impacts from the reforms program is
gradual, but given the consistent support of the IPD and law enforcement agencies including the police,
there is a greater scope for improvement in the overall irrigation system.

The groundwater management aspects of the IPD study in Muzaffargarh in FY-2007-8 concluded that in
the area of major tubewells transition, the general perception of the farmers had improved towards IPD's
performance. In particular, the farmers felt satisfied with the transfer of tubewells ­ as it provided them
with a direct control on the fresh groundwater (FGW) tubewells. The farmers felt they now had a choice
of using these tubewells as an alternative when required.

Details of findings and conclusions from the Perception Survey are provided in Annex 2.


4. Assessment of Risks to Development Outcome

Rating: High

The Program Documents for DPL 1 and 2 indicated several risks that could affect program
implementation. These included amongst others: the history of uneven high level support to the irrigation
reform agenda; staff redundancies resulting from the devolution of O&M responsibilities to FOs coupled
with anti-reform lobbying by those who may stand to lose as a result of the reforms; weak financial
management capacity of IPD; continuing with conventional methods for consulting with, and informing
stakeholders, which are not fully effective; and limited capacity of IPD for managing social and
environmental issues associated with asset management activities. A number of risk mitigating
arrangements were built in the program to respond to these risks.

It was noted that at the time of DPL series were designed and as the implementation of first DPL
progressed the irrigation reforms continued to receive strong political support, and water users/farmers
participated in the implementation of the reforms program with great enthusiasm and witnessed the initial
positive outcomes of participatory irrigation management. While there was an inherent risk that a change
in political leadership could affect the reform momentum or shift priorities, it was concluded that the
reforms have reached a take-off point and there would be pressures to move ahead. This risk did not
materialize during the implementation of both DPL 1 and DPL 2 and the irrigation reforms continued
with high level political support.

Similarly, while responding to the risk of staff redundancies, GOPunjab adopted a strategy of natural
attrition of redundant staff. The establishment of Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU)
in IPD directly contributed to mitigation of weak financial management capacity as IPD embarked upon
transparent fiduciary management and increasing level of computerization of financial transactions under
the PIFRA regime. In improving its consultations process, the IPD carried out close monitoring,
benchmarking and reporting on the positive outcomes of the reforms were used as a countervailing force
to neutralize adverse publicity. An effective communication strategy for IPD was developed as part of the
reform program to more effectively communicate with both internal and external stakeholders and build


                                                    37
greater awareness of change management as the reforms proceed. The capacity gap for managing social
and environmental issues was mitigated by strengthening IPD's and FOs institutional capacity in these
areas through training and capacity building. A Social and Environmental Unit (SEMU) was established
to prepare and ensure compliance with social and environmental guidelines.

Another moderate risk identified was related to the uncertainty whether adequate level of funding for
M&R and other elements of IPD's asset management plan would be sustained. However, as Punjab's
fiscal situation had improved, there was a much greater realization that vital hydraulic infrastructure must
be well maintained to reduce risks of failure. In addition, the M&R yardsticks were revised to reflect
market rates and budgetary allocation for M&R were made in accordance with the revised yardsticks and
Province's MTBF. In addition, the risk that IPD's limited capacity may impact effective utilization of
M&R resources was addressed as part of the Asset Management Planning, which among others allocated
M&R funds taking into account the local needs as well as implementation capacity. A system of
performance evaluation was initiated to ensure that M&R funds are judiciously allocated, properly
utilized in a transparent manner with full regard to procurement and fiduciary safeguards, downwards
accountability to farmers. The outcomes and impacts were closely monitored.

Another risk related to riparian issues. Construction of new, as well as remodeling of existing hydraulic
infrastructure, involved careful consideration of downstream water rights/entitlements and this risk was
mitigated under the existence of Inter-provincial Water Accord being administered by the Indus River
System Authority (IRSA). The intra-province water allocations and entitlements were also covered by the
Accord, and one of the pillars of the reforms specifically focused on greater transparency in
administration of intra-province water entitlements.

Finally, there was the risk related to macroeconomic management. Although the policy stance of the
government remained appropriate, continued high inflation and external trade deficit indicated significant
excess liquidity in the economy, and called for resolute actions to contain money supply and improve
export competitiveness. However, while the Government was committed to take necessary steps to ensure
macroeconomic stability, this risk was not fully mitigated due to subsequent external shocks and the as
result the preparation of the third DPL was first deferred and later abandoned due to deterioration in the
macroeconomic conditions in FY 2007-08.

Since completion of DPL Program the period 2007-2010 witnessed a sizeable downturn in the country's
economic growth rate, with mounting economic problems. There have been high fiscal deficits, as well as
an energy crisis. The resource constraints have led to a squeeze in development expenditures. The
situation has been further compounded by the recent nationwide floods. Given the resource constraints,
and the adverse record of very low levels of revenue generation, there could be renewed pressure on the
irrigation management system to raise abiana rates, as well as collection efficiency and intensity.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Punjab Irrigation Development Policy Loan (DPL 1)

Rating: Satisfactory

The World Bank performance at entry is rated as satisfactory. The Bank team remained proactively
engaged with the Government on the program design and implementation. During initial phase the Bank


                                                    38
held regular policy dialogue with GOPunjab. In addition to working closely with the IPD and Agriculture
Department, the Bank team maintained regular interaction with the Planning and Development Board and
the Department of Finance, which raised the profile and seriousness of the reforms program. In addition,
the Bank provided technical support to IPD and Agriculture Department through senior technical experts
who provide guidance and best practice knowledge in various areas including preparation of the assets
inventory, functional analysis, setting of IMIS, revision of yardsticks, performance evaluation of public
sector tubewells and field conditions for the assessment of need to continue or transition FGW and SGW
redundant tubewells, amongst others. At the time of DPL 1, the Pakistan's economy was starting to grow
after a period of stagnation and the irrigation reforms program enjoyed strong championship from the
political leaders and top administrative officers of the province which made it possible to implement
institutional and fiscal reforms.

Second Punjab Irrigation Development Policy Loan (DPL 2)

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the World Bank at entry is rated as satisfactory. The Bank team continued to take
keen interest and worked together with IPD for the design and support of the Loan program. The Bank
continued regular policy dialogue with GOPunjab in particular the Planning and Development Board and
the Department of Finance, which strengthened highest level support for the reforms program. The Bank
team worked closely with the IPD and Agriculture Department and provided technical assistance through
senior national and international experts in different technical areas including Groundwater Management
Strategy, Development of Social and Environmental Guidelines, and the preparation of IPD's
Communication Strategy under DPL 2. The Bank also contributed through a GWMATE team of experts
for refining the IPD's Groundwater Management Strategy and coordinated closely with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), which at the time was also assisting GOPunjab through public finance and
irrigation reforms including preparation of the IPD Modernization Plan and introduction of Integrated
Water Resources Management (IWRM) principles in the Province.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Punjab Irrigation Development Policy Loan (DPL 1)

followed up and suggestions for the GOPunjab. At the operational level, consistent engagement with the
IPD and Agriculture Department teams enabled effective review of progress and discussion on areas
needing acceleration. Coordination with other donors including ADB and Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA) was effective and enabled better alignment between available technical expertise and
resources and with the needs of the reforms program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory for the DPL series. The justification for the rating is
as follows:

·   The Bank team remained engaged in the design of the program with the GOPunjab and acted as a
    catalyst during the implementation working closely with the IPD for the support of the reforms
    program while maintaining strong dialogue with key policy makers, not only in the IPD and
    Agriculture Department but also with the Department of Finance and the Planning and Development
    Board.
·   The Bank team consisted of senior staff from various sectors of the Bank to maintain efficient
    supervision and monitoring of the various components of the program. The team also consisted of
    senior national and international technical experts.
·   The Bank team undertook regular supervision missions and held field visits to interact with the
    Farmers Organizations (FOs) and the members of the Area Water Board (AWB) to assess the on
    ground progress and impacts of the institutional reforms as well as the performance of FOs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Borrower performance has been fully satisfactory during the DPL series. The GOPunjab remained
engaged with the reforms agenda and had strong championship from the political leaders and senior
administrative officers of the province that made it possible to implement institutional and fiscal reforms
and improved service delivery. At the provincial level, the good progress and satisfactory achievement of
objectives has been based on alignment of vision and strategy among the key set of policy makers, and
intensive monitoring and oversight by the dedicated operational teams. The PMIU played a key role in
monitoring discharges and making the distribution transparent by posting the discharge date on the IPD
website. The GOPunjab has sustained the reforms and all prior actions agreed as part of the DPL program
are continuing. The GOPunjab implemented the required prior actions in a timely manner including
preparation of the assets inventory, functional analysis, setting of IMIS, revision of yardsticks during DPL
1 and preparation of asset management plan, groundwater management strategy, development of social
and environmental guidelines, and communication strategy under DPL 2.

6. Lessons Learned

Key lessons learned from past Bank operations in the water sector and the experience with the Punjab
Irrigation Sector DPL series, are that successful implementation of reforms requires:

·   Focus on instruments and incentives for reforms rather than simply on organizations, programs and
    projects. Based on the past experience, both GOPunjab and the Bank agreed that new approaches and
    instruments will be needed to meet the diverse set of challenges facing the water sector. The DPL
    instrument was therefore considered a more suitable instrument for supporting the reform agenda set
    out in the PISRP. The choice of DPL for the irrigation sector reforms was driven by the need for
    engagement at the highest level of decision making. Should the Bank's support for irrigation reforms
    had been through a specific investment loan as instrument of financing, the detailed engagement
    would have remained with the implementing agency instead of the policy drivers. This strategic
    choice of instrument brought momentum to the reforms and created incentives for the policy makers
    to directly support implementation of their decisions. The level of engagement started at the highest
    decision making level from the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary to the Planning and Development
    Board, Finance Department and the Agriculture and Irrigation departments and provided an added
    thrust to timely implementation of the agreed actions.

·   An approach based on "principled pragmatism" which recognizes that reforms and investments must
    proceed in parallel. The past investments in irrigation system rehabilitation no doubt brought benefits
    of reduced incidences of canal breaches and resolved siltation and erosion problems. However,
    without institutional changes and adequate O&M, the system reverted to pre-rehabilitation situation.
    The DPL series aspired to address this through a principled approach where investments in system



                                                    41
    restoration should be seen as complementary to the fundamental institutional change with greater
    farmer participation and accountability at its core.

·   Strong political championship, government ownership, and commitment are essential for the success
    and continuity of reform programs. Formation of the Inter-Departmental Reforms Steering
    Committee headed by the Chairman Planning and Development and reporting directly to the Chief
    Minister's office not only raised the profile of the reforms but also steered high impact decisions. This
    led to high level monitoring and oversight, and created an interest in focusing on outcomes. Financial
    and technical support of the Bank became more meaningful with these conditions in place.

·   Analytical work prior to the program. The Bank's support to Punjab's ISRP was designed on the
    basis of extensive analytical work undertaken by the federal and provincial governments as well as by
    the Bank. At the federal level the Pakistan Planning Commission prepared the Ten-Year Perspective
    Plan (September 2001); the Ministry of Water and Power (MOW) prepared a Water Resources
    Strategy (WRS) with the assistance of the AD3 in 2002, and a draft national Water Policy)in 2005
    with resources provided under NDP. At the provincial level the GOPunjab updated the provincial
    Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper underscoring irrigation section reforms, and prepared a medium
    term budget framework. While the Bank carried out a systematic review of public spending in water
    sector as part of the 2002 Public Expenditure Review and in 2005 prepared the Country Water
    Resources Assistance Strategy (CWRAS) for Pakistan which provided the underpinning for water
    sector elements of the 2006-09 Country Assistance Strategy.

The successful implementation of irrigation DPL series specifically points to the following lessons learnt
from the program:

·   Keep it simple: This lesson was specifically learnt from the implementation of the National Drainage
    Program and was applied to the DPL Program. The Program was simple and had one main
    implementation agency (IPD) which made its implementation easy. Given this the program was
    strategically designed to engage the highest decision making officials through an Inter-Departmental
    Reforms Steering Committee which provided oversight and guided decision making as well as their
    quick implementation.

·   Any program that generates demand can be considered a success: The irrigation reforms
    program created a significant interest and desire to follow the same model as has been the case in
    Sindh. The institutional architecture that evolved under the PISRP in affect provided strong bases for
    farmers' participation and decentralized irrigation management responsibilities. A well-designed
    communication plan ensured that all stakeholders ­ especially farmers ­ are aware of the steps being
    taken through the reforms. This not only created the demand for transparency in information sharing,
    it also challenged the IPD to keep pace with increased demand for timely and accurate information.

·   Strong political support and government ownership is essential for any program to succeed:
    The program had strong championship from the political leaders and top administrative officers of the
    province, which made it possible to implement institutional and fiscal reforms and improved service
    delivery. The interest generated at the highest level of decision making not only raised the profile of
    the reforms but also created space that kept different departments informed of the outcomes of their
    decisions and how these affected the implementation of reforms.

·   Institutional change needs time to take roots: This was demonstrated by the pace of
    implementation of institutional reforms and performance of new FOs during DPL, which slowed
    down after DPL program. If DPL 3 had materialized, the institutional changes would possibly have



                                                     42
    taken roots. The short lifespan of the DPL series was designed for quick outcomes in setting forth the
    reforms processes, however there remains the need to follow up with invest programming that is
    based on the reforms that were sustained and re-contextualize those reforms that were partially
    sustained.

·   Capacity building of new organizations is essential: The performance of the FOs showed mixed
    results; some FOs performing well and some FOs performing poorly. The Abiana collection by FOs
    was initially high but declined. There is a continual need to build capacity of new organizations for
    ensuring success of the institutional reforms. These include not only the farmer organizations and the
    Area Water Boards but also the units created within IPD to address social, environmental, monitoring
    and evaluation and communication aspects.

·   Refinement in the irrigation system: In particular, issues such as the groundwater management
    have to be a continuous process as groundwater reservoir is dynamic. However, refinement can be
    attained with the awareness and active participation of water users. The PISRP reforms program built
    on past lessons of going beyond delivery of water services and including investments in on-farm
    services such as land leveling and high efficiency irrigation to influence agricultural productivity.
    Any future programming in water sector will have to continue building upon the irrigation-agriculture
    nexus for deriving economic benefits from water.

Annex 2 Beneficiary Survey Results

1.       Key findings of the Independent Third Party Surveys
In order to monitor the impact of reforms relating to fiscal management in planning, procurement and
execution of M&R works, transparency of water allocation/entitlements and irrigation management-
transfer and users participation, IPD engaged independent consultants to monitor the ground realities in
respect of the above functions, conduct third-party surveys to verify implementation of program
interventions and evaluate outputs and outcomes through random surveys as well as case studies. The first
Report of the Consultants was issued in February 2008.

The review of the work plans noted some shortcomings in the work plans prepared initially, which were
rectified. Out of a total of 7,867 schemes in the finalized annual M&R work plan, a random representative
sample of 946 (818 NCBs and 128 non-NCBs) schemes was selected. With time the field offices started
paying attention to the QA Procedures. Eventually, work plans were prepared with introduction of the
Third Party Check, documentation was improved and the supervisory activities intensified.

The Consultants also checked the Delivery Performance Ratios (DPR) Values is to determine the
adequacy of water delivered to the farmers and to ascertain transparency of water allocations and
entitlements in FO Managed Channels and control channels managed by IPD, by carrying out random
check measurements of discharges. The supply of water at head of the channels by and large was found
satisfactory. It was observed that the supply to several outlets has improved but the distribution of supply
amongst the outlets observed during the spot-checking was not equitable. Similarly, the DPR values of
outlets in head, middle and tail reaches were, also somewhat inconsistent highlighting the need for further
improvement.

The Consultants carried out case studies of randomly selected Farmers' Organizations (FOs). The study
used indicators for benchmarking of FOs established by PIDA after their review and evaluation. The
Consultants rated performance of 80% of the FOs as adequate/satisfactory/good and 20% as poor.

Abiana Collection Performance of FOs
The status of Abiana collection in the FO areas prior to and during the DPL Program is summarized in
Tables A2.1and A2.2.

It is observed that the Abiana collection by the FOs was generally high in the beginning but gradually
started to decline.

Abiana Collection in non FO Areas
Abiana collection in non FO areas improved during DPL 2 and improved further during subsequent years.
The declining trend was not only reversed but the collection performance improved significantly 70% in
2006-07 compared to 47% in the preceding two years. The status of collection of abiana after completion
of DPL Program was as follows: 77% in 2007-08; 87% in 2008-09 and 86% in 2009-10.

2.       Remote Sensing Study
In addition, IPD also conducted a remote sensing study to evaluate the impact of reforms on irrigation
system performance and agricultural water productivity under the Punjab Irrigation Sector Reforms
Program (PISRP). The study provided macro analysis of the entire system and indicated that water
distribution has improved in most of the canals during Kharif 2007 where not only reliability has
improved but also the volume delivered to all canals has increased. Variations were controlled and more
reliable supplies were provided. Similar improvement is noticed in Rabi supplies but to a lesser extent.
Overall, Punjab delivered 3237.8 M m3 more water in 2006-07 than in 2004-05. This is partly due to the
fact that that the river supplies were higher by about 5% and also there was better monitoring and
transparency through access to data to everybody on IPD website. The Gross Value of Production (GVP)
increased in most of the canal commands (average increase: 10%).

3.      Summary Findings and Conclusions of Perception Survey
In 2008 IPD carried out a Perception Survey to gauge perceptions of a cross section of stakeholders in
FOs and non-FO areas. Another study was carried out by the IPD in Muzaffaragrh in 2007 ­ 08, the area
of major TW transition.

The Perception Survey was mostly related to the institutional reforms for participatory irrigation
management (PIM) supported by the DPL Program. The Perception Survey had following objectives:

1.   Assess impact of reforms through a set of performance indicators
2.   Assess public perceptions about IPD
3.   Present a comparative evaluation of FOs and non-FOs about IPD
4.   Assess the acceptance levels about Participatory Irrigation Management System




                                                   48
The Outcome Indicators of the Perception Survey included:
1. Redefining IPD's role as is perceived by people
2. Benchmarking IPD performances for organizational development

The sample size was 160 in FO areas and 40 in non FO areas. FO samples were filled in LCC (E) and (W)
canal commands with the coordination of PIDA Social Mobilization Cell who were deputed in the field
for conducting FO elections. Non FO forms were filled out in the Secretariat to capture insiders'
perceptions about PIM reforms.

The profile of surveyed stake holders in Non FO and FO areas is shown in Tables A2.3 and A2.4
respectively.

Generally the Reforms interventions are considered a positive sign by the external stakeholders. However,
there are mixed views as to the proportion of Departments' interference, PIDA's joint management.
Water availability has increased and water thefts have been reduced to a considerable extent according to
the perceptions of both categories. The perception of the stakeholders in FO areas about the
improvements due to various reforms is generally positive as is indicated in Figure 1. The percentages
show the improved perception by respondents. The perceived improvements include: improvement in
Abiana collection; control of water theft; reduction in corruption; on spot solutions of problems and
improved water availability at tails.

FO Perceptions about IPDs' support to FOs drew a mixed response. Only 77% of the respondents
expressed an opinion and about 59% of these were critical of the support provided by the Department
whereas about 41% of respondents were satisfied with the level of support provided by the IPD to the
FOs, as indicated in Figure 2, while 27% reported non-cooperation and 16% a monopoly by the IPD and a
16% of respondents perceived tat FOs are not authorized to take on additional management
responsibilities under the reforms.

Conclusions:
The Perception Survey Report draws following conclusions:

·   Reforms intervention is considered a positive sign by the external stakeholders. However, there are
    mixed views as to the proportion of Departments' interference, PIDA's joint management. Almost 25
    numbers of responses were in favor of total autonomy of FOs. But the majority of respondents are in
    favor of a joint management of PIDA and FOs.




                                                  52
·   Water availability has increased and water thefts have been reduced to a considerable extent
    according to the perceptions of both categories.

·   The spillover of reforms is gradual but given the consistent support of the department and law
    executing agencies like the police, a lot of scope for improvement is anticipated in the system. The
    IPD needs to continue to evaluate this situation in order to inform future reforms and policy decisions.

A one day workshop on Groundwater Monitoring in Punjab was held on November 2, 2007 by
Directorate of Land Reclamation (DLR) & Strategic Planning / Reform Unit (SPRU) Punjab Irrigation
and Power Department

The objectives of the workshop were to:
· Highlight the importance of groundwater monitoring and its future requirements
· Streamline groundwater monitoring for sustainable GW management
· Highlight the current groundwater status and trend analysis in its true perspective

The Chief SPRU informed the participants about:
· The preparation and finalization of Punjab Groundwater Management Plan
· Structuring of Steering Committee on Groundwater along with its role
· The formation of Groundwater Working Group along with its role
· The establishment of Groundwater Management Organization in Punjab Irrigation and Power
   Department

Key Messages (Workshop Outcomes):
· The over pumping of groundwater is leading to rapid aquifer depletion.
· The groundwater level on the average is declining in the province.
· Need was felt for frequent contact and interaction with the end users to bring about a change in their
   mind- set for groundwater resource management.
· Uncontrolled and unregulated groundwater extraction paves the way to groundwater quality
   deterioration, saline water intrusion and secondary soil salinization.
· The groundwater trend analysis needs to be placed on website for guidance of the farming
   communities.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower's ICR of November 2010 follows:

The Government of Punjab successfully implemented the Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program
(PISRP), which was supported by two12 Development Policy Loans (DPLs) during (FY2006-08). Far-
reaching institutional reforms were initiated in the irrigation sector under PISRP. The two DPLs in an
amount of US$100 million equivalent each were part of a programmatic series of loans during two years
(FY2006-07) with a total amount of US$200 million. DPL1 and DPL2 were approved and disbursed.

The PISRP was designed to address some of the key problems of the Sector which included:
· Deteriorated irrigation and drainage infrastructure.
· Growing water shortages.
· Government tubewells have generally outlived their useful life and place a major burden on the
   recurrent budget.
· Lack of farmer participation in operation, maintenance and management of irrigation services.
· Lack of financial sustainability.
· Lack of properly calibrated flow measurement gauges and trained and motivated staff.
· Uncontrolled growth of private tubewells that led to over exploitation/mining and deterioration of
   groundwater quality in many areas.
· The irrigation establishment has grown over time and the good practices followed in the past are not
   generally in vogue, which has led to inefficiencies.

Cognizant of the aforementioned problems the government developed a vision and strategy. The long
term vision was "to provide adequate, equitable and reliable irrigation supplies to the cultivable lands
of Punjab aiming at enhanced agricultural productivity, and sustainable development with focus on
holistic management and broad based institutional reforms". The government launched a medium term
reform program for achieving this vision, based on lessons learned from past experience and after
extensive consultations with various stakeholders within and outside the government, including policy
and strategic dialogue with the World Bank and other development agencies. The strategic vision includes
institutional and policy reforms as well as critical investments on rehabilitation and system improvement.
The reform program was built on the following four inter-related pillars, which were consistent with the
priorities identified in the World Bank Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy,

Pillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms to improve the management and maintenance of the
irrigation system to ensure its long term physical and financial sustainability.

Pillar II: Water Resource Management Reforms to emphasize the critical importance of water
entitlements, measurements, and transparency. The objective is to make intra-province water allocations
and distribution more transparent, and to ultimately extend the system of entitlements to groundwater as
well in the long term.




12
  Initially three annual DPLs of $ 100 million each were proposed but only the first two loans were disbursed in FY
2006-07.



                                                        55
Pillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms to improve the quality, efficiency and accountability of
irrigation services, through greater participation of farmers, institutional reforms, and the use of
contractual arrangements among water supply agencies and users.

Pillar IV: Reforms to encourage new technology to improve water use efficiency and on-farm
productivity through a system of incentives and reforms in agriculture marketing and research.

A4.1    Achievements under DPL/PISRP

The specific achievements of the government under various pillars of DPL/PISRP are summarized below;

A4.1.1 Pillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms:

  i. M&R Budget was allocated according to revised yardsticks. Rs billion in 2005-6; Rs 2.136 billion
     in 2006-07 and Rs 2.453 billion in 2007-08 as compared to Rs 1.200 billion in 2004-05.

  ii. 1,617 non performing saline tubewells were closed and FGW Tubewells were closed / transitioned.

 iii. System of fortnightly (twice monthly average) meetings of the Departmental Accounts Committee
      (DAC) was institutionalized. 45% of the advance audit observations were reviewed and resolved
      during the DPL 2.

 iv. The negative trend in recovery of abiana in non FO areas was reversed. Performance on Abiana
     collection in non-FO canals improved to 70% as of end June 2007 from 47% in 2005and 2006. In
     FO managed areas the cumulative Abiana collection as of end June 2007 was 72% (82% during FY
     2004-05 and 62% during FY 2005-06).

  v. A 10 year Asset Management Plan (AMP) with estimated cost of Rs 144 billion was prepared. The
     expenditure on rehabilitation & modernization during 2005-06 was 6.08% and for 2006-07 was
     7.61% of the deferred maintenance.

 vi. Performance Evaluation system for M&R was prepared and its implementation started.

vii. A realistic and transparent policy for M&R cost sharing between budgetary allocations and user
     charges for various tiers of the system was approved.

A4.1.2 Pillar II: Water Resource Management Reforms:

  i. IPD posted water accounts for 24 main canals and distributaries regarding entitlements, deliveries
     & balance share on the website. Data on the website is updated on 10 daily basis. The program
     continues even after end of DPL Program.

  ii. Installation of flow metering gauges in the LCC East AWB was completed in 2005-06.
      Distributaries discharge data was posted on IPD website. Observation and calibration of gauges was
      undertaken in 20 Canal Systems. 1492 gauges were calibrated in 2723 channels. Any missing
      gauges or defects in installed gauges were rectified.

 iii. Surface Water Quality Monitoring Plan was defined and its implementation started.




                                                  56
    iv. The GW Management Plan was prepared, which included groundwater management policy
        guidelines, GW strategy and GW management action plan. Three pilot areas have been proposed
        for GW Management in Punjab. GW information is now available in the irrigation web site. FOs in
        LCC East started water depth and quality groundwater monitoring.

    v. Criteria for : i) allocating additional water that becomes available under the Accord, and ii) sharing
       water shortages among canal commands, was prepared and posted on IPD website.

    vi. Water accounts for all distributaries canals in LCC East posted on IPD website and updated every
        10 days.

vii. Preparation of a decision support model stared.

A4.1.3 Pillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms:

The status of actions taken is as follows:

     i. The draft strategy paper on IPD Modernization Plan was prepared by the IPD Reform Unit. ADB
        appointed an international and local consultant for preparing the draft Modernization Plan.

    ii. A Strategic Planning and Reform Unit was established in IPD for monitoring implementation of the
        PISRP/DPL and preparing internal M&E reports of the Reform Program.

    iii. A communication strategy was prepared and implementation started.

    iv. 186 new FOs were established in LCC East, LCC West, CRBC, and LBDC. IMTAs were signed
        with the new FOs.

    v. To raise awareness of environmental and social risks, guidelines were developed and their
       implementation was made mandatory for operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of irrigation
       infrastructure.

    vi. LCC (East) AWB was made fully operational and two new AWBs (LCC West and LBDC) were
        notified in 2006-07.

vii. Rehabilitation of FO managed channels was undertaken in LCC East AWB. 28 FOs channels
     having length of 678 km with investment cost of Rs.250 million were rehabilitated.

viii. Benchmarking system for FOs was introduced by PIDA.

A4.1.4 Pillar IV: Reforms to encourage new technology to improve water use efficiency and on-
       farm productivity:

The status of actions taken during the DPL Program follows:

·     Under the Water conservation programs of watercourse improvement and provision of laser land
      leveler were achieved:
      (i) 5011 watercourses improved during FY 05-06
      (ii) 5004 watercourses improved during FY 06-07
      (iii) 500 laser leveler units delivered FY 05-06



                                                      57
      (iv) 1000 laser leveler units delivered FY 06-07
      (v) Project proposal prepared for promoting pressurized irrigation systems. High efficiency irrigation
           systems (drip/ sprinkler) have been installed on 9,964 acres (4,034 ha) so far in the Punjab

·     The actions relating to amendment of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Ordinance, 1978;
      Restructuring of research and preparation of models of economic incentives (cost sharing, matching
      grant, regulations, policies, institutions) were pursued outside the ambit of DPL.

A4.2       Impacts of Reforms

The DPL Program proved very beneficial and worked as catalyst for introducing far reaching
improvements in the water sector in Punjab. The program resulted in improved asset management; better
management and distribution of water as capacity and system was created for transparent administration
of water entitlements and sustainable management of water resources; greater participation and
empowerment of water users in irrigation service delivery; improved capacity in the Irrigation and Power
Department (IPD) and farmer organizations (FOs) for dealing with social & environmental issues; better
management of groundwater resources including closure of non performing SGW tubewells, and
transition of FGW tubewells which resulted in reduced annual electricity payment in 2007-08 by Rs
461.98 million as compared to Rs 941.9 million in 2005-06.

The hydraulic infrastructure was progressively made safer and sustainable; there was a sizable increase in
M&R budget and investments to take care of deferred maintenance of irrigation and drainage
infrastructure. Operation and maintenance of distribution system in LCC East; LCC west and CRBC was
handed over to FOs, which are also responsible for collection of Abiana.

Capacity and system was created for transparent administration of water entitlements and sustainable
management of water resources. Water accounts for 24 main canals regarding entitlements, deliveries &
balance share were posted on the website13. Data on the website is updated on 10 daily basis. Distributary
discharge data has been posted on the IPD website.

Delivery Performance Ratio ­DPR (ratio of actual to authorized discharge at the head and tail outlets) of
distributaries in LCC East were measured by PIDA and PMIU and verified by Third Party Consultants.
DPR values in head and tail reaches indicate improved equity and increase in supplies to tail reaches. As a
result of various interventions rotation in distributaries reduced and the distribution system received more
water. PIDA completed the baseline pre-condition survey of all channels in LCC (East) Circle.

Joint measurement of discharges at head of distributaries by IPD and FOs is being carried out. The FOs
are regularly monitoring the discharges of outlets. PIDA M&E staff also checks the discharges and
informs FOs wherever any corrective measures are needed. These steps have resulted in improved equity
of water distribution. FOs resolved more than 2,800 disputes. This included 1,758 disputes related to
unauthorized water use/ water theft.

Preliminary AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT estimates indicate that improvement of one watercourse
results in saving of about 100 AF annually. Upto June 2008 about 634,613 acres (256,928 ha) acres were
leveled by the laser levelers provided under the Program.
