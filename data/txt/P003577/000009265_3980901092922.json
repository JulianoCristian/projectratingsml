Some lessons learned included: this\n            is to reduce the likelihood of two risks that often\n            undermine the subprojects' eventual viability. The\n            first risk relates to the subborrower missing the market\n            opportunity for which it was designed and being forced to\n            subsequently compete in a market environment very different\n            to the one expected at the project's conception. The\n            second risk relates to the increased risk of cost overruns\n            in long-gestation projects. The practical implications are\n            that the subprojects investment plans should allow for rapid\n            implementation, and be sufficiently flexible to quickly draw\n            in additional resources, if needed and justified, with\n            limited delay. If the Bank is to be involved in State-Owned\n            Enterprise (SOE) reform at the individual enterprise level,\n            the sponsored activities need to go well beyond upgrading\n            the physical equipment and technology. In this case, the\n            three cement plants have been forced to compete in a market\n            dominated by inexpensive low-grade cement, where little\n            price distinction is made for cement quality due to the lack\n            of government regulation enforcing the use of high-grade\n            cement and discouraging polluting cement plants."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
