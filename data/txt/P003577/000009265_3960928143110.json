The project consists of three\n            components: (a) Tongling cement production and distribution;\n            (b) Zhongguo cement plant rehabilitation; and (c) technical\n            assistance. The Tongling component will implement a regional\n            cement production and distribution scheme, which involves\n            installation of a cement plant at Tongling, and construction\n            of a clinker grinding at Ningbo to process clinkers to be\n            shipped from Tongling. This component will be supported by a\n            river and coastal bulk transport system which includes a\n            loading terminal at Tongling, bulk carriers, a clinker\n            receiving terminal at Ningbo, and bulk cement receiving\n            terminals at Nantong and Wenzhou. The Zhongguo component\n            involves replacing wet-process cement production units by a\n            dry-process cement unit in order to improve efficiency and\n            product quality and to expand production capacity of an\n            existing medium-scale cement plant. The technical assistance\n            component provides financial and technical support to\n            strengthen four cement industry research and design\n            institutes and a study to improve the efficiency and\n            emissions of small-scale cement plants."}, "docdt": "1992-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
