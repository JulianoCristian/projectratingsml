  Burundi's economy from a post-conflict to a sustainable\n            development oriented economy. In practice, these efforts\n            consist to formulate and implement policies to accelerate\n            growth and promote human development, including through\n            private sector development. At the conclusion of the ERSG\n            IV-V programmatic series, tangible progress with respect to\n            each component of the reform program is expected, including:\n            (i) measurable improvements in public finance management;\n            (ii) measurable improvements in the environment for private\n            sector development, with a focus on improved performance of\n            the energy sector; (iii) progress in the liberalization of\n            the productive sector, including the execution of the reform\n            program in the coffee sector; and (iv) measurable progress\n            towards coping with the effects of an ongoing fuel and food crisis."}, "docdt": "2011-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
