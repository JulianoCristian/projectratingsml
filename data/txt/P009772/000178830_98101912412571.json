The project would contain a\n            package of components designed to: improve the vegetative\n            cover in the upper catchments of the Shiwalik Hills, thereby\n            regulating run-off and reducing soil erosion; protect\n            agricultural land below the Hills from the devastation of\n            annual floods; and enhance the productivity of both forest\n            and agricultural land thus protected. The project would be\n            implemented in five watersheds in the Kandi Tract, the\n            Punjab portion of the Shiwaliks."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
