ongoing activities. Project\n            components will include: (i) creation of an Agricultural\n            Research Council to advise on priorities and to produce a\n            Master Plan for agricultural research; and (ii) reduction of\n            the Department of Agricultural Research's (DAR) station\n            network and improvement in physical facilities. The project\n            will involve; (iii) reorganization of DAR, as well as\n            management and systems improvements; (iv) staff development;\n            and (v) intensified collaboration with International and\n            Regional Agricultural Research Centers and introduction of a\n            contract research program. It will further consist of the;\n            (vi) establishment of adaptive research teams and research\n            extension workshops. It will finally include; (vii) a\n            reduction in running costs of ongoing activities, and\n            reallocation of budgeting proceeds to sustain the proposed\n            new activities. The project provides for civil works;\n            equipment, furniture, vehicles; staff relocation; technical\n            assistance and training; and operating costs."}, "docdt": "1985-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
