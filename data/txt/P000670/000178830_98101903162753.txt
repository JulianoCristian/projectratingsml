INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSCCIATION
REPORT AND RECOM4ENDATION CF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELORV4ET CREDIT
TO THE E4PIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit herewith the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US $3.5 million to the Empire of Fthiopia to finance part of the cost of an
agricultural development project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        This is the first agricultural project in Ethiopia to be submitted
for consideration by the Executive Directors.   Most Ethiopians obtain their
livelihood from subsistence forming in the highlands where crop yields are
very low due to the traditional method of cultivation in small holdings, and
it has long been recognized that modernization of subsistence agriculture
is essential to economic development in Ethiopia. However, in view of the
immense difficulties of transforming the structure of the rural society in
Ethiopia, it has been necessary to devise a gradual approach to the problem
to be based during the next few years on a small number of integrated regional
"package programs". The Ethiopian Government is committed to this apnroach
and has already established one such regional project. The "Chilalo Agricul-
tural Development Unit" which was established in September 1967 by the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA) and the Ethiopian Government has
many similarities with the proposed IDA project, particularly in organization
and financial structure.   The SIDA project has mnde an encouraging start in
its first two years.
3.        The proposed project hps been prepared over a long period of time
by the Ethiopian Government, the IBRD Permanent Mission in East Africa, the
Agricultural Development Service (Nairobi), the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program
(Rome) and the Bank headquarters staff in Washington. As a result the Govern-
ment submitted to the Association in September 1968 a request for assistance
in financing the first six-year phase of a program for agricultural development
in the Wolamo subprovince of Sidamo Province in southern Ethiopia. An
appraisal mission visited Ethiopia in November 1968 and recommended some modi-
fications in the project that were accepted by the Ethiopian Government.
4.        Negotiations for the proposed IDA credit took place in Washington
in July 1969. The borrower w.s represented by His Excellency Ato Tesfa
Bushen, Vice Minister of Agriculture; Ato Woldemariam Girme, Director Gener2l
of Finance, Credit and Investment in the Ministry of Finance; and Ato Asfaw
Damte, Financial and Economic Attache with the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington.

(appraved 1964), US $1.0 million in the Ethiopian Pulp and Paper Company
(as a result of a US $1.7 million maximum undermriting commitment, approved
1965) and US $9.0 million in HVA-Metahara (sugar growing and milling, approved
1967).
7.       Aside from the 1968 loan and credit for highways, there are no out-
standing problems of delays in disbursements. For the highway project a
second tender was required due to an insufficient number of responses to the
first tender. The second tender drew more responses, and the various contracts
were signed in July and August 1969.
8.       It is expected that a second agricultural project requiring a loan
of about US $3.0 million will be ready for presentation within a few months.
Other operations under consideration are in the fields of education and water
and sewerage in Addis Ababa; to carry out the technical and management studies
for the latter the Executive Directors approved on July 15, 1969 a grant of
up to US $180,000.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
9.       Borrower:                Empire of Ethiopia.
Amount:                  US $3.5 million equivalent in various
currencies.
Purpose:                 To help finance the first six-year phase
of an integrated agricultural development
program to improve the yield and quality cf
crops in three highland development areas,
and to resettle farm families in two new
settlement areas in the savanna zone.
Amortization:            In 50 years including a 10-year period of
grace through semi-annual instalments of
1/2 of 1% from December 15, 1979 through
June 15, 1989 and of 1-1/2% from December 15,
1989 through June 15, 2019.
Service Charge:          3/4 of 1% per annum.
Estimated Economic Rate
of Return:               13%
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.      An appraisal report entitled 'Wolamo Agricultural Development
Project - Ethiopia" (PA-9a) is attached.
11.      Agriculture in Ethiopia provides 90 percent of employment, 60 percent
of the gross national product and almost all exports. While some progress
has taken place in the development of a small modern commercial farming sector,
the vast majority of the population are still engaged in subsistence farming
on very small holdings using outdated end inefficient methods. In view of
the numerous and complex problems in the subsistence farming sector, any
attempt to increase yields calls for simultaneous attacks on many fronts
through providing farm inputs, feeder roads, marketing and credit facilities,
primary processing facilities, extension services, etc. Due to the pressure
of ponulation in the highlands there is need for resettlement of farmers in
new areas.
12.      The proposed project is designed as a concentrated effort to improve
both yields and quality of crops produced by 7,750 farm families in the Wolamo
subprovince. In the highland area of the subprovince, 6,000 farm families
would receive the benefits arising from improved roads, markets, water supplies,
agricultural credit, and intensive extension services. Production of maize,
wheat and livestock would be increased by the use of improved seed, fertilizer,
implements, working oxen and dairy cows which would be provided on credit.
Earnings on existing coffee production would be increased through improvements



- 4 -
in quality brought about by better processing. In addition, two areas in
the savanna zone which now contain 700 farms, would be reorganized and expanded
to accommodate the resettlement of 1,050 farm families from more densely
populated areas.
13.      To ensure timely and controlled development of the project, the
Government will establish a separate project organization to be called the
Wolamo Agricultural Development Unit (WADU). WADU will be managed by a Project
Director responsible for the administration and organization of the project,
subject to the policy guidance of an interministerial committee and the
limitation of the approved budget. Because of the present acute shortage
of trained and experienced Ethiopians, foreign staff would be required for
management and key executive posts, but would be phased out during the six-
year project development period, leaving a cadre of Ethiopians who should be
capable of managing future phases of IWIADU.
14.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US $5.1 million;
foreign exchange costs are estimated at US $2.2 million or 43 percent of
the total cost. The proposed credit of US $3.5 million would finance
69 percent of the total cost. The Government would finance 28 percent
and the remaining 3 percent would be provided from the United Kingdom
technical assistance and the World Food Program. About $1.3 million of
the proposed credit would be used to finance local expenditures; this is
considered to be justified by the strategic nature of this project, taking
into account the fact that at its present early stage of economic development
Ethiopia would have great difficulties in mobilizing the full amount of
domestic resources required to make an effective attack on its fundamental
agricultural problems.
15.       At full production, which would be achieved in the ninth year,
the cash income of the average highland farmer would increase to about
US $130 from the present level of about US $82. After paying the marketing
fees the net increase in disposable cash income would be about 30 percent
for all farmers in the highland development area. In the settlement areas
the average farmer would earn a net cash income of some US $175 in addition
to obtaining subsistence for his family. Taking into account the direct
benefits and costs based on rather conservative assumptions as to yields
and prices, the estimated economic rate of return for the project over
20 years would be 13 percent.
16.       Rate of return calculations, however, are an inadequate measure
of the full value of the Wolamo project. They do not reflect the value
of training Ethiopian agriculturists, or of the valuable experience which
will be derived from this project in guiding Ethiopia's future agricultural
development policies. Only through carefully analyzing the effects of
concentrated efforts on relatively small areas like Wolamo, can the
Government design larger scale projects for the modernization of Ethiopia's
subsistence agriculture sector.
17.       Procurement of vehicles, tractors, agricultural implements and
farm inputs, the contract price of which will exceed the equivalent of



US $20,000, will be made on the basis of formal international competitive
bidding. Other procurement will follow agreed procedures which ensure
adequate advertising and effective competition.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANID AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Association and the
Empire of Ethiopia, the Recommendation of the Statutory Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
19.       The draft, Credit Agreement contains terms which are similar to
those in other agricultural credit agreements signed by the Association.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A '"Iemorandum on Recent Economic Developments in Ethiopia"
was annexed to my report of April 23, 1969 on a proposed loan for the
Finchaa Hydroelectric Project; some comments were also included in the
text of that report. There has been no significant change in the economy
from what was described there. The basic economic data for Ethiopia
are attached.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREESINT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply w?ith the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - R2CO:I2iEDATIOU
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
