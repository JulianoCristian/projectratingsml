In the highland area of the subprovince, 6,000\n            farm families would receive the benefits arising from\n            improved roads, markets, water supplies, agricultural\n            credit, and intensive extension services. Production of\n            maize, wheat and livestock would be increased by the use of\n            improved seed, fertilizer, implements, working oxen and\n            dairy cows which would be provided on credit. Earnings on\n            existing coffee production would be increased through\n            improvements in quality brought about by better processing.\n            In addition, two areas in the savanna zone which now contain\n            700 farms, would be reorganized and expanded to accommodate\n            the resettlement of 1,050 farm families from more densely\n            populated areas."}, "docdt": "1969-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
