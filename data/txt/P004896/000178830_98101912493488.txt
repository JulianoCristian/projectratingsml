I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Socio-Economic Development and Transport Needs
1.01      Algeria's long-term development strategy has emphasized the rapid
establishment of an integrated industrial base within a national policy of
socio-economic decentralization. The success of this policy has relied ex-
tensively on the growth of the hydrocarbon sector, and this continues to
provide the most important base for economic development (62% of expected
1980 revenues). However, Algeria's development strategies show an increas-
ing emphasis on non-industrial sectors, especially housing, agriculture and
public utilities, to promote an equitable level of regional socio-economic
integration.
1.02      The rapid growth of regional development is placing an increas-
ing burden on the country's transport facilities, with commodity traffic
growing by an average of 12% p.a. since 1976. Whilst important efforts
have been made to improve and maintain the transport infrastructure (para.
1.05), this has been unable to keep pace with growth in transport demand
and traffic. Thus, despite the changing investment emphasis in socio-
economic development, improvements in the quality and quantity of the trans-
port infrastructure remain a major factor in future development plans.
B. The Transport System
1.03      Traffic distribution between modes is summarized in Table 1.1.

to be temporary (1980 estimates are 220 million passengers) and is
explained by the unusual 21% increase between 1976 and 1977.

-2-
1.04      The classified road network (39,000 km) is the most important
mode, carrying approximately 76% of freight and 90% of public interurban
passenger traffic. Road traffic has been growing since 1976 at 10% p.a.
for freight and 5% p.a. for passengers excluding private cars and taxis.
Traffic on the 4,000 km railway system has grown at only 4% a±±d 5% annually
for freight and passengers during the period 1970-78; but figures for 1976-
78 indicate that growth rates have increased to 10% and 40% with much of
the increase in passenger traffic being due to the growth in commuters.
Port traffic consists mainly of hydrocarbon exports (47.3 million tons in
1978) and merchandise imports (13.6 millions tons in 1978) with annual
growth rates for 1975-78 of 8% for exports and 9% for imports.
C. Governnent Policy in Transport Development
1.05      Starting with the 1974-77 Development Plan, important efforts
were made to meet the backlog in transport needs through new investments,
increased maintenance and intensified training of personnel.  An average
of 7% of public investment was devoted to,improving transport infrastruc-
tures as compared to 3% before 1974. Despite these efforts, the develop-
ment objectives and day-to-day commercial activities, which are generating
rapidly increasing traffic volumes, remain seriously hampered by the trans-
port sector deficiencies, in particular: (a) inadequate road capacity and
general deteriorating quality of existing roads; (b) low efficiency, low
productivity and cumbersome management procedures of ports and railways
operations; and (c) overall shortage of qualified and trained staff re-
sulting in low efficiency at most levels of the work force throughout the
transport sector.
1.06      The proposed 1980-84 Development Plan seeks to overcome the
weaknesses indicated above and tentative investment proposals, compared
with 1974-79, are given in Table 1.2 (1978 and 1979 were transition years).

-3-
Of particular importance in the development plan are: (i) an increase of
about 33% in the road investment and maintenance budget from US$292 million
equivalent   in 1979 to US$390 million  equivalent  in 1980 (para. 2.08)
consistent with the overall budget increase in 1980 of 37%; (ii) the lare
increase in railway maintenance, renewal and investment for 1980-84;
and (iii) reorganization of ports operations into decentralized auto-
nomous organizations.
1.07      The total proposed average annual investment in transport for
1980-84 shows a decrease of about 3% over the 1974-79 period in real terms.
The most noticeable feature of the proposed program is the major increase in
railway investment to 11.0 billion Algerian Dinars, in the plan period.
However, the DA 11.0 billion is stated to be the provisionally approved
investment program whilst budget allocations for investment during the
1980-84 plan, taking into account implementation capability, have been tenta-
tively set at DA 5.5 billion. Other than the proposed level of investment
in the railway sector, particularly construction of new lines the justifica-
tion of which remains to be demonstrated, the 1980-84 Transport Sector
Investment Program appears reasonable in 'relation to demands.
1.08      Since 1976, the Governnent embarked on large scale road modern-
ization programs and improved maintenance based on an overall assessment
of the needs of the road network. This has included: (i) improving main-
tenance over the entire road network; (ii) rehabilitating and strengthening
existing road sections; (iii) improving and reconstructing road sections,
which could otherwise become bottlenecks in the network and hamper economic
development; and (iv) improving overall management of the road sector.
Government has also started implementing large scale training programs,
improving educational facilities--some with Bank assistance--and is review-
ing staff development opportunities and compensation policies. This policy
will continue to be followed during the 1980-84 Plan.
.09       For the implementation of the programs for the road sector the
Government is largely relying in the medium term on foreign consultants and
contractors except in the case of road maintenance where force account
operations have been shown to be more cost effective. To attain self-
sufficiency in the longer term the Government has established a number of
public consulting firms and public enterprises, which are expected gradually
to lead to increased productivity and efficiency to meet the needs of the
road sector programs.
D. Bank Participation in Addressing Transport Related Issues
1.10      Transport infrastructure budget allocations have substantially
increased between 1979 and 1980 and under the Third Development Plan (1980-
84). Roads and railways are the subsectors most in need of improvement
and maintenance, although all subsectors have experienced personnel short-
ages and management deficiencies. Government policy in meeting the needs
of the transport sector are generally vell conceived and adequately
executed, although planning coordination, both intra and intersectcrially
is weak and requires additional support. The Bank is in general agreement
with Government transport sector policies and has participated in them
through six previous projects. Three projects approved in 1973, 1977 and
1979 respectively, addressed the highway subsector. The first project has
been completed satisfactorily and closed in 1979 (Audit Report No. 2882 of
March 13, 1980), whilst the second project, after an initial delay caused



- 4 -
by an unsuccessful first round of bidding, is now fully committed as is
90% of the third project.
1.11      The proposed project will make an important contribution through
its road maintenance and pavement strengthening components (para. 3.03 -
3.04) to the preservation and improvement of the existing infrastructure.
This will not only be achieved through the provision of additional engineer-
ing resources, but also by increasing the productivity of the existing road
maintenance personnel (para. 3.05). Improvement of the Bordj Mira-Kherrata
section of National Road (NR) 9 (para. 3.08-3.10) will lead to significant
transport cost savings between the developing port of Bejaia and the hinter-
land area centered on Setif, and will remove a serious transport bottle-
neck which is not only limiting the development of the Bejaia - Setif
region, but also constraining the effective growth of Bejaia port, which
is one of the few Algerian ports with physical growth potential.
II.  THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The system of national roads (about 19,000 km) and wilaya (pro-
vincial) roads (about 20,000 km) provides access to all major towns and
producing areas of the country, although at decreasing levels of service.
The rapidly increasing traffic volumes, following widespread industriali-
zation and regional development call for the network's urgent upgrading
and improved maintenance. The Second and Third Highway Projects, as well
as the Government's substantially increased budget allocations (para. 2.07),
have addressed these needs but a major share bf the paved network, which
represents 83% of the classified road-system continues to deteriorate due
to the combination of heavy traffic and insufficient maintenance in earlier
years. Some roads, in particular those crossing the mountain ranges, are
inadequate for existing and forecast traffic volumes and have become bottle-
necks in the network. Besides the national and wilaya roads, an estimated
60,000 km of local and unclassified rural, private, service and forestry
roads, feed into the road network. Very little maintenance is done to
these roads; a matter which the Government is presently addressing (para.
2.14).
B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.02      In 1976 the vehicle fleet was estimated at 478,000, of which
about 22% were heavy vehicles. In 1980 the vehicle fleet has increased to
about 800,000 vehicles of which 30% are heavy vehicles; the average annual
increase of just under 14% corresponds closely with the increase in traffic
between 1976 and 1979, as measured by traffic counts. Government continues
to limit the importation of vehicles and the resale market for new vehicles
indicates a considerable pent-up demand, which could be translated into a
major increase in the vehicle fleet should the supply situation be eased.



- 5 -
Based on the Government's policy on importation of vehicles and earlier
traffic counts, traffic growth is estimated at 10% for 1980-83 and at 8%
p.a. thereafter. An important characteristic of the vehicle fleet is its
average age of about 10.5 years which is high as compared to other countries
with similar GNP and this undoubtedly makes direct vehicle operating costs
more sensitive to road conditions than in many countries.
2.03      Medium and long distance road transport is largely undertaken by
public companies, SNTR for freight (2,600 trucks) and SNTV for passengers
(2,440 buses), although a large number of public enterprises also operate
own account fleets. By law, private truckers normally may operate only one vehicle
and of less than 5.5 tons capacity, although exceptions are made to this
if an economic case is made. Although relatively unrestricted, private
operators undertake mainly local distribution (less than 100 km) as
they are not competitive with the larger SNTR trucks over medium and long
distance hauls. The transport organization is adequate to handle the needs
and total capacity is sufficient for forecast long-haul transport demand,
while excess capacity exists for short-haul traffic. There is no problem
of excessive axle loads as Government controls the medium and heavy truck-
ing industry almost entirely and private truckers are limited to smaller
vehicles.
C. Administration
2.04      The Government is pursuing a policy of decentralization and
separation of responsibilities at the wilaya level. The wilaya director-
ates for infrastructure are in the process of a reorganization, similar to
that effected for the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) in 1978, aimed at the
separation of responsibilities for roads and for housing and construction
by 1981. The directorates for basic infrastructure (DIB), would be res-
ponsible only for maintenance of national and wilaya roads. They would
also supervise new construction and provide limited assistance to local
Governments for maintaining local and unclassified roads, when financing
for such operations is available. The efficiency of the road administration
continues to suffer from a shortage of qualified staff and Government has
had to continue to rely on technical assistance to prepare and implement
investment programs; but this should improve as a result of the Government's
training effort, assisted by the Bank, for MPW staff (para. 2.15-2.16).
D. Planning
2.05      The MPW has overall responsibility for planning classified road
investments and maintenance programs. These are based on a master plan
prepared in 1977 under the Bank's First Highway Project. A general traffic
study for updating this master plan has been started in 1980 under the
Bank's Third Highway Project and is expected to be completed by the end of
1981. The master plan is well designed and allows for phased construction
of its components.
E. Financing
2.06      Financing of new construction and maintenance of national roads
is entirely the responsibility of MPW whilst for wilaya roads, only new
construction is included in MPW's budget with maintenance being financed
by wilaya governments.  nuaget aliocations ar  aauequate add budget appro-
priations for 1930 are consistent with overall budget allocations agreed
with the Bank during loan negotiations for the Third Project.



-6-
2.07      Total expenditures for roads have increased steadily since 1974.
Total budget allocations for national, wilaya and local paved roads reached
US$390 million equivalent in 1980, with US$290 million equivalent earmarked
for investments and US$100 million equivalent for maintenance. Over the
period 1980-83 annual budget allocations for maintenance including capital
and recurrent costs are expected to remain at US$100 million equivalent in
constant 1980 prices, but the implementation of the improved maintenance
program would allow wilaya directorates gradually to carry out more mainte-
nance operations with the same budget allocations. In 1980, the average
allocation for maintenance of national roads amounts to US$3,350 per km and
for wilaya roads US$1,500 per km. These allocations were defined by studies
carried out under the Bank's First Highway Project and are sufficient for
adequate maintenance operations as conceived in the maintenance program.
Details of expenditures and budget allocations for roads are in Table 2.2.
Average annual growth rate of the budget allocations was 33% for investments
and 22% for recurrent expenditures, showing a real annual growth of 21% for
investments and 10% for recurrent expenditures between 1976 and 1980.

2.08      Government statistics on road user revenues show that revenues
adequately cover expenditures for the road subsector (Table 2.3). Con-
sequently this does not present an issue.

F. Engineering
2.09      MPW is responsible for the technical aspects of highway projects.
Under the First Highway Project, the Government employed consultants to
prepare general studies on maintenance operations, design standards, phased
construction of pavements, road capacity, etc., which now serve as guide-
lines for feasibility studies and detailed engineering in all wilaya direc-
torates. Most of these studies were prepared by foreign consultants but
local consulting firms have since been created, some in joint venture with
foreign consultants.  The Government is eager to stimulate the development
of these consultants as well as strengthening its national and wilaya
materials laboratories (para. 1.09). To assist the development of local
consultants the proposed loan would finance local consultants at the same
percentage rate as foreign firms (para. 3.20).
G. Construction
2.10      The domestic road construction industry consists of public
enterprises and a few rather small private contractors. Since 1976, some
of the complex road projects, financed under the Second and Third Highway
Projects, exceeded the capacity and capability of the domestic industry
and major foreign contractors are now providing the required capacity;
the domestic industry continues to be fully employed on less complex road
projects. To meet this shortage in capacity in the long term the Govern-
ment decided in November 1979 to create seven new public enterprises, six
for roads and one for bridges. These new enterprises will be equipped to
carry out the less complex projects initially, while the expansion of the
existing public enterprises would be controlled and the major effort aimed
at improving efficiency and productivity.
2.11      The efficiency of public enterprises is generally low.  They are
constrained by the lack of managerial experience, shortage of good technical
staff and are overextended. As a result, there is little competition and
unit prices are high, whilst productivity is low. Until now, MPW assumed



- 8 -
that growth in capacity and efficiency of public enterprises could be
achieved by they, themselves, improving their management and technical
capacity by hiring, when necessary, expatriate staff. However, experience
has shown the MPW that this was not sufficient and that the enterprises'
developmeL. would be achieved more successfully by:  (i) controlling their
growth; (ii) encouraging joint ventures with foreign contractors; (iii)
creating new enterprises to have a better regional spread of construction
capacity; and (iv) providing them with managerial assistance.
The small private contractors would continue to carry out their contracts
at the local level.
2.12      Several joint ventures are already operational and the Government
has created the new enterprises under a special budgetary allocation. The
proposed project would provide for training and assistance for the public con-
struction enterprises. Terms of reference, prepared by the Bank, were
submitted to the Government and were discussed and agreed during loan
negotiations. They are available in the project file (Document C.3).
H. Maintenance
2.13      Maintenance of national and wilaya roads is the responsibility
of the DIBs (para. 2.04) of the MPW. These suffer from a lack of equipment
and to carry out their maintenance program they seek rented equipment,
which is not readily available, and try to utilize contractors who are
often not interested as they are already overextended. As a result, costs
of maintenance operations have increased substantially above budget alloca-
tions. To overcome this difficulty, the Government has decided to imple-
ment a maintenance program under which routine and light periodic mainte-
nance (resurfacing) would be done by force account by the DIBs, while heavy
periodic maintenance (pavement strengthening) and all new construction would
be entrusted to contractors. Under the Third Highway Project a first
tranche (1980-81) of a five-year program (198p-84) was started and equipment,
financed from the loan proceeds, is expected to be delivered by mid-1980.
The first operational year of the program would be 1981. Equipment financed
under the Third Highway Project consists mainly of quarry equipment to pro-
duce crushed stone for resurfacing and patching, equipment for resurfacing
and routine operations like patching and maintenance of shoulders and
ditches and equipment for transportation. The proposed project would con-
tinue to support this program for 1982-83 and provide financing for similar
equipment to meet the maintenance needs.
2.14     The maintenance of local and unclassified roads is neglected
(para. 2.01). Finance for these operations has been lacking and the organ-
izational set-up has slowly withered away. The maintenance, whenever done
under budget allocations for special programs, is carried out by the DIBs
or contractors. The Government is actively considering this issue and has
various alternatives, among which are: extending the responsibility of
MPW and its DIBs; creating a new organization for maintenance of lower
class roads; or, establishing and stimulating the regional contracting
industry, including local public companies. The Government has requested
the Bank to assist in resolving this issue through a rural roads project,
currently under preparation and expected to start implementation in 1982
(para. 3.13).

I. Training
2.15      The technical staff of the MPW consists of some 2,000 technicians
and 340 maintenance personnel. Furthermore, public companies (enterprises
and consulting firms) under the supervision of MPW employ 1,500 technicians
and 800 foremen, mechanics and equipment operators. Total estimated per-
sonnel needs for MPW, including the new public enterprises created in
November 1979 (para. 2.10), are for 12,500 in 1985: 5,700 for the Ministry
and its wilaya directorates, and 6,800 for public companies. The MPW has
several educational facilities at all personnel levels and projected needs
for engineers are expected to be met through current training facilities,
and direct recruitment. However, the needs for superintendents, foremen
and maintenance personnel are not expected to be met fully until the end
of the 1980s.
2.16      The MPW has already taken some measures to increase training
capacity for maintenance personnel by enlarging some of its educational
facilities and creating new training centers. Under the Second and Third
Highway Projects training of maintenance personnel was started through
seminars and intensive courses, in Algeria and abroad. The Third Highway
Project includes financing for setting up two permanent training centers
for equipment operators and mechanics. The proposed project will continue
this effort and the total output from these centers and all other training
facilities available in Algeria are expected to meet two-thirds of the pro-
jected needs by 1985 and progressively more over time. Furthermore the
MPW is considering improving the output of the training schools and will
carry out an in-depth study to determine specific steps to strengthen the
schools' current capacity. The review of employment conditions and com-
pensation policies, currently underway should also facilitate the recruit-
ment of the necessary staff.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01       The proposed project would contribute significantly to the Government's
efforts to meet the backlog in maintenance and in the modernization and
rehabilitation of the road network in support of the policy of decentraliza-
tion and regional development. Its main objectives are to: (i) improve
overall road maintenance' (ii) remove a serious bottleneck in the network
which could hamper regional economic development; (iii) improve the efficiency
of the construction industry; and (iv) develop a program to improve accessi-
bility of rural areas.
B. Description
3.02      The project comprises:
Road Maintenance
(i)  a second tranche of a five-year program (1980-84) for
improving road maintenance, for which a first tranche was
financed under Loan 1683-AL, Third Highway Project, and
which would include purchase of road maintenance equipment
to complete and expand, as necessary, the maintenance
fleet for routine maintenance and resurfacing;



- 10 -
(ii) a second tranche of a road rehabilitation and pavement strengthening
program started under Loan 1683-AL, Third Highway Project (Map
IBRD 13997R);
(iii) training of site and workshop mechanics for road maintenance
operations;
Construction
(iv) reconstruction with supervision of the 7 km Bordj Mira-Kherrata
section of NR9 linking Setif and its region with the port of Bejaia
(Map IBRD 13997R); and
Assistance and Studies
(v)  for strengthening productivity of public construction enterprises
and for improving access to disadvantaged areas and maintenance and
rehabilitation of rural roads.
Road Maintenance
3.03     As a result of maintenance studies prepared under Loan 912-AL, First
Highway Project, the Government decided to improve cost effectiveness of road
maintenance operations and designed a program to achieve adequate maintenance
levels for national and wilaya roads by 1985. A first tranche of this program
was included under Loan 1683-AL, Third Highway Project; it comprises the
program's equipment and training needs for 1980-81. The equipment was pro-
cured according to schedule and is expected to be delivered starting mid-1980
so that the first operational year would be 1981. The training has also
started (para. 3.05). A second tranche of the program is included under the
proposed project and would cover the equipment and training needs for 1982-83.
The procurement of the equipment is scheduled to start in mid-1980, with
delivery expected for mid-1981 so that the first operational year of this
second tranche would be 1982. The maintenance operations with the additional
equipment are planned and implemented according to annual programs setting
forth physical targets and budgetary appropriations agreed with the Bank. The
1980 program as well as the budgetary allocations for 1980-81 were agreed
with the Bank during loan negotiations for Loan 1683-AL, Third Highway
Project. The subsequent annual programs would be agreed each year starttng
in April 1981 while the budgetary allocations for 1982-83 were agreed at
loan negotiations. The agreed program for 1980 and the draft program for
1981 are available in the Project File (Document C.7).
3.04     Also, under the previous highway project, the Government embarked on
a rehabilitation and paved roads strengthening program according to an over-
all rehabilitation program developed under the First Highway Project in 1977-
78 simultaneously with the road network master plan (para. 2.05). This
program included about 2,000 km of roads to be rehabilitated. A first tranche
(250 km) was included in the Third Highway Project and bids were received in
February 1980 for the first 175 km.  Construction is expected to start by mid-1980.



- il -
Studies are underway for about 350 km of other road sections of which about
130 km would be included under the proposed project. The preparation of
these road sections is done in accordance with a methodology agreed with
the Bank.  The first 60 km, expected for implementation immediately following
loan effectiveness, were discussed and agreed during loan negotiations.
The criteria for Bank approval under the program are: (i) quality of prepar-
ation and analysis acceptable to the Bank; (ii) ER of the investment package
at least equal to the opportunity cost of capital in Algeria (10%); and
(iii) the implementation of an investment package to take place in its optimal
year.
3.05     To continue supporting the strengthening of MPW's training effort
for maintenance personnel, the proposed project will include the continua-
tion of the training program for equipment operators and siLe and workshop
mechanics. The program is designed to train 250 equipment operators and site
and workshop mechanics annually from 1981 onwards and retrain 220 of the
1,140 current staff annually (para. 2.15).` The program was started at the
training center in Bethioua (Map IBRD 13997R) in February 1979 and the first
output was 72 equipment operators in January 1980. The training of site
mechanics is expected to start in Bethioua in September 1980 financed under the
Third Highway Project. The second center in Batna (Map IBRD 13997R) is
scheduled to begin the training of equipment operators in February 1981,
financed under the same project while the training of mechanics in Batna
would be started in 1982 financed under the proposed Fourth Highway Project.
Details of the proposed training program are available in the project file
(Document C.2).
3.06      Bank financing in road maintenance would provide for the full foreign
exchange cost of: (i) equipment for routine maintenance and resurfacing,
consisting of quarry equipment for crushed stone, resurfacing equipment,
routine maintenance equipment, transportation equipment and spare parts for
existing and new equipment according to a list agreed at loan negotiations; and
(ii) consultant's services for training of mechanîcs in Batna according to a
program agreed at loan negotiations. Bank financing would also provide for 45%
of total cost or 87% of foreign exchange cost of about 130 km of the road
rehabilitation and pavement strengthening program.
3.07      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from Governnent
that it will:
(i) carry out the maintenance operations in accordance with annual pro-
grams setting forth physical targets and budgetary appropriations
submitted to the Bank for review and comment prior to April 30 of
each year and consistent with overall budget allocations agreed
wîth the Bank at loan negotiations;
(ii) provide all means required for the carryîng out of the entire
maintenance program;
(iii) renew and replace in a timely manner defective or worn out equipment
in accordance with the annual program agreed with the Bank; and
(iv) ensure that sufficient numbers of trainees are trained as instructors
to ensure the efficient continuation of the training centers in
accordance wîth the program agreed with the Bank.

Reconstruction of the Bordj Mira-Kherrata Section of NR9
3.08     The 7 km Bordj Mira-Kherrata section is a critical part of NR9,
linking the port of Bejaia to the fast growing town and region of Setif, an
important industrial and agricultural center. The section is located where
NR9 crosses a mountain chain running east-west parallel with the coastline.
The existing road crosses the mountains following a narrow and winding
riverbed with steep slopes and sharp curves. Studies conducted in the late
1960s and under the First Highway Project indicated that the above section
could become the worst bottleneck on this major link and could hamper
economic development of the regions located south of the mountain chain, in-
cluding the town and region of Setif.
3.09     The existing 7 km road, of widths ranging between 4 and 6 meters,
and without shoulders, follows the winding riverbed with sharp curves
between steep rocky mountain slopes. The existing road can only handle
traffic of about 2,000 vpd, for which, however, the truck size is limited
because of the very poor road geometry. The major deficiencies are: insuf-
ficient capacity for current traffic levels, narrow sections (4 m), no
shoulders, sharp curves, substandard sight distances, steep grades, insuf-
ficient room for passing vehicles in the opposite lane, if any, steep mountain
slopes, and frequent rock falls.
3.10     The proposed construction would replace the existing 7 km road with
a new 6.2 km, two-lane road (lane width 3.25 m with variable shoulders) com-
posed of: eight viaducts of a total length of 1,960 m, six semi-viaducts
totalling 410 m, where the new road partly uses the existing road, five tun-
nels of a total length of 2,610 m and 1,225 m of road in fill and cut. The
project allows for maintaining traffic during construction. The design
provides for passing lanes over a total length of 770 m for descending traffic
and climbing lanes over 1,000 m. Furthermore, the existing road with minor
improvements will be used over a total léngth of 3,840 m for slow moving
heavy climbing traffic. Bidders are allowed to'propose alternative more
economic designs, which would be agreed-with the Bank.
3.11     In light of the difficult technical nature of the construction works
(viaducts and tunnels), the project will also provide for about 198 man-months
of consultants' services to assist MPW in analysing the bids and supervising
the proposed construction. Construction supervision would be the responsibi-
lity of a special DIB and the National Laboratory.
Assistance and Studies
3.12     To assist in strengthening the productivity of public enterprises,
the Government has requested the inclusion in the proposed project of con-
sultants' services (about 120 man-months). This assistance would.be used for
specific tasks for the improvement of the productivity of public construction
companies in accordance with overall terms of reference agreed with the Bank
during loan negotiations.
3.13     The proposed project also provides for consultant's services (about
10 man-months) for the preparation of a future project designed to assist the
Government in improving access to and integration of disadvantaged areas, and
more particularly to improve maintenance and rehabilitation of rural road
networks, currently the responsibility of local governments and the Ministry
of Interior.

C. Engineering
3.14     The road maintenance program is based on the same documentation as
for Loan 1683-AL (Project File Document A.1). Engineering of the Bordj
Mira-Kherrata section of NR9 was financed under the First Highway Project
and carried out by Italconsult (Italy), according to satisfactory design
standards (Project File Document B.2).
D. Cost Estimates
3.15     The estimated costs of the project are in Table 3.1, with recurrent
costs for implementing the second tranche of the maintenance program in
Table 3.2.
3.16     The cost of the maintenance program is based on the budget appropria-
tions for 1980.      Estimates for road maintenance equipment are based on
bids received in November 1979 for similar equipment financed under the
Third Highway Project, appropriately inflated to the expected time of tender.
The cost of pavement strengthening works is based on unit prices for similar
works resulting from recent bidding (para 3.04).  Construction cost estimates
for the Bordj Mira-Kherrata road section are currently based on quantities
from detailed engineering and unit prices for comparable works obtained in
April 1980 by public bidding for road and railway construction.
3.17     Consultants' services are based on an average man-month cost
(comprising the individual's rate, international travel and local allow-
ances) expected to be about US$9,000 to US$12,500 according to the level.
The man-month cost is consistent with currently applied rates in Algeria
for similar services.
3.18     Physical contingencies for civil works and consultants' services
are estimated at 10%, except for the reconstruction of the Bordj Mira-
Kherrata section where 15% is provided for because of the complexity of the
works; no physical contingencies are provided for maintenance equipment
since all items to be procured were accurately defined at loan negotia-
tions. Contingency allovances for price escalation, mainly for civil works,
were estimated overall at 15.5% (13.3% on foreign costs, 18.4% on local costs)
on the basîs of the implementation schedule (Annex I).
3.19     The percentage of foreign exchange cost in total expenditures is
based on the likely blend of foreign and local participation and is similar
to the percentage under the Third Highway Project. These percentages are
based on detailed analyses of construction costs, and recent bidding.
E. Financing
3.20     The financing arrangements are shown in Tables 3.1 and 3.2.  The
proposed loan of us$110 million would finance up to 100% of the foreign
exchange component of the capital costs of the maintenance program, 87% of
the foreign exchange costs of civil works, and 70% of the total costs of
domestic consultants; 70% being the estimated foreign exchange component fox
foreign consultants (para. 2.09). The Government's contribution of US$280
million would cover the balance of the foreign exchange costs not financed by
the loan and all of the local costs except in the case of local consultants.

3.21     About US$100,000 of the consultant's services costs under the loan,
which relate to preparation of the proposed rural roads project and bid evalua-
tion of the reconstruction of Bordj Mira-Kherrata road section would occur
before loan approval and are recommended for retroactive financing. About
one-third of consultant's services are expected to be supplied by domestic
consultants representing about US$500,000 of local cost financing.
F. Implementation
3.22     Annex I shows the expected timing of project implementation, which
was discussed and confirmed with the Governxent at negotiations.
a. Responsibility for Project Implementation
3.23     MPW would have overall responsibility for project implementation.
The DR of the MPW would have responsibility for procurement of the main-
tenance equipment, the preparation and procurement of rehabilitation works,
and the procurement of civil works. The provincial DIBs would be responsible
under the supervision of DR for maintenancè operations, and supervision of
rehabilitation contracts, while a special subdirectorate under DR would be
responsible for construction supervision of the Bordj Mira-Kherrata road
section. Consultants engaged by MPW would be assigned to assist the
provincial DIB and the special subdirectorate in construction supervision.
Responsibility for the preparation of the rural roads project has been given
to the Ministry of Interior. Assurances concerning project implementation
responsibilities were obtained at loan negotiations.
b. Procurement
3.24     Civil works will be carried out by unit price contracts awarded
through ICB in accordance with the "Bank Guidelines for Procurement." The
Government, in agreement with the Bank, has called for prequalification of
prospective bidders for the Bordj Mira-Kherrata road construction and 12
contractors applied for prequalification. About six bids are expected to be
received by July 10, 1980 and contracts would be awarded following loan
effectiveness. Bidders for rehabilitation works are expected to include
public enterprises. During loan negotiations assurances were obtained
from the Government that it will guarantee the performance of these public
enterprises, in a manner similar to agreements reached with the Bank for the
Second and Third Highway Projects. The road maintenance equipment would be
procured through ICB. Bids would be evaluated on the basis of co0t, delivery
time, and reliability of subsequent dealer service. Domestic preferences in
bid evaluation would be applied in accordance with current Bank policies.
Spare parts vould be procured either through ICB, LIT or directly from the
equipment manufacturers to which they relate, or, for contract amounts not
exceeding US$100,000 purchased locally from import companies, For èquip-
ment and spare parts purchased locally, Bank financing would be limited to
80% of total costs, equivalent to the foreign exchange cost of these items.
Consultant's services would be provided by qualified and experienced con-
sultants, domestic and foreign, and according to terms and conditions all
satisfactory to the Bank. For domestic consultant's services, Bank financing
would be for 70% of total costs, equivalent to the average estimated foreign
exchange cost of foreign consultants.

G. Disbursements
3.25     The proceeds of the proposed loan amount of US$110 million would
be disbursed as follows:
US$
Category                 Million
(a)  Civil Works                     49.5    45% of total expenditures
(b)  Equipment                        35.9    100% of foreign expenditures
and 80% of local expenditures
(c)  Consultant's Services             3.7    100% of foreign expenditures
and 70% of total expenditures
for local consultants
(d)  Unallocated                     20.9
Total                     110.0
Retroactive financing for an amount not exceeding the equivalent of
US$100,000 could be made for Consultant's services.
3.26     Based on these allocations and the project implementation schedule
(Annex I) the schedule of cumulative disbursements is estimated as follows:
Cumulative
Disbursements
at End Fiscal
IBRD Fiscal                Year (US$'000
Year                     Equivalent)

1981/82                     40,000
1982/83                     60,000
1983/84                     85,000
1984/85                    110,000
The preparation stage of,the project is such that disbursements would start
immediately following loan effectiveness. Contract awards are expected by
December  1980 for Bordj Mira-Kherrata, and early in 1981 for road mainte-
nance equipment and rehabilitation works.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits
4.01      Within the broad framework of socio-economic benefits which would
be derived from a more efficient road transport system, it is possible to
identify more specific benefits and beneficiaries related to the proposed
project components:



- 17 -
(i) the improved road maintenance program will lead to increased
productivity in maintenance operations, lower vehicle operating
costs, and the postponement of road rehabilitation programs:
the beneficiaries of this program will be the road users and
road maintenance authorities;
(ii) the paved roads strengthening program will yield similar
benefits and touch upon the same beneficiaries as the road
maintenance program and, in effect, is an integral part
of maintenance operations; and
(iii) the reconstruction of theBordj Mira-Kherrata section of NR9
will remove a serious transport bottleneck which otherwise
would hinder the socio-economic growth of the Setif region and
the development of the port of Bejaia; reduced transport costs
through lower vehicle operating costs and distance savings
will benefit all transport users; indirectly the productivity
of Bejaia port should also benefit,and improvement and main-
tenance needs of alternative routes should be reduced.
B. Improvement of the Bordj Mira-Kherrata Section of NR9
4.02     The proposed reconstruction of the 7 km section of NR9 linking
the port of Bejaia with the town and region of Setif, an important and fast
growing industrial and agricultural area, deserves special mention in view
of the size and unit cost of the investment. The economic analysis shows
the reconstruction to be economically justified for opening in 1985. The
analysis, which was made by comparing transport costs on the'Bejaia-Setif
link with costs on an alternative route through'M'Chedallah, 132 km longer,
demonstrates the benefits resulting from the sole improvement of the Bordj
Mira-Kherrata section accrue mainly to long distance traffic. Increases in
this traffic would have to use the longer M'Chedallah route in the event of
no improvement to the section. Present traffic on the Bordj Mira-Kherrata
section is about 1,800 vpd but, with the economic development of the area
and increased traffic through the port of Bejaia, long distance traffic
levels are expected to reach 3,000 vpd by 1985, largely beyond the capacity
of the existing road (2,000 vpd) (para. 3.09).
4.03     The long aistance traffic mainly consists of dry cargo (bulk and
general cargo) amounting in 1980 to about 650,000 tons with a growth rate
of about 8% p.a.  With the development of the Bejaia port, one of the few
Algerian ports that is not operating at capacity and has potential for
expansion, and the rapid growth of the Setif area, as a result of major
industrial and agricultural developments, the current growth rate is expected
to-continue. By year 2000 about 4.0 million tons of dry cargo are expected
to be shipped through Bejaia port, of which 3.0 million tons would go to
the Setif area. The existing road cannot accommodate such an increase in
traffic, neither in capacity nor in volume. Furthermore, because of the
difficulties in using the existing road and its limited capacity, transport
companies charge tariffs relating to the 132 km detour of this road,
although they may select to use NR9.



- 18 -
4.04     In order to avoid limiting the economic development of the Setif
area, which would occur as a result of the high transport costs from traffic
originating in Bejaia, the Government considers the proposed investment of
the highest priority and has included it in the 1980-84 Development Plan.
The Bank has been involved in the economic and technical ana-lysis of this
component since 1976 and is in general agreement with the Government's assess-
ment of the priority. The investment, although high, represents less than
6% of the road plan for 1980-84 and can be absorbed with little difficulty.
4.05     At loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
that following project completion, it would undertake and make available to
the Bank, a detailed study showing the logic and breakdown of the distribution
of transport benefits resulting from the improvement of the Bordj Mira-
Kherrata road section,
C. Economic Evaluation of Project Components
4.06     The economic evaluation of the road maintenance and rehabilitation
and pavement strengthening components follows procedures laid down at the
time of appraisal of the Third Highway Project.  The description and results
of the calculations are contained in the project file (Document C.1).
The main benefits derive from savings in vehicle operating costs (over a
5-year analysis period for road maintenance and 10 years for the pavement
strengthening program). Vehicle operating costs have been updated to 1980
and traffic flows and growth rates have been revised following MPW traffic
censuses in October/November 1979.
4.07     The consultant's study of the problem of improving transport
facilities between Bejaia and its hinterland centered on Setif was carried
out over a period of three years, with the Bank closely involved at all
stages.  Briefly, the study examined the probable pattern of socio-economic
development of the region and estimated the consequent transport demands,
especially between Bejaia and Setif. Alternative solutions to meet these
demands for 20 years were then evolved, taking into account construction
and maintenance costs and benefits derived from reductions in transport
costs and journey time. The solutions examined included upgrading alterna-
tive routes and three levels of improvement to the Bordj Mira-Kherrata
section of NR9. The result of the analysis showed that the economically
preferred solution was the upgrading of the road section, using a series
of viaducts and tunnels, and this solution has been retained for the project.
Further, net present value calculations showed that the optimum project
timing (the construction period is estimated at 5 years) would be 1985.
Traffic forecasts used in the study have been checked against late 1979
traffic counts and confirm the validity of feasibility study assumptions.
D.  Results of Economic Analysis and Sensitivity
4.08     The following economic rates of return (ER) benefit/cost ratios
(B/C) and first year rates of return (FYB) have been calculated as appropriate
for the main project components and for the overall project (excluding
training). For the Bordj Mira-Kherrata reconstruction, results are given
with and without value of time savings.

a/ This is the minimum ER acceptable under the project but individual
road sections proposed for pavement strengthening are expected to
have much higher ER.
4.09     It is considered that the reconstruction of the Bordj Mira-Kherrata
section of NR9 is the most risk susceptible project element, particularly as
regards project cost. The rate of return was calculated on the basis of 1977
construction cost estimates and vehicle operating costs. Sensitivity tests
applied to these figures show that an increase in construction costs of 25%
reduces the rate of return to 27.5% whilst a reduction in benefits by 25%
reduces the rate of return to 26.7%. If costs increase by 10% whilst each of
base ttaffic, vehicle operating cost savings per vehicle and traffic growth
rate are 10% lower, the rate of return is reduced to 21.7%. However, a
reevaluation of construction costs during loan negotiations on the basis of
recent bidding for similar works confirmed that these costs should be similar
to those used in the 1977 evaluation and, as vehicle operating costs over the
period 1977 to 1980 have increased by about 35%, the rate of return is likely
to be significantly higher than calculated.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During loan negotiations agreement was reached on various issues
referred to in the report, including the following matters of particular
significance. The MPW will:
(i) (a) continue to carry out the maintenance program in
accordance with annual programs setting forth detailed
physical targets and budget appropriations submitted
to the Bank for review and comment prior to April 30 of
each year and consistent with overall budget allocations
agreed with the Bank during loan neogtiations; (b) pro-
vide all means for carrying out the entire program; (c)
renew and replace in a timely manner defective or worn
out maintenance equipment in accordance with the annual
programs referred to in (a) of this paragraph (para. 3.07);



- 20 -
(ii)  submit the technical and economic evaluation of rehabil-
itating individual road sections of the rehabilitation
and pavement strengthening program for Bank approval
before tendering the works according to agreed method-
ology, criteria and procedures (para. 3.04);
(iii)  (a) carry out the training of maintenance personnel in
accordance with a program setting forth training targets
and budgetary allocations agreed with the Bank; (b) make
available a sufficient number of experienced technicians
to be trained as instructors, to ensure the efficient
continuation of the training centers (para. 3.05); and
(iv)  include in the project completion report a detailed analysis
of the distribution of economic benefits realized by public
transport companies following the reconstruction of the
Bordj Mirra Kherrata section of the Bajoia Setif road
(para. 4.05).
5.02     Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this
report the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$110 million to the
Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for a period
of 17 years, including a 4-year grace period.
