training of\n            maintenance personnel, reconstructing a section which is\n            presently a serious bottleneck in the national network that\n            could hamper regional development, improving the efficiency\n            and productivity of the construction industry and helping\n            develop a program to increase access in rural areas. The\n            loan will finance: (i) the full foreign exchange cost of\n            additional equipment for routine and light periodic\n            maintenance within a second tranche of a five year\n            maintenance program and training of maintenance personnel;\n            (ii) 87 percent of the foreign cost of a second tranche of a\n            long-term pavement strengthening program and the\n            reconstruction of a 7 km section of the National Road 9 (NR\n            9) between Bordj Mira and Kherrata; and (iii) 70 percent of\n            the total of consultants services for construction\n            supervision, training of public construction industry\n            personnel and preparation of a project to improve the\n            country's rural road network. Benefits include\n            increased productivity of maintenance operations, reduction\n            in transport costs and savings in road expenditures. Direct\n            beneficiaries are road users and road maintenance authorities."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
