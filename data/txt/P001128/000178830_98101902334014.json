quality of and\n            increase the access to primary education by establishing\n            four primary teacher training centers, (iii) to implement a\n            pilot community development project, and (iv) to prepare a\n            follow-up project and to strengthen the Government education\n            planning capacity. The community development project's\n            being experimental is probably the most risky component; the\n            project is, however, limited to two townships in this phase\n            and would be closely monitored."}, "docdt": "1979-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
