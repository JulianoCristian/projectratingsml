Both World Bank and borrower performance were\n            satisfactory overall. Key lessons learned relate mainly to\n            the resettlement and irrigation components. They include:\n            The need to carefully appraise proposed institutional\n            arrangements for resettlement; the treatment of land\n            acquisition; the feasibility of \"moving back\"\n            resettlement strategies where there is a tendency to\n            overestimate remaining land resources; the need to further\n            advance resettlement planning to allow better assessment of\n            resettlement strategies, and the preparation of more\n            accurate cost estimates; and the need to consider in the\n            project design measures to ensure borrower commitment to all\n            elements important to the success of the project."}, "docdt": "1999-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
