APPRAISAL OF
A RAILWAY PROJECT
ALGERIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Algerian transport system is concentrated in the northern re-
gion, while many areas of the southern desert region have no transport faci-
lities and are completely inaccessible. The system comprises: 79,000 km of
national, regional, and local roads, serving about 256,000 vehicles; a 4,000
km railway system, including a section of the international line between
Rabat (Morocco) and Tunis (Tunisia); 8-major ports and a amaln  fleet of sea-
going ships; 3 international and 10 secondary airports as vell as 2 national
airlines; and gas and oil pipelines.
M.        Previous Government Development Plans accorded low priority to de-
velopment of transport infrastructure. But the 1974r77 Plan, now in prepara-
tion, is expected to emphasize transport development. Furthermore, to for-
mulate an appropriate development strategy for the transport sector in the
next Plan, the Government has initiated a comprehensive transport study by
consultants.
iii.      An efficient and reliable transport system is needed to support
Government' s development strategy of rapid industrialization and increasing
agricultural production through diversification. Both the road and railway
network have deteriorated because of a lack of systematic maintenance, and
inadequate reneval investments. The Bank has already approved a road proj-
ect (Loan 912-ALO) aimed at improving certain major roada and road mainte-
nance, and at strengthening highway planning. The proposed railway project
is designed to continue this policy of upgrading and improvement of infra-
structure and transport planning.,
iv.       A railway development plan totalling about DA 1.9 billion (US$464
million) and covering the renewal and capacity-increasing investments for the
period 1974-77 has been prepared but must still be approved by the Council of
Ministers. The plan seems over ambitious and SNCFA's absorptive capacity would
be insufficient for an investment plan of the envisaged size. Some major ca-
pacity increasing investments still need further evaluation and the Bank vill
assist SNCFA in financing some of these studies. lHowever, this evaluation
will not affect the size, scope and timing of the proposed renewal investments
of high priority which will be required irrespective of the final scope of
SNCFA's overall Investment Plan.
v.        The Bank has been in contact with SNCFA since late 1971 and in
early 1973 a project identification mission visited the raïlways and recom-
mended Bank participation in financing of urgently needed renewal investments
and some consultants' studies designed to establish proper guidelines for
future administration of SNCFA, and to improve its personnel training, par-
ticularly at the middle management level.  The proposed US$127 million proj-
ect would consist of the renewal stage (1974-76) of a reneval and moderniza-
tion program for SNCFA and it inclu4es realignment or renewal of track and



- ii -
track equipment, reneval of rolling stock, signalling and telecommunications,
consulting services, and other miscellaneous work and equipment. All mate-
rial would be procured through international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
vi.       The project has a sound economic and technical justification.  In-
vestments on the Mineral Line are expected to yield an economic return of at
least 20% and investments on the Grande Rocade of at least 18%. SNCFA's
financial position is satisfactory and expected to improve further vith the
execution of the project.
vii.      The principal objectives of the proposed Bank loan are to support
the railway's rehabilitation program and to contribute to the improvement in
investment and overall corporate planning of SNCFA. The loan vill finance
59% (US$49 million) of the foreign exchange cost of the project (US$82.9
million).  The balance concerning items carried over from the previous plan
and already contracted for vill be provided by or through Government; as vill
the local cost component. The Government has asked the Bank for US$0.65 mil-
lion in retroactive financing for a consulting study.  This amount is in-
cluded in the project.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$49 million to SNCFA
for a 20-year term, including 4 years of grace.



APPRAISAL OF
A RAILWAY PROJECT
ALGERIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria
has asked the Bank for a loan of US$49 million to help finance a railway
project.  A project preappraisal mission visited Algeria in January/February
1973 and recommended urgent rehabilitation o2 track, modernization of equip-
ment and some expansion in rolling stock capacity. Based on this recommend-
ation and the findings of an appraisal mission in September/October 1973 a
US$127 million project is recommended for Bank consideration, covering the
years 1974-1976 of the 1974-1977 Government and railway Four-Year Investment
Program. This would be the Bank's first railway project in Algeria and its
second transportation project since Algeria's independence in 1962. A high-
way maintenance and improvement project was approved by the Board of Execu-
tive Directors in May 1973 (Loan 912-ALG).
1.02      This report is based on:  information provided by the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer Algqriens (SNCFA), the Ministry of Transport, a
transport sector study carried out by the British consulting f irm EASAMS Ltd.
(U.K.); a consulting report by the French consulting fira Bureau Central
d'Etudes d'Outre-Mer (BCEOM); the findings of a January/February 1973 Bank
preappraisal mission; and the findings of a September/October appraisal mis-
sion composed of Messrs. D. Havlicek,(Economist), C. Mignot (Engineer), J.
Brechot (Engineer, consultant) and J. Horrocks (Financial Analyst, consultant).
Il. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.    Description
(a) The System
2.01      The concentration of 90% of Algeria's 14.6 million population in
the mountainous northern coastal region (20% of the land area) has resulted
in a dense network of roads and railways. By contrast, few routes penetrate
the southern desert region. Hareh topographical and climatic conditions
make construction of land routes costly and maintenance difficult.
2.02      The transport infrastructure consists of:  about 79,000 km of
roads, of which about 45% are paved and serve about 256,000 motor vehicles;
4,000 km of railways; 8 major ports and a small coastal fleet; 3 interna-
tional airporte; 10 secondary airports and 2 national airlines; about 3,700
km of oil pipeline and about 1,100 km of gas pipeline.



- 2-
(b) The Modes
2.03      Road goods transport moved 25.7 million tons or 79.5% of total land
transport volume in 1972 and increased by about 20% between 1970 and 1973.
It is expected that this rapid growth will continue over the next Four-Year
Plan (1974-77). Intercity road passenger traffic amounted to about 3.9 bil-
lion passenger km (1972) as compared with 1.0 billion for the railways. Rail-
way operations and traffic are discussed in detail in Chapter three.
2.04      Efficient and reliable roads to transport goods and passengers are
essential to support the Government's plans for further development of
agriculture and industry as well as for movement of people and goods, es-
pecially between the most important production and consumption centers. With
many roads deteriorated because of lack of maintenance and delayed improvement
works, the present road network does not meet these requirements and transport
costs are high. In order to assist in remnoving the backlog in improvement,
construction and maintenance of roads carrying heavy traffic volumes, the Bank
agreed in May 1973 to finance the foreign exchange cost of a US$33.1 million
road project (Loan 912-ALG). Through this project, the Government aima to
improve certain major roads and road maintenance and to strengthen highway
planning.
2.05      There is a state-owned National Road Transport Company (SNTR) which
enjoys a monopoly for public road transport. Although private transport
companies still exist to some extent they are only allowed to contract
freight through and on account of SNTR.  Total transport capacity of public
road transport amounted in 1972 to about 30,300 tons; 24,300 tons for SNTR
and 6,000 tons for the affiliated private enterprises. The second important
element in the organization of road traffic :Ls the traffic on own account
(vehicules pour propre compte). Traffic on own account accounted in 1972
for a total transport capacity of 97,000 tons.
2.06      Algeria's main port, Algiers, handles most of the country's general
cargo inports and exports.  Other important ports, usually highly specialized,
are: Oran for general cargo imports; Arzew for crude oil and liquified
natural gas exports; Annaba for steel and iron ore exports; and Skikda for
exports of ammonia, refined petroleum products, crude cil, and liquified
natural gas. The ports are managed and operated by a National Port Authority
under the Ilinistry of Transport. Port design and construction, however, are
the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and Construction (MPWC).
'ost funds allocated for port development in the Four-Year Plan 1970-1973
are for expanding ports that handle petroleum, natural gas, and ore exports;
the ports concerned are Arzew, Annaba, and Skikda, where major port facili-
ties are being constructed or are planned to be constructed shortly. The
Government has asked for Bank assistance in constructing a new port at Bethîoua,
which is needed to export large quantities of liquified natural gas, and to
this end has prepared a project whieh was appraised in October 1973 (para.
2.15).
2.07      Algeria has 3 international airports (Algiers, Annaba, and Oran),
10 secondary airports with paved runways, some smaller local public airports,.



-3-
and numerous private airports mostly built by oil companies. Two airlines,
Air Algerie and Societe de Travail Aerien, offer international and domestic
flights. Although air transport has been increasing rapidly and plays a
vital role in serving the more isolated centers, its total share in the
transport market is still modest. In recent years, expenditures have been
essentially for maintenance works and strengthening of runways at major
airports.
2.08      An extensive network of pipelines evacuates gas and oil from the
Sahara and the Sirte Basin in the eastern part of the country to several
ports on the Mediterranean. Oil production in Algeria increased substantial-
ly after 1956 following discoverles of major fields in the Sahara. In 1959,
a US$50 million Bank Loan (242-FR) helped finance construction of a 412 km
pipeline to evacuate crude oil from the Hassi Messaoud field in the Sahara
to the port of Bejala. Production of oil is estimated at 50 million m3 per
year. Natural gas exports amount to about 27 million m3 per year, and are
expected to rise sharply, primarily as a result of the El Paso Scheme for
exports to the United States. A pipeline fox carrying the gas will be cons-
tructed from the Hassi R'mel field to Arzew port.
B.   Policy, Planning, Coordination, and Lending Strategy
Policy
2.09      Since independence in 1962, the Government has aimed to develop
the economy along socialist lines, under strong central control and with
most of the transport sector in the hands of public enterprises. The main
instruments of development policy have been the Three- and Four-Year Develop-
ment Plans as well as the ordinary and investment budgets. All public enter-
prises must deposit their depreciatîon provision in the treasury. Surpluses
must be transferred to the treasury. In turn, all their investments are
financed from the budget.
2.10      The Ministry of Planning is responsible for preparing the Develop-
ment Plans. A new Plan for 1974-77 is being prepared. In the 1970-1973
Four-Year Plan low priority was accorded to development of transport infra-
structure and emphasis was on investrent in rolling stock for roads and rail-
ways. The program for expansion of rolling stock will be continued and,
additionally, rehabilitation of roads and railway track will play a greater
role in the 1974-1977 Four-Year Plan. While in the 1970-1973 Four-Year Plan
the transport sector investments amounted to only about 3% of total invest-
ments, Government tntends to increase investments for the transport sector
in the next Four-Year Plan considerably in order to eliminate the arrears
in renewal works for roads and railways.
Planning
2.11      Investment planning suffers from several weaknesses, such as:
inadequate data collection and project preparation, unsatisfactory coordina-
tion and exchange of information between government agencies and transport
modes. Government's attempts to imnprove the quality of its planning are



- 4 -
hampered by a severe shortage of qualified staff and until these staff pro-
blems are resolved Algeria will neea assistance from expatriate consultants,
as has been provided for example in the road maintenance project financed by
the Bank (Loan 912-ALG) and is recommended for the proposed railvay project.
Coordination
2.12      Theoretically, allocation of traffic to the government owned Societe
Nationale des Transports Routiers (SNTR) and SNCFA on the one hand and traffic
on own account on the other hand is intended to follow stringent rules for
intercity traffic; urban traffic is free from restrictions. However, due to
a flexible administration of these rules coordination of road/rail traffic
is mainly left to market forces.  There is no serious coordination problem
between roads and railways; only about 10% of the railway's traffic is sub-
ject to road competition (para. 6.01).
2.13      Government initiated a land transport survey 1/ which has been
completed. Its first phase covered a survey of transport policies and re-
commendations for immediate improvements, its second phase covered an analy-
sis of model distribution of traffic and demand forecasts until 1980, and
proposed guidelines concerning policy changes and long-term investment pol-
icy. The Government is reviewing the study, and has sent a copy of it to
the Bank.
Lending Strategy
2.14      The Bank's lending strategy in the transport sector supports im-
provement of the existing transport infrastructure and carefully selected
extension projects; improvements in efficiency of transport sector manage-
ment; and technical assistance in training of personnel.
2.15      Within the framework of this lending strategy the Bank proposes
financing part (US$70 million) of the construction co0t of the US$293 mil-
lion Bethioua port to enable it to handle the planned expansion of liquified
natural gas exports. The railway loan of US$49 million equivalent now pro-
posed is designed to make up past deficiencies in the orderly reneval and
replacement of track, rolling stock and other equipment, and to contribute to
the improvement in overall corporate planning of SNCFA, thus supporting Gov-
ernient's transport development objectives and ensuring that the railways
will continue to play their vital role in the Algerian economy (para. 6.01).

III. THE RAILWAY
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
Organization
3.01      SNCFA is a state enterprise created under a convention of June 30,
1959. When Algeria became independent in 1962 this convention was ratified
by a decree of May 16, 1963. The equity of SNCFA is held wholly by the
Government and the operations of the enterprise are under the supervision of
the Minister of Transport (see Chart WB-8148). The Minister exercises
control over SNCFA (a) through a Board of 17 members composed of Government
nominees and workers' delegates 1/ (four appointed by the Minister on proposals
of the Workers' Syndicate), (b) through a management proposèd by the Board and
approved by the Minister and (c) through financial control iin the fields of
capital investment, budgetary aipproval and tariff changes.  The permanent way
is owmed by and maintained and renewed at the expense of Government (para. 5.01).
3.02      This system of control is similar to that of many other state
enterprises in the Government controlled economy of Algeria. In the case of
SNCFA the control is reasonable: loans for railway purposes are secured by
the Government, and liability for servicing debts is passed to SNCFA on the
same terms and conditions as the loans; the budget is approved separately by
the Ilinister, but is not part of the Government budget and SNCFA does not re-
quire prior Governnental approval for overruns in budget expenditures. While
tariffs must be published, arrangements exist both for the early application
of increases, if these are needed to balance the budget, and for the payment
of Government subsidies to SNCFA (a practice which is being reduced) in cases
where for social or other reasons the Government requires railway services to
be provided at less than the necessary public tariff.
Management
3.03      Executive functions are vested in a Director General who is ap-
pointed by the Chairman of the Board, subject to the agreement of the
Minister of Transport. The chief officers are also appointed by the Chair-
man of the Board on the recommendation of the Director General. Management
is exercised through a centralized departmental organization, backed by com-
parable district staff (see Chart WB-8147 (2R)). This internal organization is
satisfactory but there is a shortage of experienced qualified personnel at all
higher levels of management.
1/   The Board consistes of a Chairman, apppinted by the Government, and 16
members (4 representatives from various ministries, 4 from the public
or private sectors on a basis of competence, 4 from the higher echelons
of SNCFA and 4 SNCFA workers' delegates).



-6-
3.04      Planning activities are widely dispersed among different depart-
ments 'and insufficiently coordinated. To deal with this problem SNCFA has
recently created a corporate planning unit directly responsible to the
Director General. Work scope and staffing of the planning unit vill be
determined with the assistance of a consultant's study to be financed under
the proposed Bank loan (para. 4.04(d) and (g)). However, as a matter of in-
ternal reorganization to be undertaken at an early date, independent of the
consultant's study referred to above, agreement has been reached with SNCFA
during negotiations on the centralization of the production and presentation
of SNCFA's statistical information by the planning unit. The unit vill,
inter alia draw up, in consultation with the Government, a comprehensive
corporate plan for SNCFA and then monitor its progress, investigating alter-
native courses in the light of changing circumstances.
Staffing
3.05      SNCFA's staff has remained at about 11,000 people in the period
1968-72. This figure includes about 1,000 temporary staff (who are paid by
the hour). In the last five years both passenger and freight traffic have
increased and nroductivitv per man employed has risen from 200,000 to 232,000
traffic units. These figures compare favorably with the performance of many
railways. 1/ Management's stated policy is to contain the numbers employed
and to further improve productivity bv staff training and technological
changes such as more mechanization of track maintenance.
3.06      The terms and conditions of employment of staff are in line with
those of other state enterprises, except for the payment of bonuses related
in amount to the enterprise's financial performance. All salaries have been
blocked since 1963 but bonuses - which later become incorporated in salaries
- can be paid to the staff. Some state enterprises pay better bonuses than
SNCFA and make it difficult for the railway to retain professional and skilled
staff. The problem is particularly troublesome in urban areas. Bonuses have
been paid to SNCFA in 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1973. Bonuses are distributed
almost equallv between staff. SNCFA's social services (vacation centers for
children, housing, travel, etc.) are said to be among the best in Algeria.
3.07      There is only one railway union or workers' syndicate.  Membership
of the union is voluntary and management staff are not members.  Four repre-
sentatives of the union sit on the Board (as do four representatives of
management). Labor relations are good.
Training
3.08      Following independence some 7,000 expatriates out of a total staff
of 12,800 left the service of SNCFA. The gap created by their departure has
1/ Traffic units are ton/km and pass/km. Other figures, on information
available to the Bank, are: Egypt 132,000; East Africa 127,000; India
160,000; Malaysia 165,000; Turkey 190,000.



-7-
been filled by the promotion, appointment and training of Algerian staff and
by technical assistance (provided by France), but there is still a dearth of
qtualified men which it will take time to make good. SNCFA's management is
aware of the problem and is making use of both technical assistance and con-
sultants while proceeding with training programs for local staff in Algeria
and overseas. 1/ While SNCFA's top management realizes the importance of
technical assistance for the interim period of acute shortage of qualified
management personnel, they advocate a long-term solution through the estab-
lishment of a technical training institute, which would, in addition to the
existing basic vocational training, prepare SNCFA personnel for all manage-
ment positions below those requiring university training. The planning for
such an institute is still in its nucleus stage and provision has been made
in the proposed loan for a study of the feasibility of a special railway
training institute within the framework of the Algerian industrial education
system (para 4.04(i)).
B.   Railway Property
3.09      The Algerian railway network consists of 3,933 route km of track,
of which 2,657 km are standard gauge (1.44 m) and 1,276 km are narrow gauge
(1.05 m and 1.00 m). The network comprises the standard gauge axis running
west-east parallel to the coast from Morocco to Tunisia (Grande Rocade) with
branches to the coast and three lines into the interior, including the partly
electrified Mineral Line from Annaba to Djebel Onk (see Map IBRD 10425).
Much of the track traverses mountainous country, resulting in many curves
and severe grades (up to 25°/oo). A detailed description of railway track
structure, equipment and other property is presented in Annex 1.
3.10      Serious arrears in track renewal have been allowed to accumulate
since 1963, resulting in increased unit costs for track maintenance, damages
to permanent way and rolling stock, speed restrictions and derailments.
SNCFA has prepared a 10-year program beginning in 1974 to relay and reballast
950 km (36% of the standard gauge systems) of the Mineral Line and the Grande
Rocade.  The program is satisfactory and SNCFA is competent to carry it out.
The project proposes to finance the first three years of this track renewal
program. The signalling and telecommunications system is generally satisfac-
tory and only minor additions will be required in connection with some exten-
sion projects.
3.11      SNCFA is currently renewing its rolling stock.  The major part of
the motive power fleet has already been renewed. Half of the 370 passenger
coaches have reached the end of their economic life and will partly be re-
placed by 60 new coaches and 33railcars. Freight cars number 10,778 of all
tvpes; about 25% are over 35 years old and will be replaced by modern wagons
of higher capacity.
1/   There is a (diminishing) Technical Cooperation program with France.
SNCFA has 4 training schools, the largest in Algiers and Constantine;
18 men are currently being given specialist training abroad, paid for
by SNCFA.



- 8 -
3.12      SNCFA's stations, marshalling yards and sidings are generally ade-
quate. The six railway workshops (Annex 1) are poorly equipped and are in-
creasingly unable to cope with their motive pover and rolling stock due to:
(i) lack of qualified manpower; (ii) lack of-spare parts; and (:iii) obsoles-
cent machinery. To alleviate these problems, procurement of new machinery
and financing of a consultant study on reorganization of the workshops (para
4.04(h)) are proposed in the project.
C.   Operations
3.13      Operating statistics are given in Annex 2 and Annex 9.  They show
a constant decline in railway efficiency during the past years, due to main-
tenance and operating problems with overaged equipment. Availability and
utilization of motive pover and rolling stock are unsatisfactory. Operating
efficiency also suffers from severe gradients on the Grande Rocade (25'/oo),
axle load limits (17 ton between Algiers and Oran), and transshipment from
standard to narrow gauge. Substantial improvements in rolling stock utiliza-
tion will be possible by 1975 through: (i) acquisition of new workshop equip-
ment under the proposed project; (ii) implementation of the recommendations
of the workshop reorganization study; and (iii) new motive power and rolling
stock already received, or to be received, during the next few months. SNCFA
has still to set up and implement a plan for scheduling of trains, train com-
position and handling at terminals. Specific operating targets set out in
Annex 3 have been agreed.
3.14      The quality of passenger service is unsatisfactory.  The average
speed of the fast trains on the main routes, Algiers-Oran, Algiers-Constan-
tine, is less than 50 km/hr.  Punctuality is poor:  over 70% of all passenger
trains arrive late. Many factors contribute to this problem, which is to be
investigated., But, at least, train delays could be reduced by 1976 to no more
than 30% of the passenger trains delayed by more than 15 minutes.  This target,
agreed upon is included in Annex 3.
D.   Traffic
Freight Traffic
3.15      Freight traffic statistics and forecasts are in Annex 4, Tables 1
and 2. Total railway traffic grew by about 28% during the period 1968-72,
both in terms of tonnage and ton-km. This compared with about 80% during
the same period for total road traffic (intra- and intercity).  However, a
growth comparison between the two modes is difficult because the level of
competition of substitution is a low 10% of all goods carried by the rail-
ways. Furthermore, demand outpaced supply of railway freight services due
to a severe shortage of motive power for the Mineral Line and a low avail-
ability of other rolling stock. These problems are now being solved and will
not hamper the traffic growth expected for the seventies.



-9 -
3.16      The backbone of the railway's business is its bulk traffic, partic-
ularly the iron ore and phosphate traffic on the 408 km Mineral Line - run-
ning roughly parallel to the Tunisian border. During 1968-72 traffic on
this line amounted to 50-60% of total railway freight traffic. Overall,
bulk traffic amounted to about 85 to 95% of total railway traffic, a very
high share when compared to other railways in developing countries. 1/
3.17      Growth prospects for freight traffic during the seventies are
promising. Total traffic i8 expected to more than double during 1972-77, at
an average annual rate of about 15-17% (Annex 4, Table 2). Many new basic
-industries such as iron and steel manufacturing, cement and fertilizer, are
now reaching the production stage and they will provide the railway with an
increasing volume of bulk traffic. The composition of traffic will not mate-
rially change, i.e. bulk traffic will remain SNCFA's most important commodity
group. Transport of fertilizer is expected to increase fourfold by 1977 due
to the new fertilizer plants in Annaba and Arzew. Transport of chemicals,
metallurgical products and cement will increase by 130%, 160%, and 460% re-
spectively by 1977.  Iron ore and phosphate traffic on the Mineral Line are
expected to increase by about 45% and 144% respectively. These estimates are
based on surveys by SNCFA covering the production, and transport requirements
of state enterprises, the railways most important customers. More details on
the freight traffic forecast are in Annex 4.
Passenger Traffic
3.18      Passenger traffic has steadily increased at an average rate of 9%
per annum during 1962-71. Prospects for the future are uncertain. In 1972
the Governnent withdrew a major part of its subsidies for special fæires, which
affected about half of all passengers causing a reduction in traffic.  However,
preliminary results for 1973 show a resumption of the normal growth pattern
for passenger traffic. Based on the information presently available and on
statistical analysis by the Bank, passenger traffic thereafter is expected
to grow by about 8% per annum which would be consistent with the long-term
growth trend. It must be noted that such a growth rate can be achieved if
the quality of rail service, such as reliability, frequency of service and
comfort, is increased continuously.! SNCFA is embarking on a program to up-
date its passenger rolling stock and improve its service.
3.19      Government is considering making better use of the railway's poten-
tial for carrying large numbers of passengers in the suburban areas of Algiers,
Annaba, Oran and Constantine, thus relieving the considerable road congestion,
particularly in Algiers.  To provide an incentive for potential railway pas-
sengers, Government has ordered 33 two-unit railcars for SNCFA for suburban
traffic which will be in service by the end of 1974.  It is too early yet to
comment on the prospects for success of this policy.  The passenger traffic
forecast presented in Annex 4, Table 3, therefore, takes into account only
the normal growth of suburban traffic.
1/   The relation of bulk traffic to total traffic is in:  Malaysia 68%
(1970), Turkey 70% (1971), Egypt 71%, Bolivia 51% (1970).

IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Investment Plan 1974-77
4.01      A railway development plan, to be incorporated in the Gcvernment's
Four-Year Development Plan 1974-77, has been prepared by SNCFA, the Minis-
try of Transport and the Ministry of Planning but must still be approved by
the Council of Ministers. The plan calls for expenditure of about DA 1.9
billion (JS$464 million) with a foreign exchange component estimated at about
US$310 million and it covers both renewal investments and capacity-increasing
investments for rolling stock and track. Details of the plan are presented
in Annex 5. The plan seems over-ambitious in its present size, scope and
timing, and SNCFA's absorptive capacity would be insufficient for an invest-
ment plan of the proposed size. Certain major capacity increasing investments
such as rolling stock expansion and new line construction have not yet been
sufficiently evaluated. Agreement was reached during negotiations that major
railway investments will be based on technical, economic and financial feasi-
bility studies. Furthermore, some of these studies are part of the project
and will be financed by the proposed loan (para. 4.04(b)). Should Government
require SNCFA to carry out investments which the studies referred to above
show to be financially not viable then any losses accruing to SNCFA in the
operation and maintenance of such investments would be compensated vithin
the framework of the relevaht legislation (Ordonnance No. 69-107, dated
December 31, 1969 and Ordonnance No. 73-64, dated December 28, 1973).
B.   The Project and the Loan
4.02      It is recommended to assist the railways as a firet step in finan-
cing consultants' studies necessary for improving SNCFA's management methods
and operations and for the justification of some major items of SNCFA's In-
vestment Plan, and urgently needed renewal investments which will be required
irrespective of the final scope of the overall Investment Plan.  The project
consists of (a) items carried over from the previous Four-Year Plan (1969-73)
or already committed in 1973, (b) priority renewal and rehabilitation in-
vestments to be made in 1974-76, and (c) studies required for corporate plan-
ning. The proposed loan would finance items (b) and (c) above.
4.03      The project includes the following major items:
(a)  complete renewal of 315 km of track.  105 km on the
Mineral Line, 210 km on the Grande Rocade;
(b)  equipment for track renewal, i.e. ballast cleaning,
automatic tamping and levelling machines;
(c)  partial completion of signalling and telecommunica-
tions, remodelling of stations, yards and aidings,
carried over from the previous plan, and automatic
level crossing equipment;



- il -
(d) replacement and modernization of overaged workshop
machinery;
(e) doubling or realignment of sections of track in the
Annaba and Algiers industrial area, carried over
from the previous plan;
(f) procurement of about 60 new coach"s, 25 railcars,
manufacture of 200 freight cars and modernization
of 25 coaches, carried over from t:he previous plan.
Assembly of 110 ballast cars, 300 mineral cars,
and procurement of about 450 freight cars; and
(g) nine studies by consultants, details of which are given
in para. 4.04 below.
Consulting Services
4.04      The consulting studies included in the project are:
(a) A detailed engineering study already commissioned by
SNCFA and concerning the doubling of a 90 km section
of track between El-Gourzi and Ramdane Diamel. The
study vill be financed by Government.
(b) A study aimed at establishing a technically, economically
and financially feasible bypass for the mineral line in
the east. A consulting firm has already been selected
and a contract for an 8 months (about 65 man-months)
study has been signed. The consultants started their
work in February 1974. The costs of these consulting
services are included in the proposed Bank loan. The
terms of reference have been reviewed by the Bank and
are satisfactory.
(c)  A traffic costing and tariff reform study.  The terme of
reference have been reviewed by the Bank and are satisfac-
tory.
(d) A study on the railway's internal organization and admin-
istrative structure. Terms of reference for this study are
being prepared and will be submitted to the Bank shortly
for review.
(e)  A study of SNCFA's accounting system.  SNCFA has requested
the Bank's assistance for the preparation of appropriate
terms of reference.
(f) A study on the reorganization of SNCFA's stores department.
Terms of reference for this study are being prepared vith
the Bank's assistance.



- 12 -
(g) A study on the reorganization of SNCFA's management informa-
tion system. The Bank will assist SNCYA in the preparation
of appropriate terns of reference.
(h) A study on the rationalization and reorganization of SNCFA's
maintenance and repair workshops for rolling stock and motive
power. The consultants are expected to require about 29 man-
months.  Ter s of reference are not yet available.
(i) A feasibility study on the establishment of a technical train-
ing institute for the middle management level not requiring
university degrees. The study would comment on the need for
and size, scope and timing of such an institute. Terms of
reference are not yet finalized.
4.05      During megotiations agreement vas reached that, SNCPA vould retain
consultants by not later than September 30, 1975, upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to SNCFA and the Bank to carry out the studies referred to in
paragraph 4.04(c)-(i) above and that SNCFA would fwnish to the Bank not later
than six months from the date of its completion a plan of action based on such
studies.  After an exchange of views between Governnent and the Bank the plan
of action vould be implemented by the railways ia accordance vith Govereatt'
instructions.
C.   Cost Estimates
4-.06     The project cost including customs duties, taxes and crontingency
allowances, is estimated at US$127 million. The foreign exchangs couponent
i8 US$82.9 million, of which the proposed loan would finance US$49 million
ih the three-year period 1974-76. Estimated project expenditure and Items
tb be financed by the proposed loan are suumarized in the Table on page 13.
4.07      The co0t estimates for rail and rolling stock are based on recent
quotations obtained by SNCFA under international competitive bidding. Cout
estimates for the other imported items are based on proposals by major
European firas received by SNCFA recently.  Price contingency allowaces
ranging up to 14% p.a. on certain items have been added to the foreign ex-
change estimated cost of the project. This estimate ls considered reason-
able because most of the imported items vill (a) be ordered in 1974 and (b)
are likely to be procured from European countries whose exchange rates vis-
a-vis the US Dollar have depreciated considerably since the time of the
project appraisal (October 1973). Cost estimates for local vorks are based
on actual costs for similar works recently carried out by SNCFA and a 5%
p.a. price conting.ncy has been added, based on estimates of prospective
increases in SNCFA vages and materials used by the railways. No physical
contingencies have been included since quantities to be procured or works
to be executed are known and fot expected to change.

Total                           520.9          127.3         100.0
4.09      The proposed Bank loan would finance about 59% of the foreign ex-
change requirements of the project. The balance of 41X is already secured
and will be financed by government and through foreigu credits.
4.10      One contract for consulting services (para 4.04 (b)> included in
the project has been signed and vork cormenced before presentation of this
project to the Board and vill therefore involve down payment8 of about
US$650,000 by SNCFA before any loan can be signed. Retroactive financing
from February 1974 to June 1974 amounting to US$650,000 has therefore been
included in the proposed project. '
E.   Execution of the Project, Procurement
4.11      SNCFA vould be responsible for project execution.  Track renewal
and improvement works, which are the major part of the project, vould be
carried out by SNCFA assisted.by the temporary employment of additional staff.
The mineral and hopper ballast cars vill be largely assembled rather than
manufactured by the Societe Nationale Metal (SONAM) which has a production
capacity of 70-80 cars per month. Local value added in assembly represents
about 50% of the final coet. The quality and cost of locally completed cars
is generally comparable with that of imported completed cars. The 450 special
freight cars vill be imported fully assembled.
4.12      All items to be financed by the proposed loan vill be procured
through international competitive bidding. Agreement vas reached during
negotiations that for purposes of bid evaluation all items under the loan
would be evaluated on the basis of CIF cost. Bid evaluation and avard pro-
cedures are satisfactory and are in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement, but opening procedures, although elaborate, do not require
bids to be opened publicly. It was agreed during negotiations that bid open-
ing ptocedures consistent with the Guidelines for Procurement vould be fol-
lowed.  No preferent4 .I tariffs are now in effect in Algeria.



- 15 -
F.   Disbursement
4.13      Disbursements would be made on the basis of CIF cost.  Annex 7
shows an estimate of disburseinent assuming the proposed loan becomes effec-
tive on September 1, 1974. Should there be any savings in Bank financed items,
they would be either available for cancellation or be used to finance the for-
eign exchange cost of other items in the Investment Plan, subject to review
and agreement with the Bank.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Background - Financial Relationship with Government
5.01      In Algeria the railway track, and its integral structures, such as
bridges, culverts and tunnels, are the property of, and are provided, main-
tainei and renewed at the expense of the State, in the same way as roads are
provided, maintained and renewed for the use of road transport. The SNCFA
pays Government for the use of track as the road transport organization pays
for the use of roads. The charges paid by SNCFA take the form of duties and
taxes, for the major part calculated as a percentage of operating receipts.
In addition SNCFA pays to the Government its surplus earnings after provision
for depreciation of its plant and equipment, debt service and transfers to a
general reserve, the accumulated total of which is limited to 10% of current
annual revenues. The rules are the same for SNCFA's major competitor, SNTR,
the Stat't-owned road transport enterprise. In the past several years the
payments'made by SNCFA to Government have been adequate to cover maintenance
of the permanent way and its use-depreciation, calculated at present-day re-
placement cost, such depreciation having been substantially in excess of
actual renewals made in the period.
5.02      In the course of a costing study of SNCFA undertaken during project
preparation (Annex 8), it was found that the track element (maintenance, de-
pre'ciation and interest on the renewable investment) of the long-run variable
cost of rail transport equated very closely to the dutie« and taxes paid by
the railway for use of the track. It may be assumed therefore that no price
distortion has resulted from Government's policy relating to the track; analy-
sis of the types of traffic carried by rail provides no evidence to invalidate
this conclusion and no objection to the present policy can be found. Rowever,
as regards road/rail user charges the question of equality of treatment should
be reviewed by Goverament after finalization of a road user charges study to
be financed by Loan 912-ALG.
5.03      All borrowing by SNCFA for capital investment has in the past been
from, or through the medium of, Government. For local currency purchases of
capital equipment or for imports for which no suppliera' credits or bilateral
lending was available, SNCFA was authorized in earlier years to borrow from
the Treasury and since 1961 from the Caisse de Developpement. Purthermore,
Article 19 of the railway convention of June 30, 19S9 stipulates that except



- 16 -
for renewal of locomotives, rolling stock and other assets not forming part
of the permanent way, all new investments must be financed by or through
Government.
B.   Rates, Fares and Costs
5.04      Passenger revenue at present is sufficient to cover the long-run
variable t,oost of providing the services (including depreciation and interest
on the renewable investment) and to make a satisfactory contribution to fixed
costs. The average fare paid per km of travel in 1972 vas DA 0.0795 (US cents,
1.94). Passenger train revenue equalled 38% of combined freight and passen-
ger revenue; passenger train locomotive-km represented 49% of total train
locomotive-km. Statistics of passenger-km carried on the s-tandard gauge
and narrov gauge lines indicate that whereas standard gauge services are
profitable, those of the narrow gauge lines do not meet long-run variable
cost by a substantial margin. The traffic costing and tariff.study will
cover this and all other aspects of the tariff structure (para. 4.04(c)).
5.05      SNCFA has in the past been reimbursed by Government for passengers
travelling free or at concessionary fares. The two largest categories involv-
ed have been members of the armed forces and large families. In 1972, the
concessions were wîthdrawn with adverse effect on railway passenger traffic
and revenue. Government reimbursements in respect of concessionary fares have
fallen from a level of about DA 38 million in 1971 to about DA 5 million in
1972.
5.06      In the case of freight services, the costing study for 1971 shows
that the mineral line covers its long-run variable costs and makes a substan-
tial contribution to fixed costs, that other standard gauge lines meet long-
run variable costs with a 8mall surplus, but that freight traffic on narrow-
gauge lines produces revenue below long-run marginal cost. Annex 8 and Chart&
1, 2 and 3 present the results of the traffic costing study. A comparison of
costs and revenue is given below.

5.07      In Annex 10, Table 1 the forecast income account to 1977 is shown.
The projections make provision for expected rises in wages and price levels,
and include assumptions regarding economies which may be expected to accrue
from improved operation standards, and the new facilities and equipment to
be delivered. Rates and fares, which are already high, are not increased,
except where previous concessions have been withdrawn. In such cages, they
are shown in 1977 as having reverted to the level of 1970/71.,
5.08      The projection indicates a gradual improvement in the financial
results of operations after the year 1973. Specifically, operating results
are expected to evolve as follows:

1972     235        192          21         213       22         82        91
1973     237       202           21         223        3         85        94
1974     295       247           30         277       18         84        94
1975     353       289           35         324       29         82        92
1976     415       333           45         378       37         80        91
1977     478        375          58         435       43         79        91
5.09      Depreciation provision takes the form of an annual contribution to
Renevals Fund which is intended to provide sufficient resources for the re-
placement of locomotives, rolling stock, plant, machinery and other assets
not being part of the permanent way. In accordance with Article 19 of the
Convention, the contribution is calculated as a percentage (normally 9Z) of
traffic receipts, fixed every three years, on the recommendation of SNCFA
and jointly approved by the Ministers of Public Works, Transport and Finance
and is deposited with the Treasury. The contribution to the Fund in 1971,
DA 21.4 million, was confirmed as adequate by the costing study. Projecting
the costs to 1977, and providing for 6% p.a. inflation, it is estimated that
use-depreciation of the relevant assets in that year will amount to DA 57.9
million. By a new law (Ordonnance No. 73-64 dated December 28, 1973), Govern-
ment vill in future provide all the funds needed to renew the assets of the
railways and the other public enterprises and vill retain the contributions
to their Renevals Funds.
5.10      Agreement was reached during negotiations that SNCFA vill take all
necessary action to maintain a satisfactory working ratio (i.e. a ratio of
operating expenses, including duties and taxes but excluding permanent way
costs and renewals contribution, to total operating revenue). Informal as-
surances were obtained that the level of such vorking ratio vould be not less
than the present 82% and that SNCFA would improve thereon in ensuing years.

D.   Balance Sheet
5.11      Summarized Balance Sheets of SNCFA are presented in Anmex 10, Table
2.  The value of the fixed assets shown in the books of the railway is not
supported by an inventory and appears to be merely a figure handed down from
the days when SNCFA was operated as part of the SNCF of France. The value
appears to be substantially overstated. In the course of the costing study
it was necessary to evaluate che renewable investment. On these tentative
calculations the present day depreciated replacement value of the renewable
assets of SNCFA would appear to be about DA 800/900 million, as compared with
the figure of DA 1,821 million shown in the Balance Sheet.
5.12      The value of Government's equity in the railway is, of course,
proportionately overstated and it is not meaningful therefore to quote debt/
equity ràtios at the present time except as an indicator of trend. It is
noteworthy, however, that the only change in Goverument equity over the
past six years is an increase proportionate to redemption of debt from
SNCFA's own resources. With the exception of the permanent way, all addi-
tional investment in the railway during this period has been financed by
long and medium term borrowing. The same situation is expected to apply
in the financing of the Plan. Debt service coverage during the project
period 1974-1977 will remain steady around 1.4.  Assuming that the DA 1.8
bil..ion estimated Plan investment will be spread over about six years, out-
standing long-term debt is estimated to increase from DA 278 million at the
end of 1973 to over DA 900 million at the end of 1977, and probably to DA
1,300 million by the end of 1979. Peak debt service will occur in 1981,
at which time the debt service coverage is forecast at not less than 1.1.
This is a satisfactory result in view of the exceptionally large planned
expenditure resulting from many years of underinvestment.
5.13      The working capital positicon of SNCFA is good but a cause for con-
cern is the worsening in 1972 of the Railway's accounts receivable, which
had increased as at December 31, 1972 to DA 142.5 million from DA 102.1 as
at the end of the previous year. DA 37.2 million of the DA 40.4 million in-
crease was in respect of commercial traffic. SNCFA had in 1972 the equivalent
of about six months' freight business in its accounts receivable. Normal credit
accommodation with industrial and commercial customers is for a period of three
months and an increase of DA 13 million had occurred in this category. The
position has improved, however, since SONAREM has settled a large debt to the
railways. Informal assurances were obtained during negotiations that all debts
owed to and by Government agencies and public enterprises will have been set-
tLed by December 31, 1976. Furthermore, in application of Ordonnance No.
69-107 of December 31, 1969, all inter-company debts must be settled within
a 90 day period.
E.   Cash Flow
5.14      For purposes of comparison of the changing financial situation of
SNCFA the following cash flow which is detailed in Annex 10, Table 3 is a
summary of past and future five-year periods:

F.  Audit
5.15      SNCFA has agreed that their accounts shall be audited annually by
independent auditors. Under the prevailing Algerian law the Controle Financier
de l'Etat examines SNCFA's accounts every year and submits a general report te
Government. The Government appolnted Controle Financier is acceptable to the
Bank as an independent auditor and during negotiations informal agreement was
reached to consult on the conditions under which he vill carry out the audit.
5.16      Internal audit at present is restricted to check of station accounts
by travelling auditors. These officers, however, report to the Chef d'Exploi-
tation instead of to the Chef de Gestion, as would be more appropriate. The
newly appointed Chef de Gestion is interested in creating an internal audit
section, which should take over the station audit and should include inven-
tory verification vithin its scope, as part of normal internal audit checks.
Advice and direction in the matter of setting up an internal audit section
will be included in the terms of reference of the study on a reorganization
of SNCFA's accounting system (para. 4.04(e)).

VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   ,tole of the Railways
6.01      The future of the railways is closely linked with Algeria's efforts
to industrialize the country as rapidly as possible progressing from the
construction of basic industries to more consumer oriented light industries.
Each industrial complex and each major factory has been or vill be equipped
with rail sidings, thus providing a convenient and competitive service.
Since about 90% of the railway's traffic is medium-to-long distance bulk
transport (190 km - 500 km) and will remain so in the future, the railway
plays a vital role in Algeria's economy.  Furthermore, without the Mineral
Line the rich iron ore and phosphate deposits in Ouenza, Khanguet and Djebel
Onk could not economically be exploited. In 1972, this traffic constituted
50% of the railways total transport volume. 1/ As regards traffic on the
Grande Rocade comparison of long-run marginal costs of road and rail traffic
shows a cost advantage of about 25% in favor of the'railway for traffic over
an average distance of about 240 km. The cost advantage increases with in-
cre'ased length of haul and decreases for shorter hauls. The break-even point
lies at about 180 km.  However, the railway's cost advantage is sharply re-
duced if door-to-door service by rail cannot be provided. In this case the
road/rail break-even point would increase to about 300 km. It is estimated
that only 10% of the railway's total present traffic volume may be affected
by the need for transshirment. The intermodal comparison for the narrow
gauge lines, however, is different. On the basis of long-run marginal costs
of rail and road transport, costs are roughly equal. Rail revenues on the
narrow gauge lines do not cover long-run marginal costs. In suumary, it can
be concluded that the railway will remain an important economic factor in the
country's development as far as the '%ineral Line and the Grande Rocade are
concerned. The future of the narrow gauge lines, however, is doubtful and
will be subject to further study (para 4.04 (c)).
B.   Evaluation of the Project
6.02      The economic evaluation is based on a 10-year program of track
renewal prepared by SNCFA, and a program of rolling stock rehabilitation to
be completed within the project period (renewal program). The renewal pro-
gram is designed to make up for past deficiencies in the orderly reneval of
track and replacement of rolling stock and some other facilities. This vill
enable the railways to accommodate traffic levels up to about 5 million tons
on the Grande Rocade and 6.5 million tons on the Mineral Line. Any further
traffic growth would require additional massive investment for the extension
of existing capacity (see Annex 11).
6.03      While the renewal program as proposed is economically fully justi-
fied and of high priority (paras 6.07 to 6.09), it could only satisfy demand
1/  54% in terms of tonnage.



- 21 -
for railway transport up to about 1975/76. Analysis suggests that a long-
term capacity-increasing program designed to move the projected future traf-
fic efficiently and at competitive cost could yield high economic benefits
as vell. SNCFA has prepared such a program whose size, composition and
timing are still tentative and vill be subject to further review (para.. 4.01).
6.04      It is not possible to attribute specific benefits to any particular
item of the renewal program, because the proposed investments are closely in-
terrelated and achievement of maximum benefits depends on theïr coordinated,
parallel implementation. The proposed renewal program does not represent a
marginal increment to an already efficient system but amounts to safeguarding
the continuance of a railway which othervise would cease to exist as a major
transport mode. Therefore, the economic evaluation examines two alternatives:
(a) no further investment in the railway, and (b) accepting the renewal pro-
gram. The timing of the proposed investments takes into account the railways
absorptive capacity and the level of demand for railway services up to about
1975/76. Investments on the Mineral Line and the Grande Rocade have been
analyzed separately because the equipment to be invested is used exclusively
on each line. Details of the economic analysis are given in Annex 11. The
main benefits of the project would accrue to (a) the Algerian industry in the
form of avoided incr.seatal highway transport cost and improved quality of
railway service, and (b) SNCFA in the form of reduced unit co0t of rail
transport.
Grande Rocade
6.05      Track on the Grande Rocade is on the average about 30 years old.
If maintenance were kept to a bare minimum safety conditions would deterio-
rate rapidly and all passenger traffic would have to be withdrawn. This would
result in a decrease in SNCFA's fixed cost coverage 1/ of about DA 25-30 mil-
lion without a commensurate decrease in SNCFA's fixed co0t. A comparison of
road/rail passenger transport cost was not possible due to the lack of relia-
ble operating cost estimates for buses.
6.06      As far as goods traffic is concerned, the adverse effects of a
deteriorating permanent way would be more gradual than in the cgse of pas-
senger traffic. It is estimated that for two years after the withdrawal of
passenger traffic all projected freight traffic for the Grande Rocade could
be transported safely and efficiently. In the third year safety considera-
tions would require a curtailment of freight traffic which would progress up
to the sixth year. Thereafter all traffic would have to be discontinued be-
cause the track would no longer be fit to support SNCFA's heavy locomotives.
6.07      Thus, in the economic evaluation two possible alternatives have
been compared: (i) the increasing deterioration and ultimate collapse of
the system as described above (paras 6.05/6.06) against (ii) track renewal
1/   1971 figures.



- 22 -
proposed by the mission. Quantifiable benefits of the reneval investDents
would be (i) the continued contribution of passenger traffic to SNCFA's over-
head costs, and (ii) the avoidance of diversion of railway freight traffic to
higher cost road traffic. The economic lifetime of the system has been es-
timated at 25 years. The economic return of the reneval project has thus been
estimated at about 21%.
Mineral Line
6.08      The Mineral Line is utilized almost to capacity and any deteriora-
tion in maintenance of this very difficult line would lead to its closure
within a period of one or two years. In 1973, safety reasons required vith-
drawal of a substantial part of passenger services. Since no viable alter-
native transport mode could move the iron ore and phosphate traffic, the main
quantifiable benefit would be the line's continuing and increasing contribu-
tion to SNCFA's fixed cost. This measure of economic benefit is conservative
since it represents only part of the value added that would be lost if mining
operations had to be abandoned because of inadequate transport facilities.
The economic return from keeping the line in operation through adequate
maintenance and reneval of track and equipment as well as provision of new
rolling stock would be about 23%.
C.   Sensitivity Analysis
6.09      Sensitive factors for the economic return of the reneval program
are: (a) investment cost and (b) traffic growth. An increase of 10Z in in-
vestment cost and a decrease of 25% in traffic growth would still yield a
satisfactory economic return of about 18% for the investments on the Grande
Rocade.  As pointed out above (para 6.08) the estimated economic return of
23% for the Mineral Line is already conservative. Hovever, investment cost
might be susceptible to an increase of about 10%. In this case, the economic
return would still be a satisfactory 20%.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMNENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement vas reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  operating targets (para. 3.13);
(b)  technical assistance in the fields of investment studies,
tariff, reform, management, accounting,stores, management
information, workshops and training (paras. 4.04, 4.05);
(c)  financial target (para. 5.10); and
(d) audit (para ,.15).



- 23 -
7.02      Retroactive financing from February to June 1974 at about US$650,000
is recommnnded for que consulting contract (para. 4.10).
7.03      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$49 mil-
lion. The loan would be made to SNCFA for a term of 20 years, including four
years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A RAILWAY PROJECT
ALGERIA
Description of Railway Property
A. Track, Signalling and Telecomuunications
1.        The railways (see map) consist of 3,933 route km of track, of which
2,657 route km are standard gauge (1.43 m) and 1,276 route km are narrow gauge
(1.05 and 1.00 m). The main features are:
-   a standard gauge axis line of some 1,300 km which runs through
the rich agricultural Mediterranean Zone of Algeria from Morocco
(to the vest) to Tunisia (to the east) and serves the main cities
and ports of Oran, Algiers, Constantine and Annaba; sad
-   a standard gauge Mineral Line of 408 km from ADnaba to Djebel-
Onk which carries a heavy tonnage of iron ore and phosphates
for export and for the development cf Algier'l own metallurgical
and fertilizer industries.
Other lines, mostly built of lighter track, are of secondary importance.
The topography of the country i8 mountainous and all lines, including the main
axis line and especially the Mineral Line, have to cope with severe grades and
curves up to 25% in various sections which limit loading and speeds and in-
crease the difficulty and cost of track maintenance. Details of the track
and the main physical features of the railway are given in Table 1,
2.        Since 1963 there bas been a decline in track maintenance and renewal;
419 km of track was renewed in 1953-62 but only 114 km in 1963-72, The decline
has been due mainly to a shortage of experienced staff (para 3.03) and also to
difficulty in recruiting and retaining labor for hard mauual vork in the urbaa
areas where more attractive employment is possible. The present employment
averages only 0.8 of a man per km of track. In the last two years SNCFA has
made a section-by-section survey of the system and, taking into account the
actual running condition of the track, its age, the tonnages carried, and the
difficulties and coats of maintenance, has prepared a tenryear program, begin-
ning in 1974, to relay and reballast 211 km of the Mineral Line and 739 km of
the Grande Rocade. Rails and sleepers recovered from these lines will be
used, as practical, to strengthen selected sections of the secondary lines
where lower levels of traffic will allow the recovered material au extension
of its useful life.  This program, detailed in Table 2, has been used to iden-
tify the track items of the proposed project described in Chapter IV of this
report.



Page 2
3.        The systems of signalling used are automatic block, telephone block
and single line token with mechanically operated signals. Most of the signal-
ling is old but should not place constraints on line capacity in relation to
future traffic growth in the next plan period. Some new signalling viii be
required, however, in connection with the developFent of industrial areas and
yard systems, e.g. in the Annaba/El-lHadjar area where 10 km of line is being
doubled and new yard facilities provided for heavy steel, phosphate and other
industries. The communication system of telephones and teleprinters for train
and traffic control is, provided and maintained by SNCFA. The Mineral Line,
wliich is electrified, has satisfactory cabled coinunications; the rest of the
system uses overhead lines which are less satisfactory, but adequate.
B. Motive Power and Rolling Stock
4.        SNCFA's motive power and rolling stock position in detailed in
Table 2, the locomotive fleet on the heavy Mineral Line between Annaba -
Ouenza - El Kouif is electrified, a distance of 299 km. The rest of this
line from Tebessa to Djebel Onk (109 km) is operated by diesel-electric
traction, as are all other lines.
5.        The poor condition of most of the electric locomotive fleet
(31 x 1,770 kW locomotives which in 1972 were 40 years old) led to a decline
in mineral traffic in 1971, underlining the urgent need to replace it. This
vas done in two ways: first by ordering 32 x 2*000 kW nle electric locomotives;
and second, as the electrie locomotives were going to take ties to deliver, by
ordering 29 x 2,500 kW diesel-electric locomotives in the interla which could
later be transferred to the other main lines. The new diesel-electric units
vent into service in 1972 and the 32 new electric units in 1973.  The nev
electric locomotives are suffering from "growing paint', which have to be
worked out. The stock nov consista of 32 new *lectric locowmtives and 8 x
2,300 kW locomotives which are only 14 years old. Of a total fleet of 173
main line diesel-electric locomotives, 82 are in poor condition and will have
to be scrapped during the next 3-4 years; 37 are only 11 to 15 years old and
54 have just been put into service. The 91 new or relatively new locomotives
should allow SNCFA to improve availability and utilization.  About half of
the 77 diesel-shunting locomotives vill have to be replaced. To this and 20
locomotives vere received in 1972.
6.        The present standard gauge fleet of 16 railcars, 14 to 20 years old,
is in very poor condition. Availability is about 50%, and ll units have to be
scrapped. Another 23 railcars have been ordered for delivery in 1973/74:
(a) to replace the units to be scrapped, and (b) to increase urban train serv-
ices from 100 to 200 km around the sizeable conurbations of Algiers-Oran and
Constantine which suffer from a groving urban transport problem.
7.        There are 335 passenger coaches on the standard gauge lines and 34
on other gauge lines. Of these coaches, 180 or 50X are 40 yearu old or more.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Out of 35 new standard gauge coaches already ordered, 4 have been delivered;
another 30 new coaches will be ordered befort the end of 1973,
8.        Of some 10,778 freight cars in stock, about 2,720 are 40 years old
or more and are awaiting scrapping.  Of the total stock, 1,142 cars are owned
and maintained bv other state enterprises, in particular SONARUM which ex-
ploits the Ouenza iron ore. Altogether, 631 higli capacity special cars are
currentlv employed on the Mineral Lilne. The new government policy is aiming
at givinp, S17CFA responsibility for all thie present stock of private-owner
cars, but no firm decision has yet been made.
9.        To offset the withdrawal of old cars, and to deal with new types
of bulk traffics, SNCFA and the various interested state enterprises have
already ordered 1,430 new cars whiclh are beginning to come into service.
C.  Other Properties
10.       SNCFA's stations, marshalling yards and reception sidings are gen-
erally adequate, although a few of the yards need remodelling and, in some
cases, c.g. at Annaba, complete rebuilding. The Annaba work is to be phased,
with the first stage to be done in the 1974-77 Plan period. A yard will be
built at Rouiba (near Algiers) to serve industrial development in that area
and requirements near Oran and Arzew. Consultants (para 4.03) will be
examining these proposals.
11.       SNCFA has six workshops strategically situated throughout its system
to deal with its locomotives and rolling stock. Main Line diesel-electric
locomotives are dealt with at Algiers and Mohammadia. Electric locomotives,
which operate solely on the Mineral Line, have a workshop at Souk Ahras.
Railcars and shunting locomotives are dealt with at Constantine. The trail-
ing stock is dealt with at opposite ends of the system, passenger coaches at
Sidi-Bel Abbes (not far from Oran), and the freight cars at Annaba.  Generally
the stlops are handicapped by old and obsolescent machinery and a lack of qual-
ified manpower.  Consultants will be commissioned to review organization of
the workshops as one of the project element proposed for Bank financing.

APPRAISAL OF
A RAILWAY PROJECT
ALGERIA
Traffic Forecast
A. Freight Traffic
Iron Ore
1.        SNCFA transports iron ore from the mines of Ouenza and Khanguet in
the east near the Tunisian border (about 3 million tons in 1972); Zaccar,
about 110 km west of Algiers (about 150,000 tons in 1972); and Timezrit,
about 25 km from the port of Bejaja.
2.        Ouenza and Khanguet:  The Societe Nationale de Recherches et
Exploitations Minieres (SONAREM) projects a 60% increase in iron ore trans-
port for 1972-80. This growth rate is realistic in view of the increased
demand for iron ore from the Societe Nationale de Siderurgie (SNS) at El
ladjar, the installation in 1977 of a second blast furnace at the SNS fac-
torv, and a projected increase in the next 4-5 years in the export of iron
ore. Based on the 1972 transport volume of about 2.8 million tons, transport
in 1977 will amount to about 4.5 million tons.
3.        Zac,ar:  The ore is mostly destined for export through the port of
Algiers. The annual tonnage to be transported will amount to about 200,000
tons over a distance of 110 km. The mine will be depleted by about 1977.
4.        Timezrit:  Exploitation of this mine will probably cease in 1977
whlen reserves would be exhausted. Until then, about 150,000 tons re envi-
saged to be transported annually over about 25 km.
Phosphates
5.        SONAREM projects a transport increase of 180% by 1977.  This es-
timate was based on a transport volume of 1 million tons in 1972, whereas
the actual transport volume amounted to only 544,000 tons. Prospective
phosphate traffic has been consistently overestimated in the past, primarily
due to overly optimistic estimates of export prospects, and the completion
of production facilities at Annaba. Taking this into consideration and ac-
counting for an increased use of fertilizer as well as substitution of fer-
tilizer imports, a more realistic estimate would be an increase of 140% by
1977, to about 1.3 million tons, the equivalent of a 25% increase p.a. This
growth rate seems realistic in view of the opening in 1973 of a phosphate
factory at Annaba.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
14etallurgical Products
6.        Transport of metallurgical products is determined by the development
of the SNS steel mill near Annaba and the production of iron products (con-
struction material and steel pipes) in the industrial zone of Reghaia near
Algiers, as well as some smaller industrial plants in Constantine and Oran,
Based on present production plans and expected completion from road transport,
railway transport valume in 1977 is expected to reach about 1.5 million tons
(1972: 0.6 million tons), which would amount to an annual average increase
of 21%. Due to larger average hauls, ton-km are expected to increase by about
237O p.a. during 1972-80. However, most of the additional transport volume
(about 0.8 million tOIis) will not materialize before 1977/78, when a second
blast furnace will be put in service in the SNS steel factory.
Grains. Flower, Semolina
7.        Traffic volume in grains has oscillated between 350,000 tons and
513,000 tons since 1963. No consistent trend can be identified. As regards
future traffic, the construction of new grain silos and rail sidings to Algiers
and Bouira is expected to lead to an increase in rail traffic from the 1972
level of 383,000 tons to about 550,000 tons in 1974/75 and beyond.
Petroleum Products
8.        Crude oil is mainly transported by pipeline.  Only a small amount
of crude oil is transported by SNCFA from Biskra to pover plants in Constantine
and Annaba. This traffic will cease because of the pending substituion in
these plants of natural gas for crude oil.
9.        The railways' most important business is the transport of refined
petroleum products to inland consumption centers. In 1972, SNCFA transported
about 400,000 tons and it expects to transport about 500,000 in 1973 due to
the operation of three new refineries in Algeirs, Arzew and Skikda. Local
consumption is expected to grow by about 10% p.a. up to 1980. du the assump-
tion of a stable modal distribution among road, rail and pipeline, SNCFA
would transport about 850,000 tons petroleum products'by 1977.
Cement and Limestone
10.       While most of the cement used to be imported, beginning in 1973 it
will now, be substituted by local production. Two factories will come into
operation; the cement factory of Rladjar-Soud (near Constantine) and a factory
near Mefta (Algiers region). In their final production stage (1974), these
factories will have an output of about 1.8 million tons p.a. The factories
will liave rail sidings. In addition, the construction of about 10 distribution
centers for cement, all with rail sidings, is being considered. The tonnage
to be transported in 1973 will amount to about 700,000 tons, compared with
269,000 tons in 1972.  .- 1977, a transport volume of about 1.5 million tous
is expected.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Sugar
11.       Sugar is both imported and produced locally from sugar beets.
Imported sugar is refined in El-Khemis. Two more refineries, Guelma and
Mostaganem, are nearing completion. Sugar beets are processed in El-Khemis
and Sfi-Sef and will also be processed in Guelma. Transport volume in 1972
was 239,000 tons. It is expected to increase by about 3% p.a, in accordance
with population growth, and to reach about 300,000 tons by 1980.
Chemical Products
12.       Factories for sulphuric acid, phosphorus and PVC and other chemical
products are being considered for the Four-Year Plan 1974-77. RHowever, con-
crete projects have yet to be developed. During the past six years (1967-72),
railway transport of chemical products has grown by about 25% p.a.  Consider-
ing that Algeria is still in an early stage of industrialization and intends
to emphasize in the coming eight years the development of petrochemical and
other chemical industries, and considering SNCFA's judicious marketing policy
to provide large factories with railway sidings, it is reasonable to assume
an annual growth rate of about 19% during 1973-80 for railway traffic of
chemical products. SNCFA's transport volume in 1977 would thus amount to
about 280,000 tons, an increase of over 230% for the period 1972-77.
Esparto Grass and Straw
13,.      It is not possible to identify a clear trend for the development of
this traffic. In the past six years the transport of esparto grass and straw
has varied between 70,000 tons and 90,000 tons p.a. depending on climatic
conditions. however, a new paper factory using esparto grasis as raw material
will be put into service in 1973/74. This, a total transport volume of about
240,000 tons can be expected in 1977.
Fertilizer
14.       Algeria is planning to become self-sufficient in fertilizer produc-
tion bv about 1977.  A new fertilizer plant in Annaba will corne into operation
in 1973 and will produce about 550,000 tons phosphate fertilizer annually.
Other plants in Arzew will produce 365,000 tons of fertilier annually. Rail-
way sidings have been provided for these factories. Abaut 560,000 tons are
expected to be carried by 1977.
Coal and Coke
15.       No reliable forecast of future coal transport is possible since
Government has not yet decided whether to exploit indigenous reserves or to
import coal, particularly coke for the iron and steel mill in El Hadjar.
The trend in coal transport by SNCFA has been down since 1970 when it reached
a peak of 356,000 tons as compared to 246,000 tons in 1972. Probably the El
Hadjar steel works will require more coke as they increase their production.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Based on expansion plans of the El hadjar complex, a coke transport of 570,000
tons has been assumed for 1977.
All Other Goods
16.       This group is composed of various diverse goods such as ag:ricultural
and manufactured products. In the past this traffic stagnated at a level of
about 300,000 to 400,000 tons. However, it is expected that a growth rate
of 10% can be sustained through 1980 and might even be surpassed, especially
when Algeria moves into the second stage of its industrialization - the
development of consumer goods and other light industries.
B. Passertger Traffic
17.       Passenger traffic has increased in the nine-year period 1964-73 at
a rate of 5.6% p.a. in terns of passengers and 7.8% in p8s8-km. Due to over-
aged rolling stock, deteriorating quality of service and a partial withdrawal
in 1972 of passenger fare subsidies, traffic grew only at the rate of popula-
tion increase (2%-3%) during 1968-72 and declined 7% in 1972. Folloving a
serious accident in 1973, a substantial part of the passenger trains had to
be withdrawn from the Mineral Line in the east for safety reasons.  However,
these negative developments are expected to be partially offset by a policy
of improving both the quality of service off red and a renewal of passenger
coaches, and more vigorous competition for suburban traffic. On the basis
of past trends and their expectation of a substantial increase in suburban
traffic, the Mlinistry of Transport and SNCFA project an overall increase of
20% p.a. for the five-year period 1972-77. So far there is no evidence to
verify the assumption of such an enormous increase in passenger traffic.
Furthermore, competition from buses, particularly for suburban traffic, is
keen. For the above reasons, a growth rate projection of 20Z sannot there-
fore be supported.
18.       A realistic forecast of SNCFA's prospective passenger traffic is
extremely difficult because of many non-quantifiable factors such as customer
preferences, increased comfort, more reliability, better coaches, etc. Attempts
to base the forecast on multiple regression analysis failed because of the
influence of exogenous factors. It was, therefore, decided to extrapolate the
trend persisting over the past 10 years. The average annual growth rate vas
thus found to be 8%.

APPRAISAL OF
A RAILWAY PROJECT
ALGERIA
Description of Main Project Items
l,        The project consists of:  (a) items carried over from the previous
four year plan (1969-73) or already committed in 1973; (b) renewal and reha-
bilitation investments to be made in 1974-76; and (c) studies required for
the execution of the investment plan.
2.        The carry over consists of items highly justified at the present
traffic level: (a) improving signalling in Algiers and Oran yards and renew-
ing of old electric substations on the Mineral Line; (b) yard remodelling in
developing industrial areas (Annaba-Rouiba); (c) realignment or doubling of
very limited sections of track in order to supLess bottlenecks in Constantine
auid Annaba areas; and (d) new rolling stock stili to be delivered in 1974.
3.        Track renewal and improvement works on the main-line, Annaba -
CouLstanitine - Algiers - Oran, are planned over the next ten years and take
into account a serious backlog in maintenance which has built up over the
past ten years. The work is expected to be carried out at the rate of 60-70
kn per year and to be done in strict order of priority, beginning with those
sections where consideration of safety are involved.  The propose project in-
cludes work to be undertaken in the years 1974-76. The same standards of
construction will apply as with the mineral line, except that with longer
stretches of straight track, where there will be greater use of long-welded
rails. The extended use of long-welded rails is expected, under conditions
of similar traffic density, to yield substantial economies in track mainte-
nance. There will also be economies in locomotive and rolling stock mainte-
nance due to smoother running.  An added benefit will be increased averaged
speeds. Tlhe renewal of track on secondary lines, and the provision of loops
and sidings for industrial purposes will be effected by using track recovered
fror,] th-e mineral and main line relaying programs. Conditions of operation on
tlhe nineral line are severe and no major renewals have taken place for ten
years. The program has regard to the age of the track, the tonnage carried
since tlhe last renewal, and the difficulties and cost of maintenance. Execu-
tion is scheduled so as to avoid serious disturbance to the heavy flow of
traffic. Heavier rails (from 46/49 to 54 kg), increased sleeper density
(froni 1,500 to 1,700 km), better ballasting, more drainage, greasing of the
rail; to reduce side wear in curves, and the use of long welded rails in
st.r:i.ghL s.ectILos are all factors expectcd to extend tlre life of tlhe track
([)y sonte 20,' per ton of traffic passtng over it) and to improve operating
cie iictccy.



ANNEX 6

4.        The track maintenance equipment will consist of ballast cleaning,
automatic tamping and levelling machines and one track recording car. These
will be used first for the track renewal and relaying program, where they
will improve the quality of work and do it in a shorter time than can be
donc by manual labor. The time factor is important in relation to the back-
log of work to be done. The eventual introduction of the machines to main-
tenance work has regard: (a) to the extended use of concrete sleepers on
main lines with heavy track which cannot adequtely be maintained by hand,
and (b) to the difficulty of recruiting and retaining labor for this type
of work, particularly in competition with industrial demand in the urban
areas. SNCFA have recently installed a concrete sleeper plant with an out-
put of 100 sleepers a day or 28,000 sleepers a year (of 280 days). 1/ The
doubling of output to 56,000 sleepers or some 30 km of track is envisaged.
Tnis will still leave SNCFA having to import some 114,000 heavy wood and/or
stecl sleepers a year. Manual maintenance of the track will continue on
secondary lires (2,200 km) and on some parts of the main line and there
will be no premature reduction of staff; however, numbers employed will be
conitained unider conditions of increasing traffic.
5.        The development of road transport, the increase in train speed
tlirough renewal of track and more powerful rolling stock (the maximum new
railcars' speed is 130 km/h), the need to increase safety of operations,
justify the equipment of 40 level crossing with automatic warning devices
aiLcl barriers during the next three years.
6.        rhe workshop equipment is linited to minimum requirement, mostly
to replace overage and obsolescent units. This will allow SNCFA: (a) to
improve quality of work, and (b) to reduce repair time and improve the
availability of rolling stock in order to reach the agreed target.
7.        Sixty-one new coaches and 33 railcars, ordered during the previous
plan, will replace overaged units (half of the coach fleet is 40 years old).
T'le 110 ballast cars are required to deal witlh the heavy track renewal and
irnprovement works together with the normal cycle of maintenance which requires
a regular supply of ballast.  The 300 mineral cars, 200 for iron ore and 100
for phospliates, will replace overage units and provide additional cars to
carry the forecast increase in traffic on the minerai line. The 650 new
freigiht cars, of whlich 200 were ordered during the previous plan, will re-
place about 1,600 unserviceable freight cars. In order to accommodate the
clhanged composition of goods traffic the majority of the new freight cars
will be specialized.
May 1974
1/    The cost of the local production of concrete sleepers is approximately
DA 40 per unit compared with DA 31.4 and DA 53.7 for similar wood and
steel sleepers; cr-.crete sleepers have an estimated life of 40 years
compared with 1' 20 years for wood and 50 years for steel.

Economic Evaluation
A.  Investments and Benefits
Grande Rocade
Passenger Traffic
1.        Since no reliable data are available for economic operating costs
of buses, the contribution to overhead costs from railway passenger service
was chosen as a measure of benefit. In 1971, the long-run marginal cost of
passenger traffic on the normal gauge lines amounted to DA 0.0572 per pass-km
and the average revenue per pass-km to DA 0.0883. Hence the contribution to
overhead in 1971 was DA 0.0311.
2.        If the proposed track renewal and modernization program were not
carried out, passenger services would have to be withdrawn gradually, thus
causing traffic decreases of 40% in the first year, 40% in the second and
total withdrawal of passenger services in the third year. It is further as-
sumed that in the case of passenger services withdrawal only 50% of the con-
tribution to overhead represents a net benefit, since a moderate reduction in
fixed cost would be possible due to elimination of stations, personnel, equip-
ment, etc. The attached table shows the estimated net benefits from passen-
ger service.
Freight Traffic
3.        The analysis is based on two principal assumptions regarding
SNCFA's investments: (a) investments (DA 650 million over 12 years) necessary
to carry out a program of renewal of rolling stock and track (renewal program);
(b) investments (DA 3.2 billion over 12 years) necessary to accommodate the
expected passenger and freight traffic levels and to renew the existing roll-
ing stock and infrastructure (extension program). However, the extension

ANNEX 11
Page 2
program excludes any new line constructions on the Grande Rocade since plan-
ning is still only in the preparatory stage and consultants will study the
Drobleris in detail.
Regarding the renewal program, it is estimated that the new roll-
ing stock already acquired by SNCFA and some state enterprises, and to be
procured under the proposed project, will meet SNCFA's renewal needs. This
rolling stock would be sufficient to carry a traffic of 5 million tons an-
nually, a level which will be reaclied by the end of 1975/76.  The renewal of
track is expected to continue up to 1983, as planned by SNCFA. Some minor
additional renewal works totalling DA 20 million per year have also been
taken into account in the investment expenditure. The investment cost stream
for the reneval program is given in tlhe attached table.
5.        The economic benefits to be generated from the two investment pro-
graris are derived from a comparison of long-run marginal cost of rail freight
traffic and vehicle operating cost. If the renewal program were not carried
out the track would gradually deteriorate over about six years until traffic
would finally have to be disccontinued.  The resultant shift of traffic to
highwavs could only be accomplished at higher economic cost.  The main bene-
fit of the extension program would be to enable the railways to carry traffic
over and above the 5 million tons considered as the upper limit for the re-
newal program,. With the renewal progran, long-run marginal costs would de-
crease, as a consequence of improved operations and a higher traffic level,
from DA 0.1111 per ton-km (including transshipment) in 1971 to DA 0.0529
in 1977, and thereafter increase by about 5%. With the extension program,
long-run marginal cost are expected to continue decreasing until 1980 because
of increases in traffic volume and the concomitant economies of scale. It
is assumed that thereafter possible further cost decreases through increasing
traffic will be balanced by higher operating cost through increased wear and
tear of rolling stock and motive power.

7.        About 85% of transports on the Mineral Line (from Annaba to Quenza
and Djebel Onk) consists of iron ore and phosphate. Passenger traffie had
to be reduced considerably for safety reasons and because the line is reach-
ing its capacity limit. The possibilities of increasing line capacity
through track doubling or construction of bypasses are being examined. The
analysis presented here takes into account only investments necessary to
assure full utilization of the existing Mineral Line. The carrying capacity
of the line will be reached by about 1978. It is assumed that traffic there-
after would remain at capacity. Any increase would have to be accommodated
througli new line construction.
el.       The economic benefits of the project are derived from a comparison
ol- tiue alternatives of executing the planned investments for the line and
tritis keepiing it open for traffic, or closing the line in 1974. In case of
line closure no alternative means of transport would be available. Since
iL was impossible to measure the loss in value added of mineral production
an(l transport, it was decided to use as a minimum criterion for the benefit
to be derived from continued operation of the line, the net contribution of
min-ieral traffic to the railways' fixed cost; in 1972, this amounted to
DA 0.0141 per ton-km. Cost and benefit streams for the Mineral Line as well
as forecast traffic are presented in the attached table.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
Grande Rocade
9.        Two factors whicli could adversely affect the economic return were
corisidered: (a) increasing investment cost, and (b) reduced traffic growth.
(a) Ait increase in investment cost of 10% would reduce the
return from 21% to 18%, in tlhe case of both the renewal
progran and the extension program;
(b) A decrease in traffic growtn from 16% p.a. up to 1984
to a low of 12% p.a. would reduce the economic return
of the renewal project to only 18%, whereas the economic
return of the extension program would be reduced to 5%.
The reason for the considerable difference in the sen-
sitivitv of the two alternatives to traffic changes is
that the renewal program concentrateb on existing traffic
and could not in any case accommodate a higher traffic
level than 1.7 billion ton-km p.a. whlich will be reached
by about 1975/76; whereas the extension program primarily
aims to create sufficient capacity for expected traffic
growth beyond 1975/76.
10.       In conclusion, the tests show that both the renewal and the exten-
sion program are sensitive to increases in investment cost and decreases in
traffic. lIowever, the renewal progran would still be acceptable even if the
pessimistic assumption would materialize. As regards the extension program,
the tests indicate that a high sustained traffic growth is a crucial pre-
requisite to justify an extension program of the assumed size.
*fineral Line
11.       Regarding the Mineral Linie, tihe estimated economic return of 23%
is already very conservative, as pointed out in parai5.08. Traffic is
captive and depends primnarily on the extension plans of the steel and phos-
phate factories in Annaba, both of which have firm production plans up to
11)77. Therefore, no downward change in the projected traffic levels is
e;pect«l.  however, investment cost mnight be susceptible to increases of
about 10%.  Yet, this would still result in a satisfactory economic return
of 2o%.
