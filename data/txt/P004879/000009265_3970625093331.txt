FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT - LOAN 996-AL
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation and
implementation of the First Railway Project in Algeria for which Loan 996-AL
of US$49.0 million was made on June 10, 1974. The loan was closed on December
31, 1981, after cancellation of US$5.94 million.
The report was prepared by the Europe, Middie East and North Africa
Regional Office of the Bank on the basis of a review of the Bank files,
including appraisal, supervision and progress reports, project consultants
reports and other available docuuentation. Summary discussions with the
Algerian railway authorities held after project completion had been helpful in
the report preparation.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
gOED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; their reply Is shown as an
attachment to the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGRA
FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT - LOAN 996-AL
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was the first Bank loan for Algerian railways and
consisted of a three-year portion of the 1974-1977 railway Development Plan
including renewal of track, improvements to signalling, stations and
workshops, procurement of equipment, passenger coaches and freight cars, and
consulting services. The project components were related to the Development
Plan investments to be made in 1974-1976. The project cost of DA 520 million
represented 27Z of the total Plan cost for the railway sector of DA 1.93
billion and the Bank loan of US$49.0 million represented 60S of the project
foreign cost.
The final cost of the sector investments under the Plan was DA 2.31
billion, of which an amount of DA 1.90 million was expended within the Plan
period, while the remaining amount was required to complete Plan commitments
after 1977. The physical components of the project were completed
satisfactorily. Implementation of consulting services, related to
institutional improvement studies, was slower than estimated at appraisal due
to the shortage of local staff for timely appointment of consultants and
adequate supervision of studies and review of reports. Additional
difficulties were experienced during the project time because organizational
changes of railway authorities were carried out under overall far reaching
socio-economic reforms of the Algerian administration. Implementation of the
recommendations resulting from the technical assistance component extended
beyond the project period and some are still under study.
Points of special interest in this project are:
(i) urgency of track renewal after 20 years of neglect (para. 1.03);
(ii) substantial purchase of rolling stock under the 1974-1977 Plan
(para. 3.07 and Table 1);
(iii) laborious implementation of the large program of project studies
(paras. 3.08-3.17);
(iv) financial probl-m-s caused by organizational changes, unclear
financial responsibilities and delays in adjustment of tariffs
(paras. 5.02, 5-06-5.09); and
(v) disagreement between the Government and the Bank on the economic
justification of a track doubling project, when costs resulting from
final engineering were substantially higher than anticipated
(para. 3.18).

FIST RAILWAY PROJECT - LOAN 996--AL
I.  INTRODUCTION AND SECTORIAL B OD
1.01    During the past 15 years Algeria's substantial exports of
hydrocarbons have supported rapid economic and social developmaent. The
related capital investments and rising income have, in turn, resulted in a
steadily rising demand for transport services. However. associated needs for
improved operating standards have not always been met effectively due to the
limited availability of experienced man-pe-eer and priorities for other sectors.
1.02    To serve transport needs the country relies on an extensive transport
network comprising about 80,000 km of roa z, 4,000 km of railways, 5,000 km of
oil and gas pipelines and 10 main ports. Domestic air services play an
important passenger transport role. Whilst the system was adequate for the
needs of the economy up to the late sixties, the traffic increase has led to
growing problems of port congestion, roads operating beyond structural and
geometric capacity and a deteriorattag railway infrastructure.  Transport
services are provided mainly through a state-owned railways, state road
transport companies and state-owned industrial enterprises which operate their
own transport fleets. The railway and roads carry about 23Z and 77Z
respectively of passenger and freight traffic. Tariffs are officially set and
controlled by the Government and infrequent y updated. Meetings between
transport agencies and major transport users are held regularly to allocate
forecast freight traffic to the most efficient system.
1.03    The railway network consists of 2,657 route-km of standard gauge
(1.435 m) and 1,276 km of narrow gauge (1.00 m and 1.05 m) lines. In 1974
only 186 km of standard gauge lines were of double track. Track maintenance
and renewal was neglected over a number of years: no track renewal was
undertaken between 1955 and 1974, except for sections requiring urgent
intervention, totalling about 100 km. In 1974 about 50Z of locomotives,
passenger coaches and freight cars were 25 to 40 years old and needed
replacement. Operation of railways was affected by the departure of
expatriate personnel after 1962. In addition, the organizational reform,
which is still in progress, added to the institutional problems.
1.04    The 1970-1973 Development Plan for railways included mainly
replacement of rolling stock and -traffic safety signalization. The 1974-1977
Plan, while continuing the rolling stock replacement program, was directed
more towards modernization and renewal of track. The First Railway Project
Was prepared by the Bank and the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Algeriens (SNCFA) to assist in implementing the 1974-1977 Plan and developing
SNCFA.
1.05    Bank lending for the transport sector in Algeria since 1970 to 1983
amounted to US$495 million. It included four highway projects, two of which
are now completed, the railway project, which is the subject of this
completion report, and two ports projects one of which has been completed and
the other cancelled when the major complementary investment in a steel
mnmufacturing complex was delayed. Of the total lending for transport about
451 has been disbursed as of April 1984, an amount of US$87 million (18Z) was
cancelled and the remaining 37Z, of which more than half is committed, is.
expected to be fully disbursed by December 1986.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     At the September 1971 Bank Annual Meeting, the Algerian delegation
approached the Bank management with request for a railway project.  In March
1972, SNCFA presented a draft railway development plan for major overhaul of
the railways. The emphasis of the plan was modernizing and doubling of track,
widening narr- gauge lines, and improving maintenance operations. The Bank
mission of January 1973 identified a modest size project with a possible loan
of about US$25 million for track renewal and workshop equipment. During
subsequent meetings, investment priorities and the SNCFA organizational
problems were discussed and the need for technical assistance clarified. The
railway development program as finally prepared by SNCFA was incorporated in
the 1974-1977 Development Plan. The Plan called for railway expenditures of
DA 1.93 billion (US$ 464 million), with a foreign exchange component of about
US$310 million, covering both renewal and capacity increasing investments in
track and rolling stock, including doubling of track and new lines. The
details of the Plan are shown in Table 1.
2.02     The Bank considered the Plan over-ambitious in its track doubling and
new lines components, and was concerned about the economic feasibility of
related investments. Nevertheless, the First Railway Project was appraised in
October 1973 on the basis of the Plan, including part of the priority renewal
and rehabilitation investments for 1974-1976, consulting services for
institutional improvements, and feasibility and engineering studies. The
total project cost was initially estimated at DA 448 million (US$107 million)
of which the Bank would finance a portion of the foreign exchange for an
amount of US$41 million. At loan negotiations the project was expanded by
additional rolling stock to an estimated amount of DA 521 million (US$127.3
million), and the Bank loan was increased to US$49 million, covering 59S of
the project foreign exchange cost. Bank financing was provided for track
renewal, equipment for workshops and track laying, freight cars and consulting
services. The cost of signalling and telecommunications, modernization of
stations and yards, doubling or realignment of track and procurement of
passenger coaches was covered fully by SNCFA. The details of the project
costs are shown in Table 2.
2.03     During loan negotiations, the Government, SNCFA and the Bank agreed
on the 1976 operational performance targets (para. 4.07)   Moreover, the
Government agreed that important investments of SNCFA would be based on
technical, economic and financial studies, and that the Bank and the
Government, with the participation of SNCFA, would consult with each other on
the conclusions of such studies. The related covenant was included in Section
3.03 of the Guarantee Agreement. Negotiations were completed on May 9, 1974,
and the loan was approved on May 30, signed on June 10 and declared effective
on November 11, 1974. The project was expected to be completed by September
30, 1978 and the loan closed on December 31, 1978.
2.04     The project would assist SNCFA in:
(i}   upgrading infrastructure through track renewal, modernization of
stations and signalling, and replacement of rolling stock; and



3-
(ii)  improving           t and operation methods through studies on
organization and Administration, tariffs, accounting, maintenance,
stores, traiuing facilities and selected economic feasibility and
engineering studies.
Under Section 3.02(b) of the Loan Agreement. SNCFA undertook to retain by
September 30, 1975 consultants for all studies, except for economic
feasibility and engineering studies for which consultants were already
appointed. The summary of the project components is shown below:

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
General
3.01     Implementation of the principal physical components of the project -
way and works and rolling stock -- was completed satisfactorily. Procurement
of track material, equipment and rolling stock was completed by the scheduled
closing date of December 31, 1978 when 84Z of the loan amount was disbursed.
However, the technical assistance component met with major delays, and its
implementation required extending the closing date first by two years and then
one more year to December 31, 1981, when the loan was closed and the
undisbursed amount of US$5.94 million cancelled.



3.02     In March 1976, the Government implemented a long standing decision to
reorganize the railway authority by dissolving SNCFA and replacing it by the
Societe National des Transports Ferroviaires (SNTF) and the Societ6 Nationale
d'Etudes et de R&alization de l'Infrastructure Ferroviaire (SNERIF). SNTF was
responsible for operation and maintenance of the railway, and SNERIF for
preparation and execution of network development. The Government retained
financiln responsibility for construction of lines and renewal of track.
SNERIF entered into a joint venture with two Brazilian firms to establish the
Societe des Insfrastructures Ferroviaires (SIF). The SIF activity consisted of
providing consulting services in competition with other Algerian and foreign
consulting firms. The Bank loan was transferred to SNTF, including financial
and implementation responsibilities. This was confirmed by the legal opinion
of October 20, 1976, delivered by the Algerian Government.
3.03     In January 1977, SNTF reorganized itself internally.  Previously
there were six department in the Direction Generale (Mechanical, Way -nd
Works, Transportation, Personnel, Administration and Economic Studies) and
three operating regions with headquarters in Constantine, Algiers and Oran.
As a result of the reorganization, two new departments were added to the
Direction Generale: Marketing and Information Systems and the three regions
were abolished and 27 new functional units were established- Of these, 19
were for railway operation, 6 for maintenance and repair of locomotives and
rolling stock and 2 for manufacturing of concrete sleepers. Each of the units
maintained its own accounts of revenues and expenditures. The new
organization, particularly the 19 operational units, proved unwieldy to manage
due to the excessive decentralization of responsibilities, and further
organizational reforms are currently being considered.
Way and Works Component
3.04     Bids for supply of rails and equipment for track laying and worzshops
were received in August 1974. The lowest evaluated bid for rails exceeded
appraisal estimates by 132Z. The bids for equipment were also higher than
appraisal estimates. The high bids were due to a worldwide rise in steel
prices. To provide additional fcreign exchange for track material and
equipment the Bank agreed in March 1975 to reallocate loan funds by reducing
allocatiun for rolling stock. This was possible because the purchase of
freight cars was well provided for in the SNTF budget, and mineral and ballast
cars were manufactured in Algeria. The reallocation of funds is shown below:

3.05     Renewal of rails, sleepers and ballast was carried out on 327 km of
track, covering 30 sections of 1 km to 43 km length.  Of the total track
renewal 96 km were located on the Djebel Onk-Annaba mineral line, 179 km on
the East-West grande rocade line (106 km on Algiers-Oran and 73 km on
Algiers-Annaba sections) and 52 km on branch lines. In addition, ballast only
was renewed on 155 km. The total cost of track renewal was DA 316 million and
of ballast renewal DA 31.5 million. Moreover, about DA 40 million were
expended for localized interventions of less than one km length.
3.06     Detailed information on the progress of signalling and
telecommunication works and modernization of stations is not available, except
that the total cost of these investments during the Plan period was about DA
220 million. Only DA 14 million, out of DA 450 million initially allocated,
were spent for track doubling and sev lines while about DA 60 million were
expended on engineering studies for new lines, (see Table 1).
Rolling Stock
3.07     The Bank participation in renewal of rolling stock was limited to 250
freight cars. Under the 1974-1977 Plan the total purchase included: 40
diesel-electric locomotives, 55 shunters, 33 railcars, 165 suburban and 45
main line coaches, 34 baggage vans and 5,200 freight cars (see Table 1).
Consultant's Services
3.08     The project's nine studies were detailed in Schedule 2 of the Loan
Agreement as follows:



-6-
(i)   study on costs and tariffs;
(ii)   study on the internal o-ganization and administrative structure;
(iii)   study on the reorganization of the accounting system;
(in)   study on the reorganization of supply and stocking systems;
(v)   study on the management information system;
(vi)   study on the reorganization of maintenance;
(vii)   stu:, or the feasibility and establishment of a technical institute
for training of middle management staff;
(viii)  feasibility study of by-passes on the mineral line; and
(ix)   detailed engineering for the doubling of about 90 km of track between
Ramdane Djamel and El Guerrah.
3.09     The Borrower initiated consultation for studies early in 1975, with
the Bank reviewinz terms of reference and award of contracts. The Loan
Agreement target date of September 1975 for appointment of consultants was
considerably exceeded because of shortage of qualified and experienced staff
in SNTF and the time used for consultations, negotiations and contract
awards. The study on internal organization and administrative structure was
deferred with the Bank's concurrence, until completion of other studies.
However, because of the late completion of the these other studies the
organization study was not commissioned.
3.10     The contract for the costs and tariff study was awarded in February
1976 to SOFRERAIL (France) and was completed satisfactorily in January 1979.
Following the study recommendations, new tariffs were implemented on June 1,
1979.
3.11     The study on the reorganization of accounting systems was contracted
in October 1978 to the joint venture Transurb-Sobemap-Gombert (Belgium). Only
about seventy percent of the study has been completed. Continuation of the
study has been suspended since July 1982 pending agreement between SNTF and
the consultants on an extension of the contract requested by the consultants.
The suspension arose as a result of a disagreement between SNTF and the
consultants on the scope of the terms of reference.
3.12     The study on the reorganization of supply and stocking systems was
started in late 1977 and was completed within two years. It was carried out
satisfactorily in-house, by SNTF staff. The implementation of recommendations
included establishing of the new centralized information system for spare
parts, overhaul of forms and working documents and computerization of the
system.
3.13     The study on the management information system was carried out by
TRANSURB between September 1977 and November 1980. The final report was
reviewed and commented extensively by the Bank. The consultant recommended a
rather complicated system which would require about 20O staff to operate and a
five-year period to render the system fully operationai. The Bank suggested a
more practical approach of restructuring the existing system using available
equipment complemented by some advanced equipment available on the market. It
appears that further consultations and assistance are needed to finalize the
action plan.



3.14     The study of the reorganization of rolling stock maintenance and
workshops was contracted in March 1978 to TRANSURB, and was completed in April
1980. The consultant prepared a comprehensive report which was largely
comented on by the Bank. The report recommended reorganizing maintenance to
high efficiency standards, not attainable at present because of SNTF's
staffing problems. Nevertheless, SNTF is continuing modernization of
workshops following to the extent possible study recommendations. The 1980-84
Development Plan includes establishment of two new specialized workshops, as
recommended by TRANSURB, one for repairs of freight cars in Ain M'lila and
another for passenger cars in Rouiba.
3.15     The study of establishing a technical institute for training of SNTF
middle management staff was entrusted to EUREQUIP (France) in November 1975
and was completed in March 1977. For implementation of its recommendations,
an amount of DA 50 million was included in the 1980-1984 Plan for construction
of buildings, with 1985 as a target for the institute opening. A small
training center was established in 1982, pending the creation of ENAT (Ecole
nationale d'application des Transports) which would include a training
institute for railway staff.
3.16     The feasibility study of bypasses on the mineral line was contracted
to FORD-BACON-DAVIS (USA) in December 1973 and was completed satisfactorily in
August 1976. The detailed engineering of track doubling between
Raadane-Djamel and El Guerrah was started by SETEC (France) before project
appraisal and was completed in June 1975. The consultant's design and
specifications were used for the procurement of works, which are now in
progress (para. 3.18).
3.17     Deferment of the study on internal organization and administrative
structure until completion of other studies was justified. Such study would
provide an overall program of institutional improvements based on
organizational reforms already implemented and a realistic program for
implementing other recommendations resulting from the studies. The deferred
organizational study could form a component of a next railway project.
3.18     The 1974-1977 Plan included doubling of track of the Ramdane
Djamel-El Guerrah line. The proposed doubling of track was decided by the
Government in order to eliminate a possible bottleneck which this section
would present to traffic after completion of the new branch lines from Ramdane
Djamel to Jijel/Djendjen port and from Tebessa to Ain M'lila. In February
1977, SNTF advised a Bank mission that bids had been called for doubling of
track; its cost was then estimated at about US$300 million. In May 1978, when
negotiations for the construction contract were in progress, the Bank raised
the question of the project's economic justification. With the Borrower's
agreement the Bank arranged a short field study of alternative solutions to
doubling of track, and concluded that local improvements estimated at about
30X of the proposed investment, which could be introduced by stages as traffic
developed, would accommodate the traffic estimated for the t.990 time horizon.
The Bank suggested to undertake a full feasibility study. However the
Government decided against the feasibility study at the time when a contract
agreement for the construction was imminent. As a result of this controversy,
preparation of the second railway project, which has been discussed since
1977, was suspended.



- 8 -
3.19     Subsequently, the Bank advised SNTF that the economic viabilitv of
development investments proposed for the period coinciding with the next
railway project should be checked by feasibility studies, and agreed to
finance such studies under the current railway project. SNTF proposed
initially a study of railway development in East Algeria (Jijel and
Tebessa-Ain M'lila lines) and later the study of other new lines included in
the development program.  To enable loan financing of such studies the Bank
and SNTF considered extension of the loan closing date to December 31, 1982.
However, before commissioning of the studies was finalized, the loan was
closed (para. 3.21) and the remaining funds cancelled.
Estimated and Actual Cost of the Proiect
3.20     The total actual cost of the project and of the 1974-1977 Plan were,
allowing for inflation, approximately as estimated, with some reallocation oL
funds to account for higher cost of track material and rolling stock. At
appraisal, the cost of track renewal was estimated at DA 500,000 per km, w'--
actual cost was about DA 1,000,000, and the cost of passenger coaches
estimated at DA 800,000 was about DA 1,300,000. Also, locomotives cost was
about double of the estimate. The 1974-1977 Plan total expenditure was DA
2,310 million against the initially budgeted amount of DA 1,933 million. The
additional DA 377 million were expended after 1977 to complete the Plan
comitments. The Plan expenditures forecasts and actual are shown in Table 1.
Disbursements
3.21     The disbursements for track material and equipment have been carried
out in accordance with the initial time schedule. Some delay occurred in
disbursements for freight-cars because from March to November 1976 the Bank
awaited the Government's legal opinion on transfer of the SNCFA debt
obligations to SNTF to continue disbursements under the project (para. 3.02).
Due to underdisbursement of Category I - track material, and Category II -
rolling stock, there remained a loan balance of about US$6 million. In June
1978 SNTF proposed using the balance to finance retroactively a contract for
11,000 ton of rails. However, procurement of rails did not comply with the
Bank Guidelines. Alternatively, the financing of pre-investment studies was
considered (para 3.19), but before any orders were placed, the Government and
the Bank agreed, within the framework of an overall review of outstanding
loans, to cancel against the wishes of SNTF the undisbursed balance at the
closing date of December 31, 1981.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Freight Traffic
4.01     Since 1970 freight traffic was growing, although irregularly, by an
average of 5X p.a. in terms of tonnage (from 6.19 million ton to 9.10 million
ton in 1979) and by 7? p.a. in terms of ton km (from 1,350 million to 2,488
million in 1979) (See Table 3). This growth was substantially below the 15?
estimated at appraisal. Appraisal estimate was based on data provided by
overoptimistic mining and manufacturing industries. For example, between 1972
and 1977 cement and limestone production was expected to grow by 41S p.a. and
metallurgical and chemical products by 21% and 25% p.a. respectively. This
did not materialize.
4.02    About 90% of total freight was long distance transport of bulk goods,
of which iron ore and phosphates carried by the mineral line accounted for
about 50Z. Only about 10? of rail freight would be open for road transport
competition. ilotwithstanding operational and organizational problems and poor
condition of track and rolling stock, SNTF responded well to the demand. The
7? annual growth of freight traffic achieved during the project period should
be considered as adequate.



- 10 -
Passenger Traffic
4.03     The growth of passenger traffic in the 1970-1979 period was higher
than the growth of freight traffic (see Table 3). The number of passengers
increased by an average 13Z p.a. (from 7.75 million to 24.9 million) against
expected increase of 8Z. The growth in terms of passenger km was only about
7X p.a. becau.- the increase was mainly in commuter traffic.  To improve
commuter traffic SNTF increased line capacity in the vicinity of Algiers by
modernization of signalling and stations, track doubling and purchase of 165
suburban coaches and 33 railcars (para. 3.07). Long distance passenger
service was improved by adding 45 new coaches.
Operations
4.04     In the years preceding the project, the availability of locomotives,
their utilization and the freight trains load were steadily declining, because
of aging rolling stock and poor condition of track. In 1974 out of 173 diesel
locomotives 82 were over twenty years old and out of 71 electric locomotives
31 were thirty eight years old. Half of the 335 passenger coaches were over
forty years old and 1100 freight cars were awaiting write-off. Railway lines
were in poor condition due to antiquated geometrical standards and long
neglected track renewal. The inadequate signalling and telecommnmications
also impaired efficiency of operations. Due to poor condition of track the
wear and tear of rolling stock was excessive and length and weight of trains
limited.
4.05     The shortage of locomotives resulted in excessive use of the
available stock and insufficient scheduled maintenance check-ups. Repairs
were delayed by shortage of spare parts and of qualified skilled workers in
the workshops. The low availability of locomotives and the poor condition of
track caused long transportation times of freight trains and delays of
passenger trains.
4.06     Railway operations were affected adversely by severe shortage of
qualified and experienced staff when about two third of the personnel left the
country after independence in 1962. It is to the credit of SNCFA that it not
only succeeded to maintain the operation of the system and replace the
expatriates, but also ensured the growth of traffic essential for the economic
development.
4.07     Traffic conditions improved during the project through track renewal,
acquisition of locomotives and improvement of workshop equipment and
maintenance procedures. The 1976 operational targets (para. 2.03) and the
actual performance are shown below:

4.07     The availability of electric locomotives shown in the table was very
low mainly because the old worn-out locomotives were still maintained in
service (para. 4.04). Train load targets were set too high in relation to
track conditions: maximum grade 3Z, minimum radius of bends 200 m and passing
loops as short as 350 m. The punctuality of passenger trains remained poor.
The staff productivity of 270,000 traffic units per employee per year compares
favorably with other countries (170,000 in Egypt, 256,000 in India). Overall
operational performance was poor although substantial efforts had been made to
reach the 1976 targets. Some performance indices reached their peak in 1976
and declined thereafter because of lack of continued effort in the improvement
of operations due to shortage of staff, lack of finance and inadequate
planning.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     SNTF is a public enterprise operating in accordance with the
principles set out in Ordonance No. 71-74 of November 16, 1971. SNTF is
responsible for generating operational revenues and covering expenditures and
debt service related to capital investments. Tariffs for railway services,
however, are subject to Government approval.



- 12 -
5.02     Changes of traffic patterns adversely affected operating revenues.
While freight traffic, a major source of revenues in 1972, increased much
slower than expected during the implementation period, passenger traffic
expanded at a higher rate than anticipated with little financial relief,
however, since tariffs were not adjusted for inflation. Freight tariffs were
increased 20Z July 1, 1975 and as a result 1977 operating revenues were about
72Z higher than 1973 revenues (Table 4). Also changing the charging basis for
freight and the cancellation of the third class transport for passengers in
the late seventies contributed to increased revenues. A further 30S tariff
increase was implemented in July 1979. As it will be shown below, this was
insufficient to improve the financial position of SNTF.
5.03     Operating expenses reached DA 454 million in 1977, 4.4X above
appraisal estimates, (see Table 4). It was understood at appraisal that all
expenditures for maintenance, renewal and extension of infrastructure would be
financed by the Government's central budget. However, from 1974 to 1978
financing of expenditures related to track renewal and new infrastructure were
considered by the Government as investments and, as such, financed by loans
serviced by the SNCFA/SNTF. This was a major departure from the financing
plan at appraisal, when a    190 million Government contribution for track
renewal (1973 to 1977) wa included in the financing plan. SNCFA/SNTF also
had to cope with increasing labor costs: Government controlled wages were
substantially raised in 1975. Operating expenses net of depreciation grew at
an average yearly rate of 15.7X from 1972 to 1980. Maintenance costs rose
from DA 50 million in 1972 to DA 212 million in 1979, whereas Government
contribution only increased from DA 67 million to DA 95 million over the same
period.

5.04        There was some improvement over the first three years, but the
situation deteriorated sharply in 1976 and further worsened in 1977.  A
minimum working ratio of 82 had been agreed at appraisal which could not be
achieved from 1976 to 1980: the above table and Table 5 indicate that the
working ratio culminated in 1978 at 107 decreasing thereafter. The ratio was
still just above 90 two years later despite a tariff increase in July 1979.



- 13 -
5.05     The liquidity situation of SNCFA/SNTF remained critical from 1972 to
1978. As of December 31, 1972 SNCFA carried a Bank overdraft of DA 21
million, which continued to expand, reaching DA 147 million in 1977. The
liquid ratio dropped to 1.0 in 1977, compared to the appraisal estimate of 2.3
(Table 6). While inventories piled up at a rate of 15.4% per year from 1972
to 1980, factors which contributed to weaken SNTF's cash position were: (i)
the gap between the expenditures for maintenance works and the reduced
Government contribution; and (ii) increasing accounts receivable by Goveroment
agencies or public enterprises not paying for services received.
5.06     The financial status of SNTF became critical at the end of 1977 as a
result of increasing confusion about the respective financial responsibilities
of SNCFA/SNTF and the Government (Tables 5 and 6). A financial restructuring
plan was agreed with the Government and, in 1978 substantial changes were
introduced to write off the DA 395 million deficit at the end of 1977.

5.07     Most importantly, all expenditures related to renewal and extension
of infrastructure were to be financed by the Government and existing loans
contracted by SNCFA/SNTF to finance infrastructure would be serviced by the
Government, the repayment of principal being progressively transferred to
equity. For rolling stock, existing loans were consolidated under
exceptionally favorable new terms: twenty-five years, 2.5Z rate of interest
and a 5-year period of grace; rescheduling of debt was obtained through three
successive loans for a total of DA 313.7 million. As of December 1980, all
these measures had succeeded in keeping SNTF financially afloat but the



- 14 -
inadequate pricing of its services was still a problem when SNTF again in 1980
faced an operating deficit of DA 87.4 million.
5.08     Accounting was deficient in the early implementation of the project.
The valuation of assets was not realistic and assets until 1977 did not
include equipment financed from external loans which was recorded only for the
value of prin-ipals already repaid. At appraisal the problem had been
addressed and a study on the reorganization of accounts and the Finance
Department was included under the project. The recommendations of this study
are still being implemented (para. 3.11).
5.09     The financial performance of the borrower was below appraisal
expectations because: (i) SNCFA/SNTF was overstrained by the ambitious
development program decided by the Government; (ii) pricing of services is not
satisfactory; (iii) SNTF's resort to short-term credit and overdraft to
finance part of its current operations and debt service; (iv) Government
contribution to maintenance of infrastructure prior to 1978 was below needs,
leading SNCFA/SNTF to impair its financial equilibrium and eventually to
curtail the maintenance program; and (v) no clear division of responsibilities
between SNCFA/SNTF and the Government constrained planning.
Audit
5.10     Under the Loan Agreement the borrower should "have its accounts and
financial statements for each fiscal year audited in accordance with sound
auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank". At loan
negotiations, the Bank accepted the "Controle Financier de l'Etat" as an
independent auditor, subject to consultations between the Bank and the
Government on the conditions under which audit is performed. It appeared
later that the audit function of the "Contr8le Financier de l'Etat" was
limited to a review of the financial reports of SNTF: if they were found
satisfactory, the Ministry of Finance would authorize their release. The Bank
considered this procedure not in accordance with the audit requirements, and
clarified in 1975 its views on audit. However, by 1978 the audits of
SNCFA/SNTF accounts for the project period were still not available, and
subsequently, only the SNTF reports on annual accounts have been forwarded to
the Bank. The lack of audit reports and the frequent changes in the
accounting practices and in the distribution of financial responsibilities
between the Government and SNTF were detrimental to the Bank perception of the
borrower's financial performance.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCF 4IND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     During the period of the project the Algerian railways authority was
substantially reorganized with far reaching changes in terms of management,
operations, finances, accounting and staffing. Considering the extent of
these changes and the volume of rehabilitation and renewal works carried out
simultaneously, the performance, supported by a 7% annual growth of traffic
units, was adequate.



- 15 -
6.02     The large program of institutional studies, included under the
project is proof of the borrower's understanding of the need for
administrative and operational improvements. The staff shortages and the
pressure of day-to-day activities prevented implementing the study program
within the time period agreed at appraisal.   Nevertheless, the program,
except one study, was executed, some recommendations were adopted and their
implementation was started. Considerable work is still necessary to complete
this task.
6.03     The SNTF performance in operations was reviewed in Chapter IV and
financial performance in Chapter V. Although not all of the 1976 operational
targets were reached, SNTF achieved satisfactory growth of traffic. Financial
performance appears to be poor but it should be viewed in light of
organizational changes, decentralization of accounting units, unclear
financial responsibilities and Government control of tariffs.
6.04     SNTF had used consistently expert consultants for engineering and
supervision of important investments. Feasibility studies were omitted or
were insufficient, but this was to a great extent because the investment
programs were already decided in their scope and timing by the Government.
When the Bank suggested to carry out full feasibility studies of large
investments, the SNTF response was positive. However, the Government decided
against such studies for projects for which commencement of works was
imminent, accepting the principle, however, for the projects for which
engineering was not yet started.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01     The economic evaluation carried out at appraisal was based on a
10-year program of track renewal and rolling stock rehabilitation. Proposed
investments on the mineral line and the grande rocade were analysed
separately. Implementation of the renewal/rehabilitation program was expected
to accommodate up to about 6.5 million tons of iron ore and phosphates on the
mineral line, and up to 5,0 million tons of other freight traffic on the
grande rocade. It was assumed that extensive investments would be required to
accommodate any further traffic increase. Two alternatives were examined: (i)
a graduwal deterioration and ultimate collapse of the system without the
project and (ii) track renewal and rolling stock rehabilitation to maintain
safe services and allow growth to the full capacity of the system. The
economic analysis assumed that without track renewal passenger traffic would
stop on the grande rocade in 1976 and freight traffic in 1980, and the mineral
line all traffic would stop in 1974. With the renewal program, traffic would
grow to reach the full capacity level of the existing system. The economic
rate of return of the project was estimated at 21% for the grande rocade and
23Z for the mineral line.
7.02     The appraisal evaluation of mineral and passenger traffic benefits
had used as a proxy their contribution to the railway fixed costs, i.e. the
excess of revenues over the long term marginal costs. The economic evaluation
was based on the difference between revenues and long term marginal costs
because at the time of appraisal these costs were lower than revenues for both
passenger and freight traffic and were therefore a reasonable proxy for the



- 16 -
railways contribution to the "value added"' from mineral production, or the
market price of passenger transport. In essence, however, this method
calculated financed rather than economic benefits. For freight traffic on the
grande rocade, benefits were quantified as savings resulting from transport by
rail instead of transport by road. The appraisal also recognized that it was
not possible to attribute specific benefits to any particular item of the
renewal program because project investments were closely interlocked, and the
benefits were interrelated and dispersed among various components of railway
operations.
7.03     It was not possible to replicate the appraisal analysis, or to
quantify the economic return from the project by another method, for the
following reasons:
(i) at some point in time, the long run marginal cost of mineral, freight
and passenger traffic exceeded revenues due to non adjustment of
tariffs; this was coupled with rising operating costs. The
difference between revenues and costs was no longer a reasonable
proxy for project benefits; and
(ii) the detailed data required for analysis of benefits and costs and
economic rate of return computation are not available and their
research would be time consuming, and may not be successful, because
of lapse of time and inadequate monitoring and data storing system.
7.04     The freight traffic growth rate lagged considerably behind the
forecast of 16X p.a.; the respective 1977 figures were: for the grande rocade
actual traffic 1,075 million ton km against estimated 2,033 million ton km,
while for the mineral line 842 million ton km instead of the estimated 1,278
million ton km. Replicat5nri the appraisal method of economic evaluation while
using these figures would give lower figures of internal rate of return than
those obtained at appraisal (para. 7.01). However, such reevaluation would
not take into account the economic benefits of the investments which not only
permitted continuation of traffic in safer conditions, but also allowed the
respectable growth of 72 p.a. in terms of traffic units; created the base for
further increase of capacity; initiated extension of the railway network and
ensured normal operation of iron ore and phosphate mines. The Algerian
railways continue to participate in the country's economy on a growing scale.
The project studies contributed to the institutional development of SNTF
through improved operations, acre--nting and maintenance.
7.05     While the limited reevaluation on the basis of methods used at
appraisal would be incomplete because it would not take into account all
economic benefits, the full evaluation is not possible for lack of
quantifiable data on railway operating costs and value added from mineral
operations. The main physical objective of the project, renewal of the track
which accounted (with the equipment for track laying) for 76X of the loan
amount, was successfully completed. It eliminated the dangerous sections in
the rail network and led to the next stages of renewal. Since track renewal
was necessary in order to keep mineral and freight traffic moving, and these
traffics car. only be carried economically by rail, it is likely that the
project remained economically justified despite the lower than forecast
traffic and the decline in SNTF's operating performance.

VIII.  ROLE OF TRE BANK
8.01     The First Railway Project's participation in implementation of the
1974-1977 railway Development Plan was well timed to provide financial and
technical assistance in the sector which had been neglected over the long
period of time. Financial assistance to track renewal helped in starting the
line rehabilitation after twenty years of inaction, and provided an incentive
to the program continuation, as witnessed by 600 km of track renewal included
in the 1980-1984 Plan.
8.02     Technical assistance under the project contributed to institutional
improvements, which coincided with the restructuring of the Algerian railway
authority SNCFA into SNTF, an enterprise restruc)ured in accordance with
Government policy. However, the Bank had over-estimated the borrower's
capacity to recruit consultants, review and implement recammendations of the
studies within the short period of project duration. Furthermore the
appraisal did not evaluate to its full extent the implications of far reaching
socio-economic reforms which were taking place in Algeria at that time.
8.03     The impact of technical assistance would have been greater if a
second railway project would have followed closely the first one as it was
initially intended. The Government requested the second project in February
1977. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards arose the controversy over the
feasibility study of the Ramdane Djamal-El Guerrah track doubling, which
suspended processing of the second project (para. 3.18).
8.04     The Bank role in the controversy about feasibility studies merits
some explanatory remarks. The covenant requiring that the important
investments of the borrower (SNCFA/SNTF) should be based on technical,
economic and financial studies was included in the Guarantee Agreement and not
in the Loan Agreement, therefore, its importance may not have been apparent
sufficiently clear to the borrower SNCFA/SNTF. Although track doubling was
discussed at appraisal in 1973, and the related engineering study included in
the project, the economic feasibility of the proposed doubling was raised by
the Bank only in 1978 when the Government was negotiating the construction
contract. The Bank's short study of the line stage improvement was refuted by
SNTF and the suggested full feasibility study was refused by the Government.
The Bank's intervention in the matter of feasibility studies was rather late.
Since this was the first project in the Algerian railway sector, the
supervision of the project should have been more frequent than the actual
average frequency of 8 1/2 months and more time would have been available to
discuss directly the larger issues of development investments in the railway
network, which might have led to a program of feasibility studies at an early
stage of the project implementation.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     Implementation of the physical components of the project was
successful: the track renewal was carried out as planned and a substantial
renewal of rolling stock was achieved under the 1974-1977 Plan. Operational
performance generally achieved the agreed 1976 targets except train loads and
punctuality of passenger trains. However, financial problems were increasing



- 18 -
with time, and the working ratio slipped from 75 in 1974 to 90 in 1980. The
principal reason for financial problems was insufficient increase of tariffs
to compensate growing operating expenses; while operating expenses grew from
1972 to 1980 at an average rate of 15.7% p.a., there were during this period
only two freight tariffs increases by 20Z in 1975 and by 30% in 1979 (paras.
5.02 and 5.03).
9.02     The appraisal was over-optimistic in the program of studies.  The
SNTF capacity to procure and administer consulting services, to review the
reports and to implement the accepted recommendations was over-estimated.
9.03     The development of the railway system in Algeria is evidenced by
capacity improvements, geographical extensions and institutional reforms. The
growing  demand for rail transport is being met satisfactorily.  SNTF is
receptive to a concept of further cooperation with the Bank. Experience
gained by both the Bank and SNTF under the First Railway Project should be
helpful in the preparation and implementation of a future project.
9.04     The principal lessons learned from this project may be summarized as
follows:
[i)  the need to agree on a clear set of policies and objectives for the
railways and on a specific action program;
(ii) a clear appreciation of the railway authority's staffing weakness and
the definition of a program of studies commensurate with the
implementation capacity;
(iii) greater effort should be put into the Bank supervision of the
projects, particularly when dealing with a new borrower;
(iv)  the Ramdane Djamel - El Guerrah track doubling issue underscores the
importance of ensuring that sound feasibility studies precede
detailed engineering and that clear feasibility criteria are agreed
upon; and
(v)  projects should focus on the main objectives agreed in the action
program and when a dialogue has been established the projects
sequence sbould be maintained to ensure the development impact.

RE:   Project Completion Report on First Railway Project (Loan 996-AL), and
your co.munication of February 15, 1985.
Dear Sir:
I wish to acknowledge receipt of the Project Completion Report on
the First Railway Project, for which the World Bank provided financial
participation through Loan 996-AL.
Except for certain matters of detail (suwmarized in the enclosed
Anne), I agree with the content of the Report and its analysis of SNTF's
situation during the 1970s.
Yours, etc.

Camments bY SNTF concernin= the World Bank Report on reorganization
of SNTF's accounting systens
(3.11: ITRANSURB-SOBEMMP-GOMBERT)
1.       SNTF did not call for additionsl accouating systems to be prepared,
but instead insisted on the application of the terms as clearly defined in the
contract, and of established procedures.
2.       The difficulties arose as a result of a narrow interpretation on the
part of the consulting firm of the scope of the services it was to provide
under the contract.
3.       SNTF encounteed no payment problems. The delay on the part of the
consulting firm was the result of:
- the inadequacy of its staff's expertise to deal with the volume of Region's
services required under the contract;                              Comment:
Para. 3.131
- the high turnover of staff responsible for the same tasks.         of PCR
amended.
4.       These problems considerably delayed the consulting firm in carrying
out its contractual obligations, so that the allocation for subsistence
expenses was completely exhausted. This work has been suspended since July
1982.
5.       About 70Z of the work has been coq_pleted.
6.       The consulting firm is willing to resume work only if the financial
terms are amended.
