Dear Dr. Egilmez,
     Re: Turkey: Loan No. 2922-TU Second Industrial Training
         Project
     We refer to the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
Bank) for the Second Industrial Training Project, dated April 8,
1988.  In our letter dated June 12, 1992, we informed you that funds
had been reallocated according to your request.  At the same time we
informed you that Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement would need to be
amended to include procurement procedures for textbooks.
Accordingly, the Bank hereby agrees to amend Part C, Schedule 4 to
the Loan Agreement as follows:
     1.   The words "and books and instructional materials
     estimated to cost the equivalent of not more than $700,000 in
     the aggregate" are added after the words "$2,000,000 in the
     aggregate" in paragraph 2 of said Part C; and
     2.   A new paragraph 3 is added reading: "3. Copyrights may
     be procured, up to an aggregate amount of $100,000, through
     direct negotiation with the publishers thereof, in accordance
     with procedures satisfactory to the Bank."
     Please indicate your agreement to the above amendment by
signing and dating the form of confirmation on the attached copy of
this letter and returning said copy to us.
     A copy of this letter is being sent to YOK and the Ministry of
Tourism for their information.
                           Sincerely yours,
                          /s/Michael Wiehen
