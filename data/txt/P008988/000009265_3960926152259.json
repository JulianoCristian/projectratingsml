The project aims to assist the Council\n            of Higher Education in developing:  (i) a national system of\n            higher-level technician training; and (ii) a system of\n            high-quality technical and vocational teacher education in\n            four Faculties of Technical and Vocational Education\n            (FTVEs).  In addition, the project supports the Ministry of\n            Culture and Tourism (MCT) in developing a national training\n            system for hotel, catering and tourism occupations.\n            Specifically, the project supports the conversion of 20\n            outmoded, ill-equipped and inappropriately staffed\n            Vocational Schools of Higher Education (VSHEs) into proper\n            Technician Training Centers (TCCs).  It also supports the\n            expansion and upgrading of existing instructor training\n            programs at the FTVEs to meet a projected shortfall of over\n            13,400 technical and vocational teachers by 1991, as well as\n            the upgrading and expansion of 10 tourism training centers (TUREMs)."}, "docdt": "1988-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
