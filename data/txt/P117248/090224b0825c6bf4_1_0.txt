                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and performance oriented budget management process, while strengthening
                         financial accountability across the expenditure management cycle. The project supports fundamental reforms of operational budget management functions in both
                         central units and line ministries. Enhanced budget process and financial accountability is likely to improve the allocative and operational efficiency in public expenditure
                         management which in turn will enable better provision of key public services in support of the Government's social and economic policy objectives.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         2 out of 4 Project Development Objective (PDO) level indicators - institutionalizing the MTBF, and implementing iBAS++ as a prerequisite for achieving international standards of
                         financial reporting - will not show any significant result by the project end-date. The other 2 PDO-level indicators regarding the number of ministries producing annual performance
                         reports and percentage of ministries producing quarterly financial management reports – will only
                         be partially achieved. Accordingly, the rating for progress towards achievement of PDO has been maintained as “unsatisfactory”.

                         While there have been achievements in some areas, overall project implementation has remained sluggish and critical activities will not be completed by the closing date.
                         Consequently, the overall implementation progress rating has also been maintained as “unsatisfactory”. The main areas of progress to date and the activities which will not be
                         completed by the closing date are summarized below.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Finance, SPEMP donors and the World Bank have decided to close most project activities on July 31, 2014 as scheduled. A key factor that informed the decision
                         against a project extension was the observed lack of adequate follow-up by the Government and project team on recommendations made during consecutive supervision missions,
                         especially with regard to the development of IBAS++. Concerns also existed about the realism of plans to achieve project objectives during an extension period. However, the closing
                         date for expenditures related to 26 Masters degree candidates has been extended to September 30, 2014 so that they may complete their degree programs.
