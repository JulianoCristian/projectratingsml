        highly unsatisfactory rating with moderate risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            highly unsatisfactory ratings for their respective\n            performances. There were four Level 2 restructurings of the\n            project. These restructurings involved changes in project\n            design, the revision of the results framework, an increase\n            in the funding allocation from, and a closing date extension\n            by two months, which applied only to one specific project\n            activity to allow students in an ongoing Masters program to\n            finish their program. There were several lessons learned\n            from this project and include the following: (1) project\n            goals could have been less ambitious, more prioritized and\n            sequenced, and better informed by previous projects and\n            known capacity constraints, (2) more effective consultation\n            with government about their priorities and more active\n            questioning of paper commitments would also likely have led\n            to a less ambitious project, (3) the consequences of the\n            lack of a results framework, and results chain analysis was\n            evident in the design and implementation. In the absence of\n            a more logical explanation of why the public financial\n            management (PFM) reforms were being prioritized the links\n            between activities to the objectives were ill defined, (4)\n            greater use could have been made of the available resources\n            to supplement the technical knowledge of the task team,\n            especially to provide more intensive oversight of critical\n            activities, (5) more up front work to clarify the (PFM) IT\n            strategy, system architecture and user requirements, is\n            advised before committing large amounts of funding to a\n            financial management information system (FMIS) Project, and\n            (6) allowing the normal rules preventing officials being\n            hired as consultants to be circumvented carries significant risks."}, "docdt": "2015-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
