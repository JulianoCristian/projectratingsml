performance orientation in public financial management through institutionalizing the
Medium Term Budget Framework and Strengthening Financial Accountability". This was
slightly different from the objective stated in the PAD which was to "deepen and
institutionalize the medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and build a more strategic
and performance oriented budget management process, while strengthening financial
accountability across the expenditure management cycle." For the purposes of the ICR, the
PDO in the Grant Agreement with the Government has been used as the basis for assessing
the results.

The Project supported fundamental reforms of operational budget management functions
in both central units and line ministries. Enhanced budget process and financial
accountability were considered likely to improve the allocative and operational efficiency
in public expenditure management which in turn would enable better provision of key
public services in support of the Government's social and economic policy objectives.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO has not been revised. With the benefit of hindsight it would have been advisable
to revise the PDO as part of the restructuring process, perhaps removing the emphasis on
performance orientation, since the Government showed relatively little interest in this
aspect of the reforms.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background

1. The Project was prepared at a time when Bangladesh was experiencing strong
   economic and social progress. Despite periods of political turmoil and natural
   disasters, GDP grew by a rate of 6.21 percent per annum on average during the period
   of the Project. Responsible fiscal and monetary policies kept inflation in single digits.
   Fiscal prudence also kept public borrowing in check, preventing the crowding out of
   private investment. Meanwhile, fiscal and monetary discipline, along with periodic
   adjustments in the exchange rate, helped keep the external sector in balance. Sustained
   public spending in key priority areas contributed to visible social outcomes with the
   country outperforming most low-income countries on a range of social indicators such
   as infant mortality rates and gender equality in access to primary schooling.

2. At the same time, the Project faced a challenging overall governance environment.
   Public administration was challenged by weak policy coordination, a poor incentive
   structure, inadequate revenues, weak accountability and limited implementation
   capacity that led to underperformance in the delivery of public services. Bangladesh
   was governed by a Caretaker Government. The Caretaker Government stayed in power
   from early 2007 until the end of 2008. It was replaced by an elected Government in
   December 2008, which took office in January 2009.

Sector background

3. At the start of the Project, Bangladesh’s public finance management (PFM)
   policies and institutions had gone through a decade-long process of incremental
   transformation. Notable achievements included the consolidation and amendment of
   the regulatory framework, the computerization of the transactions and budget process,
   a new classification system, and the development and piloting of strengthened
   expenditure management through a Medium Term Budgeting Framework (MTBF) and
   better integration of the capital and recurrent expenditure programs. The Government
   also began to develop capacity of key PFM staff through the establishment of the
   Financial Management Academy (FIMA).

4. However, additional PFM reforms were considered necessary to sustain and
   expand on the previous achievements. While the previous reforms were recognized
   as important and essential building blocks of a comprehensive reform of public
   expenditure systems, by themselves they were deemed to be insufficient to bring about

   the desired sustainable change in the management of fiscal resources across
   Government. The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (FY06-10) noted that the
   country’s relatively weak governance environment could increasingly prove a barrier
   to more rapid, inclusive and sustainable growth calling for improved quality of public
   investments and overall public financial management.

Rationale for Bank assistance

5. The Bank’s assistance was based on the Government financial management
   reform strategy and donor interest in supporting a joint program. In May 2006,
   the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) prepared its financial management reform
   strategy: “GoB Vision and Medium Term Rolling Action Plan” which provided the
   framework under which all PFM-related reform initiatives could be incorporated under
   a single ‘umbrella’. Several development partners agreed to provide their funding on a
   joint and ‘programmatic’ basis. In response to the GoB Action Plan, the Strengthening
   Public Expenditure Management Program (SPEMP) was developed to be financed by
   a Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF) with the participation of five development partners,
   the UK’s DFID, the European Union, Canada’s DFAT (then CIDA), the Danish
   Embassy/ DANIDA and the Government of the Netherlands, with the World Bank as
   the trust fund administrator.

6. The “Deepening MTBF and Strengthening Financial Accountability” (SPEMP A)
   was the first Project to be prepared under the new pooled funding arrangement.
   It was the largest Recipient-Executed Trust Fund under the program aimed to
   strengthen instruments of fiscal control and provide the means to ensure effective
   implementation of budget allocations and greater transparency in government’s
   financial management. Improving the expenditure management system and
   streamlining associated budget preparation and implementation procedures were
   expected to result in more effective management of government’s financial resources
   and efficiencies in government budgetary transactions leading to improved public
   services, and enhanced social and economic outcomes.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7. The objective of the Project per the Grant Agreement was “to strengthen and modernize
   budget management institutions within the Recipient, with a particular emphasis on a
   performance orientation in public financial management, through institutionalizing the
   Medium Term Budget Framework and Strengthening Financial Accountability”.

8. The expected results were described in qualitative terms in the Project document,
   but mostly without specific, measurable, time-bound indicators. The Project aimed
   to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and performance
   oriented budget management process, while strengthening financial accountability
   across the expenditure management cycle. The Project intended to support fundamental
   reforms of operational budget management functions in both central units and line
   ministries. It was expected that the enhanced budget process and financial




                                           2
     accountability would improve allocative and operational efficiency in public
     expenditure management which in turn would enable better provision of key public
     services in support of the Government's social and economic policy objectives.
     However, the expected results were not expressed in the form of “SMART” indicators.
     Please refer to Annex 4 for a detailed description of the expected results at project
     approval.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justifications

9.   The PDO remained unchanged during the lifetime of the Project. However, the
     key indicators were extensively worked on during the life of the Project, as part
     of the ongoing development of the unfinished results framework. A number of
     different results frameworks were proposed, notably during the 2012 and 2013 Project
     restructurings. Different interim versions of the results framework were used for the
     purposes of Project reporting from 2012 onwards. The latest version of the results
     framework was set out in the 2013 Restructuring Paper and was used in the last
     Implementation Status Report archived on July 28, 2014. This results framework
     included indicators which were quite high level given the activities under SPEMP, and
     prone to change given exogenous factors (such as intermediate results indicator 1).
     These indicators were used for the purposes of the ICR and are set out in Section F
     above.

10. The link between the PDO and the indicators was loose. This was particularly true
    for Intermediate Indicator 1, where the gap between the activity and the attributed
    results, i.e. smaller deviations on key macro-fiscal indicators was very large. Indicator
    4, on budget to actual deviations, was similarly problematic. These were highly
    influenced by factors outside the Project and therefore not good indicators of the
    Project’s success or failure.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11. The direct beneficiaries of the Project identified in the Project Document were the
    Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, the Planning Commission and Line
    Ministries. A link was made to the welfare of the citizens of Bangladesh through
    improved resource management by government resulting from the reforms, in turn
    leading to improvements in public services. Other indirect beneficiaries that might have
    been identified include various important consumers of budget and accounting
    information. These included, for instance, the Controller General of Accounts, the
    Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance, Bangladesh Bank, the Office
    of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Budget and Public Accounts
    Committees of the parliament, and civil society organizations with an interest in
    monitoring public finances.

1.5 Original Components

12. As originally designed, the Project had nine PFM components and one Project
    Management Component. Nine of these covered the main technical areas of PFM
    reform and one covered Project Management and Communications.

   1)      Strategic Budget Management in Finance Division;
   2)      Developing Capacities for Debt Policy and Management;

1.6 Revised Components

13. There were four Level 2 restructurings of the Project. These restructurings involved
    changes in Project design (March 5, 2012), the revision of the results framework (July
    23, 2013), an increase in the funding allocation from US$50 million to US$52.5 million
    (June 25, 2014), and a closing date extension from July 31, 2014 to September 30, 2014
    (July 13, 2014) which applied only to one specific Project activitiy to allow students in
    an ongoing Masters program to finish their program.

14. The major restructuring in 2012 resulted in the original ten components being
    rearranged to four components. Five of the other original components became sub-
    components, with the exception of component 4 which was taken out of the Project.
    The changes in components and the resulting allocations are shown in the chart below.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

15. The 2012 Project Restructuring also involved changes in implementation
    arrangements. A Project Executive Committee was introduced, to review progress
    reports, and address implementation issues. It consisted of the Additional Secretary
    (Budget), the Project Director, Component Directors, the MISC Project Coordinator,
    and focal points of selected line ministries. The Committee was expected to meet
    quarterly to promote better coordination and ensure quick disposal of decisions by
    higher authority.

16. The nine Component Coordinators were replaced by three full time ‘Component
    Directors’. They were to report directly to the Additional Secretary, FD and supervise
    overall Project implementation in partnership with the Project Director and Project
    management team. The component director positions were filled by former senior FD
    officials (working as consultants under the Project) with authority over policy and
    technical issues as well as access to key personnel within government.

17. The restructuring approved in July 2014 extended the closing date by two months
    to September 30, 2014. The extension was granted on a limited basis, to allow 26
    scholarship students, already enrolled in overseas master’s programs, to complete their
    studies.

1.8 Project Component Allocations: Revisions over Project Life

18. The original Project included nine PFM components and one Project
    Management Component, each with its own funding allocation. The original
    allocations were based on a total amount of US$67.17 consisting of the committed
    funds of a US dollar equivalent of US$50 million, plus an additional US$17.17 that
    were planned to be added once the amount would become available from the MDTF.
    The PAD component figures and the 2012 restructuring of components are based upon
    the US$67.17 million figure, whereas the loan categories cited in the Grant vary
    between an initial US$50 million and US$52.5 million later in the Project life.

19. The June 2014 restructuring made further changes to the component allocations.
    As part of the restructuring, the total funding envelope was reduced from US$67.17
    million (per the original Project Document) to US$52.5 million (June 2014
    amendment). The allocations between expenditure categories were also revised.
    US$2.5 million was added to the category of “Consulting services, training, and study
    tours”. Funding for the “Goods” category was reduced due to delays in iBAS-related
    procurements and reallocated to “Operating costs”.

20. In July 2014, there was a final Project restructuring to create a new spending
    category for 26 ongoing training scholarships. The Project closing was also extended
    by 2 months to accommodate the scholarship period and expenditures were allowed
    during that period only for the scholarships. The other expenditures were only eligible
    up to the original closing date.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Lessons of earlier operations

21. The SPEMP-A Project represented a continuation and expansion of a PFM
    reform program that was already 15 years old. Two DFID-led projects RIBEC and
    Financial Management Reform Project (FMRP), had, since 1992, achieved some
    limited successes in improving budgeting, accounting and financial reporting,
    enhancing audit and skills levels, and had helped the GoB to implement an automated
    financial management information system.

22. The preparation and design of the SPEMP-A Project needs to be understood in
    the context of donor commitments to improve development coordination. Donors
    aimed at following the aid harmonization principles agreed under the Paris Declaration
    and applying these to PFM. Previously, donor support to PFM reform in Bangladesh
    had been fragmented. In 2005 the four largest development partners to Bangladesh —
    the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the UK Department for International
    Development (DFID), the Government of Japan, and the World Bank developed a Joint
    Strategic Framework (JSF), a Statement of Partnership Principles, a Joint Outcome
    Matrix, and a division of labor for sector coverage. This resulted in the World Bank
    assuming responsibility for public finance management with financing through a Multi-
    donor Trust Fund supported by UK’s DFID, the EU, Canadian Department of Foreign
    Affairs, Trade and Development (DFAT, formerly the Canadian International
    Development Agency, CIDA), the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the



                                                 7
   Royal Danish Embassy. The Project design was successful in bringing the donors
   together under one single umbrella program (SPEMP) and coordinating them around a
   single program. However, the single program tended to be as wide as the interests of
   the donor agencies supporting it, and was perhaps a contributing factor to the ambitious
   agenda.

23. The Project was originally conceived as covering an even broader scope of the
    PFM area. However, during the design stage it was decided to divide the SPEMP
    program into three Projects for easier management: SPEMP-A, and additionally
    SPEMP-B to support the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and SPEMP-
    C to support the Parliamentary oversight function. Extending the same principle of
    further dividing up the SPEMP A Project along organizational lines might have
    prevented the problems which arose within SPEMP A in respect of the support to the
    Planning Commission under component 4.

Risks and Mitigations

24. The Project Document rated the overall risks of the SPEMP-A Project as
    “substantial”. The PD identified two key implementation risks:

   -   Lack of a sound human resources management strategy in GoB, in particular
       regular reassignment of officers to new positions resulting in loss of knowledge and
       continuity and the rivalry created by separate cadre systems such as that between
       the administrative and economic and audit and accounting cadres, leading to a
       potential unwillingness to cooperate on Project objectives.

   -   Insufficient coordination between MoF and Planning Commission reflected in
       separate processes for the development and non-development budgets, making the
       development of an effective MTBF and Forward Baseline Estimates (FBEs)
       difficult.

25. The Project design did not include explicit measures to mitigate the turnover and
    coordination risks. Although it would have been unrealistic to expect major changes
    in HR policy, logical responses might have been to reduce the scope of the Project or
    to allow a longer period for Project implementation. The second risk could also have
    been addressed in the Project design, considering that Component 4 was later separated
    from the main Project. Although there were other issues caused by government
    officials being hired as consultants, one positive impact was the fact that they stayed
    with the project until the end.

26. A number of other important risks were not discussed in the Project Document,
    2008. First, there appears to have been limited consideration of the technical risks
    associated with the size and complexity of the Project relative to GoB’s absorptive
    capacity; and especially in light of the proposed ICT developments for a financial
    management information system. This is now widely accepted as a significant reason
    for the unsatisfactory outcome, as was commented on in the 2012 Bank ISR mission



                                            8
   and the 2013 Independent review initiated upon management request. Second, the risk
   involved in the proposed procurement plan to have a single contract, requiring a single
   firm to obtain consultants of adequate quality for such a large and diverse Project, was
   not considered. Third, the institutional risks were greater than envisaged, given the
   actual level of GoB ownership (across different organizations including Finance
   Division, Ministry of Planning, Accountant General’s Office and line Ministries) of the
   PFM reforms and the extent of potential resistance to change, which was not well
   discussed in the Project Document. As such the change management aspects of the
   Project design were not strongly emphasized or developed. As a result, some activities,
   for example internal audit, performance budgeting and changes in legislation were
   included in the Project although there was little or no demand.

27. The specific risks and challenges associated with introducing a new financial
    management information system were not addressed. The challenge of introducing
    a new chart of accounts under SPEMP which would require a large number of
    stakeholders (including the Ministry of Planning) in addition to Finance Division was
    also not addressed as a risk.

Project Design

28. The PDO and results framework were loose and broadly defined. The first part of
    the PDO statement “strengthen and modernize budget management institutions” was a
    broad objective and the logical connections between this and the other parts of the PDO
    statement, “emphasizing performance orientation in PFM” and “institutionalizing the
    MTBF and strengthening financial accountability” were not very clear. For example
    the objective of strengthening financial accountability was only supported to a limited
    extent by the Project outputs, which focused on accounting rather than accountability.
    The logical connections between the PDO and the broad range of activities were also
    not sufficiently clear. Overall, the results framework in the PAD was unsatisfactory
    and incomplete. The results were framed as broad statements of goals, but they lacked
    specific or measurable results indicators.

29. The Project design did not take sufficient note of the time taken to achieve results
    in PFM as evidenced in earlier projects. The FMRP and RIBEC were affected by
    delays in decision making, and problems in project management and coordination
    which were later to affect implementation of SPEMP-A. In all cases project progress
    was heavily dependent on few key officials, with vision and energy, pushing forward
    the reform process. Given the inevitability of changes in key personnel and delays in
    obtaining political approval for key strategic decisions, the Project scope could have
    been reduced or the implementation period extended.

30. The Project design also did not adequately reflect the recipient agencies’ capacity
    to manage a complex set of reforms simultaneously or the limited interest in some
    activities. The original Project design was widely recognized as overly ambitious, with
    nine PFM components being implemented in parallel. Later restructurings, although
    consolidating components, largely failed to simplify the Project activities to make the



                                            9
   Project scope more focused and address the challenges of the original design.

31. Sequencing of various reforms, though rated critical during the design stage, did
    not find proper reflection in the Project design. The Project followed GoB’s PFM
    reform timeframe, as reflected in the PFM Vision and Medium Term Rolling Action
    Plan, 2006. However, the approach was to take on most of the activities without a
    greater attention to the prioritization and sequencing required.

32. The approach in component 1 of SPEMP-A was to improve good resource
    management across all government, but without the new system introduced the
    institutional reforms were quite burdensome for line ministries. For instance,
    capacities in Line Ministries were stretched by the MTBF process and introduction of
    new institutional set-ups and requirements and therefore staff were not able to place
    sufficient focus on monitoring of budget implementation and cash requirements.

33. Insufficient preparatory work was done to clarify the information systems
    strategy of the Finance Department. This had several negative impacts on the
    Project. The GoB maintained an expectation that the existing iBAS system could be
    incrementally developed and expanded to meet its needs, based on development of the
    existing software. This turned out not to be possible, but it took more than one year
    after the Project had started before the FD accepted that the iBAS system would have
    to be replaced with new software. The same misapprehension resulted in the selection
    of a consultant firm whose main skills and experience (in ICT), were as an implementer
    of customized commercial-off-the-shelf software. The decision to develop bespoke
    software meant that the main consultancy firm hired to deliver SPEMP A results had
    to work outside its core expertise, and this resulted in additional delays as the firm
    sought qualified individuals with software development skills to support the
    development of the bespoke iBAS++ system, a new financial management information
    system. Contrary to the impression given by the name, iBAS++ was not a development
    of iBAS, but a completely new system.

2.2 Implementation

Initial Stage

34. The Project did not effectively get underway until mid-2010, even though the
    Project Document was finalized in September 2008. Project implementation was
    initially delayed by the time to declare the Project effective, as well as the processes of
    selecting and consultants under the main contract (S-1: Management and
    Implementation Support Consultancy (MISC)) and then mobilizing them. Although the
    Project became effective on November 2, 2009, the contract with the MISC was not
    approved until April 29, 2010 with consultants beginning work from the middle of




                                              10
      2010.2 Many of the individual consultants who were proposed in the bidding document
      proposal turned out to be unavailable and replacements had to be found. Component
      Advisors for all initial nine components were never made fully available.

35. Early on in the implementation in 2011, there were delays due to disagreement
    between FD and PDP Australia on the way forward regarding specific reform
    areas. Disagreements became apparent during the discussion of the Inception Report
    prepared by the MISC in August 2011 and approved with reservations by the Steering
    Committee only in January, 2012. The initial disagreements included the feasibility of
    introducing forward-based estimates into the annual budget preparation, the type of
    macroeconomic forecasting modelling, and whether to replace or upgrade the iBAS
    system.

36. Problems in coordinating the work of the Planning Commission and the Finance
    Division were apparent from 2010. The Planning Commission, which was
    responsible for preparing the annual “development budget” did not see the benefit of a
    common project and requested that “their” Component A4 be turned into a separate
    project, independent of the Ministry of Finance. In October 2011, the Project suspended
    its support to the Planning Commission until both the Finance Division and Planning
    Commission agreed on reform priorities and implementation arrangements. In 2012 it
    was agreed that technical assistance to the Planning Commission would be provided
    under a separate Project.

37. By 2011, widespread problems in Project coordination and implementation had
    become apparent. Performance on all aspects (except for financial management) was
    rated as “Moderately Unsatisfactory”, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) was
    rated as “Unsatisfactory”. The Project underwent a first major restructuring beginning
    in 2011 and approved in February 2012, with the amendment to the grant agreement
    signed in May 2012. The main focus of the restructuring effort was to improve Project
    management and coordination and to simplify what was recognized as an overly
    ambitious set of objectives and a complex and ineffective Project design.

2012 Restructuring

38. The 2012 Project restructuring reduced the number of PFM components from 9
    to 3 but did not lead to prioritization of activities. The restructuring of technical
    components was accompanied by an organizational restructuring. Nine component
    coordinators were replaced by three component directors, who were senior civil
    servants (most were Additional Secretary Rank), and considered to be reform-minded.
    Because of the close relationships between the strong component directors and the
    Finance Secretary and Additional Finance Secretary, the Project Director was relegated
    to a support role. This was not reflected in any formal redefinition of the Project

    PDP Australia was the winning consultancy firm.




                                                      11
      Director’s role, and the Project Director was afterwards widely perceived by Project
      stakeholders as exercising influence by delaying decisions.

39. The restructuring process initiated the process of developing a proper results
    framework, which was lacking. Under the restructured design it became easier to
    relate activities to the PDO. Component 1 groups activities related to the first part of
    the PDO “to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and
    performance orientation…; while component 2 groups activities relate to the “…
    strengthen financial accountability across the expenditure management cycle”.
    However, the restructuring did not lead to a narrowing or prioritizing of activities
    despite the complexities of working across such a broad range of PFM issues.

2013 Mid–term Review

40. In February and March 2013, an independent mid-term review of the Project was
    prepared jointly between staff and consultants of the World Bank, DFID and EU.
    The report of the independent review requested by management noted the significant
    lack of progress in many areas and highlighted a number of important problems
    affecting the Project including:

         the fact that the GoB was “not initially persuaded of the need for key Project
          deliverables including the new Chart of Accounts (COA), FBEs, and the
          replacement financial management information system rather than modification of
          the existing IBAS system. As a result the consultants hired under SPEMP A, as
          well as the Bank supervision team, had spent much energy in the first two years
          dialoguing with the staff of the FD and Comptroller & Auditor General (C&AG)
          of the importance of these specific reforms”.3
         the very ambitious scope of SPEMP-A, which arguably exceeded the absorption
          capacity of government.
         structural obstacles to PFM reform, the most important of which were the cadre
          transfer system under which senior staff were frequently transferred to very
          different functions.
         the entrenched system of dual budgeting (under which the preparation and
          execution of the "development" and "revenue" budgets are to a large degree
          separated).

41. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) also noted continued challenges in coordination
    and other areas. It observed that in spite of the 2012 restructuring of Project
    governance structures, coordination between the three major remaining components
    still needed improvement and significant problems continued to exist in the interface
    between the Project and Government in respect to the supply of materials (a
    government responsibility) and the replacement and approval of new consultants. The

    Mid Term Review Report, May 2013.




                                            12
   report concluded that while there was considerable momentum in the Project, some key
   targets were likely to be missed. However given the long delay in the effective start of
   the Project the MTR recommended a no-cost extension to the Project, focused on a
   more limited set of objectives.
2013 - Second Project Restructuring and Deteriorating Progress

42. In 2013, the Bank team expressed concern about the continued lack of agreement
    on the results framework. This led to a second Project restructuring in November
    2013 which main purpose was to establish a proper results framework. Although a new
    results framework was broadly defined and included in the first restructuring, in
    practice FD and the World Bank did not agree on the details, which continued to be
    debated and revised until the conclusion of the Project in 2014. By this time a new
    results framework had been developed for the proposed Project extension.

43. The World Bank’s assessment of Project progress remained overly sanguine
    through the first half of 2013. Although little progress was made in the areas of debt
    management, legal and regulatory, and the payroll and pensions subcomponents,
    overall progress was rated “Moderately Satisfactory”. The Aide Memoire noted that
    the new accounts classification structure was on-track to be finalized by June 2013,
    together with a new manual on accounting procedures, and the development of the new
    integrated budget and accounting system (iBAS++) had progressed with agreements
    on the functional scope of the new system, finalization of the overall technical
    architecture, drafting of system requirement specification (SRS) documents and
    adoption of quality management methods in the software engineering methodology.

44. By the summer of 2013 it was clear that the Project implementation had still not
    gained in momentum. Critical decisions were pending with the Finance Division,
    affecting core reform areas, including:
     Ratification of the MTBF Roadmap.
     Establishment of the Budget Management Wing in FD.
     Approval of FBEs Guide (submitted to FD in 2012).
     Decision on the role of Medium Term Strategy and Business Plans (MTSBPs) in
        planning and resource allocation.
     Approval of the new accounts classification structure by FD and GAG.
   Project ratings were again downgraded to “Moderately Unsatisfactory” in components
   2 and 3 which were most central to the overall development objective, including
   strengthening of budget management and MTBF, as well as accounting and financial
   reporting.

45. Project management and coordination had also deteriorated. Decisions on hiring
    and procurement suffered from long delays; Project finances were not well managed
    so that the Project was unable to produce credible disbursement plans; FD was not
    exercising regular and systematic oversight of the Project; and decision-making was
    hampered by a lack of coordination between FD, PMCU and the consultants under PDP
    Australia.

Plans for Project Extension

46. In line with the MTR recommendations, the Government requested donors to
    extend SPEMP-A and increase the total financing for SPEMP-A to US$79 million.
    Significant work was done by the Government and the Bank team to design the Project
    extension. As late as May 2014, a joint government donor meeting discussed the
    extension proposal, but SPEMP donors expressed concerns about whether the SPEMP
    A Project could be completed even with the proposed two year extension. Since an
    extension of SPEMP A would require an extension of the MDTF and the SPEMP
    program, many SPEMP donors were not able to commit to extending the trust fund
    without more reassurance on current progress and details of activities to be carried out
    by an extended SPEMP A with additional funds. At that time, project implementation
    and progress towards the project development objective were rated as “Unsatisfactory”
    in the implementation status reports. The request for an additional financing of US$29
    million over the US$50 million grant was made, since the Project was almost fully
    disbursed. This represented an additional US$11.8 million over the original Project
    document amount of US$67.17 million.

Decision to close the Project

47. In early 2014, the World Bank reviewed progress on the ground which led the
    SPEMP donors and the World Bank, as the trust fund administrator, to conclude
    that the performance of SPEMP-A, and plans for the extension period, could not
    justify the request for additional financing. An expert review of the IBAS++
    implementation, in March 2014, was critical in forming this view. The resulting report
    was critical in persuading the Bank management to recommend closure of the Project.
    It reported:
      Limited Government ownership and involvement, including lack of clarity on
       objectives of iBAS++; and absence of authorization and clear decision-making on
       system development;
      Significant delays in system development, with less than 10 percent of software
       code written; modules described as completed not running properly, poor design
       documents and delays in installing critical;
      Unrealistic implementation strategy, including unrealistic timelines, lack of
       information on data clean-up and migration, and gaps in in critical diagnostics;
      Inadequate Project Management, including lack of technical leadership,
       insufficient focus on ‘soft’ factors of information system, i.e. people and processes;
       and failure to follow-up on advice given during previous supervision missions;
      Poor documentation, including outdated functional specifications and
       Inconsistencies between and within design documents.The report concluded that,
       even with a two year extension, it was unlikely that the system would be
       successfully implemented.



                                            14
48. Furthermore, under World Bank investment lending guidelines, SPEMP-A, a
    Project which at that time was rated unsatisfactory at the PDO and IP level, would
    not have been eligible for additional financing without a waiver. According to OP
    10.00, Investment Project Financing, paragraph 29 states, “The Bank may provide
    additional financing to an ongoing, well-performing Project…”. 4 Substantial
    compliance with key loan covenants, including audit and financial management
    reporting requirements. SPEMP-A would have only been eligible for additional
    financing if the following three conditions would have been satisfied: 1)The PDO can
    still be achieved; 2) there is an agreed plan on the way forward; 3) Recipient
    performance is satisfactory.
49. The PDO could not be achieved in the original timeframe. The extension proposal
    was not unanimously agreed as the way forward, with donors and the Bank expressed
    concerns about the timetable for the IBAS++ development in particular. The recipient’s
    performance was not considered to be satisfactory on the basis of the very limited
    Project achievements.
50. Following discussions with Finance Division and the SPEMP donors, the GoB
    request to extend and provide additional financing to SPEMP-A was not
    approved. The proposed extension request was discussed by the Fifth Joint Donor
    Government Committee meeting in May 2014, and there was no agreement at that
    meeting on a realistic way forward. Subsequently, the Government sent an official
    extension and additional financing request, which was not approved by the World
    Bank. The World Bank’s procedures for extension and additional financing were
    explained to the SPEMP donors and there was an agreement with the SPEMP donors
    to allow the Project to close as per its original date. Given the long discussion on an
    extension request, the Government and a few donors considered this to be an abrupt
    change of direction in light of the earlier efforts that the Bank team and the Government
    had put into developing an extension request.
2014 Restructuring

51. A final restructuring took place in July, 2014, after the decision had been taken
    not to provide additional financing, and to allow the Project to close as per its due
    date. The Bank team and the government discussed the activities that would be
    adversely affected if the Project closed on time. A further restructuring was therefore
    undertaken to allow Masters students who had been in receipt of scholarships, financed
    by the Project, to complete their studies, and thus the restructuring granted specific
    limited extensions to the Project closing date. The financing of $2.5 million was made
    available to account for accounting changes that indicated commitments in excess of
    $50 million needed to be met. The total $52.5 million for the project was below the
    appraised and approved project total of $67.17 million.

 “Well-performing” is defined as follows: ISR ratings for implementation progress (IP) and development
objectives (DO) have been consistently rated as moderately satisfactory or better over the most recent 12
months.




                                                   15
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

52. The M&E framework described in the PAD included broadly stated objectives
    and “performance indicators” but all of them lacked one or more important
    attributes of SMART indictors or Objective Verifiable Indicators. The Project
    design team’s rationale in leaving the Project objectives broadly defined was that the
    detailed results could be worked out during implementation and that retaining
    flexibility was an advantage. Once implementation started, the new task team leader
    drew attention to the need for the development of a results matrix. However, it was not
    until the first Project restructuring in 2011 that the development of a full results matrix,
    with proper indicators, was initiated, but the process of agreeing the framework was
    long drawn out, with the result that a stable framework for measuring the Project results
    was never established.

53. The new results matrix began to be used in 2012, but remained subject to change
    throughout the life of the Project. Further substantial revisions to the indicators
    complicated the process of results measurement, monitoring and evaluation. For
    example in Component 2, indicators 3 (Data interface into IBAS for all transactions
    originating at Bangladesh Bank and Sonali Bank), and 5 (Timeliness of treasury
    receipts and matching payments accurately using on-line challan verification) are
    reported in 2012 but were later dropped.

54. The Project struggled to create an effective M&E unit in the PMCU. The 2012
    Aide Memoire expressed concerns about the lack of initiative to put in place adequate
    monitoring and reporting arrangements and to fill staffing gaps in M&E. The revised
    TPP (the government’s equivalent of the Project Document and including a detailed
    procurement plan) only had an allocation for hiring an international M&E Specialist
    for 8 months. The mission recommended hiring a national M&E Specialist from
    unallocated and miscellaneous budget. Given the complexity and size of the M&E task
    the Bank recommended that a full-time national M&E staff be identified to work with
    international experts, or that PMCU hire a national consultant on an intermittent basis.
    By mid-2013 an M&E consultant had been recruited, but in July 2013 the Project was
    still in the process of setting up effective monitoring and reporting practices.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

55. There were no social or environment safeguard issues arising from
    implementation of the Project. Due to the nature of its activities, the Project was rated
    a category “C” Project in terms of safeguards and as a result did not trigger any
    safeguard policies.




                                              16
Financial Management

56. Financial management was generally handled in a “Moderately Unsatisfactory”
    manner. Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were received by the due dates and found to
    be in order. However, throughout the Project duration, financial management positions
    at PMCU were understaffed which affected the quality of financial records and internal
    control.

57. Audit reports were submitted on time and most audit observations were dealt with
    satisfactorily. However, the Statement of Audit Needs, as required by the Project
    Document, was submitted by the Project only in July 2012 and was taken as a basis for
    audits for the FY2012-2013 onwards. In total, the auditors made 5 observations, 2 of
    which were identified as material by the Bank team. All the recommendations, except
    one, have been followed by the Project on time. There were repeated audit observations
    on inadequate documentation and payment procedure of Karmadokhota Training.
    These were resolved shortly before the closure of the Project.

58. Computerized accounting software became operational only in April 2013. Before
    that, all accounting records were maintained in EXCEL format. Concerns were raised
    that the Project team was unable to provide expenditure reports at sub-component level
    in order to match expenditures with outputs and results. In 2013, the automated
    accounting system was fully operational to record, process and report accounting
    information of the Project. However, the ICR Bank team was unable to find anyone in
    the PMCU who would be able to provide expenditures data disaggregated any further
    than sub-components, which makes it impossible to track expenditures on individual
    activities, especially IBAS maintenance and IBAS++ development. The lack of
    disaggregated data also limits the reliability of estimates of cost efficiency and analysis.
    The table below provides the estimated expenditures by component based on the latest
    financial reports.

Procurement

59. The overall procurement performance is rated “Unsatisfactory”. Post-procurement
    reviews observed no major deviations from agreed provisions of the Grant Agreement:
    (a) procurement records well maintained, (b) the Project used appropriate tender
    documents, and (c) all contractual payments made on time. However,a number of
    deficiencies were repeatedly highlighted by the Bank team during implementation.
    These included (a) poor quality of procurement planning; (b) consistent delays in
    procurement processes especially at early stages of the Project; (c) procurement
    capacity constraints due to regular absence of Senior Procurement Specialist; (c)
    procurements by the Project outside the approved procurement plan.

60. The largest contract under the procurement plan the MISC contract for US$ 42.9
    million (dollar equivalent) was time-based. This considerably limited FD’s capacity
    for quality control, as no mechanism was in place to ensure value for money. This
    arrangement was criticized by a number of officials interviewed as having contributed
    to the 100% disbursement of Project funds despite many incomplete outputs.

61. A procurement issue to note was the practice of hiring government officials on
    special leave (on lien), as part of the MISC contract. This practice, which was
    carried over from previous PFM reform projects (funded by other donors), was contrary
    to World Bank guidelines on hiring national consultants, but it was not flagged at the
    time the contract was awarded. The issue surfaced at the time of the March 2012
    restructuring, which involved hiring three officials (on lien) in addition to 12 who were
    already working under the MISC contract as National Consultants. The World Bank




                                             18
   regional procurement manager cleared the hiring of the officials subject to two specific
   understandings: (i) that after completion of their assignments consultants returning to
   FD, would not be in a positions to follow up with the Project activities or have any
   position that would cause a conflict of interest, and (ii) that this exception should not
   set a precedent for future contracts funded by the Bank in Bangladesh. The PDP
   Australia contract was amended to include these additional consultancies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

62. As the SPEMP Trust Fund has been extended to December 2016 there are several
    new Bank-executed non-lending technical assistance activities that are planned.
    Following the closure of the SPEMP A Project, the Bank held discussions with the
    Finance Division and the other SPEMP donors for several Bank-executed NLTA to
    provide “bridging support” for a period of 18 months to continue to review and support
    selected activities which had been initiated under SPEMP A and where there was
    consensus that these activities required additional support to embed the reforms initiate,
    as follows:

       Development of macroeconomic forecasting capacity in the Finance Department.
        The bridging support for macroeconomic forecasting takes the form of a
        US$250,000 non-lending technical assistance program, managed and executed by
        the World Bank. This will provide key technical experts to assist the
        Macroeconomic Wing in completing the development of the macroeconomic data
        required for modelling, including the use of the new ‘rebased’ National Income
        Accounts data.
       A review of the budget management arrangements though assistance to four line
        ministries and finance division to help them implement the Medium-Term Budget
        Framework (MTBF), consistent with the implementation guidelines issued by the
        Finance Division.
       A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment and analytical
        support for a new PFM strategy.

63. GoB has approved a new program under their revenue budget and is financing
    the continued development of the iBAS++ financial management information
    system. Funding of 14 crore BDT (US$ 1.8 million equivalent) for continued
    development of the new iBAS++ software has been approved for FY2015. As of
    December 2014, the budget preparation module of IBAS++ is quite advanced (80
    percent complete), but there is still substantial programming needed to be done before
    the system could be used for either budget preparation or execution.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating of Relevance of Objectives: Substantial

64. The relevance of the Project objectives is rated as substantial based on its general
    alignment with Government and Bank development priorities. The area in which
    the project was working was relevant and closely aligned to the Bank’s Country
    Assistance Strategy (FY11-14), which noted that the country’s relatively weak
    governance environment could increasingly prove a barrier to more rapid, inclusive and
    sustainable growth and called for improved quality of public investments and overall
    expenditures. It was also consistent with the country’s own development priorities.
    These were articulated in the Second National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty
    Reduction (NSAPR-II) and PFM Vision and Medium Term Rolling Action Plan
    (2006). Improving fiscal management, through better management of debt stocks and
    service levels, a more strategic approach to budgeting (MTBF) and improved controls
    and transparency with respect to expenditure could all have been expected to contribute
    to improved service delivery, improving the alignment between capital and recurrent
    budget allocations, linking the budget more strongly to results, providing more
    predictability of the public expenditure management system. At the end of the project
    implementation period, the objectives remain relevant to the CAS objective to Enhance
    Accountability and Promote Inclusion, including support to the Government to increase
    the effectiveness and efficiency of public resource use (Outcome 4.1). Continued
    support to strengthen PFM systems is specifically mentioned in the current CAS.

Rating of Relevance of Design and Implementation: Negligible

65. The relevance of the Project design is assessed as negligible due to:

   There was no clear results chain analysis linking the activities to the PDO to guide the
    development of the results framework.
   An acceptable results framework was not in place until 2013, which hampered design
    and implementation the overambitious and unmanageable design with nine
    components covering all aspects of PFM reforms.
   The decision to put all the technical assistance into a single contract, which limited
    flexibility in managing the Project.
   A number of targets were overly demanding and highly dependent upon timely political
    decisions on major outputs.
   Sequencing was not neither carefully thought through nor followed.
   The time and effort required for recipient decision-making and coordination were
    underestimated.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Negligible

PDO: The objective of the Project per the Grant Agreement was “to strengthen and
modernize budget management institutions within the Recipient, with a particular
emphasis on a performance orientation in public financial management, through
institutionalizing the Medium Term Budget Framework and Strengthening Financial
Accountability”.

66. The Project had very limited success in “strengthening and modernizing budget
    management institutions”. The few positive achievements were that the MTEF
    process became better established. MTBF formats and quality were improved, and the
    MTBF was extended to all 59 Line Ministries. MTBF Performance indicators and
    medium-term budget outlooks were prepared for all ministries. While new institutional
    arrangements for budget preparation (Budget Management Wings, Budget Working
    Groups and Budget Management Committees) were designed and partly implemented,
    in practice these do not appear to have reached the level of sustainability. By the time
    of Project closure the new budget management institutions were mostly performing the
    task of budget preparation, while the additional task of doing budget monitoring and
    exercising control over execution remained a low priority. In other ares of institutional
    improvements there were few results. The Institute for Public Finance was established,
    but it remains essentially a shell. There was no progress in establishing an internal audit
    function, and the component on legislative and regulatory changes delivered no
    significant results.

67. Progress towards the objective of improving performance orientation was also
    very limited. Officials interviewed during the ICR stated that the Government had not
    committed to introduce a performance oriented budgeting system. Nonetheless by the
    end of the Project one (target 5) Ministry had produced a strategic business plan, and
    four others had got to the stage of preparing drafts. Key performance indicators (KPIs)
    are included in the Ministry Budget Framework documents, but in the absence of a
    Government commitment to move towards more performance oriented budgeting the
    value of the strategic plans and KPIs is questionable.

68. The project was modestly successful in deepening and institutionalizing the
    MTBF. As mentioned above the practice of preparing MTBFs has been established
    across government and the quality improved. At the same time some key aspects of
    deepening and improving the quality of MTBF were not achieved. The Project failed
    to develop the macro-economic forecasting model, which meant that there was no
    improvement to the medium term fiscal framework on which line ministries could
    prepare forward budget estimates (FBEs). Furthermore, the methodology for FBEs was
    not finalized by the FD or adopted as part of budget preparation. As a result a fully
    functioning MTBF is not in place in any ministry. The latest MTBFs were prepared
    based on Medium Term Macroeconomic Policy Statements. Some progress was in
    building the foundations for future success in this area. A new accounts classification



                                              21
   system was developed, although not finally adopted. Work was started on the
   development of the new computerized financial management system, but this is far
   from complete and successful implementation is not assured. Some improvements
   have been made to the existing accounting system which have improved its coverage
   and functionality. However, very few of these activities were completed and the
   targets set for the projects were not achieved. Improving financial reporting was not
   achieved, due to the failure to adopt the new accounts classification system, accounting
   standards and to develop a new financial management information system.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Negligible

69. The overall efficiency of the Project can be considered negligible given the gap
    between the disbursed amount and Project outputs. In common with many such
    projects the economic justification for the Project was not detailed in the Project
    Document. It is therefore hard to measure the economic efficiency of the project.
    However, the fact that the full budget of US$50 million was disbursed, plus a small
    amount of additional financing, while very few of the planned outputs were delivered,
    indicates a low level of economic efficiency. Significant investments were made in the
    development of the IBAS++ system, and in PFM skills (see Annex 2 for more details).
    These have the potential to deliver benefits in the future, but these are difficult to
    quantify and are not assured. The IBAS++ system may not be implemented and the
    civil service management system in Bangladesh means that those given financial
    management training may not be in jobs where their skills will be used.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

70. Combining the relevance, achievement of PDO, and efficiency, the overall
    outcome rating of the Project is rated Highly Unsatisfactory. The negligible efficacy
    of the Project due to the lack of significant and sustainable progress towards the
    achievement of the PDO and outputs and the negligible level of efficiency justifies the
    highly unsatisfactory rating despite the modest relevance of Project objectives, design,

                         Overall Outcome                      Highly Unsatisfactory

71. The fact that the Project did not achieve most of its PDO and intermediate
    indicators also suggests a “Highly Unsatisfactory” rating. One out of four PDO



                                               22
   level indicators was reported to be achieved partially by the Project closure date – 51%
   of Line Ministries produced quarterly financial management reports meeting FD
   requirements, although the ICR found that the actual number may have been closer to
   50% (29 out of 57 ministries). The composite indicator “Line Ministries with MTBF
   meeting specific criterion” was not achieved , as Line Ministries fully met only one
   criterion – unified budget format used in MTBF and other budget documents. The
   second criterion was achieved partially with Budget Management Wings, the Budget
   Working Groups and the Budget Management Committees established in all Line
   Ministries, but not fully consistent with Terms of Reference suggested by FD. FD also
   failed to introduce baseline estimates used as the basis for determination of budget
   ceilings. Target for indicator two - Line Ministries reporting annual performance - was
   achieved in FY13, but not in FY14 with none of the Line Ministries submitting the
   APR in time in FY14. Finally, the indicator four was not achieved – Annual financial
   statements prepared as per IPSAS cash based standard consistent with COFOG and
   GFSM 2011. Out of 18 intermediate indicators only five intermediate results
   indicatorswere fully achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72. Due to the overall lack of results, the Project’s impact on poverty and social
    development is likely to be minimal and limited with respect to gender aspects.
    Gender budget reports for 40 LMs were published in the FY15 budget. The guidelines
    on gender budgeting were further enhanced and re-issued. A model gender budget
    report for the Ministry of Youth and Sports based on the gender responsive budget
    guidelines was developed. However, gender budgeting still has a mostly reporting
    function and it needs to develop into an instrument of a pro-active planning.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73. The Project had some limited positive impacts on PFM skills levels and
    institutional arrangements. A large amount of PFM training was delivered to a good
    standard which may have a long term positive impact on the quality of public financial
    management. However, the effect is likely to be diluted by the Government’s HR
    management practices which do not ensure that people trained in financial management
    are assigned to posts requiring PFM skills. The Project also helped to establish the
    Institute of Public Finance on a more sustainable basis to be a training provider,
    although it remains heavily dependent on external financing of training. New budget
    management structures were set up within the line ministries to support improved
    budget practices. However, the long term sustainability of these institutions still seems
    to be dependent on continued donor support for budget reforms.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)




                                             23
74. A positive outcome of the Project, which was not reflected in the results
    framework was the improvement of the iBAS system, which remains the core
    accounting system of the Government. Consultants paid for by the Project helped to
    improve the functionality of the system, its reliability and system coverage. During the
    period covered by the Project the system was extended to 325 (out of 400) Upazilla
    accounting offices, electronic funds transfer was introduced as a new payment method
    (used to pay government officials salaries in Dhaka) and a system for on-line
    verification of challans was introduced. A version of iBAS was also developed for use
    by 5 of the major self-accounting entities (SAEs), including the Public Works
    Department, where the system is in use, Roads Department, Bangladesh Railways, the
    Post Office and the Department of Public Health Engineering. New servers and
    communications equipment were purchased which supported the expansion of the
    system and improved its reliability.

75. Additionally, work was also undertaken to support PFM in the health and
    education sectors. Specifically, the Project supported Sector-Wide Approaches to
    adopt the IBAS as the financial management information system for the generation of
    financial reports for the development partners who were contributors to the pooled
    financing under the SWAps. The Ministry of Primary and MassEducation went on to
    accept the advice and to a large extent adopt government systems for reporting
    requirements. In the case of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare however, there
    was continued reluctance on the part of the officials and the donors to move to the
    country system since IBAS was considered more unreliable than the system that had
    been set up by the SWAp.

76. An unintended negative consequence of the Project was that the Ministry no
    longer has a fully functioning automated debt management system. The Project
    was designed to upgrade the DMFAS system, which it had operated successfully for a
    number of years (with support from UNDP), with a new version of the system DMFAS
    6.0 which was implemented under SPEMP A. The UNCTAD contract for
    implementation and training in the use of the DMFAS 6.0 system has ended, and FD
    now no longer receives the updates required to maintain the old version of DMFAS.
    As a result, neither DMFAS nor DMFAS 6.0 are fully operational. Furthermore the
    UNCTAD contract finished before the work had been completed to connect the debt
    department with the Bangladesh Bank. During discussions on “bridging activities” no
    request was made to continue the work on debt management. After the discussions had
    been concluded a request for a retroactive extension was sent to the Bank, but this was
    not approved. A repayment from UNCTAD of US$ 250,000 is due in respect of
    payment made for services not completed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

77. No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

PDO: The Project aimed to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more
strategic and performance oriented budget management process, while strengthening
financial accountability across the expenditure management cycle.

78. The risk to the Development Outcomes of the Project has to be considered in the
    context of the limited results of the Project. Since the Project fell far short of its
    intended results, the risk of a major reversal to development outcomes is somewhat
    lessened, and in the area of medium term budgeting the progress achieved is supported
    by a follow on project. However, without continued external support, or changes in
    Government HR practices, the impact of component 3 on training may be lessened.

79. The main achievements were improvements in medium term budgeting, a debt
    management strategy, improvement and expansion of the pre-existing iBAS
    system and extensive training of staff. The macro forecasting and expenditure
    management reforms will continue to be supported by Bank NLTA projects. The
    improvements in system coverage and performance of the legacy IBAS system are
    sustainable but the PDO outcome of strengthening financial accountability is
    contingent on the successful development and implementation of the FMIS which is
    going ahead under a government-financed project, but success is not assured. While a
    significant amount of preparatory work has been completed, including the development
    of a new chart of accounts and design of the new financial management information
    system, the outcome is still at significant risk as policymakers have not approved the
    chart of accounts. The investment in PFM skills remains at risk due to civil service
    management practices, which commonly rotate staff with specialized PFM training to
    non- specialist posts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

80. Although the Project was designed using analytical work and was broadly aligned
    with the Government’ stated plans, it was not sufficiently targeted. The Project
    built on the Government’s broad PFM objectives but did not sufficiently select areas
    for which there was greater reform ownership and interest in the near term. Analytical



                                           25
   work included a 2006 PEFA assessment and a 2009 public expenditure and institutional
   review. Despite this, the Project went for a comprehensive approach to a large number
   of PFM reforms while the benefit of hindsight would indicate more prioritization and
   attention to the sequencing of reforms would have made more sense.

81. The design did not take sufficient account of past evidence of the limited ability of
    Government to coordinate effectively, or the capacity to implement such a
    complex set of reforms over a limited period. The Project attempted to coordinate
    the work of the Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance and line Ministries, and
    the work had implications for other agencies including the C&AG and Bangladesh
    Bank. While recognition of the coordination challenges led to the original SPEMP
    program being split into three Projects, SPEMP-A still faced significant coordination
    challenges.

82. The team acknowledged that the Government had not requested to undertake
    fundamental reforms of PFM but nevertheless incorporated fundamental reforms
    into the Project design. Such fundamental reforms included the introduction of
    performance budgeting, internal audit, commitment controls and changes to business
    processes and budget legislation for which there was little demand. In practice these
    activities were not carried out.

83. The design process failed to address different expectations with respect to the
    future development of the iBAS system and agree on an IT strategy . The
    Government continued to believe that the Project could achieve its goals through
    incremental improvements to the existing iBAS system while the World Bank’s
    expectation was that GoB would replace the iBAS system. As a result, almost a year
    was spent preparing diagnostic studies and debating the approach to FMIS, and the
    consulting firm selected for the main contract lacked the skills to develop bespoke
    software. The failure to reach agreement on fundamental design issues on the FMIS
    prior to signing the grant agreement, proved to be a significant factor in the delay in
    implementation, such that there was insufficient progress on systems development by
    the time the decision needed to be made on an extension and additional financing.

84. The failure to develop a solid monitoring and evaluation framework prior to the
    approval of the Project was a significant weakness in the Project design. In
    hindsight, this lack of precision contributed to gaps in understanding and expectations,
    which led in turn to long debates and failure to implement many activities.

85. The type of contract and decision to use a single contractor to cover all of the
    reform activities brought some problems. The rationale was that there would be
    gains from integration and coordinated advice. In practice, the quality of the work
    carried out by the MISC consultants was variable, with good results in some areas and
    poor results in others. With the benefit of hindsight, better results might have been
    achieved if separate contracts had been issued for different skills areas, or if payments
    had been more closely linked to results. In making these observations, it is important



                                             26
   to recognize the challenges in attracting consultants to work in Bangladesh.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Unsatisfactory

86. Throughout the Project, the Bank maintained a dedicated team of staff based in
    Dhaka. This consisting of a TTL, an Operations Analyst, a Program Assistant, a Team
    Assistant, and a Research Analyst based in Dhaka to ensure close supervision of the
    Project. In addition, an IT expert (consultant) and a Debt Specialist (Bank staff) were
    regularly engaged in Supervision Missions to ensure technical expertise; and a full time
    public sector specialist was added to the team in Dhaka from 2013. Supervision
    Missions were conducted on time and the quality of Aide-Memoires and ISR’s are well
    noted. There were three TTLs over the course of the Project, although for most of the
    Project there was a reasonable level of continuity of staffing. Fiduciary supervision was
    provided on a regular basis.

87. The Bank only partially addressed the weaknesses in the original Project design.
    The 2012 restructuring improved the Project design, but largely failed to address the
    over-ambition of the Project design, keeping too many of the activities that were not
    performing well. The lack of a proper M&E framework and inadequate staffing of the
    M&E function were not satisfactorily resolved during the lifetime of the Project.

88. The quality of technical supervision was variable. Government officials argued that
    the team could have been more proactive, or brought additional skills to bear, when
    monitoring the quality of consultants provided by MISC and their outputs. For instance
    the macroeconomic forecasting model developed by the MISC was first approved by
    the Bank’s team, but then admitted not to be suitable. It also appears that the team was
    over-optimistic in upgrading the Project performance in 2012-13. Although the
    restructuring was helpful in re-establishing some momentum, it was already apparent
    that the Project’s objectives were unlikely to be achieved without a significant Project
    extension.

89. Government representatives expressed the view that the change of TTLs after
    2012 impacted the Project. In the view of some officials, the incoming TTL was new
    to the Bank, which impacted to the swift supervision of the Project, and also to
    Bangladesh, which is widely acknowledged to be a challenging environment. In
    addition, the TTL faced several other challenges, including:

      Dealing with a FD request to extend the waiver request to allow new FD staff to be
       hired as consultants under the SPEMP-A Project, which was not permitted by
       Bank’s senior management. This issue became an overriding issue of dialogue
       during much of 2013/4, and the TTL was the “messenger” of a difficult message.
      A technically complex and ambitious Project design.
      Unsatisfactory Project performance and implementing arrangements.




                                             27
      Maintaining relationships with multiple SPEMP donors, with different
       perspectives.
      Government officials’ unhappiness at losing a TTL with whom they were
       comfortable.

   This was compounded by changes in management which resulted in gaps of several
   months, when both the Country Director and Practice Manager positions were vacant.
   Conversely, upon management decision in March 2014, an independent evaluation
   with highly specialized PFM experts was organized, and the TTL for the umbrella trust
   fund changed.

90. The Bank’s stance on government officials working as National Consultants under
    the Project had a significant negative impact on relations between the World Bank
    and the Government and created a situation of potential conflict of interest.
    Through an oversight the Bank had approved the original MISC contract which
    included 12 national consultants on special leave (on lien). The conditions set by the
    Bank in 2012 (see para. 63) for approving the appointment of the three additional
    consultants prevented the Government from substituting new officials as consultants
    when those who were contracted under MISC ended their assignments. The
    Government was not happy with the new restrictions and there were numerous
    discussions on this issue, which was raised to the level of senior management. Both
    Bank staff and officials told the ICR team that the Government’s dissatisfaction with
    the Bank’s stance on this issue soured the relationship, to the extent that the team leader
    could not access senior government officials responsible for the project. Furthermore,
    the fact that the government officials were on leave of absence and working for the
    MISC, may have left a gap in terms of ensuring that there was sufficient qualified
    government officials to oversee the consultancy firm. These officials were seen as
    having the unique, required skills to make the project successful. If this was the case,
    with such senior people on the consultancy team, it may have also added to the
    challenge for government officials remaining within government to oversee and hold
    the consultancy firm accountable for results.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

91. There were significant flaws in the Project design which contributed to problems
    in implementation. Project supervision was not sufficiently effective in identifying,
    addressing and following up on the various problems as they emerged. As a result of
    the highly unsatisfactory rating for Project design and the unsatisfactory rating for
    supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated highly unsatisfactory.




                                              28
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

92. Coordination across Government agencies was weak. The Finance Division of the
    Ministry of Finance was responsible for leading implementation in close partnership
    with the Planning Commission and line ministries. In practice, the Planning
    Commission, by its own decision, stood apart from the Project and consultation and
    involvement of line ministries was somewhat limited e.g. consultation with them as
    users of the IBAS system.

93. The Project Steering Committee and Joint-Government Donor Committee met
    irregularly. The Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary (FD), and including the
    Project Director, Component Coordinators, focal points representing line ministries,
    the TTL and a representative from the Lead Donor was supposed to meet semi-annually
    to review progress in implementation, performance against objectives, resolve
    problems and provide guidance on implementation issues. In practice, only a few
    meetings were held during the five years of the Project and at infrequent intervals,
    indicating only limited support or steering from the top management. In practice most
    of the decision making was made by individual component implementation units and
    their heads. In the case of the IBAS++ component this appears to have been driven by
    the consultants MISC. A Joint Government-Donor Committee was established as the
    main regular oversight body for the Project to meet as needed, but at least six monthly.
    It appears that it met irregularly.

94. The Project leadership arrangements were unclear with the official and de facto
    leadership being quite different. While the head of the PMCU was officially the
    Project Director, real leadership rested with the Finance Secretary and later with the
    Additional Secretary. As a result of the restructuring in 2012, the Project Director’s
    effective function became manager of Project support functions (procurement, Project
    accounting, reporting and M&E). In many instances the Project Director was not
    invited to key meetings and not part of important decisions, which were made by the
    component directors and the Finance Secretary/Additional Secretary. In this sense, the
    Project restructuring was incomplete and neither Government nor the Bank was
    effective in recognizing or addressing the poor communication and coordination
    between the Project Director/PMCU and the Component Directors which resulted.

95. The main implementation responsibility for all activities initially rested with nine
    Component Coordinators, senior officials (Joint Secretary or above) supported by
    Component Implementation Units made up of staff of the relevant units in the
    Ministries and the Planning Commission. This arrangement proved ineffective. The
    appointment of three Component Directors as part of the 2012 restructuring resulted in
    improved implementation performance in selected areas.




                                            29
96. The Planning and Management Coordination Unit (PMCU) did not fulfill its role
    effectively. The PMCU was intended to serve as the secretariat and support Project
    implementation through procurement, financial management and monitoring and
    evaluation services. The PAD assigned the PMCU the role of being the primary point
    for managing the linkages and ensuring the interface between the individual
    components, and being largely accountable for the timely and effective implementation
    of the overall Project. In practice the PMCU worked largely as a “post office”
    processing requests from component implementation units. One PMCU Director
    commented that that the unit was just a “cipher”. The PMCU was also widely criticized
    for slowing down procurement and appointment of consultants.

97. Successive review missions identified weaknesses in PMCU’s monitoring and
    evaluation function. It appears to have been difficult to obtain adequate international
    consultants for this task. A strong monitoring and evaluation function would have kept
    tabs on the performance of all components and identified required remedial actions
    where progress was not on track. Instead it appears that the monitoring and evaluation
    function was carried out in a perfunctory “tick the box” fashion rather than an in-depth
    problem identification fashion which would feed into decision making.

98. Observations and recommendations made by Bank supervision missions were
    frequently not followed up. The Bank regularly drew attention to areas of
    unsatisfactory performance, with recommendations for improvement. Table 4 above
    sets out the ratings of the different components over the period October 2011 to
    February 2014. This raises questions about the impact of the supervision missions and
    of the monitoring role of the PMCU.

99. Quarterly progress reports based on the Results Framework were prepared by
    component teams and aggregated by the PMCU and forwarded to the Bank and
    senior FD staff. Regular progress reports on SPEMP-A and the whole SPEMP
    program were prepared and distributed regularly and made publicly available on the
    SPEMP website.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

100. Aide Memoires identified serious gaps in communication and coordination
   between officials in the Finance Department, the Project management team and
   the implementation support consultants as early as 2011. Numerous reform
   proposals made by consultants resulted in very few decisions by the FD. Supervision
   reports regularly reported:
      Lack of follow up actions by Government in response to recommendations made
       in Aide Memoires, including filling critical positions.




                                            30
      Long delays in confirming the selection of new personnel to work on the Project.
      Failure by senior management to take decisions on key strategic documents ,
       such as the IT strategy, the debt management strategy and the new Chart of
       Accounts.
   For example, in mid-2013 an M&E consultant had been recruited, but the July 2013
   Aide Memoire reported that Project was still in the process of establishing effective
   monitoring and reporting practices. This state of affairs was blamed on the
   unnecessarily and unrealistically complicated implementation arrangements, which led
   to confusion and decisions getting stuck in the pipeline.

101. By mid-2012, restructuring was reported to have improved decision-making
   ability within each of the components. However, the roles of both the PD and the
   team coordinator of MISC were reported as having become less clear.
   Communication and coordination problems continued between officials of the FD, the
   Project management team and implementation support consultants persisted and parties
   reported that they were still working in silos and that there was a lack of “drive” to
   implement decisions across the 3 components. In 2012, the World Bank team
   recommended that the quarterly meetings of the Project Executive Committee be held
   continuously to raise and resolve issues needing of high level attention. These meetings
   were expected to be supported by proper M & E-arrangements and a systematic
   inventory of pending decisions discussed at frequent decision update meetings between
   the PMCU and MISC. The mission also recommended that FD, the PMCU and the
   MISC revisit the roles and functions of staff following the restructuring to address the
   lack of clarity.

102. A critical issue affecting progress in the development of the iBAS replacement
   system (iBAS++) was limited Government ownership and involvement in the
   development of the new system. An independent assessment of the status of iBAS++
   implementation in 2014 drew attention to the lack of clarity on objectives of iBAS++;
   absence of authorization and clear decision-making on system development; and the
   fact that key design documents (functional & technical) had not been formally signed
   off by GoB. There was a lack of leadership with respect to the technical professional
   aspects of implementation which contributed to unrealistic estimates of timelines and
   slippages and insufficient follow-up, in between missions on advice given during the
   supervision missions. There was also insufficient awareness and attention given to the
   “soft” factors which are important in the development of new information systems, i.e.
   communications, people and processes.

103. Finance Division refer to consultancy resources being used to upgrade and
   improve the existing IBAS system, which may have slowed the IBAS ++
   development. It is possible that a significant part of the Project budget was spent on
   unplanned improvements to the existing iBAS system and fixes to help address
   operating problems and increase the performance and coverage of the iBAS system.




                                            31
From the point of view of the contractors, the performance of the PMCU posed
significant challenges. PMCU was responsible for coordinating with the main contractor
(MISC), including clearing consultant appointments, and ensuring that the Government
provided its contributions to the Project in the form of physical resources such as office
accommodation, office equipment and vehicles. Long time delays were experienced,
especially at the start of the Project. The Bank also for some time expressed concern
about the quality of PMCU accounting. The PMCU attributed these problems to the lack
of staff and delays in getting approval of staffing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

104. Borrower performance is rated highly unsatisfactory based on several factors
   adversely affecting Project implementation. The Project experienced lack of
   decision making on important issues and concerns highlighted during Bank missions;
   lack of clarity with respect to internal Project management and leadership arrangements
   and insufficient Steering Committee meetings; weaknesses in the performance of the
   PMCU, especially with respect to M&E and processing of contracts and appointments;
   diversion of resources to the old iBAS system; and lack of GoB commitment to
   important parts of the reform agenda.

6. Lessons Learned

Project Specific Lessons

105. The Project goals could have been less ambitious, more prioritized and
   sequenced, and better informed by previous projects and known capacity
   constraints. Although the Project was generally aligned with the Government’s PFM
   reform strategy, developed in 2006, the number and intensity of activities was much
   greater than had been attempted under either of the previous PFM reform projects,
   RIBEC and FMRP. Simplifying the objectives at the outset, or later during the
   restructuring, might have improved the chances of success. Attempting to cover a wide
   range of PFM reforms under a single 5-year project with 9 components was not realistic
   and sufficiently adapted to the country and capacity context. Greater attention to
   “getting the basics right” could potentially have helped gather the reform champions
   and focused scarce capacity on a narrower set of activities.

106. More effective consultation with Government about their priorities and more
   active questioning of paper commitments would also likely have led to a less
   ambitious project. This could have avoided problems of lack of ownership and
   increased the chances of success. Interviews with Government officials indicated that
   they did not subscribe to many of the major reforms envisaged in the Project, which
   were then not implemented. These included a major upgrade of the FMIS system,
   performance oriented budgeting and internal audit. Similarly, a better understanding of
   stakeholder preferences, including of FD and PC priorities, might have informed
   Project design and potentially reduced some implementation challenges.

107. The consequences of the lack of a results framework, and results chain analysis
   was evident in the design and implementation. In the absence of a more logical
   explanation of why the PFM reforms were being prioritized the links between activities
   to the objectives were ill defined. In fact, there was analysis to hand (for example the
   Public Expenditue and Instiutitonal Review) that could have helped the team at the
   design stage to focus on the more binding constraints of the PFM system to service
   delivery. By including such a large number of activities, the emphasis on what was
   needed to have better alignment of resource allocation and financial accountability was
   lost. Furthermore the incomplete Results Framework did not service the Project well,
   as even now it is difficult to report against the indicators, the indicators are not closely
   aligned to the activities in some cases, and at the PDO level the indicators themselves
   had a number of external reasons for them being met or not met, for example, the
   deviation between the debt to GDP or deficit to GDP ratios at the start and the end of
   the financial year.5

108. Greater use could have been made of the available TF resources to supplement
   the technical knowledge of the task team, especially to provide more intensive
   oversight of critical activities. Additional funds had been committed by donors but
   were unutilized. These could have been usefully deployed, for example, to quality
   assure key outputs, usch as the macro forecasting model that was rejected by the MOF
   staff and by the Bank as too generic. Similarly, additional ICT specialist inputs could
   have been helpful in following up on the advice offered by the Bank’s ICT specialists
   during implementation support missions, helping for example to reach decisions on the
   overall approach to FMIS development or strengthening management and oversight of
   the main consultant’s activities. Additional support to Government on the IT aspects
   could have resulted also in a clearer understanding and appreciation of the extent of the
   progress made, or not made, in developing IBAS. It was an unwelcome surprise to
   Bank management for example to discover in 2014 how much work remained to be
   done on IBAS++, indicating that an extension of more than two years would be
   necessary to fully implement iBAS++. This contributed to the decision not to extend
   the Project.

109. More up front work to clarify the PFM IT strategy, system architecture and
   user requirements, is advised before committing large amounts of funding to a
   FMIS Project. In this case there was lack of clarity with respect to the basic strategy,
   with the result that it was not until more than two years after the Project had started,
   that the IT strategy was agreed. The PAD was notably unclear with respect to the


5
 For instance, if the debt management activities were introduced as a result of the analysis that indicated
(despite low overall debt to GDP ratios) that debt service was crowding out fiscal space (debt service was
becoming close to the size of the education budget in 2008); then the indicator should have been debt service
as a percent of the budget; rather than debt to GDP ratios.




                                                     33
   strategy for development of an integrated financial management system. This allowed
   the Government to maintain its expectation that the Project would achieve this goal
   through incremental improvements to the existing iBAS system while the World
   Bank’s expectation was that GoB would replace the iBAS with a COTS solution.

110. Allowing the normal rules preventing officials being hired as consultants to be
   circumvented carries significant risks. In this case the situation arose partly because
   it was an established practice inherited from previous projects and partly because
   because the Bank paid insufficient attention to the contract details at the time it was
   agreed. Correcting the mistake during project implementation then resulted in damage
   to the relationship of trust between the Government and the World Bank. It also limited
   the Government’s independence and objectivity in respect of the consultants’
   performance and vice versa.

General Lessons

111. Alternative instruments, including multiple projects, a programmatic
   approach, or result-based financing, could be considered. An option to keep
   projects supporting a larger reform agenda manageable could be to divide activities
   into more than one operation which could be implemented either in parallel or as a
   programmatic approach or series of projects. As a general rule, if there is an “and” in
   the PDO, the rationale for two separate projects can sometimes be stronger. In this case,
   for instance, a project for deepening the MTBF and a project for strengthening financial
   accountability might have been easier for the Bank and the GoB to manage. Another
   instrument to consider could be result-based financing combining incentives in the
   form of result-based financing based on Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) with
   technical assistance to support the client reach the objectives. Result-based
   arrangement could also strengthen the alignment between disbursements and outcomes.

112. The use of larger contracts can represent both advantages and risks. The
   project relied on one very large time based contract ($43 m) to provide almost all the
   technical inputs. On the one hand, a consolidation of the procurement plan into fewer
   contracts can provide operational benefits in contexts where a high number of
   procurement processes may overburden limited procurement capacities. It can also help
   ensure more effective coordination of inputs and reduce the risk of conflicting advice.
   On the other hand, larger contracts can result in a concentration of risks in cases where
   the selected contractor may face challenges in attracting and retaining adequate
   expertise to cover all areas covered by the contract. Such risks may be higher in cases
   when several different specialized skills are required combined with a challenge to
   attract and retain these skills on the ground.

113. The appropriateness of time-based contracts has to be evaluated carefully. The
   main MISC contract was time (or input)-based rather than output based. While time-
   based contracts may be appropriate options in cases where few implementation
   challenges are expected, they can represent significant disadvantages in other contexts.
   In particular, they can limit the client’s capacity for quality control if the mechanisms



                                            34
   in place for ensuring value for money are not sufficiently strong. This can weaken the
   link between disbursements and outputs and the overall efficiency of an operation.

114. Where there is uncertainty on basic aspects of the design of major IT
   applications such as FMIS large amounts of funding should not be committed to
   implementation. Where the IT strategy, system architecture and user requirements are
   not defined, the Bank could use a two-stage approach. Stage one would focus on
   completing redesign of business processes, development of the IT strategy, design of
   the system architecture, specification of user requirements, preparation of bidding
   documents and securing a consensus amongst key users. Once this design work is done,
   the Bank could support implementation with a relatively quick disbursing grant/loan to
   cover the development of software, the purchase and installation of hardware, system
   acceptance testing and user training.

115. More  importance should be attached to upgrades of legacy systems and interim
   IT solutions. Given the long gestation period of most FMIS projects it is unrealistic to
   expect governments not to continue to invest in upgrading and expanding existing
   systems. SPEMP-A spent significant sums on upgrading and expanding the IBAS
   system (see Table 3), although this was not well reflected in the results framework.
   The Bank could also support the development of interim (low-tech) solutions (either
   off the shelf or bespoke) in areas such as fixed asset management, commitment control
   and payroll. This could deliver improvements in financial management and aid
   transition to IFMIS, by cleaning up and reconciling the basic data, improving control
   and reporting, and training users in the use of ICT. All of these steps should aid
   transition to the new system and reduce the project risks. In this Project, some progress
   was achieved in the area of payroll and pensions, but this could have been taken further.


116. Successfully designing and implementing such complex PFM projects requires
   that key team members have strong Bank operational experience, combined with
   technical and local knowledge. Strong Bank operational skills are a a critical factor
   contributing to both a solid Project design and the ability to take effective corrective
   action, within the constraints of the Bank’s institutional arrangements, policies,
   procedures, and instruments. In this case the operational experience of the team was
   limited and were not sufficienty compensated by management oversight and support.

117. Multi-donor trust funds can be difficult to manage and require strong
   coordination to manage the expectations and demands of a diverse set of donors.
   While desirable to enhance donor coordination, MDTF-arrangements can also enhance
   the complexity of operations. At the design stage of multi-donor operations and in order
   to keep an operation manageable, measures could be taken to ensure an adequate level
   of selectivity of project activities. For instance, this could be achieved by seeking a
   donor agreement to put less funding on the table up front, but with the promise of
   additional funds once key decisions have been taken. In addition, multi-donor
   operations require strong and effective coordination and communication mechanisms
   among donors and the Government throughout the project cycle. Task teams benefit
   from planning adequate time and resources to ensure this important function.

Component 1. Strategic Policy, Planning and Budget Management

1.1 Macro Fiscal Policy and Management

Rating: Unsatisfactory

This sub-component aimed at provision of support to the FD capacity for developing
capacities for macro-fiscal forecasting and analysis, and fiscal policy management7.

The intermediate result indicator measured by the deviation between the forecast and
actual outturn for two key macro-fiscal performance indicators (budget deficit to
GDP and debt to GDP ratio) was achieved for one of the two sub-indicators, but there
are many exogenous factors that might have affected the indicator . The deviation
between the forecast and actual budget deficit to GDP ratio met the target of +/- 0.8 percent
of GDP in FY13 The deviation between the forecast and actual debt to GDP ratio was well
below the targeted of +/– 1.0 percent of GDP in FY13, and is unlikely to improve
considerably in FY14. The deviation between the forecasted and actual values was to be
reduced through building the capacities of the Macroeconomic Wing (MEW) of the FD
largely by replacing the existing spreadsheet model by a new macro-fiscal forecasting
model. However, since the macroeconomic forecasts were made based on the pre-existing
spreadsheet model, the results may be partially attributed to the Project.

(MTMF) and the budgeting process. The macroeconomic forecasting model developed by
the MISC was first approved by the Bank’s team, but then admitted not to be suitable. The
macro-fiscal forecasting model that was developed by the consultant, was not used by the
MEW to formulate the MTMF due to a number of deficiencies identified by the core
macroeconomic modelling team at the MEW (static rather than dynamic modelling,
unconventional dummy estimates, manipulative nature of the model, unsatisfactory
estimation results, etc.) and their concern about the credibility of the results. The recent
decision by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics to change the base year of National Income
Accounts series from early 1990s to 2005/2006 has also undermined the confidence in the
model, which requires sufficiently long time series to produce reliable forecasts.

There are a number of factors common to the overall Project implementation that
hindered the production of a reliable model, including frequent changes of
consultants, lack of consensus on the model type from the beginning, insufficient
beneficiary capacities to assess the quality of deliverables on time and affect the
outcome. Frequent changes in macro-economic advisors and modelling consultants caused
substantive delays in deliverables. Conflict of opinions between the consultants and the
MEW, and limited capacity of the FD to influence the modelling design led to the
development of two models, both of which were not accepted by the MEW as operational.
It also took long MEW before it could prioritize activities under the building macro-fiscal
policy and analysis subcomponent. The outcome may have been different, would the MEW
staff worked closely with the consultant at the stage of the model development and the
World Bank team provided technical oversight to ensure the quality and adequacy of the
model.

A software-driven macroeconomic database, a unified electronic repository of key
macroeconomic data required for macro-fiscal modeling and macroeconomic
reporting, is operational, but has not reached the point of sustainability. Systematic
maintenance and need for monthly updating is difficult with given resources. Data needs
to be collected from a number of government agencies besides FD (BSS, BB, NRB, ERD),
while an inter-face for automatic data transfer is established only for the BB. Additional
funds beyond the Project will be needed to establish digital interface with other agencies
for the routine sharing of macroeconomic data, and appropriate management arrangements
are required to ensure the sustainability of the database.

A positive outcome of the sub-component was the creation of a core modelling team
under the MEW and its capacity building through training courses on applied
econometrics and time series techniques. The team now feels confident in using Project
purchased E-views software and plans to develop a new model (or revise the previous one).
However the team still requires technical assistance from the World Bank staff in ensuring
the robustness of the new model. Retaining of core modelling staff within the MEW is also
a critical issue. Another core output is the gathering of a large database of the required
macroeconomic indicators needed for macroeconomic forecasting. The development of
reliable historic data has been a positive output from this component.

Macro-fiscal policy and analysis capacities were strengthened through deepening and
extending the macroeconomic and fiscal analysis in the Medium Term Budgetary
Framework (MTBF) document presented with the annual budget, which was replaced by
a separate document “Medium Term Macroeconomic Policy Statement” in 2013 as
required by Public Money and Budget Management Act (PMBM). Formats of an enhanced
monthly macroeconomic monitoring report and monthly fiscal monitoring reports were
developed and used for the first time in 2014.

1.2 Debt, Treasury and Cash Management

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Debt Management

The sub-component’s objective was to strengthen the Recipient’s structures, processes and
skills to manage its debt obligations more effectively, more particularly in, inter alia: (a)
improving governance, coordination and monitoring mechanisms among all its agencies
dealing with debt management; (b) building capacity for preparation of the debt strategy,
debt policy formulation, data recording and analysis resource and debt management; (c)
building capacity to manage contingent liabilities; and (d) strengthening the regulatory
framework for public borrowing.

   (a) improving governance, coordination and monitoring mechanisms among all its agencies dealing
       with debt management

This was to be achieved through the installation of the Debt Management and Financial
Analysis System version 6.0 (DMFAS 6) in all related debt management entities. The MoF
has been using the DMFAS since 1996 for external debt management. The latest version
(DMFAS 6.0) was to support front, middle and back office operations in all debt
management entities. Fully operational DMFAS 6.0 would have allowed for integrated
coordination and monitoring of external, public and private debt data.

The DMFAS 6 is now operational in FABA, FD and BB, but not in ERD. The whole
picture on external and domestic debt data is not yet available, as the interface solutions
between the DMFAS 6.0 and BB’s MI module and IBAS were not completed. The
interface with BB is needed to ensure continual and smooth flow of data on domestic debt
from BB to DMFAS 6.

Many of the planned activities on DMFAS 6 (activation, developing interface and
training) were not accomplished by the date of Project closure, as the team had
anticipated the extension of the Project and scheduled many of the activities to be delivered
by December, 2014. Decision on non-extension and closure of the Project came late and
the debt entities were left out with only partially operational DMFAS 6. ERD found itself
in the worst position, as the previous version of DMFAS used since 2002-2003 for external
debt data, had stopped getting updates, while the new DMFAS 6 was not yet ready to
replace the previous version. ERD has reportedly gone back to record all data in Excel
datasheet.

       (b) building capacity for preparation of the debt strategy, debt policy formulation, data recording and
           analysis resource and debt management

Debt management capacities were strengthened through the establishment of a multi-
disciplinary working group of staff from MEW, FD, FABA and BB, who received
extensive training on DSA formulation and has prepared DSA with end-June 2012 data.
The sustainability of the DSA now largely depends on DMFAS 6, as the next update of the
DSA is recommended to source data from DMFAS 6. Retaining of staff who received DSA
training is also an issue, and if both conditions do not hold the sustainability of the
capacities to prepare DSA is highly questionable.

A Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) was approved by the Minister
of Finance in 2014. The MTDS was developed by a multi-disciplinary group (the same as
for DSA), which benefited from training on Bank-Fund MTDS toolkit. MTDS is critical in
informing policy decisions while framing the annual borrowing plan and issuance calendar.

Delayed development and approval of the MTDS hampered the achievement of the
intermediate results indicator related to debt reporting on time. The debt entities will
now need to prepare quarterly and annual reports that include an evaluation of how the
borrowings and other debt-related transactions have complied with the requirements set in
the MTDS.

2014 and the respected guidelines approved by the Finance Minister on July 31, 2014.

Contingent liabilities database could not be completed to the full extent, as FD holds
information of the “issued amount”, while the actual outstanding are not available as the
SOEs do not report back to FD on how much have been repaid.

A concept paper on the rules, policies and guidelines for public debt management by the
Government of Bangladesh was prepared, but was not formally approved by FD.

Cash Management

The sub-component also aimed at supporting the Recipient in the establishment of a sound
and coherent system of treasury, cash and debt management, by inter alia: (a) reviewing
treasury functions; (b) designing, testing and implementation of a preliminary module for
cash management; (c) installing of the requisite systems either as: (i) an interface or (ii) an
added functionality, to the integrated budget and accounting system; (d) improving treasury
and cash management; and establishing liquidity planning tools.

       (a) reviewing treasury functions

Three reports were prepared in 2012 reviewing treasury functions and providing
recommendations on – 1) Report outlining current processes and systems relating to cash
forecasting and Treasury Single Account; 2) Report on building capacity for management
of financial assets; 3) Report on strategies for improving government capacity for treasury
and cash management.

       (b) designing, testing and implementation of a preliminary module for cash management, and (c)
       installing of the requisite systems either as: (i) an interface or (ii) an added functionality, to the
       integrated budget and accounting system

This was to be achieved through the development of a Treasury and Cash
Management Module within iBAS and Budget Execution and Transactions modules
in iBAS++, which were not ready at the time of Project closure (more details in the
Component 2). Software to systematically record government shares and equities has not
been completed as well.

Software has been developed to extract past receipts and payments from iBAS for use
by Line Ministries in preparing the cash forecast. However, the capacities of Line
Ministries are still need to be strengthened to use the software. A budget implementation
plan module has been added to the existing IBAS; this module captures cash inflows and
outflows, as well as borrowing requirements and has the potential to help line ministries in
their cash management. However, this module is being used in some but not all line
ministries. Moreover, the accounting offices are still keeping all records in paper form for
verification, and some of the line ministry offices (e.g., Health, Education) are using
parallel systems for specific reporting needs.

       (d) improving treasury and cash management; and establishing liquidity planning tools

Cash plans were introduced as a liquidity planning tool, but they are calculated on a
quarterly basis not on a monthly basis, as planned in the revised results framework.
Original thinking was to introduce cash balances calculated daily, which proved to be not
feasible in the absence of a complete TSA and FMIS. Therefore monthly cash plans were




                                                   44
defined as an intermediate state towards achieveing the original target. The guidelines for
the preparation of annual cash plans were developed under the Project in FY13, and they
are awaiting approval by FD. Cash plans for four quarters of FY14 were prepared and
submitted to the Treasury and Debt Management Wing (TDMW). However, the cash plans
were mostly prepared by the Project team using a top-down approach. Getting quality
bottom-up information from line ministries on cash requirements forecasts still remains an
issue. Capacities in line ministries were overburdened by the MTBF process and therefore
not able to place sufficient focus on monitoring of budget implementation and cash
requirements. Collecting bottom-up from line ministries also largely dependent on the new
iBAS’s commitment module, this has not fully developed by the time of Project closure.

The cash-forecasting model expected to be developed by the Project was not delivered.
There was a continuous disagreement between the Project team and the TDMW on the
sourcing of information for the model – the Project team recommended to base it on
Treasury Single Account, whereas the TDMW inclined to use iBAS. In the end, TDMW
has developed its own model.

An Annual Report on government investment in shares and equities prepared and is under
process of approval by the Minister of Finance. Database for government shares and
equities developed, but the software is not ready yet.

       (b) strengthening poverty and gender budgeting;

One of the few areas where the Project reached its targets was with regard to the
formulation of gender budget reports. Gender budget reports for 40 LMs, and were
published in the FY15 budget. The guidelines on gender budgeting were further enhanced
and re-issued. A model gender budget report for the Ministry of Youth and Sports based
on the gender responsive budget guidelines was developed. However, gender budgeting
still has a mostly reporting function and it needs to develop into an instrument of a pro-
active planning. No records or references were found related to poverty budgeting.

       (c) strengthening budget and accounts classification;

The revised budget classification and Chart of Accounts were developed but not
formally approved during the Project. This was addressed by the Component 2.1.3
Government officials also criticized the Bank’s role in evaluating the work of consultants
and major Project outputs. They argued that the team could have been more proactive, or
brought additional skills to bear, when monitoring the quality of consultants provided by
MISC and their outputs.
       (d) strengthening central monitoring and evaluation of budget implementation

At the start of the Project the FD oversight was mainly focused on budget processes
and compliance with the budget calendar. There was no systematic and regular financial
reporting by Line Ministries and no performance reporting against KPIs and output
indicators. FD’s capacities were constrained to monitor the quality of submissions and
provide feedback to spending entities.

By the end of the Project 29 out of 59 line ministries submitted quarterly financial
management reports (QFMRs) 9 based on new guidelines and associated forms for


9
 According to the reporting in the Implementation and Support reports, over 80 percent of LMs submitted
QFMRs for Q2 and Q3, less for Q1 and Q4.

preparation of Budget Implementation Plans and QFMRs approved in 2013 . The
verification on the quality of the submissions is being undertaken by Finance Division,
which was strengthened by additional 6 budget officers and managers to enable more effort
on monitoring of budget implementation. There are still issues about the quality and
timeliness of quarterly reports, including limited capacities and skills in Line Ministries
and Agencies. A special training course was delivered to all Line Ministries under the
Component 3, but developing and institutionalizing the appropriate skills will take some
time.

Although progress was made towards the introduction of Annual Performance
Reviews as part of the budget cycle, the second PDO indicator target for FY 14 was
not met. Two ministries (Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare) submitted Annual Performance Reports (APRs) for the period FY12 to Finance
Division on October 9, 2013. Revised guidelines and formats of the APR for FY13 were
prepared and issued by Finance Division on March 3, 2014. Three additional line ministries
(Ministry of Primary and Mass Education, the Power Division and Ministry of Agriculture)
started work on preparing Annual Performance Reports (of FY13 performance) but had
not submitted APRs by the end of the Project.

    (e) strengthening capacity to play a developmental role on the internal audit function in line ministries

Internal Audit Cell has been formally established within FD and an organogram and
ToR for the Cell have been developed, but the Cell is not operational yet . As staffing
of the Cell will follow Government’s existing service rules, the Ministry of Public
Administration has been approached for recruitment of staff. The internal Audit manual
prepared by the Project has been approved by FD and the Ministry of Public Works has
been identified for implementation of internal audit guided by the new manual.




                                                    48
The second objective of the sub-component was to develop capacity in line ministries by
inter alia: (a) rolling out a more policy oriented budget processes to all line ministries; and
(b) developing institutional processes and administrative structures and capacities in line
ministries to enable them to implement effective internal controls, manage resources and
achieve results in line with policies.

This objective is measured by the first PDO level composite indicator, which was not
achieved . The indicator is composed of three sub-indicators, of which one achieved, and
one achieved partially. The composite nature of the indicator makes it difficult to assess
the overall success of the PDO level indicator.

One of the Project’s successes is the roll out of MTBF to all line ministries using the
unified budget format (Sub-indicator 1.3). However, the MTBFs are not yet based on
Forward Baseline Estimates, which would have allowed for reliable estimate of budget
ceilings (Sub-indicator 1.2). The Forward Baseline Estimate (FBE) guidelines were

prepared and presented at a workshop held on September 28, 2013. The guidelines were
updated, incorporating recommendations received at the workshop and from a Bank-
commissioned review, but not finalized. The FD had expressed its intent to hold another
workshop, post Project closing, to finalize the guidelines, which at time of reporting have
not taken place. Therefore, FBEs will not be introduced before FY 16. The dual budgeting
practice with development budgets being the responsibility of Planning Commission and
recurrent budgets run by Line Ministries also undermines the realistic budgeting practice.
The quality of MTBFs considerably vary among Line Ministries pointing to the need for
extensive capacity building activities; this is agreed to be provided through the Bank
executed TA in 2015.

Only one MTBF (Ministry of Agriculture) is based on Medium Term Strategic
Business Plan (MTSBP) compared to targeted 5 in FY14. MTSBPs for other four Line
Ministries (Power Division, Local Government Division, Ministry of Education and
Ministry of Social Welfare) are in draft status. A revised draft guidance note on introducing
MTSBPs has been prepared. The technical committee in principle agreed to the Power
Division’s MTSBP at a meeting on April 10, 2014. A second revised draft of the MTSBP
of the Local Government Division was prepared with the help of a consultant and the
MTSBP for the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social Welfare is at an initial stage.

The target of introduction of a program budget structure was dropped over the
course of the Project; this is justified from prioritization and sequencing point of view.

The targets for institutionalizing the MTBF Line Ministries were partly achieved.
The core budget management institutions (the Budget Management Wings or Branches,
the Budget Working Groups and the Budget Management Committees) have been
established in all Line Ministries. However, most do not yet perform all of the functions
that were outlined in the terms of reference (TORs) for these institutions that were issued
by the Finance Division. By the time of Project closure budget management institutions
were mostly performing task of budget preparation, while budget monitoring and control
over execution remained to be of low priority. Standardized formats for Budget
Management Committees and Budget Working Group working papers have been
developed but have not been adopted or issued. The Finance Division has decided to
arrange quarterly meeting with Budget Management Wings/ Branches (BMW/B’s) in order
to strengthen FDs monitoring and guidance of LMs to make BMWs fully operational.

1.5 Legal and Regulatory

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Under sub-component 1.5 support to the Recipient’s regulatory reforms in public financial
management was envisaged, including inter alia: (a) implementing a Public Money and
Budget Management Act (PMBMA); and (b) reviewing and revising the general financial
rules, including treasury rules and accounts codes.

Little progress was made toward Intermediate Result 1.5 – PFM Legal and regulatory
Reforms Achieved. The GFR and Treasury Rules have not been fully revised to make
them consistent with the 2009 Public Money and Budget Management Act and modern
financial management practices. The revision of the Treasury Rules, which was supposed
to have been completed by the end of FY14, was postponed by FD. The revised GFRs
have been drafted under SPEMP A, but were not approved and promulgated. Three
guidelines or circulars have been issued on: (a) financial reporting under MTBF, (b) budget
management wings to be constituted in all LMs, and (c) internal audit. A fourth circular,
related to the creation of a Financial Management Group of 200 staff to work in LMs and
Finance Division, a cadre controlled by the Finance Division, was not completed by end
of the Project.

Component 2: Public Financial Systems

The Project, as originally designed, contained two components related to the development

modernization of the treasury and cash management systems (A.6 US$19.3m). The

objective of Component A5 was quite broadly stated as “to build on the present iBAS
platform and establish key elements of a fully functional GFMIS (including integration of
budgeting and accounting functions), with the objective of supporting more informed fiscal
and financial decision making. Planned activities under component A5 comprised:

         Improving the quality of accounts and the timeliness and reliability of financial
          reports.
         Reengineering existing business processes and procedures applying international
          standards (IPSAS and GFS 2001).
         Improving the Chart of Accounts and the quality and format of financial reports,
          including incorporation (i.e. consolidation) of departmentalized accounting entities.
         Developing the internal capacity to manage the systems and accounting and
          financial reporting in government in conjunction with a wide range of outputs from
          other SPEMP projects.

The objective of Component A6 was to establish the basis for a sound and coherent system
of treasury cash and debt management The main activities planned were to review treasury
functions with the objective of prioritizing actions under linked Project components and to
design test and implement a cash management module. A set of activities were also
identified as necessary to meet the objectives, in particular:

         Interface between the cash management module and iBAS.
         Implementation of an IFMIS.
         Interface between IFMIS with government Banks.
         Interface with reliable debt, macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting.

The start of FMIS development did not begin until two years after the start of the Project.
This delay resulted initially from the time taken to make the project effective and then to
contract and mobilize the consultants (MISC’s contract was signed in April 2010, and the
main team mobilized between June a d October 2010) and second due to a lengthy debate
(lasting around 1 year) over the IT strategy. The Government wanted to incrementally
develop iBAS, based on the existing software, while MISC, supported by the Bank made
the case for replacing iBAS with a COTS solution.

Several reports were commissioned in 201011 and 2011 to look into the options for further
development of iBAS. These were consistent in concluding that the existing iBAS was
unsuitable as the basis on which to develop a fully integrated FMIS. Nevertheless in
looking at alternative options the Ministry of Finance remained convinced that a
customized off the shelf solution was not suitable and that an iBAS+ system could be built
by combining an improved and expanded version of iBAS with commercial software
modules In the fall of 2011 the Bank team commented that building iBAS+ as a fully

integrated financial management information system was unlikely to be achievable during
the lifetime of the Project due to:

      the complexity of  a hybrid solution involving both bespoke and COTS modules,
      the need to redesign business processes before developing the technical
       specifications and
      the ongoing challenge of integrating internal and external expertise.

As early as 2011, it was apparent that the Finance Department and the consultants were in
fundamental disagreement regarding the approach, and communications had largely
broken down. The Bank team commented on the lack of sufficient discussion and
consensus between internal and external experts, with the result that none of the diagnostic
reports could be considered a blueprint for action. The Bank team also emphasized the
need to introduce much better quality management and assurance processes, observing that
this had contributed to significant problems with iBAS in the areas of security,
documentation, audit trail, reliability and performance.

In the period from 2011 to 2012 the Project underwent a major restructuring, which tried
to address the problems related to the development of iBAS. The Bank’s ICT expert
became closely involved in working out a solution and held a series of workshops with FD
officials designed to clarify the overall strategy. In 2011 a consensus was reached that the
existing iBAS could not support the additional functionality required by the government,
and that a new bespoke system should be developed to replace iBAS, rather than a COTS.
It was also accepted that, apart from the adoption of GFS 2001 and IPSAS cash accounting
standard, no major reengineering of business processes was foreseen. However it was not
until 2012 that the functionality of the new iBAS++ system was agreed.

The 2012 restructuring created a new Component 2 (Public Financial Systems) with two
subcomponents. Sub-component 1 (: Improving Accounting and Financial Reporting)
was comprised of 4 sub-activities incorporating the development of the new iBAS+ system
and related changes in budgeting and accounting policies and procedures. These were as
follows:

       2.1.1 Development of the GFMIS (i.e. implementation of iBAS+)
       2.1.2 Development of accounting procedures and standards (i.e. adoption of
       IPSAS cash accounting standard)
       2.1.3 Strengthening budget/accounts classification and fiscal reporting (consistent
       with COFOG and GFS 2001)
       2.1.4 Self Accounting (Departmentalized Accounting) Entities (i.e. supporting
       consolidation of the accounts of non-core units of government, SOEs etc.)

2.1.1 Improving Accounting and Financial Reporting

Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory




                                            53
This component aimed at improving the accounting and financial reporting, through the
introduction of an integrated financial management system and the adoption of a modern
accounts classification system.

The objective of enhancing the functionality of IBAS and applying it across
government was not achieved. The replacement IBAS++ system is still under
development and the prospects for successful implementation remain unclear. The
development of IBAS++ did not keep pace with the original Project schedule and as such
the targets have not been achieved.

Consensus on the new IT strategy and on the functionality of the system was captured
in the Aide Memoire of (July 2012). However, it should be noted that the Government
did not formally record its agreement in the form of an IT strategy or similar document,
and the requirements continued to be modified.

The Project did make improvements to the existing iBAS system. These helped to
stabilize the system and improve its operational performance in the following ways:

      Hardware upgrades were installed and operational response time was improved,
      Coverage of the iBAS system was extended to line ministries, districts and to 320
       Upazilla Accounting Offices.
      Account integrity was improved through introduction of reconciliation process
       (cheques and challans), a trial balance and Last Pay Certificates,
      New system security features and business continuity arrangements were
       introduced
      New software was developed for electronic fund transfer (EFT) allowing
       paperless, rapid payments to employees, pensioners and suppliers. This has been
       implemented in Dhaka for officers’ payroll.
      New software was developed for SAE accounting (implemented in the Public
       Works Department).
      Software was developed for preparation of BCC1.
      In addition, budget validation has been implemented in iBAS for all DAOs and
       UAOs.

A technical review by the iBAS++ development team indicated that the required redesign
of the system would involve a larger effort than previously envisioned. The Bank
recommended that FD management and donors defer all non-essential requests for change
or improvement of iBAS so as not to divert resources needed for iBAS++ development
work. They also recommended a number of additional urgent steps needed to support
iBAS++ development including:

      recruitment of 7 additional programmers/analysts for system development,
      detailed implementation planning, including costs, staffing etc.,
      strengthening the ICT organization and capacity within Government,
      planning for space and infrastructure to support a much expanded system and



                                          54
       introduction of quality management systems, especially important given GoB’s
        decision to develop the software rather than buying a COTS solution.

During 2013 and 2014 progress in developing the new system continued to be slow.
There was still uncertainty regarding the final system requirements, as FD gradually
reduced the scope of the system (for example dropping commitment control). There were
delays in selection and appointment of consultants, and lack of decision making on key
system documents developed by the consultants, which required sign off. The chart of
accounts, which is core to the development of any FMIS, was developed but not approved.

The mid-term review of the Project, which took place in 2013, concluded that
although there was considerable momentum in system development there was little
chance of it being implemented within the original Project timetable. The MTR
recommended that the Project be extended for a further two years to allow the system to
be implemented, and the Bank team and the consultants readjusted their expectations and
a substantial amount of their efforts towards the design of a two year extension.

In the early months of 2014 Bank management, faced with an imminent decision on
whether or not to extend the Project, and concerned about the continued slow
progress, commissioned a new team of ICT consultants to review the status of the
iBAS implementation. The resulting report was critical in persuading the Bank
management to recommend closure of the Project. It reported:
   Limited Government ownership and involvement, including lack of clarity on
    objectives of iBAS++; and absence of authorization and clear decision-making on
    system development.
   Significant delays in system development, with less than 10 percent of software code
    written; modules described as completed not running properly, poor design documents
    and delays in installing critical.
   Unrealistic implementation strategy, including unrealistic timelines, lack of
    information on data clean-up and migration, and gaps in in critical diagnostics.
   Inadequate Project Management, including lack of technical leadership, insufficient
    focus on ‘soft’ factors of information system, i.e. people and processes; and failure to
    follow-up on advice given during previous supervision missions.
   Poor documentation, including outdated functional specifications and Inconsistencies
    between and within design documents.
The report concluded that, even with a two year extension, it was unlikely that the system
would be successfully implemented.

At the end of the Project, functional requirements had been specified for five modules
of the new system (the general ledger, budget classification, budget preparation,
security and system configuration). System design documents had also been prepared for
classification, security, general ledger and budget preparation. Software development had
been significantly advanced for classification, security and budget preparation. Without a
fully functional iBAS the targets for this component could not be reached, since the

preparation of cash-based IPSAS compliant reports or GFS reports could not be prepared
using the existing system. Software development has continued although Project support
ended on July 31, 2014. Two of the modules have been developed and tested (security and
classification), two other modules are being developed (budget preparation and general
ledger), and the remaining four modules (budget execution, transactions, reporting, system
configuration) are pending.

2.1.2 Development of accounting procedures and standards (i.e. adoption of IPSAS
cash accounting standard)

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The objective of preparing financial statements based on IPSAS cash accounting
standards was not achieved. Preparation of course materials for training on the new Chart
of Accounts, budget classification and IBAS++ continued until June 2014, but given these
were not formally adopted in time, the training targets set for FY14 were not achieved.
Training needs of LMs on the budget and account classification were identified and a
number of training sessions held with each ministry. Drafting of the accounting procedures
and operations manual, however was not completed by the end of the Project and the
proposed training did not take place. The final mapping of the BACS economic segment
to the Cash IPSAS Financial Statements is to be completed once BACS is completed.
Implementation is also dependent on implementation of iBAS++.

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The Project met its goals with respect to systems for Payroll, Pensions, Loans and
Advances and Government Provident Fund only to a very limited extent. The original
objective of this component of the Project (Component 8 in the original design) was to
carry out diagnostic studies in preparation for the eventual automation of payroll, pensions,
loans and advances and the Government Provident Fund., as part of an expanded GFMIS
system, addressing some specific issues in each of these areas. The Project did not envisage
that additional modules of GFMIS would be developed to capture financial transactions in
these areas. Specific activities envisaged under the Project included:




                                             58
Compared to the original list of activities the actual achievements under this component
were limited, although they provide foundations for future improvements in PFM. The
government has started to build the employee and pensioner databases as the first step and
about 80 percent of both databases are complete. This was an important step towards
automating these functions and, in the process data is being cleaned up and ghosts removed.
In both cases the database design and testing has been completed and the process is
underway to collect and clean up the data, in collaboration with ministries, local
governments etc.

people trained was only a little more than half the targets set in 2012. Although this is as
much as could reasonably have been delivered, given that the reforms requiring the biggest
training input (i.e. adoption of the new Chart of Accounts and roll out of the new iBAS++)
were not achieved. The relevance and quality of the training, as measured using standard




                                            59
feedback questionnaires exceeded the targets set for the Project. Considerable effort was
devoted to monitoring the quality and relevance of training, using an established
international methodology. An objective assessment of the relevance of the PFM training
to the Project goals is an unanswered question. (economic efficiency) Arguably the
training that was delivered, including ACCA training, overseas scholarships etc. was less
well aligned with the PDOs than the planned training raising the question of economic
efficiency.

The Project was successful in institutionalizing 3 of the 4 Levels of Kirkpatrick’s
Training Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. (The Level 3 (transfer/utilization of
training) evaluation report was completed in the second quarter of FY14 and shared with
relevant stakeholders to take steps to ensure best use of the trained officials.) Targets set
regarding the percentage of participants reporting positive training outcomes had also been
achieved. Assessments done by the Project team using Level-1 and Level-2 of
Kirkpatrick’s evaluation framework showed that over 90 percent of participants think that
the training activities were valuable to them and that their learning had been in line with
the objectives of the training event. The pace of instruction was rated “just right” by 86
percent of trainees and instructor performance rated “excellent” by 79 percent and
“satisfactory” by 20 percent of trainees. FY13 and FY14 targets for the number of PFM
training days were exceeded—with 16,913 days of training carried out against a target of
1,400—including participation in study tours, foreign courses, e-training, workshops and
seminars, and Masters Studies

The Project achieved very limited progress towards the objective of establishing a
national PFM training institution on a long term sustainable basis. The order setting
up of the IPF was approved by the Minister in 2012, and the former Public Finance
Foundation (PFF), a research organization under the MoF, was merged into the IPF as its
research wing. In FY14 the IPF was established as a legal entity and the first governing
council meeting was held in March 2014. A transition plan to transfer training functions to
the IPF has been developed. However, the full complement of staff for the IPF is yet to be
recruited and the cadre of training specialists has not been established. An agreement has
been reached with FD regarding the role of the proposed online PFM journal and is
awaiting the appointment of an editorial board. A Training Management Information
System was established in FY13 (with one year delay) and will be used to record
information on training participants. So far, information on 4,500 training participants has
been entered into the system and reports can be generated electronically. The IPF staffs
have been trained in using the system. An Evaluation Handbook has also been completed
which is intended to provide guidance to IPF staff on monitoring and evaluating training
activities.

Sustainable financing of the IPF through demand for training is the main threat to
IPF sustainability. The IPF is open to receive funds from both government and external
agencies and the 2014-15 budget allocated 20 crore taka to IPF as an endowment. Despite
this progress, the sustainability of IPF future of IPF is not assured, mainly because IPF was
expecting the Project to finance training for another two years. A transition plan was
developed late in the life of the Project, but this envisaged IPF assuming responsibility only

as a domestically financed institution.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project was expected to strengthen instruments of fiscal control, provide the means to
ensure effective implementation of budget allocations and greater transparency in
government’s financial management. Improving the expenditure management system and
streamlining associated budget preparation and implementation procedures would result in
more effective management of government’s financial resources and greater efficiency in
government budgetary transactions.
      Better expenditure controls were expected to generate financial benefits, in terms
       of reduced leakage in public expenditures,
      Improved cash management was to reduce idle cash resources thereby lowering
       cash flow and financing costs
      Economic benefits were expected to flow from improvements in operational and
       allocative efficiencies in public expenditure programs.
More efficient execution of budgetary transactions would reduce delays in payments by
government creditors (beyond the period stipulated in contracts) and would eventually
reduce the costs of goods and services to the government.

The fact that the full budget was spent, while few of the planned outputs were delivered,
suggests a low level of economic efficiency. However it should be noted that an unknown
but significant level of resources was diverted from the development of the new IBAS++
system to the development of the existing iBAS system. This delivered a number of
improvements in system performance and coverage which are described in more detail in
Annex 2. Also, a considerable amount of training was delivered under component 3, which
has contributed to improved skills levels. This suggests that the expenditure was not
entirely fruitless.
