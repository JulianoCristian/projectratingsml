                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and performance oriented budget management process, while strengthening
                         financial accountability across the expenditure management cycle. The project supports fundamental reforms of operational budget management functions in both
                         central units and line ministries. Enhanced budget process and financial accountability is likely to improve the allocative and operational efficiency in public expenditure
                         management which in turn will enable better provision of key public services in support of the Government's social and economic policy objectives.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on-track with end-of-project targets for 2 out of 4 Project Development Objective (PDO) level indicators pertaining to piloting of performance reporting and quarterly
                         financial management reports. In turn, the targets on institutionalizing the MTBFand on implementing iBAS++ as a prerequisite for international standards of reporting are no longer
                         reachable by the closing date. Accordingly, the rating for progress towards achievement of PDO has been downgraded to “Unsatisfactory”.

                         Regarding implementation progress, while there have been achievements in some areas, overall project implementation has not maintained momentum in the past six months and
                         critical activities are unlikely to be completed by the closing date. Consequently, the overall implementation progress rating has been downgraded to “unsatisfactory”. The main areas
                         of progress to date and the activities unlikely to be completed by the closing date are summarized below.

                         Main areas of progress to date:

                         technical discussions and progress on issues requiring coordination and joint agreement.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since performance against a number of results indicators is off track and some activities are unlikely to be completed by the closing date, the project was downgraded to
                         “Unsatisfactory” for Progress towards achievement of PDO and Overall Implementation Progress. To improve project performance, a list of actions has been agreed (see table below
                         and further details in the attached aide memoire).

                         Discussions are on-going between the government and SPEMP donors regarding the future of the SPEMP Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) and the on-going recipient executed

                         projects under the Trust Fund. An extension of the DMTBF-project (SPEMP Project A) would require that the following conditions are met::

                         a request is received from ERD to extend the parent MDTF;
                         a technical proposal for SPEMP A activities and achievements during the extension period is received from ERD;

                         all of the SPEMP donors sign an amendment to the MDTF legal agreement to extend the parent Trust Fund’s closing date (or else withdraw from the trust fund);
                         the Bank and SPEMP donors assess the technical extension proposal and conclude that the project development objectives can be achieved during the proposed extension period
                         and that the proposed activities under the extension period are realistic and in support of this PDO;
                         the grant extension request is approved by the Bank management.

                         For any request for additional resources, the Bank would also need to get senior management approval for the request for additional finances, given the unsatisfactory rating of
                         performance.
                         The grant agreement would need to be amended and signed by the government.

                         This process would need to be completed before the July 31 closing date of the project.
