                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and performance oriented budget management process, while strengthening
                         financial accountability across the expenditure management cycle. The project supports fundamental reforms of operational budget management functions in both
                         central units and line ministries. Enhanced budget process and financial accountability is likely to improve the allocative and operational efficiency in public expenditure
                         management which in turn will enable better provision of key public services in support of the Government's social and economic policy objectives.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in its final year of implementation. While further progress has been made in a number of areas over the past six months, there has been an overall loss of momentum,
                         and the project is no longer fully on-track to reach all its project development objectives. The overall ratings of implementation progress and progress towards achievement of
                         development objectives have therefore been downgraded to “Moderately Unsatisfactory”.

                         Key areas of progress include completion of the macroeconomic model and upgrade of the debt management system (DMFAS 6.0). Work on deepening the MTBF has progressed
                         with 3 more line ministries having drafted Medium term strategic Business Plans (MTSBPs) and 2 having drafted annual performance reports. There is solid progress in the technical
                         software development of iBAS++. Consultants are hired and software finalized for the payroll database, so that a full employee database including all gazetted and non-gazetted
                         officers is expected by May or June 2014. Over the last 6 months, 2000 officials participated in training organized by the project and training evaluations show good results with
                         satisfaction rates of 88 % on average.

                         The following 4 key areas call for immediate action:

                         1)       MTBF-reform:      A detailed implementation and transition plan and a close engagement with Planning Commission is needed for introducing Forward Baseline Estimates
                         (FBEs). A formal decision is also yet to be taken on the role of the line ministry (MTSBPs) in the planning and resource allocation process. Finally, progress appears to have stalled in
                         making line ministry budget institutions, especially Budget Management Wings, fully operational.

                         2) New budget classification and chart of accounts: The finalization of the detailed new classification structure has been delayed and the planning for getting the necessary
                         stakeholder approvals and training of budget officers has only just begun. As a result, it is now a race against time to implement the new classification for the budget preparation
                         module of iBAS++ to be launched in January 2014.

                         3) Development of iBAS++
                         The management of the iBAS++ development as a whole is weak. The team has not been able to produce a reliable whole-of-project schedule. Critical procurements of data center,
                         servers and network have also been delayed and now constitute a major risk to the iBAS++ launch. Drafting of a transition plan has begun, but the work will need to be anchored
                         better in the project and get buy-in from Finance Division. There has been no progress in enhancing the capacity of the Financial Systems Management Unit (FSMU) to ensure the
                         unit is capable of taking over the further development and maintenance of the new system in a sustainable manner.

                         4) Project management and coordination. Some project management and coordination issues continue to hold back implementation: Decisions on hiring and procurement often suffer
                         from unnecessary delays, and financial planning is weak. A number of decisions on key reform elements have been pending from FD with a consequent loss of reform pace and
                         direction.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following main recommendations have been agreed with Government:

                         1)       MTBF-reform. To provide the necessary reform direction, the MTBF-roadmap should immediately be ratified by the Finance Minister. Guidelines to introduce Forward
                         Baseline Estimates for preparation of the 2014/15 budget should urgently be reviewed and approved. The Planning Commission should be engaged in order to agree on a joint
                         implementation plan. A concept note should be prepared jointly with Planning Commission to establish more clarity on the role of the Medium Term Strategic Business Plans in the
                         planning and resource allocation process. Finally, more monitoring and guidance is required to make Budget Management Wings fully operational.

                         2)      iBAS++ system. The MISC should urgently revisit the schedule and communicate to Finance Division a possible launch date, a critical path analysis and a plan for
                         necessary actions. Bi-weekly management reporting should be activated based on the updated schedule. Further, the project should exercise the highest possible level of oversight
                         and management of the IT procurement infrastructure timetable.

                         3)     Budget classification and chart of accounts. All necessary steps should be taken to ensure Finance Division’s and The Controller Auditor General’s approval. It is also

                         recommended to prepare an action plan for the full implementation of the new classification in budgeting, accounting and reporting to be endorsed by the Budget Classification Task
                         Force.

                         4)       Project management and coordination. PMCU should fully exercise its financial authority for hiring and replacement of consultants. Finance Division should consider further
                         delegation of the chairmanship for the inter-ministerial hiring committee for MISC consultants to the Additional Secretary level. It should also be explored and discussed with the Bank
                         how to avoid a loss of momentum during the next budget season.

                         Discussions between government and development partners have been initiated on options and conditions for a no-cost extension, and to prioritize areas for possible continued
                         support. For development partners to consider a no-cost extension, GoB will need to follow up on the recommendations in the recent independent review report and the attached aide
                         memoire.
