A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The following changes are proposed:
    A partial extension of the closing date by two months, from July 31, 2014 to September
       30, 2014 in order to provide the additional time needed for 26 scholarship students already
       enrolled in overseas master’s programs to complete their studies and fund costs related to
       their scholarships for August and September 2014 from the project grant. Only
       expenditures related to the completion of overseas master’s programs for the 26
       scholarship students already enrolled will be eligible after July 31, 2014.
    A reallocation between spending categories to create a new spending category exclusively
       for expenditures eligible in the extension period
    An amendment to the Grant Agreement (GA) to formalize the above changes.

B. Project Status
Despite a number of achievements, 2 out of 4 PDO-level indicators will not be achieved, and
critical activities will not be completed, by the closing date. In particular, targets relating to the
institutionalization of the Medium Term Budget Framework and the finalization of the Integrated
Budget and Accounting System (iBAS++) will not be achieved. Accordingly, performance ratings
for achievement of PDO and overall implementation progress have been downgraded to
“Unsatisfactory”. Based on the unsatisfactory performance, the development partners of the
SPEMP Multi Donor Trust fund and Government had decided not to extend SPEMP A beyond its
closing date of July 31, 2014. However, with respect to scholarships under component 3 of the
project, the Government has submitted a specific request dated July 10, 2014 for a partial
extension of the closing date by two months to ensure that the 26 scholarship students already
enrolled in overseas master’s programs can finalize their studies.

Project Development Objectives
Original PDO
The project aims to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and
performance oriented budget management process, while strengthening financial accountability
across the expenditure management cycle. The project supports fundamental reforms of
operational budget management functions in both central units and line ministries. Enhanced
budget process and financial accountability is likely to improve the allocative and operational
efficiency in public expenditure management which in turn will enable better provision of key
public services in support of the Government's social and economic policy objectives.

Reallocations
Explanation:
A reallocation is proposed to create a new spending category 2a “scholarships for training” to be used
exclusively for expenditures eligible for the partial extension period of two months. Expenditures for
scholarship activities up until July 31, 2014 will be charged against category 2 (Consulting services,
training and study tours), whereas expenditures for scholarship activities for August 2014 and September
2014 up to an amount of US $ 140,600 will be charged to category 2a (Scholarships for training).

A.     SUMMARY

The following changes are proposed:
    A partial extension of the closing date by two months, from July 31, 2014 to
       September 30, 2014 in order to provide the additional time needed for 26
       scholarship students already enrolled in overseas master’s programs to complete
       their studies and fund costs related to their scholarships for August and September
                                                  6
         2014 from the project grant. Only expenditures related to the completion of
         overseas master’s programs for the 26 scholarship students already enrolled will
         be eligible after July 31, 2014.
        A reallocation between spending categories to create a new spending category
         exclusively for expenditures eligible in the extension period
        An amendment to the Grant Agreement (GA) to formalize the above changes.

Despite the project’s unsatisfactory implementation rating, it is nonetheless proposed to
partially extend the project closing date for the following reasons: (i) the scholarships
program has been a success; (ii) 26 students are already overseas and would not be able
to obtain their master’s degrees if the project is not extended; (iii) the investment made
with donor funds would be lost; and (iv) the related reputational risk to the Bank and
development partners if support for the scholarship students is withdrawn at this time.
Given this is a partial extension, and all other activities will close by the original closing
date of July 31, 2014 or before, there is no risk of extending unsatisfactory activities.


B.       PROJECT STATUS

2 out of 4 Project Development Objective (PDO) level indicators pertaining to targets on
institutionalizing the MTBF and on implementing iBAS++, which is a prerequisite for
achieving international standards of financial reporting, will not be reached by the project
end-date. Accordingly, the rating for progress towards achievement of PDO has been
maintained as “unsatisfactory”.

While there have been achievements in some areas, overall project implementation has
remained sluggish and critical activities are unlikely to be completed by the closing date.
Consequently, the overall implementation progress rating has been maintained as
“unsatisfactory”. The main areas of progress to date and the activities unlikely to be
completed by the closing date are summarized below.

Main areas of progress to date:

        An upgraded debt management system (DMFAS version 6.0) installed and
         connected. A draft Medium Term Debt Management Strategy prepared.
        Medium-Term Budget Framework rolled out to all line ministries and new budget
         institutions (Budget Management Wings, Budget Management Committees and
         Budget Working Groups) formally established. The Finance Minister has ratified
         the MTBF-roadmap. A FD/Planning Commission (PC) joint working group was
         established to facilitate technical discussions and progress on issues requiring
         coordination and joint agreement.
        All line ministries have submitted quarterly financial management reports for Q1
         of 2014.
        Annual Performance Reports submitted by 2 line ministries
        Gender budget reporting submitted by 40 line ministries
        The Medium Term Strategic Business Plan (MTSBP) of the Ministry of
         Agriculture has been signed by the Minister and been published. Draft MTSBPs

                                               7
       have been formulated for the Power Division, the Local Governance Division, the
       Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Welfare. Draft MTSBPs for the
       Power Division and the Local Governance Division are at the final stage.
      An internal audit manual and strategy have been approved by Finance Division
       and a decision taken to establish an internal audit unit/cell in Finance Division.
      The new classification structure for budgeting, accounting and reporting was
       finalized by the designated task force based on recommendations received from
       the IMF.
      An Account Code (accounting policies and procedures manual) was drafted to be
       shared with major stakeholders.
      iBAS rolled out to 337 upazilla account offices
      iBAS is importing data from 188 branches of the Sonali Bank and 9 branches of
       the Bangladesh Bank
      Electronic fund transfer has been enabled in for all CAO offices. Further security
       enhancements are required.
      14,170 public officials have participated in training conducted by the project, of
       which 2,800 over the last 6 months. To date, 35 government officials have
       completed scholarships for overseas master’s programs.

Targets that will not be achieved by the closing date:

      Introduction of FBEs in line ministries.
      Macroeconomic model will not be used as the basis of the government’s Medium
       Term Macro Framework (MTMF).
      Envisioned number (22700) of government officials trained.
      Envisioned number of line ministries (5) with budgets based on Medium Term
       Strategic Business Plans.
      Introduction of an adequate legal framework.
      Development and testing of iBAS++ (see below).

In terms of compliance with audit covenants, the auditor expressed unqualified audit
opinion on the latest financial statements of financial year 2012-13. There has been a
repeated audit observation on inadequate documentation and payment procedure of
Karmadokhota Training, which has however subsequently been resolved to the
satisfaction of the Bank.

Following a number of issues raised in the recent implementation support missions, a
technical assessment mission was carried out in May 2014 on the status of iBAS++
implementation, which is critical to implementation success of component 2 and the
overall project. The assessment found a disconnect between current software
development and the foundational and supporting documentation, a lack of ownership of
the project by the Finance Division and other budget and accounting staff in the
government as well as inadequacies in project management. The timeline for
implementation of the system proposed by the government as the basis for a project
extension was deemed unrealistic. Based on the technical assessment of iBAS++ and the
unsatisfactory performance overall, the development partners of the SPEMP Multi Donor
Trust fund and Government decided not to extend the project.

                                             8
In preparing for an orderly closure of the project, a detailed review of commitments and
actual expenditures revealed that total project costs exceeded the original grant amount of
US $ 50 million. As the project had been appraised for US $ 68.8 million, and the Bank
had agreed to provide additional resources as necessary, a level 2-restructuring was
processed in June 2014 to increase the grant amount to US $ 52.5 million and reallocate
between spending categories in order to cover commitments already made by the project.

However, subsequent discussions with Government and development partners revealed
the need to put in place financial arrangements so that scholarship students already
enrolled in overseas master’s programs can finalize their studies. Consequently, the
Government has submitted a specific request dated July 10, 2014 for a partial extension
of the closing date by 2 months.


C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

Background
Under component 3 (Training and Capacity Building), the project is financing
scholarships for overseas master’s programs for government officials at selected
universities in the UK and Japan. The main objective of the scholarship program is to
create a pool of BCS officers with advanced graduate level education in economics,
finance and financial management and related fields to sustain the on-going public
financial management reform programs in Bangladesh.

Candidates for scholarships have been selected among the top achievers from the Fiscal
Economics and Economic Management (FEEM) training courses which have been
offered to government officials on a regular basis financed by the DMTBF-project. 62
government officials have been inducted into overseas master’s programs compared to a
target of 63 – a target realization rate of 98 %. 35 officials have already completed
overseas master’s programs, while 26 are currently pursuing their master’s studies..

Partial extension of closing date
The 26 government officials currently pursuing overseas master’s studies under the
scholarship program will only complete their studies by the end of September 2014.
Since activities for August and September 2014 are beyond the project closing date of
July 31, 2014, the expenditures relating to these activities would not be eligible. It is
proposed to partially extend the closing date of the project from July 31, 2014 to
September 30, 2014 to ensure that the 27 scholarship students already enrolled can
complete their studies and the related expenditures for August and September 2014 can
be financed under the project.

The eligible expenditures for August and September 2014 are estimated at US$ 140,600
and consist of monthly installments of living allowance, departure allowance and return
airfare as well as bank charges and a contingency to allow for currency fluctuations (see
table 1 below).

The expenditures of the extension period are financed within the existing grant amount of
US $ 52.5 million and the activities covered by the government project document (TPP),
which stretches until March 2015. The government counterpart funds of the project will
finance the salary of the project director, additional project directors and an accounts
officer, who will ensure that payments can be processed during the extension period as
needed.

Bank policy requires an extension of the closing date to be justified in terms of (a) the
Project DOs remain achievable; (b) the performance of the borrower remains satisfactory;
and (c) the Bank and the borrower agree on actions that will be undertaken by the
borrower to complete the Project. While these criteria are not fulfilled for the project
overall, a partial extension is nonetheless proposed based on the following:
   Component 3 of the project (which includes the scholarship program) has been
      rated moderately satisfactory. The target for enrollment into overseas master’s
      programs is 98 % achieved (62 students enrolled as opposed to 63 targeted), and the
      borrower’s performance in running the scholarship program is assessed by the task
      team as satisfactory
   The extension will ensure that the scholarship students can complete their studies as
      intended and return back to Bangladesh, thereby avoiding negative consequences
      for the beneficiaries as well as reputational risks for the Bank and SPEMP donors
   The extension will protect the investment made by SPEMP Donors as the majority
      of the expenditure relating to the scholarship program is already incurred
   There is agreement between the Bank and the Borrower on the actions that need be
      undertaken to complete the activities for the 26 remaining scholarship students.
   Given the extension is partial, all other activities will close by the original closing
      date of July 31, hence there is no risk of continuing unsatisfactory activities.

Reallocation between spending categories
A reallocation is proposed to create a new spending category 2a “scholarships for
training” to be used exclusively for expenditures eligible for the partial extension period
of two months (see table 2 below). Expenditures for scholarship activities up until July
31, 2014 will be charged against category 2 (Consulting services, training and study
tours), whereas expenditures for scholarship activities for August 2014 and September
2014 up to an amount of US $ 140,600 as defined above will be charged to category 2a
(Scholarships for training). All other expenditures will only be eligible up to the current
closing date of July 31, 2014.
