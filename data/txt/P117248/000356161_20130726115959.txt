7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project aims to deepen and institutionalize the MTBF and build a more strategic and performance
oriented budget management process, while strengthening financial accountability across the expenditure
management cycle. The project supports fundamental reforms of operational budget management functions
in both central units and line ministries. Enhanced budget process and financial accountability is likely to
improve the allocative and operational efficiency in public expenditure management which in turn will
enable better provision of key public services in support of the Government's social and economic policy
objectives.
