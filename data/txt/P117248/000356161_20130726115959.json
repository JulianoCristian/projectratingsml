This\n            restructuring paper discusses two changes to the project: 1)\n            a revision of the results framework for the project to\n            adequately capture the achievement of project development\n            objectives, intermediate results; and 2) an amendment of the\n            grant agreement to enable the project to extend the terms of\n            the position as communications specialist from 24 months to\n            45 months and to remove from the grant agreement specific\n            terms of contracts for specialist positions under the\n            Project Management Coordination Unit (PMCU). During the 2012\n            restructuring, a revision of the result framework was\n            initiated to simplify the original framework, which\n            contained more than sixty indicators, and reflect the change\n            in component structure. The results framework is to be\n            revised for the project to adequately capture the\n            achievement of project development objectives, intermediate results."}, "docdt": "2013-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
