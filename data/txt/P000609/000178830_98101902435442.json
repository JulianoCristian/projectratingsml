main objective will be to explore the\n            country's only known source of mineral energy to prove\n            commercially exploitable geothermal reserves. In addition it\n            will strengthen ISERST, the country's geothermal\n            research institute, through appropriate technical\n            assistance, and enable it to take a more active role in\n            geothermal exploration and development operations. EDD, the\n            country's electric power company, will be provided with\n            assistance preparatory to incorporating geothermal power\n            production facilities into its system. Project components\n            include: (a) geothermal drilling in the Hanle/Gaggade area;\n            (b) complementary surface exploration works in the same\n            area; and (c) technical assistance to ISERST."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
