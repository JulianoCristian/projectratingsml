MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
Subject: Performance Audit Report on Egypt -
Agro-industries Project (Credit 988-EGT)
Second Agro-industries Project (Loan 2243-EGT)
New Land Development Project (Credit 1083-EGT)
Fish Farming Development Project (Credit 1111-EGT)
Irrigation Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2270-EGT)
Attached is the Performance Audit Report prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department on the above five agricultural sector projects in Egypt.
Project design changes and implementation problems, especially engineering and project
management aspects (including inadequate use of technical assistance), led to delayed completions.
The two agroindustry credit projects were undermined by large interest rate subsidies and by currency
devaluation which sharply increased subborrower foreign currency debts. Technical and management
problems dogged the ambitious plan to establish a large fish farm.
Outcomes were mixed: the Pumping Stations project achieved triple its physical targets,
agroindustry lending met equity targets but was less diversified than hoped, and the foreign currency
debt problem was not resolved; the New Land irrigated settlement project was implemented much
as planned, but low water supplies are reducing benefits; and the fish farm suffers from design faults
and is not commercially viable.
The PCRs give good accounts of the project experiences. Audit lessons refer to the sector
strategy (the New Land and Fish Farming projects were poor fits), the Bank's policies on foreign
exchange risks and interest rates, and resolution of country-wide policy and implementation issues.
Overall performance is rated as highly satisfactory for the Irrigation Pumping Stations Project
and marginally satisfactory for the two Agroindustry projects. For these three projects sustainability
is likely, but institutional development is rated as modest. The overall performance of the New Land
project is rated as marginally satisfactory, sustainability as uncertain (given reduced water supplies)
and institutional development as modest. The overall performance of the Fish Farming project was
rated as highly unsatisfactory, sustainability as unlikely and institutional development as negligible.

The PAR is based on the Project Completion Reports for each project prepared by the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, the Staff Appraisal and President's Reports, the loan and
credit documents, a study of Bank files and on discussions with Bank Group staff. An audit mission
visited Egypt in July 1993, had discussions with government and other staff and visited a selection of
project sites and facilities. A draft of the PAR was circulated to the Regional Office and to relevant
agencies in Egypt. A meeting was held in Cairo on June 6, 1994 to review the draft report and was
attended by 15 representatives from project agencies. A return visit was also made to Maryut Fish Farm
to inspect on-going activities. Comments have been incorporated, and comments received from Egypt
are attached as annexes. The kind cooperation of staff in Egypt, their assistance in the field and their
contributions to this report are appreciated.
The PCRs give comprehensive accounts of the project experiences and results, and draw
appropriate project specific lessons in accordance with the applicable guidelines. The audit takes a
broader view of the five projects as examples of the main focus of agricultural operations during the early
1980s, examines the role and functions of Bank staff in implementation assistance during the protracted
project periods and draws lessons in particular on appropriate Bank implementation functions, methods
of managing complex implementation situations and related Bank/country relations.

/a    The government turned down the March 1982 negotiation request mainly due to the Ministry of Irrigation's reluctance to borrow at IBRD terms as
previously all the Bank Group-financed projects under this ministry were on IDA terms.
/b    The Bank agreed to a 60-day extension in project effectiveness date which was anticipated to be required for the People's Assembly to review and
approve the project.
/c    The following factors justified the extensions of the Loan Closing Date: expansion in project scope due to substantial savings in projoct cost; trade
disturbances in major equipment supplying countries (Eastern Europe and the Balkans); delays in equipment delivery by manufactures; and delays in
tender evaluation and awarding contracts.

f    A - anticipated completion; D - disbursement; Do - development objectives; L - Loan condition; Af - availability of funds; M - managerial;
P - procurement.
/     The number of days recorded portrays the mission time spent on the field for supervision of other projects as well, since it was a combined
supervision mission.
/h The supervision was combined with the appraisal of Irrigation and Drainage Pumping Stations Project 11.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1    This is an audit report of five agricultural sector projects which were approved between March
1980 and April 1983. The five projects represent about half of the Bank's sector operations in the 1980s.
Only six agricultural sector projects had been approved in the 1970s (four land drainage projects, one
fruit and vegetable development project and a pilot agricultural development project in two governorates).
A Technical Assistance Project for the sector was approved in 1982, and five more agricultural projects
were approved from 1985 to 1990. Page xiii lists the agricultural project approved by the Bank Group
during the period.
1.2    The five audited projects were financed by about US$262 million of Bank Group funds, although
about US$30 million of this was cancelled. In broad terms the main objectives of the projects were to
expand the agro-industrial base by a line of credit through four participating banks (two projects) to some
350 companies, and construction of two replacement slaughterhouses; and one project each to (i) develop
and settle 24,200 feddans of new irrigated area, (ii) develop a 3,100 feddan commercial fish farm, and
(iii) rehabilitate 30 pumping stations. All five projects also included institutional objectives to improve
agencies serving the sub-sectors, and technical assistance, both to effect the institutional improvements
and to assist implementation. All five projects involved substantial procurement of equipment and
supplies, contracts for civil works, and hiring of consultants, all of which caused significant problems
during implementation. All the projects took longer to implement than planned, with the accounts closing
2-1/2-3 years late between June 1988 and June 1992.
1.3    The two lines of credit for agro-industry investment were country-wide; the Pumps project
financed stations (for drainage as well as irrigation) in both Lower and Upper Egypt, the fish farm is
located on the west edge of the Nile Delta, southwest of Alexandria, with the New Land project nearby
outside the Delta on the desert margins. The Pumping project included rehabilitation of stations and a
control system on the canal feeding the New Land irrigated area, as well as pumps for drainage (including
from the New Land project) from which the Maryut Fish Farm draws water.
1.4    The agricultural sector context described here in which the projects were approved is drawn from
the staff appraisal report (SAR) of February, 1980 for the Agro-industries Project. Agriculture was the
largest sector in the economy, contributing about 25 percent of GDP, employing about 41 percent of the
labor force, and providing about 27 percent of the country's annual export earnings directly, and another
18 percent indirectly. Egyptian agriculture was based on some 6.5 million feddans of irrigated land, most
of which was double cropped and farmed in small plots with traditional methods. Many crops were
subject to (low) price and quota controls and there were instances of coerced cropping by government
edict. Government policy emphasized production of cotton and rice, thereby largely determining the
choice of other crops within the constraints of rotational and subsistence requirements. The winter
rotation was clover and wheat, followed by cotton, rice and maize in the summer. In terms of area the
leading crops were berseem (alfalfa), maize, cotton, wheat, rice, and vegetables. Agricultural output had



grown by only 2 percent per annum over the period 1952-1975, which was considerably less than the
growth rate of population (2.4 percent). As a result, food imports had been increasing, especially of
wheat and wheat flour, vegetable oils and sugar, with consequent increased vulnerability to overseas
supply constraints and prices. Some 4.5 million cattle and buffaloes produced meat and milk, but draft
power was increasingly being supplied by tractors. Other sources of meat were sheep, goats and camels,
and a large and expanding poultry industry. With meat prices uncontrolled, there had been a steady
increase in meat production over the previous 20 years.
1.5   In a broader perspective, a thorough piece of Bank economic work at the time' summarized
agriculture sector issues as follows:
"An important issue for the future is the role of agriculture. Since the 1950s Egypt's
price and exchange rate policies have squeezed resources out of agriculture in order to
develop other sectors. This strategy was perhaps inevitable when agriculture was the
only sector capable of yielding a significant surplus. But the effect was to weaken and
distort incentives for production and make it difficult for small farmers to adopt much
needed technological advances. Now that resources are readily available ....... Egypt
must encourage a greater degree of accumulation within agriculture, particularly by
medium-size and small farmers, to foster the wider dissemination of technical change.
Within agriculture the need is for a qualitative transformation. In the past twenty or
thirty years increasingly costly schemes of land reclamation [of "new land"] have been
directed toward horizontal expansion. Yet despite high yields and apparent constraints
on the intensive margin of cultivation, much remains to be done on the old land. The
far-reaching transformation of agriculture could involve drainage, new crop patterns, new
methods of irrigation, improved cultivation techniques, and the linkingpf new kinds of
agricultural production with industry and exports."
In response to these needs, the Bank had decided (since the Country Program Paper of 1978) to increase
the share of the agricultural sector in the Egypt lending program.
1.6    A little later, in 1983, the Bank summed up its agriculture sector experience and conclusions since
1975 as follows ("Selected Issues in Agriculture, Irrigation and Land Reclamation", Report No. 4133-
EGT), emphasis added:
-      weaknesses in ministries and public sector companies because of low pay, with better staff
able to get jobs in the private sector [including abroad];
-      lack of technical information and knowledge [indicating a need for technical assistance];
-      the need for more use of the private sector in pursuing development objectives [vide the
agro-industry projects];
-      considerable investment in the old lands was needed to rehabilitate infrastructure; and
-      in the new lands, availability of water will soon become a constraint.
This report saw the old lands as the main source of growth-because there were 5.5 million feddans of
old lands compared with 1.0 million of new lands, and soils were more fertile.

University Press, 1980.

1.7    Drawing on these sources, and on more detailed accounts in SARs and the files, the main issues
(arising from earlier agricultural operations) apparent at the time these five projects were approved may
be summarized as follows:
(a)    Food production: the need to expand domestic production of food to reverse the trend
towards greater reliance on imports.
(b)    Rehabilitation versus expansion: the choice between investment on rehabilitating existing
but neglected infrastructure to realize high marginal returns to more efficient production
from the 'old lands" (the pre-High Aswan Dam irrigated area of 5.5 million feddans),
and from 0.9 million feddans of "old new lands" developed since the mid-1960s with
Aswan water, as opposed to further expansion of the irrigated area by development of
"new lands".
(c)    Price distortions: managed prices for most output and subsidies on some inputs, plus an
overvalued official exchange rate (compared with the market rate) and below market
interest rates, all contributed to a complex set of incentives and disincentives to producers
and entrepreneurs which varied markedly from world prices.
(d)    Implementation capacity and quality: cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, reluctance
to use Bank procurement procedures or to recruit technical assistance, weak management
and lack of technical expertise in some areas, had contributed to costly implementation
delays and poor construction quality on existing projects.
It will be seen that these points are prominent in the accounts of the five audited projects.
1.8    The five projects in this cluster audit are discussed separately, including a discussion of issues
and lessons for each project (the two agro-industrial projects jointly) and then the cross-cutting topics are
discussed in conclusion.
2. AGRO-INDUSTRIES PROJECT (CREDIT 988-EGT)
A. Background and Identification
2.1   In early 1978 an IDA mission reported that the government had announced a new drive for food
security in the face of growing dependence on imported basic foodstuffs. The private sector was expected
to play a greater role and the Bank saw a technocratic solution, through the reduction of post-harvest
losses and wastage, as the most efficient way of increasing supplies for domestic sources. The project
identified in May 1978 focussed on investments for: (a) processing basic foodstuff, (b) assisting agro-
industries in reclaimed "new lands", and (c) improved food distribution by reorganizing the municipal
facilities of Cairo and Alexandria (that is their slaughterhouses and the fruit and vegetable wholesale
markets). Another goal would be to build up the sub-project formulation and preparation capability of
the on-lending banks (stimulated in part by the weak performance of Bank Misr (BM) under the on-going
Fruit and Vegetable Development Project-FVDP). The first letter on file indicates that the initiative for
the project was with the Bank as it summarizes to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) "the components
and organizational format of the proposed project as conceived by us." A line of credit was foreseen,
which may need a "special project unit" to implement it (possibly a reaction to Bank Misr's disappointing
performance). At this early stage the potential overlap with an existing Bank-assisted project, through
the development finance company (DFC) portfolio, was said not to be a problem given the great need
for agro-industrial finance.

B. Preparation and Appraisal
2.2    The initial plan to assist basic foodstuffs processing and agro-industries in only the "new lands"2
quickly broadened into a general agro-industrial line of credit for agro-industry.3 Similarly the Bank
soon recognized that while proposals for the two slaughterhouses would soon be ready for appraisal,
delays (a forewarning under the FVDP) in drawing up proposals for fruit and vegetable wholesale markets
would necessitate dropping these components. Eventually, the project took over from where things
petered out under the FVDP, with studies to plan these wholesale markets.
2.3    The Bank's concept of an "Agro-industries Project Unit" (APU) to implement the project took
up much time and energy during early preparation. The APU eventually died for lack of support in
government, which saw no need, and probably also because no natural home for such a unit was found.
It will become apparent later that the main reason the Bank may have wanted a project unit was to make
Bank/borrower communications less arduous. Events proved this to have been a prescient concern.
Given the unusually heavy use of Bank staff time (for such an operation), the large volume of
correspondence on the file, much of it in triplicate or more to the various project participants, one
advantage of such a central unit (in such a disparate project) became obvious later to the Bank. Similarly
the government in dealing separately (and often differently) with each "participating bank" (PB) could
have benefitted from the coordinating role of such a unit. (Government and PB staff have since
commented to that effect.)
2.4    Early preparation focussed on:
(a)    having four participating banks, given that Bank Misr's slow uptake of funds under
FVDP indicated the need for more competition. (Bank Misr had proposed opening up
uncommitted funds in FVDP to "any type of agro-industrial venture.")
(b)    the need for an Agro-industry Project Unit to advise and back-up the PBs was queried
by the Bank's IDF division for fear it would preempt the role of the PBs.
(c)    and the vital role of the Bank in helping the Cairo and Alexandria governorates plan and
implement appropriate replacement slaughterhouses.
2.5    The project moved quickly to a pre-appraisal mission in late 1978 which reported that:
(a)    one of the potential PBs (the Development Industrial Bank-DIB) had a line of credit
from OPEC for on-lending at 8 percent (well below what the Bank might agree to) and
might thus not be interested in Bank funds, but the mission proposed keeping DIB in the
project. Thus interest rates were an important issue from the beginning.
(b)    the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) was already
receiving applications for term loans for agro-industry.
2. This refers to about 1 million feddans of irrigated area expansion using additional water suppliers available from the High
Aswan Dam (HAD) from the early 1970s. The Bank-assisted New Lands Development Project (audited here) was a further
expansion by "reclamation" (perhaps a misnomer) of the desert.
3. Defined by the Bank's Economic Development Institute as "an enterprise that processes agricultural raw materials, including
ground and tree crops as well as livestock." (Agro-industrial Project Analysis, James E. Austin, EDI/IBRD, 1981). However,
this project and its successor did not feel bound by this definition as the largest single category of enterprise financed was poultry
production (for eggs and broilers).



(c)    although the APU concept was not strongly supported in Egypt, there was no strong
objection.
(d)    in response to concerns expressed by the Bank's Central Projects' Staff (CPS), a short
study (during preparation) was proposed to verify that large central slaughterhouses in
Cairo and Alexandria were preferable to several smaller slaughterhouses in each city.
2.6    By early 1979 the project concept had taken its final shape:
(a)    150 small-to-medium sized loans for new and existing agro-industrial ventures;
(b)    relocation and expansion of municipal slaughterhouses in Cairo and Alexandria;
(c)    studies towards replacing the wholesale fruit and vegetable markets in the two cities, and
(d)    supporting technical assistance and training.
2.7   Issues began to clarify as a further pre-appraisal mission was preparing to leave in March, 1979.
The main points were:
(a)    On-lending interest rates and how the foreign exchange risk' would be borne (the first
file mention of this issue). The exchange risk point was especially important in such a
line of credit because Bank staff noted that the Egyptian pound was likely to decline
aeainst the U.S. dollar (Box 1).
(b)    The APU, which had been "discussed ad nauseain," (with DIB strongly opposed to it),
was considered by the mission members to be no longer needed. It was decided to drop
the concept, with TA being substituted in the PBs (especially to assist small borrowers)
and with the Bank providing "guidance on appraisal methodology and illustrative
examples". It was noted that training of PB staff was already being supported by USAID
funds.
(c)    It was decided that Bank Misr should be included as a PB, despite poor performance, but
subject to improved performance (measured by full commitment of its funds from
FVDP), and that TA should not be forced on the National Bank of Egypt (NBE). The
Bank had thought that NBE was in need of TA, but it had objected.
(d)    Recovery of slaughterhouse costs would, in the mission's view, require untenably high
user fees.  It was decided that full cost recovery was possible for the Cairo
slaughterhouse, but that replacement of the Alexandria slaughterhouse was justified (on
various grounds), even though it was feasible to recover only about half of costs.
2.8    After field appraisal of the project, the Issues/Decision meeting process decided:
(a)    that NBE would participate provided it made satisfactory TA arrangements.
4. i.e. devaluation of Egyptian Pound against the USS (as distinct from cross-currency risk of repaying for other currencies
disbursed).



- 6 -
Box 1: Proposals for Handling Foreign Exchange Risk
From January, 1979 the unified (official) exchange rate had been set at LE 0.7/US$ (which was a
devaluation of 45 percent on the previous rate), but the mission issues paper reported a free market rate
already at LE 0.8/US$. In keeping with Bank policy at the time, the mission proposed that small borrowers
should not bear any exchange risk (with government carrying this risk), but that other borrowers would bear
only the LE:US$ risk (with government bearing the US$:other currency risk). This was consistent with the
third DFC loan. The project files reviewed do not reveal the justification for splitting the exchange risk in
this fashion so that non-small borrowers have the risk of the pound devaluing against the dollar, but the
government bore the risk arising from movements between the US$ and other currencies (that is the cross-
currency risk). Since the guidelines were based on the efficiency principle that the ultimate beneficiaries of
a loan (except where they were too small and unsophisticated to bear the risk) should bear its full economic
cost, this arrangement did not fulfill the Bank's intent. No trace was found of this split arrangement being
queried. (On the Egyptian side there was a different view, from DIB, that even small borrowers were
prepared to accept the LE:US$ risk, which would be consistent with the terms of the Bank's proposed fourth
DFC loan to DIB. The agro-industry project staff accepted this position subject to discussion at appraisal.)
At the post-appraisal issues/decision meeting it was agreed that government should take the FE risk,
except that larger borrowers would take the Egyptian Pound:US$ risk. (Later it was doubted in the Bank
that government would agree to this, and the Bank decided not to press the government on the point, but
assign the LE:US$ risk to all sub-borrowers ifgovernmentagreed. In any case, in arguing the point a memo
to regional management notes-with some lack of foresight given that devaluation was predicted, 'We also
feel the success of the project does not depend upon such an agreement").
In the event, the outcome of the debate was unsatisfactory coverage in the project documents (Box
3), and, in terms of the risk itself, near catastrophe for many borrowers as the audit relates.
(b)    that the PBs would themselves provide any TA they needed, but in any case, "60 percent
of the loans will be for expansion projects [for existing businesses] and the borrowers
would be fairly sophisticated businessmen".
(c)    that slaughterhouse bids (expected in October) be evaluated (at Bank insistence) with the
help of consultants (to be financed retroactively). It took the usual long time (in Egypt)
to appoint these consultants, leading to delays and later problems. (Unwisely, in an
effort to speed the process up, the supervising division got too closely involved in the
field-by joining the negotiations-but apparently escaped unscathed).
2.9    Central Projects' Staff (CPS) then raised the pressure by: (a) remarking that "the project had
serious loose ends", and (b) noting that the exchange risk would be very serious to small borrowers and
would affect uptake of the credit. Although the second point was not directly responded to, the region's
management noted with respect to another concern, while processing the appraisal package onwards, that
with sub-borrowers bearing the exchange risk the effective interest rate becomes positive in real terms.
This clearly shows that regional management expected devaluation, knew that this would raise repayment
costs to sub-borrowers, but even so commented no further on the point raised by CPS, nor ensured that
the documents did so. The appraisal report addressed the risk only of input price increases, in the



standard risk section by noting that the many private sub-borrowers would be able to 'vary their prices
outside government edict, and thereby cover inflationary increases in operating costs."5
2.10   Throughout preparation and appraisal the number of participating banks to be included in the
project was uncertain at times. The proposal to have more than the one on-lending bank was apparently
considered quite innovative, requiring special justification (i.e. the benefits of synergistic competition).
The fact that four PBs required a larger commitment of Bank funds was unstated but apparent from the
files, when DBE became an uncertain player and the possibility of reducing the loan became an issue
(Box 2). DBE eventually dropped out, because it did not wish to meet IDA conditions, but even then
with regional management urging that an attempt be made to reach a compromise to keep it in. Since
this did not work out, the credit component and overall IDA Credit were reduced by US$10 million.
Box 2: Participating Banks?
PBDAC was a 'natural' and never seemed in doubt; DIE was originally not interested in a Bank loan,
but was kept in by the Bank and government; and Bank Misr seemed uncertain for much of preparation. The
incentives for Bank Misr's participation were not obvious given the Bank's conditions, since, as Bank staff
noted, the FVDP funds (which it must commit first) were "a very small part of BM's overall activities'.
Indeed, after the project was approved the Bank felt it necessary to follow up with BM management on their
participation: 'We have been fortunate to have your cooperation in the past, and know that we can count on
you for continued personal support to these two projects. We shall be grateful for your help in ensuring that
the [responsible BM department] take a forward looking approach to plan lending operations. .
The most unsettling point on bank participation occurred in September 1979, when appraisal was well
advanced, with government suggesting reducing the size of the Credit and including only the two specialized
public banks (DIB and PBDAC-under the Ministry of Finance), which 'would be enough for speedy
implementation", and not the two "commercial banks" (BM and DBE-under the Central Bank). The Bank took
the position that there was ample private sector demand for agro-industrial finance (given government incentives
under the food security policy) to justify all four banks being included, rather than agreeing with government
and reducing the size of the IDA Credit.
2.11   As approved in March 1980, the project objectives were to " (i) help modernize and expand the
processing and marketing of basic agricultural products and associated services and input activities; (ii)
to help forge links between financial institutions and agro-industries, especially those which are of small
and medium size and mostly located in rural areas, and to strengthen and expand the participating bank's
assistance to such industries". (Credit Agreement, Schedule 2).
2.12   Components were unchanged from earlier in preparation: the two slaughterhouses for Cairo and
Alexandria; studies for relocating the two cities' fruit and vegetable wholesale markets and technical
assistance (for the training and sub-project processing in BM and PBDAC, for bid evaluation and
supervision of the slaughterhouse construction, for training slaughterhouse staff, and to assist
slaughterhouse management). TA was not provided for DIB since it was already receiving assistance
under other Bank-assisted DFC projects.
5. It will be seen that the most dramatic increase in input costs occurred with the removal of subsidies on poultry feed. The
Region has noted that the phase out of input subsidies was expected in in economy in transition, but the project design
overlooked this potential problem to sub-borrowers.



- 8 -
2.13   In an apparent oversight, the legal documents do not reflect the SAR's intention to finance some
primary production, which was otherwise excluded-"except in areas such as poultry plants' and
greenhouses, which are usually considered agro-industries" (SAR, para. 3.02). (Even so, poultry
production-including of chicks, which may be considered an input-was the single largest category of
on-lending with a third of the sub-loans and over half the amount disbursed by IDA for sub-loans.)
Despite the expectation in the SAR that poultry production would be financed, appraisal models for egg
and broiler sub-projects were not found in the documents. Indeed the only models traced in the Project
File (Annex C.4) were for a block ice plant, a dairy, an egg packaging plant and a cold store-nor is
poultry production included in the list of agro-industries in Annex C.4, Table 16. The model categories
are described as the highest priority enterprises for investment.
2.14   Arrangements with respect to the carrying of the foreign exchange risk were muddled in the
project documents (Box 3).
Box 3: Foreign Exchange Risk and Interest Rates
In the legal documents, on-lending terms to the PBs by government included that repayments (in
Egyptian pounds) to government should be in dollar equivalents (at the rate of exchange on the date of
repayment) and that the interest rate (from government to PBs) was 8 percent-except for amounts on-lent to
small sub-borrowers where 7 percent would apply. Thus the PBs were to take the Egyptian Pound/US$ risk.
In an apparent oversight, therefore, the legal documents do not reflect the SAR's intent (para. 4.19) that the
exchange risk between Egyptian pounds and US dollars be borne by sub-borrowers from the credit line. Both
DB and PBDAC decided to pass this risk on to sub-borrowers, while BM refrained. The interest rate to agro-
industry sub-borrowers was to be not less than 11 percent.
The project legal documents require that in the case of the slaughterhouse loans to the two governorates
the central government 'assume the risk of loss due to fluctuations in the values of currencies' (DCA, Schedule
4). It is not apparent why agro-industrial firms-of all sizes-were considered able to bear foreign exchange
risks, while the city governments of Cairo and Alexandria were not.
2.15   With respect to processing of sub-loans, a "free limit" of US$250,000 was agreed, below which
sub-loan proposals would not have to be submitted to IDA for prior approval. No overall allocation of
credit funds was made between the three PBs and not less than 33 percent was to go to small borrowers
(fixed assets not exceeding LE 200,000) and not more than 25 percent to public sector corporations
(except that an initial start up amount of US$3 million to each PB). A further feature of the project
design (which is clear from the SAR) is that a credit line was intended to finance a diverse set of agro-
industries. Thus 'A wide variety of agro-industries are expected to apply for financing", and the credit
component was expected to "reach out extensively to a variety of agro-industries" (SAR paras. 3.02 and
4.02). However, there was no provision in the Disbursement Schedule to encourage diversity, or to limit
over-concentration, since all on-lending funds were in one category.
2.16   With respect to the PBs as financial institutions, the legal documents indicate that although
standard clauses required them to submit to the Bank audited accounts on their whole operation, as well
6. In the context the audit interprets this to mean the production of broilers, eggs and chicks, although "poultry plant" would
normally refer to a poultry nromssin plant (as indicated in pam. 1.03 of the SAR).



- 9 -
as the usual project-specific accounts, the focus of the project was on only the development of agro-
industrial lending, and not on the development and financial soundness of the institutions as a whole.7
C. Implementation
2.17   A smooth and problem-free start-up to implementation might have been expected since the PBs
were already familiar with Bank operations, and tendering for slaughterhouses was well-advanced before
credit approval (construction bids had been opened six months before IDA board approval). Even so,
from the beginning things began to go awry. The consultants to assist bid evaluation were not appointed
as planned and the report of the first supervision mission (June 1980) was despondent in recording little
progress and very little information. The mission reported that the Cairo Governorate and the consultants
were "fighting bitterly," and that the govermment saw no need for these consultants. (Cases of delayed
recruitment of consultants in these five projects under audit may be generally attributable to Egyptian
reluctance to use foreign consultants, rather than to the often ostensible contractual reason.) As a result
of this delay the possibility of having to re-bid the tender for the slaughterhouses was raised.
2.18   In reporting at the time to regional management on these procurement issues the responsible
manager noted that "this case of delays and bureaucratic red tape is a particularly frustrating one,
although in no way unique for agricultural projects in Egypt." Furthermore, the staff noted on file that
"it was recognized the governorates would not be easy to work with, and the experience has fully justified
those fears". (Such problems and comments were not isolated-Box 4). The failure to sign a contract
with the engineering consultants for the slaughterhouses was particularly frustrating since their
employment was a condition of effectiveness and so the delay could also hold up implementation of the
credit component. By September, 1980 DIB and PBDAC were "pressing for access to credit".
Box 4: Communications and Other Problems
Although the two agro-industrial projects experienced less repetitive communications problems
between Egyptian and Bank staff, and less problems from project implementers diverging (constantly) from
agreed paths and procedures (as noted below in the reviews of the other three projects), their files did reveal
three comments which typify the overall problems. First, there is reference to Egyptian 'inability to answer
correspondence", then a plaintive remark that 'our experience is that events do not make substantial progress
in implementation of recommendations between supervision missions." Third, it was noted at a later stage
that "there is a much more responsible and realistic atmosphere in the three ministries dealing with
agriculture. If only they would cooperate more with each other...." Experience on the Pumping Stations,
New Lands and Fish Farming projects was to bear out these observations only too well, as is evident in the
files.
2.19   Eventually the consultants were hired and the credit became effective in December, with the Bank
deciding that retendering of the construction contracts was not necessary. Immediate problems then
seemed over, until in early 1981 the Bank learnt that in support of the food security program the
government had established a large fund (LE 100 million) to be on-lent to farmers and agro-industrial
entrepreneurs at only 6 percent. Bank staff reported that demand for project credit had almost dried up
as a result. Commitments by the PBs had reached 44 percent of the available funds by mid-1981, in only
the first seven months since effectiveness. Government's reaction was to ask the Bank to allow on-
7. The focus of such agricultural credit (and rural financial) operations has been the subject of debate in the Bank (see "A
Review of Bank Lending for Agricultural Credit and Rural Finance (1948-1992)", June 1993, OED).



- 10 -
lending at 6 percent for food security purposes, which was soon agreed for this project, as well as FVDP
and the even earlier Agricultural Development Project (Credit 830-EGT).
2.20   This was a pragmatic decision by the Bank with respect to preserving this line of credit (and
prospects for a follow-up). In justification a supervision mission merely recommended that IDA agree
to on-lending rates being brought into line with current Egyptian policy. In the files the Bank further
rationalized lowering the on-lending interest rate "on the basis of an assessment that it was not then
productive to push further on the specific issue of the agricultural interest rate structure, but to continue
to discuss interest rate policy in the context of sector dialogue ..2' This appears to be a variant on the
Bank's experience that negotiating important policy points (which have multi-sector linkages) in a project-
specific context is not productive-but in this case the argument rings hollow as justification for agreeing
to on-lend Bank funds at substantial negative real interest rates. The Bank's agreement to 6 percent for
food security loans also contrasts unflatteringly with the long struggle over interest rates while processing
the New Land Project just two years earlier, especially the Bank's letter of October, 1980 (Box 9).
Concern over the negative real interest rate was to be raised, only once and briefly, by CPS somewhat
later (as the Bank responded to the rapid commitment of subsidized credit funds by moving quickly to
process a follow-up line of credit), as follows:
"In the August 5 supervision report, it is proposed that a follow-up project be initiated.
I have no doubt that we can disburse large sums of money at 6 percent interest rate. I
seriously question whether we should initiate a second project at such a highly negative
rate. "
No response from the region to this concern was found on file, and indeed a letter had already gone out
to government a week earlier forecasting that the remaining Credit funds could be committed by the end
of the year and that "we do not think it is too early to begin preparing a follow-up project."
2.21   The effect on the credit line of the lower interest rate was immediate. Within weeks the PBs had
submitted projects to the Bank for approval which exceeded the remaining uncommitted 56 percent of
funds. But there were problems which were raised with the government by letter: that not enough small
loans were being made and that poultry projects predominated, and exclusively so for the very large
projects being submitted by BM and PBDAC. The Bank wanted to see a more balanced portfolio. At
this point BM emerged as the more farsighted of the participants in the project, when it observed that its
lending to small borrowers was constrained by it being unwilling to pass on the foreign exchange risk.
(Even so, with the sub-loan size issue becoming a particular problem with BM, a few months later Bank
staff were proposing that BM's participation in the follow-on project-despite the exchange risk
constraint-be made conditional on a third of the funds it drew under the first line going to small
borrowers.)
2.22   Although the low interest rate and exchange rate issues were now in full view, the preparation
of the follow-on project proceeded unimpeded (as discussed in more detail below) towards appraisal in
mid-1982. Processing of sub-loans, meanwhile, was causing a great deal of work for Bank staff as
evidenced by the volume of file material. Not only were all proposed sub-loans above the free limit to
be reviewed and approved, but all other loans were in effect also cleared on the basis of less detailed
documentation, before IDA disbursements could be made. This work went on through 1983, during
which time the files indicate there were continuing communications problems. Mainly this concerned
language difficulties, as shown on the files with respect to some of the incoming messages, but also there
were clear cases where the Egyptian side did not fully support an agreed course of action-especially on
hiring foreign consultants. PBDAC seems to have been particularly difficult to work with, from the
Bank's point of view, which culminated in a letter in late 1983 commenting that although staffing of
PBDAC's International Loans Department was improved, including in language ability, still this was a



- 11 -
constraint since only the manager could communicate comfortably with international agencies. This was
all the more important because PBDAC (in the absence of a central project unit) was reported to be
performing a coordinating role between all participants. The same letter referred to PBDAC's
management not communicating well with its staff, and made suggestions for improvements.
(Implementation problems across the Bank's portfolio, which led to slow disbursements, were not of
concern only to the Bank as shown by a review of a government report in the files in early 1982. This
report pointed to the causes as delayed availability of local currency, lengthy tendering time, construction
contract delays and "Arab financiers' not making payments as scheduled. It noted that USAID was
disbursing 40 percent of its committed grant funds a year compared with only 20 percent for Bank Group
funds.)
2.23   At this time problems were also continuing with the award of the tenders for the two
slaughterhouses. The Bank had approved awards but these were both protested by a lower priced bidder
(Box 5).
Box 5: Tendering and Evaluating Alternative Designs
The problems that can arise if alternative designs are requested in bidding documents are best
described in the words of Bank supervision staff:
'Procurement for the slaughterhouses was ICB. The tenders for the two turnkey design-
construct projects were written to attract a variety of solutions, and this they succeeded
in doing. However, justifying selection of the 'lowest evaluated bidder' under such
generalized specifications is difficult. Specifically, the [protesting firm's] proposals were
rejected for both tenders because their design was 'too small," as well as for other
technical reasons. The staff is convinced that the correct awards were made, but in the
case of "smallness," it is not easy to quantify. Design is an art as much as a science, and
space needed is a function of labor productivity, end-use of animal products, surging of
throughput rates and other variables. It seems that some minimum sizing should be
specified to avoid the problem of the smallest design bid claiming the award on grounds
of lowest cost. (Very probably, all the bids would then be on the basis of the smallest
specified)."
2.24   Slaughterhouse construction proceeded so well in Cairo that by mid-1983 the contractor was
worrying that "handover" might be delayed as the governorate was not yet ready to operate it. But in
Alexandria the supervising consultant was concerned that the delay of a year in construction was raising
the costs of his services, and as to how he would be paid for the extra time. The main problem was work
stoppages by the contractor when he was not paid by the governorate, and this happened frequently.
Contributing factors were the governorate's bureaucratic procedures and the contractor's site manager,
who was replaced. As construction neared completion, it became apparent that the original design was
too cramped and IDA agreed to finance an extension of the building from the Credit.
2.25   Despite the contractor's fears, the Cairo slaughterhouse went into operation in late 1983, but
immediately attracted supervision attention because, rather than replacing existing unsatisfactory
slaughtering facilities used by private butchers, its low level of operations were dedicated to contract work
for a single public sector company, and for token fees. Technical assistance staff were helping
operations, but staffing and organizational problems remained. Low throughput and low revenues
continued to be a problem during these early operating years, largely because the governorate found it
impossible to close down the old slaughterhouses in the face of the reluctance of the butchers to move



- 12 -
to the new site. Operations at the expanded building were described by supervision staff in early 1987
as very satisfactory. However, as an indicator of operating problems to come, by late 1987 the lack of
spare parts for the slaughterhouses, and the inability of the governorates to import requirements, was
becoming a serious problem. There were reports of both a lack of foreign exchange to finance supplies
and some technical difficulty deciding what was needed and drawing up specifications. It is not clear
whether some of this problem dated back to insufficient spares procurement with the original contracts,
but training had not provided the slaughterhouses with the skills needed to maintain the new facilities
adequately. The Credit was extended in part to allow financing of spare parts from surplus IDA funds.
2.26   By late 1986, and thereafter, the foreign exchange issue dominated both this project and the
second project (which had been approved in March, 1983). The official rate had fallen from LE
0.84/US$ to LE 1.36/US$, a depreciation of 62 percent. Extension of the Closing Date of the second
project was mooted and Bank staff suggested that this should be conditioned on resolution of the exchange
rate issue for both projects. On the Egyptian side, Bank staff reported that "both the sub-borrowers and
the participating Banks are in a quandary"-and that accelerated depreciation of the Egyptian pound was
expected. With respect to the PBs, in the case of PBDAC it was noted that its inability to foresee the
problem can be attributed to inexperience, as this was its first foreign exchange loan, but the other two
PBs were more experienced (with BM taking firm action). (Since the issue was now critical to both
projects, and it was dealt with jointly for both operations, further discussion of drawn out attempts to find
a solution is reserved until later below after the genesis and early life of the second project have been
described.) Suffice to say at this stage that no solution was found during the life of the first project, sub-
borrowers fell into arrears on their payments, portfolio performance deteriorated and, in the absence of
resolution (except for BM), some borrowers started to make early repayments, but eventually many
resorted to legal action (and successfully so according to reports to the audit mission). Even so,
throughout the whole of the project's life it was rated at every supervision as a category 2, "moderate
problems." In the audit's view this is difficult to understand, once the sub-borrowers ran into difficulty
with the declining exchange rate and rising debt loads.
D. Results
2.27   Slaughterhouses. Both Cairo and Alexandria governorates got replacement facilities as planned,
after delay in both cases due to contracting and construction problems-especially in the case of
Alexandria. Operations at Cairo were much below capacity for a number of years, because the private
trade could not be attracted to use the new facilities and the governorate was not able to close down the
old facilities as planned. It was only in 1988 that the transfer of calves and sheep slaughter to the new
Cairo facility brought capacity utilization to around 60 percent. In Alexandria the closure of the old
slaughterhouse, also in 1988, raised utilization there to a comparable level. Available information
suggests that although Alexandria slaughterhouse is enjoying sufficient revenue to cover recurring costs,
Cairo operations are subsidized to an even greater extent. Both governorates are expected to have to
continue to support the two slaughterhouses financially.
2.28   Credit operations. Loans totalled 71, compared with 150-200 expected at appraisal, with only
four sub-loans being made by Bank Misr. Thus Bank Misr continued the pattern of slow commitment
under FVDP, and ceased to participate in either project after 1983. PBDAC made 29 loans and DIB
made 38. Since IDA disbursements at US$18.5 million were just below the US$19 million envisaged,
the average loan size was larger than expected at US$261,000 (Bank Misr contributed to this result with
its four loans averaging US$880,000). Poultry production was the largest category of sub-loan. (There
was no amendment of the Credit Agreement to cover these production sub-projects.) There were 23 (32
percent) poultry loans taking 55 percent of IDA funds.  The second category of sub-loan was
"confectionery," with 17 sub-loans (here the project strategy of adding value to domestic agricultural
products was undermined somewhat by firms using imported sugar, since this was more reliably procured



- 13 -
than government domestic supplies, and of better quality). Together these two categories took 56 percent
of sub-loans and 69 percent of funds. Other significant categories were ice-making and cold storage, feed
mills and packaging materials. The PCR reported (para. 5.04) that the objective of lending a third of
funds to small-scale borrowers was achieved.
2.29   Information in the PCR (May, 1990) was partial but showed that most sub-loan accounts had
substantial arrears. At the time of the audit the situation remained inconclusive as borrowers sought relief
through legal action, some cases had been settled and some remained in court. Either way the costs to
the PBs were significant, although this portfolio was only a small part of their operations. The situation
is discussed further below.
2.30   Other components. Little was done on the proposed study for relocation of the wholesale fruit
and vegetable markets of Cairo and Alexandria. At the Bank's initiative terms of reference for this work
were drafted, but eventually the government requested that the study be dropped as it was no longer a
priority. A general reluctance to hire technical assistance (commonly experienced on many Egyptian
projects) led to delays and only ad hoc compliance with the intent of the project description. Recruitment
was generally delayed and appointments were for shorter periods than planned. Hence the institutional
and training benefits were less than expected. Some TA was provided to the PBs and slaughterhouses,
but contrary to intentions in the SAR and the Credit Agreement, no TA was provided to the 71 sub-
borrowers.
2.31   For the Bank the project was staff-intensive (close to double averages for all Bank projects),
because of implementation problems and the need to review all the sub-projects (the PBs submitted all
sub-loans for prior approval, not just the larger ones as provided in the legal documents). A total of 8.6
staff years were needed throughout the project cycle, which compares with data for the period of 7.0 staff
years for all agriculture projects and 5.9 staff years for all projects in Egypt. (Egyptian projects are
generally on the high side, with the corresponding Bank-wide data being 5.9 staff years for agriculture
and 4.4 staff years for all projects.)
2.32   Issues and lessons for the two agro-industrial credit projects are presented jointly below, following
description of the experience under the second project.
3. SECOND AGRO-INDUSTRIES PROJECT
(LOAN 2243-EGT)
A. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
3.1    The processing of this follow-on line of credit (without any direct financing of slaughterhouse or
the like) followed the conventional project cycle of 'identification, preparation, pre-appraisal and
appraisal," with the documentation exceeding that for the first project. Thus in mid- to late-1981 it
became clear that the faster than expected rate of commitment of funds under the first project was likely
to require that more funds be made available if such agro-industrial financing were to continue. Bank
staff reported "increasing demand for scarce funds." This was not surprising since a year earlier the
government had deemed that food security funding should be made available at 6 percent interest to sub-
borrowers (and as described above, the Bank had agreed to conform with its funds). At the time other
rates had been raised to the 12-15 percent range, which approached the inflation rate.
3.2   It was proposed that the same three PBs as before would participate, with the addition of a fourth
bank-the National Bank for Development (NBD)-as suggested by government. Thus the design was
straightforward, and an incremental approach to defining and presenting the new line might have been
a less time-consuming way of presenting the proposal. In the event about two years of staff time were



- 14 -
charged to processing the second project through board approval. If two staff years truly reflects the
work required to commit more funds to an on-going line of credit and add one more PB (there were no
major construction components such as the two slaughterhouses this time), in the audit's view the process
was inefficient and wasteful of Bank resources.! This compares with a (high) five years of staff time
used (to that point in the cycle) for the first project. Staff inputs will be discussed further below for the
whole set of projects.
3.3    Preparation proceeded rapidly towards planned appraisal in March, 1982. In the papers leading
up to appraisal the main concerns were the undiversified portfolio under the first project, with heavy
concentration in poultry production, on-lending interest rates, and slow institution-building.
3.4    The interest rate issue took most attention, with the added angle that since this was to be an IBRD
loan, and not an IDA credit like the first line, a financial subsidy from government would be needed if
on-lending was to be at 6 percent. At this time the low rate of interest was given as the (distorting) cause
of the predominance of poultry sub-loans under the first project, such that the PB's portfolios for poultry
were by value: DIB-31 percent, PBDAC-62 percent and BM-100 percent. Interestingly the high
subsidy on poultry feed grain was not mentioned as a cause of high loan demand for poultry projects,
perhaps because the 'dual industry" theory (Box 7) continued to be persuasive to Bank staff.) Recent
inflation rates were in the 14-18 percent range, and were expected to stabilize at 15 percent through 1984,
such that the proposed on-lending rate (net of exchange rate risk) was strongly negative in real terms.
There seemed little chance that the policy would change very soon, and so a memo asks-"should
appraisal proceed?" But there was little disruption of the process shown on file with the adoption of the
strategy described hereunder.
3.5    Progress in processing the project hinged on assessing in the field the likely affect on loan
demand of different interest rates, with the possibility of downgrading the appraisal mission to pre-
appraisal, if needed. (In the event, the issue was considered so threatening that, before it left HQ, the
March mission was downgraded to pre-appraisal and then upgraded in the field on the basis of a
promising progress report from the mission.)
3.6    The proposal from the field was to on-lend foreign exchange at commercial rates of interest, and
only the local currency at the government decreed 6 percent rate, indeed the four proposed PBs had
agreed to lend Bank funds at 15 percent. But even this formula gave a weighted interest rate which was
below inflation (a proposed Bank loan of US$80 million on-lent at 15 percent and local funds equivalent
to US$53 million-for a US$133 million total project cost-on-lent at 6 percent, resulted in an overall
rate of 11.4 percent). The interest rate subsidy was justified (with scant concern for the usual economic
efficiency arguments) by the staff on the grounds of: encouraging food production to replace imports,
correcting for taxation of agricultural production and processing, and because rates of return were low
for agro-industry compared with other industries. Furthermore, at the decision meeting stage (April,
1982) after appraisal it was suggested that the 6 percent rate was expected to be raised to 9 percent in
the upcoming budget (but this expectation was not captured in the legal documents).
3.7    The mission met a greater problem with the PBs and government continuing (as in the other
operations under audit) to oppose technical assistance.  The mission hoped that the PBs' and
Government's habitual hubris on this point could be overcome by locating the TA in the Central Bank.
3.8    Quite remarkably, and unaccountably, currency risk did not figure amongst the issues, even
though the devaluation expected in the SAR for the first project (see above) had occurred in September,
B. The Region has noted that this arose because the procedures for processing a follow-up project werm the same as for any
project. There were no shortcuts.



- 15 -
1981 (from LE 0.70/US$ to LE 0.93/US$, a move of 19 percent), and by early 1982 country programs
staff were reporting signs of increasing foreign exchange shortage.
3.9    At negotiations it was agreed that the sub-loan diversification objective be retained; that the first
free limit sub-loans in a category would not be submitted to the Bank for approval if a sub-loan in the
category had already been approved under the first project; that the definition of small borrower be
increased (from LE 200,000 to LE 500,000 of fixed assets, equivalent to US$600,000); that the
proportion of the Loan to go to such sub-borrowers be decreased (from 33 to 25 percent); that the sub-
loan size limit be increased to LE 400,000 (US$475,000), and that further processing of the Loan be
linked to progress in hiring TA under the first project. On this last point it was agreed (as recorded in
a supplemental letter) that hiring of consultants was to be completed by a date three months ahead of
effectiveness, although this was not made a condition of effectiveness.
3.10   After approval of the project by the Bank's board, effectiveness conditions were slow to be met
and the date was extended. One of the problems was that the PBs had not hired the agreed consultants.
However, even so effectiveness was declared on the new date in November, 1983, although the
consultants still had not been hired (no record was found on file of this agreement being modified or
waived, but then it was not a formal condition of effectiveness). From then on there are repeated file
references (mission reports and letters to government and the PBs, etc.) over following years to the
failure to hire this technical assistance, the arrangements are eventually amended by agreement, and some
reduced assistance eventually was obtained. The Bank at first attempted to fight a rearguard action on
this lack of compliance with agreements, by saying that notwithstanding effectiveness it would not process
any more sub-loan approvals until consultants were appointed. (The processing of sub-loans and
associated procurement created volumes of correspondence on the files, much of it to resolve problems
with little sign of an improving trend. This illustrated, ex-post, the need for substantial technical
assistance in the PBs. It is tempting to think that had this resource been available from the outset, and
been used in good faith by the PBs, the inordinate amount of implementation problems would have been
reduced to more reasonable levels).
B. Implementation
3.11   Thus implementation began untidily: there were a large number of proposed sub-projects coming
through in the pipeline, or with the Bank for approval (although Bank staff reported that too many were
poultry investments), but the needed technical assistance was not in place. The potential log jam that had
developed over hiring the consultants was resolved, however, by the Bank softening its position (in
December, 1983) when it agreed to process sub-projects on the basis of telexed assurances from BM &
NBD that they would indeed hire the agreed consultants.
3.12   In the first year (1984), apart from following up repeatedly on hiring consultants, Bank
supervision focussed on the need for a diverse portfolio (or at least more diverse than before), the lending
of a quarter of the funds to small borrowers, the quality of PB handling of sub-project processing, the
need for observance by the PBs of Bank requirements and problems caused by the large number of
communications between the various participants.
3.13   The files for this project and the first one contain mostly volumes of messages on sub-project
approvals and tendering for supplies required by the sub-projects. Given that the PBs, except for NBD,
were familiar for some years with Bank procedures through the first project, Bank staff record some
exasperation that, "Surprisingly, the (PBs) still have some problems with the project regulations and the
pr(,cessing of sub-projects." "Prudent shopping" for supplies (under the $150,000 threshold) through the
three bid system caused endless problems. Bank staff report on the reluctance of owners to use
competitive tendering and of their attempts to "go around it." Procurement problems were such, that a



- 16 -
mission in late 1985 reports holding a procurement workshop with the PBs (taking place in the sixth year
of the first project and the third year of the second project, this was perhaps overdue).
3.14   One mission at this time especially noted that 'procedures and communications at PBDAC leave
something to be desired." In an effort to improve matters the mission went into some detail on telex
procedures to be used to and from the Bank.
3.15   Two events around late 1983 and early 1984 were precursors of trouble to come, and especially
in a major way for the many poultry projects being financed. First, the PBs had been querying whether
it was necessary to do economic rate of return (ERR) estimates for all sub-projects. The March 1984
supervision recommended that ERRs be estimated for all large sub-projects-following the guidelines in
the Minutes of Negotiations. (Later in this account the removal by government of the high subsidy on
feed was to trouble many poultry projects. The Bank reacts by pointing to the absence of ERR
calculations by the PBs as the reason this problem was not foreseen.) Second, the January 1985
supervision mission records in its Aide-Memoire to the PBs that the PBs and their clients are concerned
'about the expected change in the official exchange rate and its effect on sub-loan demand." It was noted
that the issue had already reduced the flow of applications and might have been the reason for cancellation
of some approved sub-projects. The rate at the time was LE 0.83/US$, but moved at the end of January
to Le 1.24/US$, a devaluation of 45 percent. By the end of 1985 there was a notable reduction in the
number of sub-projects being sent to the Bank for approval, and the Bank begins to attribute a slower than
expected rate of disbursement of Bank funds to the exchange rate uncertainty.
3.16   At this time (late 1985) the reaction of the Bank to the impending crisis facing the sub-borrowers
is surprisingly phlegmatic. The supervision report of December 1985 records that: 'In response to
World Bank insistence, the rate applied for future loans and for repayment of past loans may be changed
to about 1.30 to 1.70 to the dollar, requiring the sub-borrower to carry the exchange risk. Sub-borrowers
are cautioned that the 0.84 rate applied is only for accounting purposes and that the exchange risk may
have to be borne in whole or in part by them, should the Government so decide."
3.17   Throughout 1986 the PBs (under both projects) attempted to negotiate individual settlements on
the exchange rate issue with the government, with differing results as Bank staff reported (Box 6).
3.18   The report in this box indicates that the government did not attempt a unified solution to the
problem, but somewhat confusingly dealt with each PB separately. The second half of the second
paragraph in the box (from "Agreement on this issue ...) adopts a reasonable position, in the light of the
sub-borrower's inability to bear the risk alone, and proposes sharing the risk between participants. This
is in contrast to the harder position taken at appraisal (that borrowers were prepared to take the risk) and
a few months earlier when the Bank was "insisting" that past borrowers repay at the depreciated rate of
exchange.
3.19   In contrast to this reasonable position, a memo to files recommends that the next supervision
ensure that the PBs are repaid the foreign exchange equivalent of the loans; that early re-payers be
excused prepayment penalties, and that a risk insurance fee should be charged if borrowers are permitted
to repay at the rate when sub-loans were made.9 (Ihis last was to conform with three other Bank lines
9. The Region has commented: "The supervision missions repeatedly tried to resolve this issue but to no avail, in part due to
conflicting instructions by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Cooperation regarding the relevant exchange
rate for the repayment of loans, resulting in court ritigations. The supervision missions proposed to use an exchange risk
premium to be paid by borrowers in lieu of the exchange risk (which would be borne by Govermnent). Government did not
accept this proposal for the Agro-industries Project (Cr. 988-EGT), although the same proposal was adopted later for other Bank
projects (Small and Medium Scale Industry Loan, Ln. 2458-EGT; Export Development Loan, Ln. 2459-EGT; and Construction



- 17 -
of credit, approved since Agro-industries II, where sub-loans were made in pounds with the risk fee being
the difference between the Bank's lending rate and 12 percent. This was a low fee, considering the size
of the devaluations occurring, and also implied that government took no margin.)
Box 6 - Supervision Report (Credit 988-EGT), October 1986:
Extract on Attempts to Resolve the Foreign Exchange Risk Issue
"With the many beneficiaries who have already borrowed and potential borrowers becoming
increasingly apprehensive about imminent changes in the foreign exchange rate, the pipeline
of new projects is shrinking, and some borrowers repay prematurely, despite substantial
penalties for early repayment. Attempts of the banks to solve the issue have had limited
results. Only DIB has received a letter from the Ministry of Finance (MF) which states that
it wiUl be allowed to apply an exchange rate of US$1.00 = LE.84 to repayments coneerning
loans committed prior to January 5, 1985, and a rate of US$1.00 = LE 1.34 to repayment of
loans committed after January 5, 1985. However, some doubt was expressed by the other
banks concerning the legal value of the letter. PBDAC received a similar letter from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA), stating that repayment of the loans from PBDAC to the
Ministry of Finance should be made on the basis of the premium exchange rate valid at the date
of disbursement of the loan to the ultimate borrower. Apart from the obvious differences
between the two letters, the Ministry of Finance apparently has also referred to certain decrees
when determining repayment schedules of the banks for the outstanding portfolio, notably No.
167/168 dated April 24, 1985 of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Accordingly, the Ministry
of Finance apparently has suggested an exchange rate of US$1.00 = LE 1.38 to fix the
repayment schedules. The other banks have not been able to conclude similar arrangements
with the Ministers of Finance or Economic Affairs.
During a September 24 meeting organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA) as part
of the Sector Implementation Review to discuss these two projects, attended by representatives
of the Ministry of Finance (MF), participating banks, and MEA, it was clear that this issue is
stiU hotly debated, with MF extremely reluctant to assume responsibility for foreign exchange
risks. It was agreed during the meeting that MEA would organize a meeting in mid-October
to reach agreement on an arrangement acceptable to aU parties. If such meeting would not be
successful in resolving the issue, IDA would follow-up in November, and the next supervision
mission would attempt to reach agreement. Agreement on this issue is essential to protect, at
least in part, the borrowers and the banks from excessive future changes in the exchange rate.
Since the ultimate borrowers have no means of hedging against future exchange rate
fluctuations (since they usually are not involved in export operations) it would be unfair to let
them carry the full burden of the exchange risk. Such policy would likely be self defeating as
many borrowers might not be able to repay if the Egyptian Pound is devalued substantially, as
it is expected to do. The best solution would be for MP, the banks and the ultimate borrowers
to assume a share of the risks; in that way widespread bankruptcy of borrowers might be
avoided when exchange rates fluctuate widely."
3.20    By late 1987 there was no overall progress on the foreign exchange issue, with the different PBs
handling their sub-borrowers in different ways, including in conflict with the terms of the project Loan
Agreement. This raised questions at the Ministry of Finance. This variation followed a government
instruction to use a rate of LE 0.84 up to January, 1985 and LE 1.34 from then onwards. The Bank staff
pointed to the probable non-viability of some sub-loans with the addition of an exchange risk fee, but
continued to push for this overall solution to the problem.
Industry Loan, Ln. 2460-EGT)."

3.21   The exchange rate problem was not resolved to the satisfaction of all participants during project
implementation, and during the audit mission the results of various court decisions on individual cases
were still coming through. In general terms, the audit mission understood that sub-borrowers were
making their cases (to have sub-loans restated in pounds at the time of approval) on the basis of
arguments that they received no foreign exchange directly through the loans, and had no foreign exchange
income with which to repay the loan.
3.22   As reported in the PCR, only Bank Misr took firm action to deal with the exchange rate problem:
it made just one sub-loan after 1985 (bringing the total to only nine), then in early 1987 withdrew from
the project, repaid government for project funds and converted its remaining sub-loans into local currency
loans with rescheduling. Other PBs did not fare so well.10
3.23   In mid-1989 the effect on DIB and NBD of the problem and the current situation was summed
up in a supervision report as follows:
"DIB reports a principal and interest collection rate of only 47 percent since the
beginning of the project. The low repayment rate is due to the difficulty experienced by
the sub-borrowers as a result of the significant depreciation of the Egyptian currency.
Only three out of the 58 sub-borrowers are encountering repayment difficulties for causes
other than the foreign exchange burdens resulting from the devalued Egyptian currency.
Similarly, NBD reports a principal and interest collection ratio of only 30 percent for the
first half of 1989. Loan collection is a major problem, caused by the depreciation of the
Egyptian pound:  as a result, many sub-borrowers are under litigation with the
Government and the banks on the issue of the foreign exchange rate to be used for
repayment of the sub-loans. This is a pressing matter needing Government attention."
3.24   Toward the end of implementation a further catastrophic problem hit the many poultry sub-
projects assisted from the loan. Thus, in response in part to Bank urging, in 1989 the government began
the process of removing subsidies from agricultural inputs. Poultry projects were immediately hit hard
as feed prices (about 70 percent of operating costs) rose significantly. Box 7 discusses some further
details of the situation. Notably the Bank's response to this further sub-project crisis was to point
repeatedly to the need for analysis by PBs of sub-project viability at economic prices. At the time of the
audit the PBs saw this experience as the inevitable shake-out of an industry which had expanded rapidly
in response to distorted price signals.
3.25   The Bank loan was closed in June, 1990 when US$24.7 million (30 percent of the original
amount) was cancelled, since sub-loan demand had dwindled. Box 8 comments on wider institutional
aspects of implementation.
C. Results
3.26   Of the reduced disbursements, almost half went to three of the four priority categories identified
in the SAR (poultry, dairy and cold stores-there were no bakery loans). Poultry was again, as in the
first project, the single largest category taking 24 percent of the amount, with dairy taking 20 percent.
The PCR was critical of the 'disproportionate" lending for poultry and attributed the problem in large
part to the failure of the PBs to hire qualified technical assistance to assist portfolio development.
10. DBE has commented that its studies at the time concluded that the solution was rescheduling and capitalizing part of the
debts. It noted also that such problems have now decreased with economic reforn, unification of foreign exchange rates and
the declining trend of interest rates.



- 19 -
Another quarter of the sub-loan amount went to "unspecified/other/miscellaneous processes". The target
of 25 percent of funds going to small enterprises was easily met at 32 percent.
3.27    Amongst the PBs DIB led the way with 69 sub-loans, followed by PBDAC-33, NBD-24, and,
the early withdrawer, BM at 9. Thus total sub-loans were 135, according to PB data. In contrast in
1987, some years before the loan closed, the Bank had received 166 sub-loans for processing. (All sub-
loans were submitted to Bank HQ for approval, creating a great amount of work and paper flow in the
process.) These data could not be reconciled at audit, but appear to result from some sub-borrowers
repaying their loans early or not taking up loans when exchange rate charges and prospects discouraged
borrowing on project terms.
Box 7 - Feed Subsidies and Poultry Sub-projects -
Fimancial Rates of Return
In March, 1987 DIB indicated in a sub-loan proposal that the foUowing feed prices applied:
Price (LE/ton)           Estimated       Subsidized        Subsidy
World         Price in         (percent)
Price           E__yt
Maize                       180            60               67
Cotton seed cake            80             55               31
However, at appraisal such highly subsidized prices for feed grains were not adjusted in the poultry
financial model (Project File, Annex 8), on the grounds that since producers using subsidized inputs were obliged
to seU their output to government at below market prices, most preferred to buy feed at market prices and seU
produce on the open market. On this basis a financial rate of return of 16.1 percent to investment in egg
production was estimated. But this does not explain the high demand for poultry loans. When the data is adjusted
to allow for the possibility that subsidized feed use and market egg prices might account for the high demand for
poultry project financing, a rate of return of 28 percent was obtained. Rates of return at about this level seem
more likely than 16 percent, given the production risks, especiaUy since by rescUing subsidized feed at market
prices of twice or more its cost, entrepreneurs could obtain rates of return exceeding 100 percent without
production risks.
The two-ticrod industry assumed at appraisal now seems fanciful. A more realistic assumption with
respect to the impact of subsidized feed prices would be that feed was fungible in rcsponse to price incentives and
that the poultry industry expansion was overheated at the time, with some inefficient producers kept in business
by the subsidy, such that when the subsidy was removed these producers could not survive with the new price
structure. It seems likely that had the Bank's analysis at appraisal revealed high financial rates of return (because
of subsidized feed), the high demand for poultry sub-projects would have been better understood and the coUlapse
of many firms later, when subsidies were removed, would not have come as such a surprise. But it is difficult
to tell now whether such a better understanding of the poultry industry investment 'bubble' would have modified
the PBs' support for poultry sub-projects.
3.28    Information on performance of the PB's portfolios was available to the audit for PBDAC and
NBD. In the case of PBDAC, under the incentive of minimizing the foreign exchange risk five of the
33 borrowers listed had repaid their foreign exchange loans in full, 18 had made some repayments and
10 accounts had made no repayments. Standard collection ratios (actual/amounts due) were not available.
In NBD's case, 14 of the total of 22 borrowers listed had repaid all their project foreign exchange loans,
five had made some repayment and three borrowers had repaid none of their loans. Again collection
ratios were not obtained. Given the age of many of these loans it was apparent that some further review
and resolution of non-performing loans, to clean up the portfolio, is desirable.

Box 8: The PBs and Institutional Development
Given the more recent emergence in the Bank of institutional development as the lead justification for
credit line support, it is worth commenting on this aspect of implementation. The project concept did not address
wider aspects of institutional growth of the PBs, but concemed itself strictly with the agro-industry credit activities.
(Given the relatively small amount of the Bank Group funds available to each PB, this was probably all that could
be expected.) Methodology and systems to improve agro-industrial lending were provided directly by the Bank
or through the proposed TA (which was not fully taken up). Even so the legal documents required the PBs to
submit audited accounts to the Bank and this was done, although generally delayed. The Bank gave these accounts
sporadic attention through HQ staff reviews, which were quite thorough and detailed-when they occurred. An
example was in 1987 when NBD's audited accounts were reviewed. The memo notes that although the accounts
are "quitc succinct" the following main observations were possible: that NBD has successfully and rapidly
expanded its activities; that it has attracted substantial growth in customer deposits; and that it had maintained a
satisfactory liquidity ratio. However, it had a high level of exposure to contingent liabilities and little information
was available on loan collection performance, loan loss provisions and the sources and applications of funds. No
consistent follow-up on these issues was found on file, and nor was it possible or desirabl given that the project
was only a very small part of NBD's total business and there was little legal basis on which the Bank could pursue
such institution-widc issues.
3.29   The known reluctance of the borrower and the PBs to hire technical assistance (especially when
it must be financed from Bank loans and not grants or low interest IDA funds) led to delayed recruitment
and low use of these funds. Since NBD was new to this activity, training with the assistance of a
consultant financed by the EEC focussed on this PB. The local consultant identified and recruited by the
PBs (in place of an internationally recruited consultant) to help the PBs with portfolio development,
proved disappointing and by mutual agreement did not complete his contract. He was not replaced and
hence this important aspect of the project design was largely unsuccessful.
D. Issues and Lessons Learned (Agro-industry and Second Agro-industry Projects)
3.30   The PCRs for these two projects fairly describe the project experiences and reach conclusions
with respect to project-specific issues with which the audit agrees. The audit takes these issues somewhat
further.
3.31    The PCR for the first project concluded that institution building met with only limited success,
because the banks were unwilling to make full use of the project TA resources. But the audit notes that
the focus was on only the specified line of credit in any case, and a broader approach, as currently
intended to be Bank practice, might have had more impact if the banks were fully committed and it was
adequately buttressed by appropriate incentives. As it was even after ten years the banks (with the
exception of DIB) were not evaluating the impact of the investments financed and did not routinely keep
collection statements in the most useful currently due/collection format. On the foreign exchange issue,
the PCR suggests that both the Bank and the borrower were wanting. The PCR believed that the
slaughterhouse investments were not adequately prepared with respect especially to the concept of a single
central facility replacing several more dispersed smaller slaughterhouses. Implementation and later
management of the slaughterhouses was plagued with management shortcomings. Low usage has resulted
in continuing financial deficits, especially in Cairo. The PCR draws lessons on the need to view credit
operations in the wider context of the financial sector (which is current Bank policy); better evaluation
of slaughterhouse investments (including participation of users); use of economic rates of return in sub-
project appraisal; and a more proactive role for Bank supervision to resolve implementation problems.
3.32   The PCR on the Second Agro-industry Project drew the following lessons:



- 21 -
(a)    Foreign exchange risk-since small borrowers are not in a position to bear this risk,
they should borrow only local currency and buy foreign exchange on the spot market.
The PCR did not comment on who should bear the foreign exchange risk of foreign loans
linked with credit lines, or comment on whether such foreign loans were appropriate in
such circumstances.
(b)    Sub-sector and sub-project reviews need to be thorough where lending is concentrated
in a specific sub-sector, especially to take account of any distorted incentives.
(c)    Consultants need to select "highly competent" staff for technical assistance assignments,
especially where agencies are reluctant to accept such staff.
(d)    The implementation period was overoptimistic.
3.33   The audit views the most important issues and lessons as the foreign exchange risk problem,
interest rates for on-lending and use of Bank staff resources.
3.34   Foreign Exchange Risk. It now seems extraordinary that with currency devaluation expected,
the Bank would require that sub-borrowers bear the foreign exchange risk and that neither the risk
implications would be analyzed nor measures adopted to help sub-borrowers bear the risk. The solution
to the sub-borrowers' problem preferred by Bank staff and the sub-borrowers themselves (that they should
take only local currency loans and purchase foreign exchange in the currency market) does not resolve
who should bear the risk of foreign loans. The position would seem to be that using the fungibility
argument, combined with the point that government has most influence over the exchange rate, the
government is the preferred risk taker. This would also be pragmatic in that any substantial risk ends
up on government account, in most case, in any case. Finally, it could be argued that since government
decides whether to borrow foreign currency, it should take the foreign exchange risk inherent in that
decision." Whether government can pass on the risk to sub-borrowers is a decision it must make, just
as it makes other fiscal decisions.
3.35   Interest Rates. On-lending interest rates are a subject which this audit shows are taken seriously
by the Bank with respect to country management of economic and financial policy instruments. (It will
be seen that in the case of the New Land Project, the Bank held out for its perception of acceptable
interest rates until a meeting between the Egyptian delegation at negotiations and a senior Bank manager,
at which time the Bank agreed to sub-market rates-but rather weakly asking for a policy statement as
a condition.)
3.36   Subsidy Policy. In hindsight, the apparent ease with which the Bank agreed to drop the interest
rate to sub-borrowers from 11 percent to 6 percent (for food security purposes), following government's
policy decision to promote protein production by a subsidized interest rate, was an unfortunate blemish
on the Bank's record with respect to interest rate policy. Not surprisingly credit demand was stimulated
greatly, until the real cost of credit was perceived to be much higher as the foreign exchange risk became
apparent. The Bank handled the interest rate issue weakly in this case too, without justifying on-lending
at a strongly negative real interest rate. A more consistent approach to interest rate issues is desirable.
3.37   The feed subsidy issue was also poorly handled, especially in that the Bank did not adequately
take into account the impact of the subsidy on credit demand and the risks and consequences of subsidy
11. The Region disagree with this suggestion, "since it implies tat Government should be responsible for all exchange rate
fluctuations vis-a-vis PBs. Some reasonable exchange rate risk premium should reflect market conditions and could be adjusted
periodically; this is the approach adopted in the recently approved Agricultural Modemization Project."



- 22 -
removal (Box 7).12 The Bank appears to have been surprised by the course of events (based on the file
record), although the Region has noted more recently that removal of subsidies was expected in an
economy in transition. The role that subsidies play in enterprise profitability and demand for expansion
financing should be an important aspect of credit line appraisal.
3.38   Use of Bank Staff Resource. The intensive use of Bank staff resources to routinely approve,
mostly at headquarters, an array of sub-projects over a period of several years and two projects was both
poor use of Bank staff time and may have substituted for institutional development in the PBs. The legal
documents had provided that only a limited number of the larger sub-loans required prior approval by
the Bank, but the PBs preferred that all sub-loans first be cleared by the Bank. There was no progressive
process whereby after an initial learning period for the PBs, prior-approval was replaced by selective
supervision reviews ex-post, as is a more usual pattern. The PBs may have contributed to this situation
by not sufficiently using the TA that the Bank had judged necessary for portfolio development and to
introduce satisfactory sub-loan processing standards. The suspicion of mistrust of the Egypt process,
which is engendered by this close Bank involvement with lending decisions, is not a good basis for the
Bank-borrower relationship. Similarly the procurement process was unduly labor-intensive for Bank staff.
In both cases, notwithstanding the Egyptians' reluctance to use technical assistance, some less HQ-based
system to provide the necessary input to sub-loan processing and procurement should have been found
(see paras. 7.8 and 7.9 for a suggestion on this point). The discarded concept of a central unit, in some
form, appears in hindsight to have been sorely needed. The lesson is that project designs should take
more care not to over-commit Bank resources to relatively unproductive routine work that could and
should be more efficiently done in-country.
4. NEW LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1083-EGT)
A. Introduction and Identification
4.1    In late 1977 two Bank missions went to Egypt looking for lending opportunities in the agricultural
sector. One was from the central staff and was concerned with poverty alleviation through the rural
development strategy and bore little fruit (another story), while the other reconnaissance mission from
the regional office was briefed to look further at a handful of project ideas. This mission saw the largest
number of possibilities for lending in the government's on-going "new land reclamation" program for
opening up the desert fringes to irrigation using extra water available since the mid-1960s from the High
Aswan Dam (HAD). Investment in the "new lands' competed for resources with investment to improve
the productivity of the "old lands",13 that is the long-established irrigated area, by drainage and
rehabilitation of infrastructure. The Bank was particularly well placed to take a position on priorities in
irrigated agriculture because in 1977 it had agreed to act as executing agency for the UNDP-financed
Master Plan for Water Resources Development and Use. Consequently the Bank was involved with the
planning of the use of Nile waters, and with the issues relating to future irrigation strategy (this point is
of importance to the later issue of reduced water supply for the New Land project)."4
12. The Region has disagreed with this judgement.
13. And also with investments to improve the 'old new lands', i.e. the earlier schemes to irrigate the desert margins, which
were poorly performing.
14. The Region has commented that 'the results of the study did not become available until a very late stage was reached in
the execution of the New Lands Project. Instead of making this connection, the PAR could reinforce a message which the Bank
has repeatedly given to the Egyptian authorities that 'individual project viability is necessary but is insufficient to ensure success.



- 23 -
4.2    At the time the balance to be struck between investments in old and new lands was the major
policy issue underlying the Bank's support for irrigated agriculture. Hitherto, the Bank had taken the
position that Egypt was over-investing in irrigation expansion at the expense of not tackling the serious
problems of the existing irrigated area, chief of which was the lack of drainage infrastructure and
resulting declining yields. Returns to correcting problems in the existing irrigation system were much
higher than from the complex of investments required to bring new land under irrigation. Such land is
relatively distant from the Nile, often required substantial pumping lifts and social and administrative
infrastructure had to be established from scratch-the poor performance of the domestic construction
industry was a recurring problem. Generally, new land schemes were found by the Bank to be on poor
soils, had been inadequately planned and were not provided with drainage. Consequently, although over
one million feddans of new lands had reportedly been opened up, largely by public sector farming
schemes, closer inspection revealed that the areas under production were much less (about 600,000
feddans) than the gross areas involved, and there were doubts about how profitable such schemes were
proving. The schemes were described in Bank documents as being poorly managed, with frequent
changes of top level staff, having long development periods and heavy cost overruns. Housing and
village infrastructure development generally lagged.
4.3    The Bank had therefore steered clear of new land development up to that point in favor of
supporting mainly drainage retro-fitting through four projects for 2.8 million feddans of the irrigated area
(Credit 181-EGT of 1970, Credit 393-EGT of 1973, Credit/Loan 637/1285-EGT of 1976 and
Credit/Loans 719/1439/1440-EGT of 1977).
4.4    The Bank's justification for involvement in irrigation expansion rested mainly on the need for
balanced investment and was summed up in a memo by the Loan Officer in late 1979:
"Although we recognize the need to reclaim new land, we continue to recommend that
the first priority be in developing existing agricultural land [i.e. the "old lands"], where
returns are highest. For social as well as political reasons, some progress has to be made
toward easing the increasing population pressure on the limited agricultural land now
available. Therefore, it is important for Egypt to finance a balanced program of
investments, including funding for the development and the rehabilitation of new land
areas, and to find the most economic and effective method for developing these areas."
Hence this ambiguous statement establishes both a "first priority" and the need to ignore this priority in
achieving a second priority: balanced investment for social and political reasons. The Region has noted
recently that government's switch towards developing new land with smallholder settlement (rather than
public sector large-scale farms) was a further justification for Bank support. The Bank's position on
support of new land development has varied over the years, sometimes inconsistently (Box 9 gives some
examples).
4.5    The first reconnaissance mission was followed by another such mission in early 1978, so named
because an identification mission might have appeared more committed than the Bank wanted to be at the
time. This mission concluded that a "hands-off" policy by the Bank with respect to irrigation expansion
was no longer appropriate. If the Bank was advocating a balance of investments in old and new lands,
then financing of the latter by the Bank was appropriate. On the government's side an "ambitious plan
for land reclamation" had been announced in which the mission saw scope for several Bank-assisted
projects.
Fundamental to success is an assured water supply-thus specific water rcources need to be identified as a component of project
preparation... ' (para. 3.60 of Land Reclamation Subsoctor Review-Rcport No. 8047-EGT."



- 24 -
Box 9 - New Land/Old Land Investment Priorii
Throughout the 1970s new land investment was off the Bank's agenda in favor of investing in drainage of
the old lands. Thereafter, support in the Bank for new land schemes waxes and wanes, and when things changed it
was not always for the best reasons. Thus oven as the Bank was committing itself to the New Land project, the
Agricultural Sector Memo of August 1978 commented that some of the drive for the project came from constraints
the Bank found in identifying projects in the old lands. This seems a weak reason for changing a lending priority,
with the implication that rather than no project, a project that does not meet the highest prioritics is to be preferred.
In the early 1980s the Bank was in no doubt as to where the real prioritics lay. Thus the 1982 report (para.
5.03) of the Irrigation and Land Reclamation Subsector Review mission, which was in the field (November, 1980)
a month before the New Land project was approved, stated the priorities to be:
"First priority for investment should be given to safeguarding the existing
irrigation system, second priority to removing major constraints, such as
drainage, that prevent bringing the Old-New Lands into full production and
third priority to developing New Lands."
Two sentences from the quote from the 1980 economic report (in para. 1.5 above) are also quite clear:
'In the past twenty or thirty years incrcasingly costly schemes of land
reclamation [of "new land"] have been directed toward horizontal expansion.
Yet despite high yields and apparent constraints on the intensive margin of
cultivation, much remains to be done on the old land."
More recently the Bank seems to have (realistically) accepted new land investment as a given (for social and
political reasons) without obvious concern for marginal rates of return. Thus the Land Reclamation Subsector Review
report of February 1990 runs with the mandate implicit in its title by stating in the preface (emphasis added) that "To
expand its agriculture sector, Egypt must to a large extent rely upon expanding its land base. Productivity (yields and
croyvine intensity) is relatively high in the traditional agricultural lands of the Nile Valley and Delta, thereby limiting
the possibilities for growth in these areas." That report seems alone, over the years, in sceing limited scope for
production increases from the old lands, nor even the need to "safeguard" old lands' production. (This 1990 report
also notes that "the implementation of physical land reclamation has become a relatively straightforward, trouble-free
technical experience." This will be seen to contrast with the project experience some years earlier.)
In contrast, the joint Bank/government report of December 1991-"An Agricultural Strategy for the 1990s"
(Report No. 11083-EGT)-makes the reverse case for further effort in the "old lands" and the "old new lands". It
notes that there is considcrable Potential for increasinz Yields in the old lands and that the previously reclaimed lands
(the old new lands) were producing "far below potential".
Most recently the new lands/old lands investment debate seems to have fallen away, with the country
assistance strategy discussion (in Report No. P-6203-EGT, of March 1994) making no reference to it.
4.6     Once the decision was taken to commit Bank staff resources to preparing a new land project, it
did not put to rest the Bank's agonizing over how to justify the change in policy. The government's bias
towards 'newness", as opposed to rehabilitation of existing areas, was noted as a distorting influence,
although the political need to be seen to be providing opportunities for the expanding population was
recognized. Furthermore, less good land than previously thought available was identified (only 21
percent of the gross areas identified had soils suitable for irrigation without substantial additional land
development investment).
4.7     On the positive side, the Bank was encouraged by the government decision that future new lands
developed would be offered for sale to settlers (rather than be farmed by public sector companies) who



- 25 -
would then be responsible for crop development.  In the past the rather 'ad hoc' method of
development-as described in the files-did without formal feasibility studies and was divided into two
phases, for reclamation and crop development, managed by different public sector agencies. Since there
were different performance incentives at work for the two phases, the whole process was seen to be prone
to sub-optimal results.
4.8   In May of 1978, the report of a Bank/FAO-CP mission focused the debate on West Nubariya,
to the west of the Nile Delta, as "most promising", in part perhaps because the Bank was already
involved there through the Fruits and Vegetables Development Project (Loan 1276-EGT of 1976). This
on-going project took water from the West Nubariya Canal and included funds for construction of the
West Nubariya Drain.
4.9    At this early stage the government was thinking of sugarbeet as a major crop, but the Bank
quickly expressed no interest in financing a sugar factory, although other investors took an interest for
a while. This tended to raise concerns in the Bank that the government's recent change of policy towards
free cropping choices might be prejudiced by the need to keep a sugar factory supplied. Although it will
transpire that there is still no sugar factory, the project is usually referred to as "the sugarbeet project"
by many government staff. (Most recently, govermnent staff have reported renewed private sector
interest in a factory.)
B. Project Preparation and Appraisal
4.10   Once the Bank was committed to the project and invested staff resources in getting the project
to the Board (some three staff years in total), the files give an overall impression of how detailed the staff
work is, how nothing is left to chance, and of how serious the Bank is to optimize the operation to the
benefit of the country and the settlers. (The seriousness with which the issues are presented, addressed
and resolved-or often have to be postponed-is impressive throughout. None of the time of the several
reviewers and managers (up to the most senior level) involved in the process is included in the three years
mentioned above.) However, in a generally satisfactory PCR none of this comes through and hence the
process is described in some detail here. Unfortunately, despite this good upstream work, the project was
later to fall victim to many of the implementation problems of earlier projects in the sector. Only one
Bank reviewer thought it worthwhile to note that implementation would be beset by problems-given
experience-no matter how good the design, but this did not temper the Bank's ambitious design.
4.11   The Bank's interest in West Nubariya was shared by UK/ODA, which funded a feasibility study
of an intended net area of 100,000 feddans to grow sugarbeet (for a proposed new factory). The study
was carried out by a British firm. The Bank was consulted while the study was underway and a final
report was presented in August 1979. The SAR notes that:
'Important design decisions reached within these studies included: (a) separation of the
gross area into two zones, suited respectively, for smallholder development and for joint
venture estate farms; (b) choice of surface irrigation of the basin type as being
appropriate for smallholders; (c) selection of a holding size of six feddans; and (d)
estimation on the basis of soil surveys, of the net area capable of being successfully
irrigated.  In addition, a full two years of trials with sugarbeet supported the
recommendation that this could be a successful crop in the region."
4.12   By late 1979 the government was proposing a scheme of 50,000 feddans for Bank funding, all
of it for settlement of the landless. (During implementation the Bank was to be concerned by an apparent
switch, from the SAR design, to choosing graduates as settlers rather than poor farmers, but a file memo



- 26 -
indicates that government's intentions were known to the Bank in 1978.) The project brief of November
1979 (for a pre-appraisal mission) proposed a net area of 48,000 feddans to settle 8,000 families-that
is on 6 feddan holdings, with government to arrange for factories to process sugarbeet and oilseeds. This
brief discussed water requirements, noting that the capacity of the El Nasr Canal (118 cusecs at the
intake) was sufficient at the design water duty (48 m /f/day) for 212,000 feddans net with 24 hour
operation. Only 170,000 feddans net of schemes were then planned or committed for supply by the canal
and hence water supplies were not considered a constraint. Apparently the 118 cusecs supply at the
intake of El Nasr Canal (off-taking from the Nubariya Canal) was assumed without question.
4.13   The brief was less sanguine about the condition of the El Nasr canal, noting that the lining was
in very poor condition in places over the first seven kilometres, with repairs to be financed under the
FVDP.
4.14   In addition this brief raised a long list of other issues, many of which were to prove farsighted:
(a)    The economic rate of return (ERR) may be below 8 percent (but noting that social
returns-settlement of the landless principally-would be higher and that the "pilot
nature" of the project should be recognized). This concern later came close to ending
Bank involvement;
(b)    a financing gap existed, both for the irrigation development itself and for processing
plants;
(c)    coordination of the several agencies involved would be needed;
(d)    compulsory cropping patterns (as elsewhere) were a threat (to keep processing plants
supplied). Would the Bank accept this;
(e)   the local Bedouin population should be compensated (a proposal was needed from
government);
(f)   the affect of the new cooperative law was uncertain;
(g)    Government was reluctant to use expatriate consultants, who were considered essential
to efficient implementation;
(h)    cost recovery from farmers would need to be agreed;
(i)   fann credit terms would need to be harmonized with other Bank-assisted projects; and
(j)   local government arrangements were undecided (the project area was in two
governorates).
4.15   Other points of note in late 1979 as pre-appraisal got underway were:
(a)    while a Project Preparation Facility advance of $1.0 million was approved, its main
purpose would be to refine the ERR of this "marginal project", with the Bank being
"prepared to abandon the project" if it proved sub-marginal. The Senior Vice President
Operations (SVOP) commented that this was the second marginal project in a year in



- 27 -
Egypt, querying 'are we looking in the wrong places." As a result government was
formally advised that Bank would not go ahead if the ERR was unsatisfactory.
(b)   the Swedish Sugar Group (a potential cofinancier of the beet factory) was advised of the
Bank's interest in only the settlement aspect and of the Bank's fear of compulsory
cropping.
4.16   The project was appraised in the field in January/February 1980. The mission's issues paper
dealt with most of the topics raised in the project brief: the low ERR (give weight to social and
employment effects); contract award for canal repairs should be a condition of Board presentation;
government should commit firmly to coordination committees; since there was no sure financing for
processing plants appraisal would examine "with" and "without" alternatives; government needed to be
persuaded to allow farmers to determine cropping patterns; the cooperative system needed to be freed
from government control; Bedouin would be offered plots (with proposals a condition of negotiations);
interest rates for farm loans should be as used in other lines, and local government should evolve by
phased assimilation into the national system. The most important point, however, was to recommend
splitting the development in to two phases, with the Bank considering Phase II in three years' time. This
strategy was needed to overcome perceived implementation constraints and the fact that funding for half
of foreign exchange costs had not been identified.
4.17   Apart from agreeing to the mission's proposals, it was also decided (decision memo of March
1980) that award of the contract for canal repairs should be a condition of effectiveness (Board
presentation was considered too optimistic); that the legal status of cooperatives should be clarified; and
that operation and maintenance (O&M) costs should be recovered (related to water use). However, the
decision memo was labeled as "interim", apparently to keep issues open for further discussion. Hence,
within a month the Bank had decided that government should invite bids for repairing El Nasr Canal
before Board presentation, and that alternative cropping patterns should be reviewed that would and
would not require substantial investment in processing plants (apparently this analysis had not been done
yet, either by the feasibility consultants or the appraisal).
4.18   Despite the large number of substantial design and implementation issues, the estimated ERR
caused the main concern at this time. In hindsight this seems surprising given that the methodology is
not perfect and that the number itself tends to vary more with conceptual assumptions than with the values
employed (indeed in this case even the cropping pattern was an assumption since field trials had not been
completed). Even so the SVPOP's office comments that the project may not go ahead if the ERR is
below 10 percent, central agricultural staff record in a memo their deduction that the ERR is in the range
of 10 or 11 percent, and the region responds to the SVPOP that it is now estimated at 10.7 percent and
recommends proceeding with the project. The project is saved.
4.19   At the yellow cover review stage (i.e. before clearance to negotiate) cost recovery became the
lead issue, more so because this was the first Bank-assisted irrigation project in Egypt. Recovery of both
O&M and capital costs was recommended, mainly because this was the beginning of development for
much "new land" and pumping costs were going to be high. The review also noted that experience
suggested that the rate of implementation is usually slow (untimely local funds, delays in the award of
contracts, key decisions would not be taken promptly by government and staff turnover would be high),
and that the Bank should "foresee unscheduled delays."
4.20   On cost recovery, a 1979 policy required that land reclamation costs be recovered, but
government had yet to accept that O&M costs should also be recovered. Similarly, a potential sticking



- 28 -
point was that the Bank wanted an 11 percent interest rate for medium term credit, whereas it was
currently 8 percent for agriculture (implying a sectoral subsidy).
4.21   As the project headed towards negotiations the Loan Committee required that a study determine
'the most economically advantageous cropping pattern .... including the desirability of sugarbeet
growing," and that agreed recommendations be implemented. Other Loan Committee demands were for
a higher level of cost recovery, and (addressing the poor implementation issue) that establishment of the
Project Unit be a condition of Board presentation (rather than of effectiveness), although the region
successfully argued to leave it as a condition of effectiveness.
4.22   At this point there were two blows: the possibility of having to reschedule negotiations to await
issue of the invitation to bid for the canal repairs, and one potential cofinancier (CDC) withdrew citing
that settlers can make only a very small contribution to capital costs.
4.23   The project was in difficulty in late summer of 1980, as the files record government senior staff
views:
(a)   that government was unlikely to agree to raise the interest rate;
(b)   that cost recovery (at the level demanded by the Bank's Loan Committee) of all O&M
and half of capital costs, would face great difficulty-"Nile water had been free for
centuries";
(c)   the completion of the rest of the El Nasr Canal (needed to served the project) was facing
delays; and
(d)    although government had accepted the design water demand for the project (48
m3/net/f./day), 'Government has several times announced an ambitious plan for
expansion of irrigation based on a much lower water demand per feddan" (emphasis
added)-totalling 2.8 million feddans by the late 1990s. (his potential threat to the
project's water supply was to be overcome by an assurance at negotiations.)
4.24   Negotiations in October could not resolve the interest rate issue to the Bank's satisfaction and
eventually a meeting was arranged between the SVPOP and a senior representative of government. The
case for special treatment of agriculture was made on the government side and Bank management
responded by making Board presentation conditional on receipt of a "comprehensive statement ... on
interest rate policy and strategy in the agriculture sector." This was to be delivered by the end of
November.
4.25   Following negotiations the Bank sent a letter to a senior government official arguing for a higher
rate of interest. An extract presented in Box 10 explains the Bank's position on the issue.
4.26   More recently, the Bank has addressed such multi-sectoral issues as interest rates on a broader
front than through individual projects. When the government's statement arrived, in good time, it
properly related agricultural sector interest rates to the rest of the economy, noted the need for Egypt to
come into line with international rates and that both deposit and lending rates had ben raised 2 percent
over the previous two years. An interest rate subsidy for agriculture was related to low controlled prices
for output. This last point was seen by the Bank as the best place to focus efforts towards change, but
it "needs a time dimension."

Box 10: Interest Rate for Medium-Term Farm Credit
(extract from Bank letter to Government, October 1980)
'There is one feature of the proposed project which remains a cause of concern to us,
however. This is the provision of credit for the purchase of farm machinery at an interest
rate of eight percent. This rate is low, not only in comparison with the rate of inflation
in Egypt but also when compared with other interest rates in the economy. Your
delegation explained to us that the governmnent did not believe it would be appropriate to
change the rate of interest for agricultural machinery under the New Land Development
Project. However, as Mr . ..... must have informed you, before presenting this project
to our Board we would appreciate receiving a statement from your government which
would help us to understand the rationale for this low interest rate, to place it in the
context of the government's overall policy on interest rates in agriculture, and to assess
the direction in which that policy is likely to evolve in the future."
'As you are well aware, the Bank has undertaken a great deal of research and analysis of
the effect of low interest rates in general and in the agriculture sector in particular. While
our experience does indicate that there may be special situations in which low interest rates
can be justified, the vast weight of evidence suggests that the potential for mis-allocation
of resources which may flow from a regime of subsidized interest rates outweighs the
possible benefits to the users of such credit. The use of subsidized interest rates to
compensate farmers for the losses they suffer through price controls simply adds a new
set of distortions to an existing one. When interest rate subsidies are applied to capital
goods and machinery in a developing country such as Egypt, it becomes a matter of
special concern that excessive mechanizationand capital-intensivetechniques of production
could increase unemployment in the rural areas and worsen income distribution.'
'Nor is it only on the side of resource allocation that the policy of low interest rates for
agricultural mechanization, and indeed for the sector as a whole, is disturbing. In current
inflationary conditions policies that institutionalize low interest rates will constrain the
growth of private savings and will make it more difficult to achieve the rapid growth and
investment targets that Egypt wants and needs to achieve."
"We recognize that this particular item is a small component of a large project, but we
fear that it will be forming part of a pattern of increasing subsidies and price controls with
the attendant economic and social costs of these in the longer term. I hope that your
response will enable us to assure our Board that the Government of Egypt recognizes the
need to reduce progressively these distortions and proposes to move in directions which
will permit prices and interest rates to serve as a better guide to the kinds of productive
investment which the country needs for continued rapid and equitable growth."
C. Board Approval and Objectives
4.27   The project was approved by the Board in December 1980. The region's draft statement to the
Board highlights three new features of the project design: the smallholder settlement pattern, improved
design of the irrigation and drainage systems and three-tiered management (which should provide a more
effective extension service). Given the early agonizing over the relative low returns to irrigation
expansion, compared with rehabilitating the existing irrigated area (the "old lands"), the statement to the
Board ends on a strongly contrasting note:
"In our dialogue with the government and in the consideration of specific projects, we
will continue to emphasize the importance of identifying investment priorities and of



- 30 -
achieving adequate economic rates of return-and thus continue to urge the government
to proceed with a new land development prograrn that provides the greatest benefit to
Egypt's economic as well as social development."
The draft presentation stated also that depending on experience with the project, additional assistance for
new land development would be considered.
4.28   As approved the project objectives were to: (a) increase agricultural production; (b) improve
income distribution and generate employment, and (c) to initiate a process for restructuring and
strengthening agricultural institutions in the reclaimed lands (Credit Agreement), and "which would have
demonstration effects and would become the basis for policy improvements in the new lands' (SAR, para
3.04).
4.29   Components were:
(a)    Construction of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and land levelling (in two phases
of 7,200 and 17,000 feddans, totalling 24,200 feddans);
(b)    Construction of settlements, utilities and roads, and settlement of about 4,000 [landless]
smallholders;
(c)    Supply and distribution of agricultural machinery and equipment, and establishment of
service facilities;
(d)    Field trials and training of settlers and extension staff; and
(e)    Bilharzia control (continuing the program in Middle and Upper Egypt, and extending to
Lower Egypt, including the project area).
4.30   On the sugarbeet issue the SAR comments that: "depending upon further studies, sugarbeet may
be a profitable crop in the area and if a sugar factory is constructed, project settlers are expected to
become major beet suppliers" (para. 3.03). Compared with its earlier coolness towards the sugarbeet
option, this more upbeat comment possibly reflects a staff visit a few months earlier to the cropping trials
site-viz. "potential for sugarbeet is considerably greater than assumed in the [draft] appraisal report."
(his remark may be recalled below when the trials are described as unreliable following another visit
to the site some years later by a Bank agriculturalist.)
4.31   In addition to routine covenants, the Credit Agreement required that the Government establish
a monitoring and evaluation system; determine the most "economically advantageous" cropping pattern
(including whether sugarbeet growing was desirable) and implement such recommendations; recover
operating and maintenance and the capital costs of land reclamation works and settlers' houses; charge
normal rates for utilities, and continue to support the bilharzia control program.
D. Implementation
4.32   The account of implementation in the PCR refers to "serious implementation difficulties in both
phases," but the language in which the details are laid out over 2-1/2 pages does not do full justice to the
picture that emerges from the files and from interviews. From the beginning things started to go wrong
at such a rapid pace that the substance and realism of the appraisal process is called into question. This



- 31 -
is more so since the experience in Egypt was by all accounts not unusual, especially for the agricultural
sector.
4.33   Thus a mission reports three weeks after Board approval that the tender for El Nasr Canal repairs
has failed-there were only two high priced bids (awarding the contract was a condition of effectiveness)
and that government was reconsidering the possibility of using sprinkler irrigation (the engineering design
for the irrigation layout was specifically for a 24-hour gravity system using basins). (The reasons for
promoting sprinkler irrigation are still not clear, since trials had shown that water use efficiency was
lower with sprinklers, capital costs were higher and there were significant technical and practical
problems.) 1
4.34   Eventually credit effectiveness was declared only four months late (October, 1981) by the simple
expediency of the Bank waiving the condition on contracting the canal repairs. The files show staff
stating at the time that "in view of assurances received .... (we) do not foresee any further problems."
(Some 13 years later the El Nasr Canal repairs have still not been completed, but ironically the need has
become less pressing as substantial cuts in water availability at the canal entrance have reduced flow to
levels where the danger of complete collapse is much reduced. Irrigation supplies are discussed further
below.)
4.35   Implementation was delayed, erratic, inefficient and crisis-prone. Instead of playing a watchful,
supporting role during this period, Bank staff were constantly required to reign in unexpected and
unacceptable initiatives by Egyptian staff, urge return to the agreed scheme of things and apply pressure
to proceed in a consistent direction according to agreed plans. This seemed to have been customary-a
file comment about the record on new land development prior to the project refers to an ad hoc approach,
and a management consultant reports to the Bank that planning concepts and follow-up are very weak,
if not ignored by project staff. Problems included failure to use the appraisal report as the guideline and,
moreover, failure to follow some of the important provisions included in the legal documents. This last
failure refers particularly to establishment and operation of project institutions, specifically the Project
Unit (more below), the extension service, the farm credit system, construction supervision and inter-
agency coordination. With practically all the main functionaries of the project design not in operation
at all, or only much delayed and imperfectly, project implementation and operational management relied
on day-to-day instructions from the General Authority for Rehabilitation Projects and Agricultural
Development (GARPAD) in Cairo.
4.36   As background, some main points of interest and milestones during implementation were as
follows:
(a)    in March, 1982 the Bank expresses satisfaction with progress on the crop trials
supervised by consultants (yield potential better than in appraisal report, proposed
irrigation method confirmed, adequate leaching in two years, no advantage to sprinklers
over other methods, but lack of participation by Egyptian counterpart staff);
(b)    by May 1982 there had been little progress on the repair of El Nasr Canal and there was
a risk of losing funding from Credit 1276-EGT, which was due to close;
15. The objections to sprinkler irrigation were based on the consultants' findings: that there were no water savings on these
highly calcareous soils (soil capping was a problem); the piped layout was more expensive to install and would incur higher
operating costs (mainly energy for pumping); with the traditional 24-hour canal supply system, reservoirs would have to be added
to store night water, and that a sprinkler system was more difficult to operate and maintain. GARPAD staff have commented
more recently that parts of the area are suitable for sprinklers.



- 32 -
(c)    a second New Land project (NLII) for Bank support was being discussed (to complete
the West Nubariya development) and it was suggested by Bank staff that letting of the
contract for canal repairs would be a "condition of pre-appraisal' (proceeding with NLII
was later tied more broadly to progress on NLI);
(d)    during 1982 four cases of deviation from agreed actions cause problems: (a) reverting
to following the consultants' feasibility study rather than the appraisal report for detailed
designs, (b) departing from the bilharzia control plan, (c) standard tender documents not
being used, and (d) proposal to split Phase II of the project into three construction
contracts;
(e)    GARPAD decides to terminate the consultants running the cropping trials, with the Bank
protesting that trials need one more year of consultancy for completion. GARPAD
termination letter (January 1983) cites poor performance and lack of training of Egyptian
staff. Bank requests new expatriate consultants be hired;
(f)    GARPAD suggests that a rotation with one third under sugarbeet would be most
profitable to settlers, while Bank counters that there is no income difference, with or
without sugarbeet, and that the choice is dependent on factory construction;
(g)    in February, 1983 Bank agriculturalists report that: (a) the appraisal was wrong to
reduce the soil leaching period, and (b) that uneven growth in plots at the trials farm
probably invalidates most experimental results. Poor experimental practice is cited;
(h)    in March, 1983 a Bank internal memo recommends postponing pre-appraisal of NLII
stating that the economic rate of return is low;
(i)    in January, 1984 a Bank supervVi.iir letter to government expresses concern with slow
implementation rate and the poor quality of construction work, but NLII pre-appraisal
scheduled for following month (mission reports that NLII may not be viable);
(j)    in August, 1984 a Bank supervision letter again criticizes the quality of construction
work, recommending that supervision of the contractor must be improved;
(k)    Bank advises government (September, 1984) that NLII should be postponed, possibly
until development of the adjacent new Ameriya City makes the rate of return more
attractive. Government responded within weeks with a further request for assistance,
suggesting that the ERR was over 10 percent (GARPAD reported to the audit that Phase
HI-as the NLII area is known-was almost finished using local funds, with about 15,000
feddans being settled);
(I)    supervision records of July and September, 1985 note that PU still not fully operative,the
Project Director is not full time on the project, and that construction is slow and of poor
quality;
(m)   the Bank sends a higher (than usual) level letter (November, 1985) expressing concern
over poor contractor performance, poor planning and management of the project, and that
a part of the project area has been settled by squatters;



- 33 -
(n)    in 1985 an expatriate management adviser is seconded to GARPAD, but reports
pessimistically on chances of improvement;
~)    during 1986 SPN reports note canal repairs proceeding under two contracts, but that a
third contract is in difficulty;
(p)    GARPAD seeks and receives Bank agreement to selecting graduates as settlers, instead
of landless poor (eventually, all settlers in Phase II are graduates);
(q)    in August, 1987 a supervision mission reports that work on two contracts for canal repair
is halted by technical problems, that the PU is still not functioning as planned, that Phase
I settlers are not receiving the intended extension services, that the contractor on Phase
II is "doing quite well" and that the bilharzia program has been successfully completed;
(r)    the credit closing date (December, 1986) is extended for a year (with later further
extensions by two years to December 1990, mainly to allow completion of procurement);
(s)    through 1987 and 1988 implementation proceeds with one major procurement of
machinery and equipment causing problems, but otherwise relatively smoothly (cattle
procurement is considered as an extra item, machinery distribution and credit
arrangements cause problems, the PU improves, but El Nasr Canal operations are said
to need improvement);
(t)    in October, 1990 the final supervision reports that the extension service remains poor,
that graduate settlers are performing less well than earlier settlers,16 but that project
production is impressive (even with little credit being available), and that monitoring and
evaluation is systematically tracking settlement patterns and production tends.
4.37   In summary the main factors that contributed to the poor implementation record were:
(a)    Government staff were never fully committed to the project as appraised, to the project
organization arrangements and implementation plan, and to the day-to-day procedures
needed to implement a complex set of activities. That conclusion was reached on the
basis of the substantial amount of materials on file dealing with implementation problems
and the nature of the problems.
(b)    Procurement of machinery and equipment to implement and operate the scheme was
greatly delayed by extraordinarily slow processing of routine documentation, the failure
to learn and apply agreed procurement methods (especially ignoring requirements in the
legal documents for Bank review of tender documents). This last problem persisted
throughout the long implementation period, with a final procurement of equipment
(without observing the agreed review process) leading to the need for another extension
of the credit.  (The PCR  suggests that as GARPAD  became familiar with bank
procurement guidelines, generally slow procurement improved. However, the files
indicate that there were continual procurement problems throughout.)
16. The lower production on graduates' farms is partly a function of their having less (if any) family labor available and
therefore concentrating on field crops (cereals, etc.) rather than labor-intensive vegetables. All the selected graduates were
meant to be from farm families, but only some of them were agricultural graduates. Hence their agricultural skills may be less
than those of older settlers who were previously tenant farmers.



- 34 -
(c)    Supervision of contractors was very weak, if not non-existent. The PCR commented that
"on-site implementation was almost casual" and the files confirm that observation.
GARPAD took the position in communications that (public sector) contractors did not
need supervision during the term of a contract. Consequently there is much comment on
the files about poor quality work, the need for better supervision, and eventually a round
of major restitution work had to be organized to bring works up to standard. Even so,
the audit learnt that some Phase II works have still not been formally handed over
(because of quality problems) and retention money has not been paid to the public sector
contractor.
(d)    The Project Unit (PU) was not established as planned. Although the Bank accepted in
1981 that the condition of effectiveness on the establishment of the PU (including
appointrment of its three top staff) had been met, this proved to have been only a token
action by government. As late as mid-1987 (6-1/2 years after Board approval) a
supervision mission reported that (despite earlier Bank pressure) the PU was still not
operating as intended, with its head without authority or budget, and only one section
.well staffed and organized."  This functioning part of the PU, the community
development section, was responsible for settlement activities-where there was no
contractor involved. In late 1987 a supervision report notes that the PU was being
strengthened, but by then the extra costs of weak project management and the poor
quality of implementation were bygones.
4.38   On the supervision of contractors issue, GARPAD commented in Part II of the PCR that the
appointment of a resident site manager only some years into project construction is normal practice,
usually at the time when the contractors are ready to hand reclaimed land over to the authority. During
the reclamation contract, GARPAD relies on its regular resident staff in the Nubariya administrative area.
GARPAD has a decentralized management system and in any case such problems as there were are
"normally expected in a new large project" (para. 30 of the PCR). References in Bank files to experience
on other Bank-assisted projects in Egypt indicates that problems such as those encountered by the project
(construction delays and poor quality of work) are common and were foreseeable. (It may be also
recalled that the Bank had earlier commented that new lands development in the past had been ad hoc and
haphazard, and that this was intended to be the first new land scheme carried out on a systematic basis.)
This suggests to the audit that GARPAD's management of the project was, at the PCR states, too distant
and weak on controls, monitoring and follow-up. This deficiency is more serious in that it was
foreseeable. Whatever the opinions of different participants may be on this issue, implementation
performance clearly did not match the expectations of the Bank (which may have been unrealistic) and
these failings may be assumed, in the audit's view, to have increased the costs of an already capital
intensive type of development. For its part the Bank should have taken a tougher stance, and elevated
the matter with more effect than it did.
E. Results
4.39   Although implementation was delayed and more plagued with problems than it need have been
(had the project design and the Bank's normal procedures been followed more routinely), the eventual
outcome at completion when the PCR was written was impressive. The irrigated area had been developed
and settled,17 housing and physical infrastructure had been provided, and production was reported to
be meeting or surpassing appraisal projections. On this basis the PCR re-estimated the ERR for
agricultural components at 13.3 percent, including 60 percent of project costs (i.e., excluding the social
17. The Region has noted that on other schemes settlers had abandoned their land.



- 35 -
considered, as at appraisal, to be incurred anyway if the settlers remained at their old site), and 9.6
percent with all costs included (compared with 10.7 percent at appraisal). The bilharzia control program
in addition was satisfactorily implemented (under supervision by Bank staff-and their consultants-from
the appropriate technical department) and can be assumed to have an ERR no lower, and probably much
higher than for the agriculture component.
4.40   However, by the time the audit mission was in the field (July, 1993) there had been some major
changes in the project's prospects because of water-shortage, much as had been feared in the PCR but
for a different reason. Thus the PCR section on sustainability (para. 1.30) started out: "the lifeline of
the project is the Nasr Canal and the greatest risk is [reduced] irrigation water supplies." But the PCR
saw the main risk as keeping the canal from collapsing (since the repair work had not been completed)
and in the maintenance of the pump stations. Although that risk remains (until the replacement canal is
completed), the risk that was not foreseen was that supplies from the West Nubariya Canal would be
insufficient during summer to allow the El Nasr Canal to operate at its design capacity. Summer supplies
are now so low that Irrigation staff rotate supplies to project canals every two weeks rather than weekly.
Furthermore, levels are as much as 90 cm. below design which has required reconstruction of inlets to
ensure supplies.
4.41   This water shortage issue should be no surprise to the Bank. As early as 1983 the Bank report
"Selected Issues in Agriculture, Irrigation and Land Reclamation" (Report No. 4133-EGT) reworked the
water balance, in the Water Master Plan, and concluded that there was enough irrigation water until the
early 1990s. The report sounded a strong warning, however, that the government's plans to develop 2.2
million feddans of new lands "are overambitious, not to say unrealistic. It is evident that there is a lack
of overall water planning perspective ...." For example, for a recently completed "new land scheme",
"that a water duty of 7,000-8,000 m3 per feddan would be sufficient, whereas some 10,000 m3 are
required for 200 percent cropping intensity on desert soils" (para. 3.14). (More recently, in this context,
the Bank/government report "An Agricultural Strategy for the 1990s" (December, 1992) recommends a
more modest new lands program "within the limits of assured water supplies".)
4.42   Of course, water shortage (in summer) has reduced production, according to Egyptian staff,
although data was not yet available. Inspection by the audit mission suggested that with extensive fallow
areas the summer cropping intensity was much less than would be required to achieve the over 200
percent annual cropping intensity shown in the PCR (Table 5). (Hence, the 9.6 percent economic rate
of return quoted in the PCR must now be on the high side because of changed circumstances-data was
not available to recalculate the ERR.) Reducing the area planted when water supplies are short or
unreliable is the logical reaction, rather than spreading supplies and risking serious moisture deficit
stress-especially with graduate settlers where there is also a family labor constraint. Moreover, the
irrigation system operation problems have increased substantially since the rotation interval was doubled
and the level in the canals fell. There were always some of the common problems of such gravity
layouts-uneven distribution and shortage of water in tail end areas, which led to inequities to farmers
(and consequent reactions), but matters have now become more severe. The water supply issue is a
national problem beyond the scope of this audit. In political terms there are extreme pressures to "spread
water" more thinly so that more people get some benefit (and GARPAD itself is implementing yet more
schemes drawing water from both West Nubariya Canal and El Nasr Canal), but the efficiency issue of
higher returns to rehabilitating existing schemes still holds.
4.43   Two ironic consequences of low canal supplies is that the danger of catastrophic failure of El Nasr
Canal is greatly reduced compared with operating it at full capacity (earlier repair attempt were
abandoned in favor of by construction of a replacement canal). Similarly, there was some pride, in Bank
circles at least, that the project was to be the first one in Egypt to have drainage installed from the outset,
thus avoiding the widespread waterlogging and salinity problems which arose from liberal use in the Old



- 36 -
Lands of increased water supplies from High Aswan. (here was much concern expressed by Bank staff
during implementation over delayed construction of the drainage system.) Now, with reduced irrigation
supplies there is little, if any, downward percolation and the drainage system will be of little use, if at
all. With much lower water supplies being applied over time, the need for drainage disappears as fear
of a rising watertable should be a thing of the past.
F. Issues and Lessons
4.44   The PCR found that the appraisal mission was over-optimistic on the implementation schedule,
especially for such a complex project; that project management was weak, loosely coordinated and
insufficiently staffed; that appraisal failed to settle the problem of PBDAC requiring land titles (as
collateral for credit) from settlers who lacked them; that the public sector construction industry (which
was likely to win bids) was not appraised (including that some companies were supervised by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) and were thus peers of GARPAD); and that the training
farm plan was unrealistic. Lessons learned concerned the need for (i) realistic implementation schedules;
(ii) strong on-site management; (iii) credit for settlers; (iv) guidelines to ensure that public companies
meet contract conditions; and (v) realistic institutional plans meeting project needs.'
4.45   The audit highlights issues relating to sector priorities, the water supply debacle, implementation
problems, project design details, and the performance of the Bank.
4.46   Sector Priorities. The justification for supporting the New Land Project now seems particularly
weak, especially since the outcome of a completed scheme without adequate water supplies suggests a
low economic rate of return, no matter that social benefits (in terms of settlers on new irrigable land) are
substantial. The audit believes it was a mistake for the Bank to support new land development, and it
is noticeable that there was no follow-up project.
4.47   Water Supply Problem. The outcome of the investment is now in doubt as the planned water
supply is not available, but it was too early to get hard information on what effect supply shortages is
having. Clearly resolution of the West Nubariya Canal over-commitment problem i urgent-especially
as more schemes are being implemented using this source of irrigation supplies.
4.48   Implementation Problems.  The poor implementation record of the project was a great
disappointment, although foreseeable. The main overt justification for Bank support of the New Land
project was that it would be better planned and implemented (presumably because of Bank presence) than
the large area of new land developed by government previously. It was thus doubly frustrating that
planning and implementing were so beset with problems and that the final outcome is uncertain while
irrigation supplies are reduced.
4.49   Project Design.  Important aspects of the project design were not sufficiently advanced at
approval, and apparently not fully agreed by the Egyptian authorities, given that they were not adhered
18. The Region has commented that: 'The single most important aspect which affected the performance of land reclamation
[was thatl land reclamation was a political football within the Govemment and, as para. 1.08 of the SAR notes, "(A)t one time
or another, the implementation of land reclamation has been the responsibility of four different Ministries or combinations of
Ministries, which have been reorganized numerous times, the latest being in May 1980 when the autonomous Ministry of Land
Reclamation, re-estabLished in 1978, was combined with the Ministry of Housing." And, the SAR goes on to state how these
frequent changes have resulted in indecision, slowed down the implementation process, and varying degrees of confusion about
policy. It was not until mid-1980s that land reclamation was brought under the Minister of Agriculture and even now it is not
fully integrated into that Ministry. There have been numerous Chairmen of GARPAD during the life of the project. Frequent
changes in GARPAD's senior management and the shifting of land reclamation from one Ministry to another should help clarify
the lack of total commitment of GARPAD to the project design and implementation plan.'



- 37 -
to but went off in a different direction. (Examples are the attempt to switch from surface/basin irrigation
to sprinklers and the attempt to revert to design features in the feasibility report which had been modified
at appraisal.) Credit arrangements were not sufficiently settled to the extent that PBDAC's need for land
titles for collateral was unexpected. Similarly the choice of graduates as settlers seemed to surprise the
Bank, even though a Bank manager had recorded earlier that this was government's intention. Cost
recovery was never a realistic possibility to the extent the Bank proposed, given the record of little direct
cost recovery in the past. This indicates appraisal weakness, but also this is one of those difficult issues
which is seldom resolved in the context of a single project.
4.50   Most seriously, however, this was an irrigated settlement scheme which was constructed without
the cropping pattern having been determined by field trials. The sugarbeet option was particularly
worrisome, except that on paper it seemed (implausibly?) not to make any difference to farm returns, but
depended on whether the factory is built or not. Since the integrity of such a scheme depends a great deal
on the strength or otherwise of the cropping pattern, the failure of the trials program, and moreover the
failure of the Bank to pick up on this problem sufficiently early, is of concern.
4.51   Performance of the Bank. The Bank has long supported this type of complex project (irrigated
settlement schemes in arid areas), although not very often (perhaps given the complexity of such
projects), but with a record of mixed success. Its participation in this case seems to have been
particularly ineffective in achieving the standard of implementation performance which is needed to get
these types of project off to a good start. Generally speaking the Bank allowed the borrower too much
latitude for its own good-and the quality of the operation suffered as a result. The intractibility of some
of the problems is recognized, but it seems now that problems were not elevated significantly in both the
sense of the level of Bank and country management that was involved and the level of leverage used by
the Bank to get the needed action. The Bank was too soft on Egypt failing to perform to expectations."9
4.52   Bank implementation assistance was insufficient for such a complex project. In particular, project
start-up was not given adequate attention by the Bank. There was no "project launch workshop" (then
just beginning to be used by a few operational units, and now standard in some parts of the Bank) and
the first formal supervision mission (May, 1982) did not take place until a year and a half after Board
approval (or 6 months after effectiveness). Although the files indicate that Bank staff did visit the country
on project business (including the responsible division chief), staff time recorded for supervision was
extraordinarily low for the first 18 months of such a complex and new type of project for Egypt. Up to
June 1982 only 11.2 staff weeks were charged (3.2 in FY81 and 8.0 in FY82). Thus the Bank must
accept some responsibility for early problems in that inadequate resources were applied to getting the
project off to a good start. Over the next four years, FY83-86, staff weeks averaged about 15 on
supervision-slightly above Bank norms. The files show that even this level of Bank input, which in
hindsight seems inadequate, was driven mostly by the need to address urgent implementation problems
(especially on procurement) and thus was reactive rather than planned.
4.53   The important lessons learned from this experience concern:
(a)   the need for adequate appraisal and firm agreement with the borrower on important
aspects of the project design;
(b)   the need for the Bank to follow up with strength and determination to deal with issues
affecting the efficiency of an operation; and
19. Thc Region has commented that representations were made at a high level, but they were not effective.



- 38 -
(c)   the need for the Bank to stick to its sector priorities, unless there is a substantial reason
to change priorities, rather than make an unconvincing exception as was done in this
case.
5. FISH FARMING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT llll-EGT)
A. Introduction
5.1   In the late 1970s government gave high priority to fish farming development to help contain the
increasing food gap and to make use of land and water which were unsuitable for irrigation purposes.
Fish consumption was low in Egypt and declining, with increasing imports replacing much lower
production from marine fisheries.' Low-quality waterlogged and saline soils, combined with use of
saline drainage water, were seen as two resources which could together be made productive through
aquaculture. Government plans in the late 1970s called for 60,000 feddans of fish farm development over
a decade. As a basis for such enormous and rapid expansion, and although Egypt already had some
35,000 feddans of fish farms, a need was seen for a "significant demonstration of modern aquaculture
practices". About 7,700 feddans of existing fish farms were government owned at seven sites (individual
farms were from 700 to 2,000 feddans). From the beginning of Bank involvement, although there was
some technical know-how on fish farming, there was no Egyptian experience of large-scale commercial
production. Government aquaculture operations were not highly regarded by Bank staff and consultants
who had visited them.
5.2    Stimulated by these very ambitious plans, the early work of Bank and FAO/CP missions referred
to very large areas, although originally as a component of some other Bank-assisted project. The first
two missions in 1977 described a project of 30,000 feddans in the Delta, an extraordinary scale for an
initial commitment to fish farming. Government consultants in 1979 then carried out reconnaissance on
about 35,000 feddans and proposed development of 14,350 feddans. This was scaled back by Bank and
FAO/CP work to a final proposal in 1980 for a 5,000 feddan development. Thus the project concept
started out on a very ambitious scale, but even after drastic cutting back remained extraordinarily large.
B. Preparation
5.3    Early preparation work by FAO/CP envisaged a production system based on local fish species
(tilapia and grey mullet) 'grown mainly on feed provided by the natural environment in the pond", as
stimulated by purchased nutrients. Purchased supplementary fish food was in short supply and would be
used sparingly. Nutrient and feed supply were identified as the most important issues from the start of
preparation. (This concept of a "natural feeding system' survived until implementation when it was
discarded as impractical. The concept was apparently based on expanding the common small-scale
"backyard" system, used throughout the tropics, to very large-scale commercial operations.) A first
government scheme for 2,000 feddans (880 ha) had been designed in detail for implementation in 1977/78
and would serve as the model for a later Bank-assisted project (eventually this earlier USAID-assisted
project was delayed). Land for the project was identified amongst large areas of commanded land in the
Delta, some of which was considered more suitable for fish farming because it was low lying and had
highly saline soils. (The scale of proposals was reduced in part by the Bank insisting that fish farm
development not compete for land with agriculture.) There was also a proposal to develop littoral lakes
20. Traditional fishing grounds were lost to territorial claims by other countries and the yield of Egypt's Mediterranean grounds
fell with the decline in nutrients delivered by the Nile after the High Aswan Dam was commissioned.

for fish culture (by lakeshore enclosures known as "howash" fish farms), but FAO/CP was sensitive to
ecological risks and this component did not survive to appraisal.
5.4    After identification was completed and the project concept agreed in principle, detailed
preparation was undertaken by a consultancy funded from the Bank's Project Preparation Facility. The
British firm awarded the contract submitted the only acceptable bid (three of the five firms short-listed
did not bid). The files do not reveal how this winning firm came to be approved for the short-list (which
would have required the Bank being satisfied of its competence) since it was later reported (including in
the PCR) that the firm had little aquaculture experience (and was not required to obtain any by associating
with a specialist firm).
5.5    The Bank's original preparation plan (conveyed to the government) was for a consulting contract
to be signed in mid-1978 and for the work to be completed by the end of 1978, for appraisal shortly
afterwards. However, the contract was not signed until December, 1978, after prolonged negotiations
and the raising of additional funding through Bank initiative from ODA/UK. The consultants started
work in January, 1979. In contrast, in late 1977 the Bank had been advising FAO/CP that preparation
had to be completed in nine months by November, 1978, to allow appraisal in December and Board
approval by June, 1979. FAO/CP, to its credit, saw a 2-1/2 year preparation as possible at the time,
while acknowledging that there was much to resolve. This prediction turned out to be correct to a month.
The delays in letting the consultant contract and in the preparation work that followed were not a
surprise, as things ran the normal course for such operations in Egypt. Thus the Bank's optimistic
expectations were constantly dashed by unforeseen (but foreseeable) delay and the failure of government
and project managers to meet commitments.
5.6    Preparation was also characterized by inordinate staff inputs. Records show seven missions with
as many as five staff by FAO/CP, and, jointly or separately, six other missions by Bank staff (over a
three year preparation period). Since the Bank was pre-financing a consultancy to do a feasibility study
of the main component (which eventually was narrowed down to the Maryut Fish Farm-MFF), it was
not clear what purpose frequent, and sometimes heavy, staff inputs from Rome and Washington were
serving. The file records show much eloquent reportage on details and issues but little systematic
progress towards resolution of issues or definition of the project. In the event much of the laborious
preparation effort on details was wasted (apart from eventually deciding on the Maryut area, outside the
Delta, and scaling the fish farm size back from the astonishing large 30,000 feddans originally proposed
to the merely "largest fish farm in the world" of 3,100 feddans). Thus the proposed engineering layout
for MFF was soon discarded as impractical during implementation and the production technology was
undecided and unproven some nine years later when the Credit closed. The excessive resources employed
to design what was a relatively simple (though large) investment, a single farm to raise fish, can be
attributed in great part-as will become apparent below-to the surprising fact that few of the principal
participants in this operation (including the preparation consultants) had prior experience of fish farming
in general or of the particular production system suited to the local conditions. (Several attempts by the
Bank to plug in expertise-during preparation and later through mission staffing-do not (from file
evidence) appear to have advanced discussion on technical issues in a significant and consistent way.
Furthermore on some issues the Bank was itself unconvincing or ambivalent-probably in part because
there was a high turnover of Bank staff.) Neither the Bank, nor FAO/CP, exhibited the minimal technical
competence needed to assess and supervise effectively the consultants' contribution.
C. Project Design and Appraisal
5.7    Although Bank staff can be credited with reducing the scale of the project, especially during
appraisal, the eventual plan for the Maryut farm for 2,500 feddans of ponds on a gross area of 3,100
feddans, as a "demonstration program", was an error of judgment for several reasons:



- 40 -
(a)    although there were several large fish farms in the nearby Delta, none had been
previously established in an area outside the Delta with the characteristics of Maryut (eg.
on non-alluvial soils, which turned out during implementation to be unsuitable for pond
or road embankments).
(b)    visits by Bank, FAO/CP and consultant staff to existing fish farms developed by
government produced reports of poor construction, inefficient operating methods, and
generally sub-commercial results.   This was consistent with poor construction
performance on earlier Bank-assisted agricultural sector projects, resulting in part from
weak supervision of contractors. Greatly delayed completion and inferior standards of
construction (often requiring immediate rehabilitation) were commonplace.
(c)    using saline drainage water for fish farming had not previously been attempted.
(d)   the types of fish to be raised and the method of production had not been validated by
trials in the same environment.
(e)   there were no locally available staff with the skills or experience needed to operate a
large fish farm profitably.
Any one of these observations should have dictated a much more cautious approach, and apart from lack
of technical experience, there is no clear explanation of what drove the operation onwards in the face of
such obstacles.
5.8    Even with all these problems (all of which were tabled and discussed during preparation and
appraisal and any one of which was enough to sink the enterprise before it started), the project concept
contained one other fatal flaw which, in contrast, escaped any critical review. This was that the fish farm
would be established by a government agency but then transferred for "commercial operation" to a
company which would operate along "private enterprise lines" and be owned jointly by a (diminishing)
public sector shareholder and (increasing) private shareholders (the pond operators/owners). Given the
recognized poor construction performance of the public sector, weak management standards and habitual
delays in project completion, it is not clear on what grounds the Bank believed that the government would
be capable of establishing and transferring to private ownership a viable commercial operation, especially
an enterprise as demanding of technical skill, timeliness and commercial acumen as fish farming. The
project's privatization strategy seems now to have been unrealistic.
5.9    The project concept as appraised (and later approved) is best expressed by a paragraph from the
appraisal report (3.01):
"The proposed project is intended to be a demonstration program of commercial
aquaculture development on both a large and small scale in Egypt, utilizing land and
water with no better alternative use (under currently known technology). The concept
is based on a fish culture system whose basic productivity is generated within its own
ecosystem by maximizing the use of solar energy fixed in the water by nutrients coming
from the soil (assisted by fertilization). The pond provides the essential environment for
the fish, and the greatest degree of efficiency is achieved by appropriate selection and
management of species with complementary feeding habits, so that each ecological niche
in the food chain can be occupied and maximum use made of natural pond food growth."
However, the production concept had not been tested in the project area and the project design did not
include any arrangements for production trials. Thus, missing from this description in the SAR was any



- 41 -
caveat that in the absence of any experience with this technology, this was an experiment on a gigantic
scale. In commenting on this report in draft, the current management of Maryut Fish Farm has noted
that the tilapia species identified at appraisal were not suited to saline water and the cold winters at the
site (without wintering ponds), and that the extensive production system proposed at appraisal did not
require the capital-intensive small-scale ponds proposed. It was noted also that the large quantity of fry
required to stock the ponds (in the appraisal design) were not available in Egypt.
5.10   Components were:
(a)    establishing the 3,100 feddan fish farm at Maryut (West of Alexandria);
(b)    a credit line through PBDAC to farmers to establish about 100 private fish farms
(average size 18 feddans);
(c)   improving the (wild) fish fry collecting station at El Mex;
(d)    funds for training, extension, fish marketing and project preparation activities; and
(e)   technical assistance for construction supervision and operations management at Maryut,
and for training, extension and monitoring and evaluation.
5.11   The Maryut Farm was estimated to cost US$17.4 million (with contingencies), and included
provision for 180 km. of earth embankments, a gravity main supply canal (from the West Nubariya
Drain), a pump station to lift drainage water back into the WND, six field centers (offices and stores),
an administration building, laboratory, market facilities, staff houses (including 250 for pond
operators/owners in a nearby new town of El Ameriya), vehicles and equipment, and a 3.5 km pipeline
to divert industrial pollutants to below the farm's offtake from the WND.
5.12   The credit scheme was for the improvement of existing fish farms and construction of new ones.
Although a model for improvement of a 10-feddan fish farm was presented in an annex, with a very high
financial rate of return (63 percent), the general lack of detail on specifics of the credit scheme suggests
that this component was a relatively minor player in the objectives and overall design. This proved the
case during implementation, with the problems at Maryut absorbing most of the Bank's attention.
5.13   Features of the design of relevance to later events include:
(a)    establishment of a Project Implementation and Monitoring Unit (PIMU) within the
Under-Secretariat of Aquatic Resources (which was the implementing agency in MOA)
as a condition of effectiveness;
(b)    establishment of a Coordination Committee;
(c)    government to protect Maryut Fish Farm from pollution of its water supply;
(d)    government to on-lend credit line funds to PBDAC, which would repay in local currency
(i.e. PBDAC would not carry the foreign exchange risk);
(e)    establishment of the Maryut Fish Farming Company by June, 1982;
(f)    qualifications and experience of the Project Manager (head of the PIMU) to be
satisfactory to IDA.



- 42 -
5.14   The project was expected to be completed in 5-1/2 years, with preparation of detailed design and
tender documents for MFF to be completed in four months after Board approval and contracts to be
awarded five months later. Construction was to start four months later and be completed by January
1984, some 21 months later.
D. Implementation
5.15   The PCR gives a full account of the implementation period (paras. 5.01-5.10), which eventually
stretched out to 8-1/2 years. To give the flavor of implementation and the problems encountered, the
following are some of the more significant events:
(a)    Before the project became effective the government reversed itself (on continuing for
detailed design with the same preparation consultants) by engaging a new three-firm
consortium of two overseas and one local company. The Bank had agreed to continuing
with the same consultants (for the usual continuity and efficiency reasons) although the
files already had noted that they had little fish farming expertise. The files do not clearly
show how the new arrangement came about. Suffice to note that the new consultants
immediately revised the design layout for MFF (in favor of one more suited to the local
physical conditions) and this led to substantial delays. The Bank agreed to the change
reluctantly, since the appraisal design was being abandoned. Even so, as the PCR
reports, the new design could not overcome the "poor quality of the project site," and
the farm would always need intensive maintenance of the works and embankment
stabilization problems were never fully overcome (see below).
(b)    Project start-up was extraordinarily slow with little happening that was not apparently
prompted by urgent messages from the Bank. There was no "project launch workshop",
or its equivalent, which at the time were increasingly being used by the Bank to get
projects off the ground-especially in situations where the implementation record was
poor as with Egypt's agriculture projects. This point also applied to the credit line
component, with a message going to PBDAC as late as 20 months after Board approval
urging that the credit component be got going.   Despite the project not being
implemented as planned, the only reaction traced on file from the Bank's regional
management was to instruct, at the start of year three (1984) after approval, that the next
mission be a "strong one". That supervision mission did not go out until six months later
and was notable in rating the project for the first time with "major problems". (The
project was rated with major problems for the next four years, before the rating was
dropped to "4"-meaning that the problems were not receiving attention-for the last two
years of its life. Even so the files contain little evidence of management oversight of this
"problem project", or of the problems being tackled in country implementation reviews
(as was common elsewhere with respect to problem projects and serious implementation
problems.)2' Supervision at this time was already "strong" (if measured by staff inputs),
21. The Region has commented that: 'There were systematic reviews done of this project and there were meetings held (July
1984-and subsequently) between the Project Director and high-level Bank teams, the agreements were recorded, there were
semi-annual reviews made of the project involving the Programs Director and the Project Director of the Bank, and, as part of
the 'Sector Implementation Review' in the country, meetings were held under the chairmanship of the Minister of Agriculture,
when high level Bank officials held discussions with the Egyptian authorities. In those days, there was no systematic "country
implementation review' in the case of Egypt. If the results of these efforts were meager, it gocs to prove the clout of the Project
Director who managed to go his way, despite the strong efforts of the Bank and several of the high officials of the Ministry.
The Bank did consider if it should pull out of the project; but, taking into account that contracts had been given for a substantial
portion of the credit and these works were underway, and some 60 percent of the credit had been disbursed by mid-1986, it was
considered inadvisable to pull out of the project.'

since for FY82 and FY83 it was 31 staff weeks (SW) and 20 SW, or averaging about
double normal levels. Supervision then became stronger as the level for FY84-86 rose
to average about 36 SW, which approached triple normal averages. However, the files
indicate that much of this effort was repetitive and unproductive as the staff wrestled with
one serious problem after another, without great success.
(c)   In addition to the early decision to change the engineering design of MFF, which caused
much angst and extra work in the Bank, a number of other changes and delays kept Bank
supervision staff active in reacting to them: the Irrigation Department changed the design
of the WND outlet causing concern that sea water would back up to the MFF inlet; pond
depth was changed (without prior consultation with Bank staff)-see more below on this;
the Project Director (PD) decided to retain 150 ponds for operation by the PIMU, rather
than transfer them to private operators; contrary to progress records, it was found that
the contractor was not levelling the bottoms of ponds to specification; and the outer bank
of MFF was not adequately constructed to resist wave action and possible breach in wind
storms by the lake waters adjoining the farm. (Exceptional rainfall in 1991 resulted in
the dike being breached and farm being flooded, with the loss of much of the fish stocks.
MFFC staff attributed the breach to the poor quality of dike construction and the dike had
to be reconstructed.)
(d)    Two construction problems particularly taxed the ingenuity of the contractor and exposed
the project management's inability to analyze problems and take appropriate remedial
action promptly. First, soil engineering preparatory work had not discovered that local
soils were too unstable to be used to construct pond embankments. Consequently the use
of excavated material from the ponds for the banks had to be abandoned in favor of
bringing in outside material. This led to economizing on the depth of ponds (the 1.0 or
1.2 meter depth issue, see below) since excavated material had to be dumped elsewhere.
The second problem was that the submerged or very wet soils could not be worked by
the contractor according to schedule in the absence of adequate dewatering, which for no
clear reason was the responsibility of the project management and not the contractor.
Dewatering pumps had to be obtained by project management. This proved to be a long
drawn out process which, inter alia, led to the contractor leaving the site temporarily
rather than lose money on the contract.
(e)    The other factor leading to the civil works contractor demobilizing was that the contract
was at a fixed price, with project management holding to this clause despite unforeseen
cost increases, design changes and delays which were in management's domain rather
than the fault of the contractor. The matter was eventually settled by allowing for cost
increases where prices and quantities had changed.
(f)    The quality of works at MFF was never satisfactory (although at one stage a Bank
mission reported that quality was adequate, unlike all other mission comments) and at the
conclusion of construction project management was already using its maintenance
equipment to finish off work left undone, or poorly done, by the contractor.
(g)    For several years late into implementation, the Bank-with advice from its expert
aquaculturalists-insisted that ponds should average 1.2 meters in depth, whereas they
were constructed only 1.0 meters deep. The options of deepening the ponds or raising
the embankments and the supply canal were offered at one stage to project management.
The Bank eventually went for deepening and repeatedly urged US$7 million of additional



- 44 -
excavation to avoid a production loss estimated by Bank missions of 25-30 percent. The
marginal rate of return to this incremental investment was not calculated.)
(h)    The PIMU was never staffed as planned (resulting in some cost savings but perhaps
contributing to the inadequate supervision of construction which led to poor work
quality).
(i)    Pond operators were not selected and trained on the schedule planned.
(j)    The MFFC was not established early on as planned, which might have allowed it to play
an active role (through self-interest) in correcting some of the deficiencies allowed to
persist by project management. When it was established after great delay, it was a public
sector company (contrary to the project concept), and was changed to allow it to operate
as a private sector enterprise only after IDA protest.
(k)    The implementation consultants (the same consortium that did the detailed design) lost
its local aquaculture expertise when that firm's principal was arrested in early 1983 on
charges of irregularities in other contracts. The local firm then ceased to participate
further at Maryut. (From late 1985 the project lost all consultant assistance when the two
remaining overseas firms withdrew after disputes with the PD and non-payment of fees.)
(I)    By late 1983 (almost three years after Board approval) a supervision mission listed
project problems as follows: doubtful technical and economic viability, because of
doubled construction costs resulting from design changes, greater technical risks than
foreseen because of poor water quality resulting from pollution; uncertain supplies of
"seed" fish, shortage of trained staff (with little progress on the training program), and
an organization and management which was unsuited to operate "the largest commercial
fish farm in the world." It was ominous that the complementary project assisted by
USAID (where research support was to be provided) was being restructured because of
non-performance.  The overlying problem  was seen to be that the project was
"managerially weak, with little action or initiative emanating from the PIMU." The
mission recommended restructuring of the project with the focus on "demonstration."
The follow-up letter ventured that it might be "unwise to go forward with the Maryut
Fish Farm  component."  The government resisted this suggestion and the next
supervision letter of April, 1984 agrees to continue with MFF "on a pilot/demonstration
basis', but on a reduced scale, to which the government agreed.
(m)   The key part of the new proposal was to set up 28 two-hectare pilot ponds and recruit
fish farmers to run them, to provide a flow of trained fish farmers. However, the May
1985 supervision report (a year after the reduced scope pilot operation was agreed) states:
"The agreement reached with the Project Director in July
1984 anticipated completion of the pilot ponds in August
1984, the main pumping station in August 1985 and
availability of water for the pilot operation in September
1984 (sic).  Contrary to these expectations, nothing
appears to have been done to achieve these objectives by
the specified dates."
(n)    Escalating construction costs provoked different reactions from the project director and
the Bank. The PD, who had never supported the credit component, wanted to reallocate
credit funds to MFF construction. IDA staff, conversely, proposed in early 1986 that



- 45 -
IDA "exclude the (MFF) pond complex (from further support) and concentrate on the
credit activities." IDA staff also proposed at one stage (in 1984) reducing the number
ponds to be constructed, given cost increases, but did not raise the commercial
implications of doing so.
(o)    The credit component did not get going until the fifth project year, in part because until
Bank staff advised otherwise, PBDAC had assumed that the PD at Maryut also controlled
the credit program. Even so, despite the PD's failure to encourage credit operations
during these early years, a long delay over who would carry the foreign exchange risks,
severe collateral requirements, and inappropriately short leases for some tenant fish
farmers, eventually 27 percent of the funds allocated for credit were disbursed. Even so
48 loans were approved, compared with 100 projected at appraisal, and 1,445 feddans
of ponds were constructed (1,800 feddans were planned.)
(p)    In 1986 a supervision report notes that the "cost of construction of individual ponds is
becoming more and more out of reach of ordinary fish farmers."
(q)   In mid-1986 the Bank's regional management elevated concern over poor performance
of the project, attributing blame in a telex to government mainly to a "continuing climate
of non-cooperation between the parties involved." Strengthened by this support the next
supervision mission recommended that the Project Director be replaced, as he was.
However, by mid-1987 the same officer was reappointed (according to the files-because
of political connections) to the dismay of the next supervision mission. This mission
reported that IDA was unlikely to be able to help the government rehabilitate the project
so long as the current PD remained. By late 1988 the woeful state of the project led to
a special issues paper and meeting before a supervision mission departure, which noted
that "this project has a history of bad and untrustworthy management." By early 1989
the files show a comment that there is "little doubt that present project management has
limited interest in the commercial aspects of producing fish." Even so, the IDA credit
was extended, rather than being allowed to close on schedule (as was thought fully
justified) to "avoid affecting sensitive Bank-government relations."
(r)    A final irony was reported by the last supervision mission (November, 1989), that if the
PD's batch system of fish production were adopted (as opposed to the continuous culture
system proposed at appraisal) the layout and depth of the ponds could be quite different,
and that experiments on production techniques should have been conducted from the
outset. Pilot production trials were inconclusive at this stage.
E. Results
5.16   At the audit's visit in July 1993 and again in June 1994, despite the implementation delays, design
changes and calamities, a working large-scale fish farm was seen. It consisted of a core of six sub-farms
Oaid out geometrically) of 70 ponds of about 5.5 feddans each (totalling about 2,300 feddans of pond
area). Another large 2,000 feddan rectangular pond, running the length of the farm, has since been
added and is used by MFFC for polyculture of mullet, sea bass, sea bream and tilapia. There were also
additional developments (from MALR budget funds) of polythene greenhouses for fry production, sets
of concrete tanks for intensive fish production with aeration, and reconstruction of the perimeter
embarkment, to protect the farm, was being completed.
5.17   Management of the fish farm had been transferred from the Undersecretariat for Aquatic
Resources to the MFFC. It had been recognized during implementation and in the PCR that MFFC could



- 46 -
not be profitable without government bearing infrastructure costs (i.e. transferring the assets to the
company as a capital subsidy). Capital expenditure was higher than planned because of unforeseen cost
increases, construction delays and excessive specifications (eg. the central road of some 7 km is sealed
and has street lighting). Moreover, investment was continuing at the time of the audit visit as described
above.
5.18  In 1991, when the PCR was written, it had been envisaged that MFFC would be a service
company to private operators of individual ponds, with responsibility for maintaining and operating
common facilities. Two years later it was clear that MFFC was to remain a large production company,
which could be viable only if the service functions were separated off (especially where this permitted
a large part of overhead or fixed costs-eg. for the excessive staff of some 450-to be taken off MFFC's
accounts). However, although the division of the project's assets and staff between MFFC and the
proposed service company had been effected on paper, individual accounts and profit and loss statements
for the commercially oriented MFFC production operations were not yet available. One of the problems
in separating investments and operations has been that investments have continued since project
completion such that there has yet to be a period of stable operations.
5.19   Production levels are now more respectable than the disastrous levels in the early years during
implementation-eg. ponds are producing 0.8 to 1.0 tons of tilapia per 5.5 feddan pond (compared with
a reported potential of 1.5 tons per pond). Production is by a batch method, seeding the ponds in spring
and harvesting and draining for maintenance in the autumn. Fry supply has been a constraint (such that
only 200 ponds could be used in 1992, but all 400 were stocked in 1993), hence MFFC has expanded
into fry production. Polyculture is practiced in the large 2,000 feddan pond with a mixture of native
species (mullet and bass) and self-seeded (from the water supply) tilapia providing a feed fish.
5.20   Production problems facing MFFC are quite severe and will require careful and adept
management. These are mainly:
(a)    a marked decline in water quality from the WND (the earlier possibility of diluting
drainage water with irrigation supplies is no longer available as government has banned
the use of Nile water for fish farming). Original plans assumed salinity of not more than
4 parts per thousand (ppt), whereas WND water is now 5-15 ppt, and heavy metal
pollution is sometimes a problem. In the 5.5 feddan ponds salinity has been even higher
because of the saline soils. One response to this problem has been the introduction of
hybrid red tilapia from Florida, which thrives in such salinity.
(b)   supplies of fry have not been adequate to operate the farm at full capacity. It is hoped
that the breeding program will both fully supply the farm and provide income from sales.
The proposed improvement of the El Mex fry capture station was dropped during
implementation and reliance placed on capture at the WND outlet. However, the
realization that wild fry capture (and high losses) would never allow adequate supply led
to the establishment of a breeding station close to the sea. This was partly completed and
in production at the time of the audit mission's visit. Improvements for fry capture from
the drain at the farm have also been made. Tilapia and shrimp breeding were underway
at Maryut, but shrimp production was not yet an important source of income pending the
arrival of pathogen-free lines.
(c)   in September and October, before autumn harvesting is complete, Maryut is besieged by
thousands of migratory birds, which MFFC staff estimate consume as much as a quarter
of the fish stocks.



- 47 -
(d)   it was apparent to the audit that weed growth and instability of the banks were continual
problems and that substantial annual maintenance of ponds was needed.
F. Issues and Lessons
(a)    Lending Program Strategy and Project Selection
5.21   Faced with expanding demand for domestic fish production, as traditional capture supplies
declined, and the apparent opportunity to combine saline drainage water and poor quality land for fish
farms, the Bank was sympathetic to the government's ambitious plans to expand aquaculture. However,
the Bank's involvement never managed to overcome the pressure of government's grand plans to do
something significant in a relatively short time. It is unlikely that a calm technical review of sub-sector
performance would have concluded that a commitment to a 3,100 feddan commercial fish farm
development at Maryut over five years was realistic. But such a large development represented a
substantial scaling back of government's original plans (for 30,000 feddans) and possibly survived critical
comment as a result. The planned development of 100 private farms of 18 feddans was more realistic
(para. 5.15 (o)).
5.22   The Bank's original plan was for an initial commitment to aquaculture as a component of some
other agriculture sector project. The project files do not reveal on what grounds the decision was taken
to expand the Bank's involvement to a stand-alone project, given that this was the Bank's first venture
into the subsector and that the record of government's involvement in aquaculture was not all positive.
Hence, it is fair to say that possibly the main error was the decision to expand the Bank's assistance to
a full project-which then became a very large first (misnamed) "demonstration" of (misnamed) "private
sector" aquaculture, which was intended as the basis of more widespread replication. In the event, the
technology for moving rapidly into profitable large-scale aquaculture was not available, nor was expertise
available to develop the technology quickly; the site chosen for the core investment (Maryut), while
attractive in low opportunity cost terms, was correspondingly costly in terms of development and
maintenance costs for aquaculture (the unstable soils, the need for a dike to protect the farm from Lake
Maryut intrusion, the need to pump drainage water and the potential pollutants in the water supply); and
implementation capacity (i.e. the quality of management available) was poor. Hence, the commitment
of IDA funds to the project was more supply-driven than demand-driven, recalling that USAID's much
larger grant program was also committing funds to the sub-sector over the same period. Given these
points, a modest trials or pilot commitment to fish farming would have been an appropriate first step,
with further commitments conditional on successful implementation, results and especially commercial
prospects.
(b)    Construction Issues
5.23   During early preparation it is clear that Bank staff appreciated that developing a large fish farm
in unfamiliar conditions, without yet being certain of the production system, was a risky venture and that
a high order of technical expertise would be required.  The appraisal report described risks as
"substantial", noting that: "Construction of project facilities at the Maryut site would be a major
earthmoving exercise, calling for strict control and coordination by experienced contractors." During
preparation it was known from experience on other Bank-assisted projects that poor performance by
(public sector/domestic) contractors, exacerbated by weak supervision of contractors by project
management, often resulted in poor quality construction work. Contracting the work to a single
contractor supervised by an internationally recruited firm of consulting engineers, was expected to
substantially reduce these risks. However, the actual contractual arrangements were badly flawed in that
responsibility for draining the site, to allow construction to proceed, was left with project management
(which proved extraordinarily slow to act) and the supervising engineers left the project when relations



- 48 -
with project management deteriorated and they were not being paid. Work quality suffered accordingly
and performance was not enhanced by the contractor also pulling out for a while when the relations with
project management deteriorated and little work could be done. Hence the risks envisaged materialized,
but to an even greater extent than expected.
5.24   Looking back now, it would seem that the standard approach adopted to reduce construction risks
(a single contractor and expert supervision) were inadequate to ensure that construction would proceed
efficiently. This should have been known from other experience in Egypt, and exceptional means should
have been sought to reduce risks more assuredly.
(c)    The Bank's Role
5.25   The project's problems and the unsatisfactory outcome (a large and costly enterprise which cannot
be commercially viable without substantial capital subsidies) can be attributed in great part to two
significant failings on the Bank's part. These were the failure to ensure, throughout the project cycle,
that qualified technical expertise was both employed on the project and had influence on decisions, and
as difficulties arose, the failure of the Bank to react strongly enough, with promptness to resolve
problems. Two points are relevant here: first, that during the project's life there were seven Bank task
managers and, moreover, four different chiefs of the responsible projects division. Few, if any, of these
eleven staff had any experience of fish farming and indeed the task manager who saw the project through
the critical time when the Bank was on the point of withdrawing explicitly recorded his lack of expertise
to deal with production problems (his experience was with capture fisheries, not fish farming). Second,
through mechanisms which the files do not reveal, the Bank apparently approved (or simply acquiesced
to) both preparation consultants and supervision consultants who had neither the required expertise in fish
farming, nor the incentives or instructions to obtain such expertise through recruitment and field work.
The three-firm supervision consultancy had one partner with ostensible aquaculture expertise, but the
manner in which (in the files) technical problems seem to persist, or at least not progress over the years,
does not suggest that the right expertise was being brought to bear on the issues. For example, the failure
to set up any form of small-scale pond trials at Maryut (using temporary pumping arrangements and
whatever else might be required to get trials going) over the eight years of construction implementation,
seems to have been an extraordinary oversight. The Bank's urging that "pilot ponds" should be used was
on the right lines (but more for training purposes than for production trials). Even so these ponds were
more elaborate and large scale than the situation demanded, given that so little was known (and so little
local expertise and trained staff were available) about fish culture in the Maryut area. The debacle of the
first year's attempt at production, a decade after the project was identified, points to the cost of not
embarking on an experimental approach from the outset. This is possibly the biggest deficiency in the
Bank's performance of the project, and may be compared with the initial role of trial plots, from the
feasibility stage onwards, in green field irrigation and settlement schemes (see this point in the audit of
the New Land project).
(d)    Project Management and the PIMU
5.26   The government failed to establish the PIMU as planned and agreed (as also occurred with similar
consequences in the Irrigation Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project). The results of this omission were
very costly in terms of delayed implementation, lack of action on issues (even when agreed with the
Bank), poor supervision of contractors and lack of counterparts for the supervisory consultants. But even
a well-staffed PIMU would have had serious difficulty managing the project's many problems, and it is
doubtful if it would have been very effective so long as the Project Director was unsuitable. It is clear
from incoming material on the files, the record of failures to meet commitments and the recorded
expressions of exasperation from Bank staff, that the inadequate project manager was at the root of many



- 49 -
of the implementation problems. The Bank took appropriate action (but only off the record at the time,
through mission representations) to have him replaced (and then briefly reported better performance), but
then was in error in not protesting his reinstatement. The explanation on file, that this was done to avoid
hurting sensitive Bank-country relations, is not convincing in comparison to the cost to the project of
further serious implementation problems entirely due to poor management. The continuation of serious
problems over such a long period must, of itself, have harmed Bank-country relations.
(e)    Procurement of Goods and Services
5.27   As with other projects being audited in this package, the files show an unduly large volume of
Bank staff work relating to procurement matters of a routine nature. Partly this can be attributed to the
inadequate project management, but the Bank could also have taken steps to ensure that appropriate
procurement experience was available to the project's staff, and that training was provided early on.
Regrettably, the lack of general improvement in how procurement was handled over several years
suggests that it was not just unfamiliarity with procedures that was causing problems, but that there was
also an unwillingness to apply agreed procedures. This caused unnecessary additional work for Bank
staff.
6. IRRIGATION PUMPING STATIONS REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2270-EGT)
A. Introduction
6.1    Egyptian agriculture depends on irrigation and drainage for survival. The main crops are wheat,
beseem (alfalfa), cotton, rice, maize and sorghum. A very large drainage program was required to
counteract the effect of rising water-tables and salinity resulting from excessive use of water made
available by the High Aswan Dam. In addition a large "New Lands Program" is extending the irrigated
area further away from the Nile. Even so aggregate agricultural production growth rates declined after
the 1960s to below population growth rates.
6.2   In the early 1980s when the project was proposed, there were some 460 pumping stations lifting
Nile water to serve cultivated lands, 360 pumping groundwater, and 96 pump stations to discharge
drainage water to the Mediterranean, some 910 pump stations in all. Many of Egypt's pump stations are
large by world standards, the largest with peak discharge of over 100 cumecs. The SAR noted that a
"huge backlog of deferred maintenance" of pump stations (para. 1.16) was aggravating the operational
defects of the whole irrigation and drainage system.
6.3    A role for Bank assistance was identified by an irrigation and land reclamation subsector review
mission in late 1980. The government's pump station rehabilitation program for the period up to the year
2,000 had identified 67 stations for high priority rehabilitation in the first phase of the program up to
1987. A USAID-financed project was to provide for 37 of these stations, leaving 30 for Bank assistance.
These 30 stations served about 1.1 million feddans, or a fifth of the irrigated area.
B. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
6.4   In the late 1970s the Bank was engaged in discussions with government towards diversifying Bank
assistance in the agriculture sector away from its focus on drainage projects, which dated from 1970.
A draft Master Plan for Water Resources Development and Use (para. 4.01) was completed in 1980 (with
the Bank as executing agency for UNDP) and led to the Bank deciding to: (i) undertake its own detailed
review of irrigation and land reclamation, (ii) present its assessment of the subsector to government as
the basis for a policy dialogue, and (iii) agree with government on a program of mutually supportive



- 50 -
policy measures and investment projects to accelerate agricultural production growth. This strategy was
reinforced by a request from the Minister of Irrigation (MOI) in 1980 to assist in the preparation of
investment projects. As a result the Bank sent a sector review mission in late 1980 which completed its
report in May 1982 (Irrigation and Land Reclamation Subsector Review, Report No. 337 1-EGT).
6.5    Discussions between the mission and government officials led to the agreement that the "first
priority for investment should be given to safeguarding the existing irrigation system". In support of this
review the Bank had approved a Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1162-EGT)' in late 1981 which
provided funds, inter alia, to the Ministry of Irrigation for project preparation, of which the first item
was a study for the replacement of pump stations.
6.6    A Bank identification mission discussed the proposed Pump Rehabilitation Program with Ministry
of Irrigation (MOI) officials in March 1981. Up to this point project preparation for the irrigation
subsector had been in cooperation with USAID, with the Bank taking the lead. But as individual
investments began to materialize the Bank and USAID separated their efforts, with the Bank using a
Bank/FAO-CP mission in June 1981 to advance preparation of the pump stations project. This mission
led to the establishment, in the Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) of MOI, of a technical
committee to prepare detailed proposals for rehabilitation of selected pump stations and the establishment
of pump repair facilities.
6.7    The first Project Brief in August, 1981 listed the following issues:
(a)    the difficulty of estimating benefits as there was little data available on pump breakdowns
and their effect on crop production.
(b)    the limited capacity for construction of new pumping stations (financed by the Bank and
USAID) because of the limited capacity and/or poor management of local contractors.
(c)    cost recovery (which was to be indirect through land taxes-on larger holdings only).
This led to a protest by the irrigation advisor of the Bank's central staff, noting that since
water charges had not been insisted upon by the Bank under the recently approved New
Land Project (Credit 1083-EGT), a precedent had been set for not taking action on the
wastage of water in Egypt through farmers treating it as a free good.
6.8    The project was appraised in late 1981 and an additional component to strengthen MED was
added to those for pump rehabilitation and improving pump repair facilities. In establishing the urgent
need for the project the SAR referred to the "poor quality of the original machinery, lack of spare parts,
inappropriate maintenance, excessive hours of daily operation, and the presence of corrosive water...."
The post-appraisal issues paper and decision meeting were concerned with the limited capacity of the local
contracting industry, procurement methods for spare parts and the cost recovery issue. On construction
capability there was also concern that MOI did not have adequate expertise for construction supervision
and would need additional expertise, as the Bank had recommended before.
6.9    At this point (January, 1982) a mission in the field reported that MOI had decided not to use Bank
funds for the project, on cost grounds (Egypt had recently been graduated from IDA eligibility). The
Bank, however, continued to process the project and in mid-March urged the government to negotiate
the project so that it would not fall out of the current fiscal year. By May the MOI had decided to
postpone the project to the next fiscal year. Eventually in October 1982, MOI was persuaded to continue

- 51 -
with the project. Negotiations were then held in March, 1983 and the project was approved by the Board
in April and became effective in November, 1983.
C. Project Objectives and Design
6.10   The project was designed to "improve the irrigation and drainage pumping stations in the project
area and to strengthen the operation and maintenance capabilities of MED" (Loan Agreement, Schedule
2).
6.11   Components were:
(a) Pumping Stations
(i) Replacement of pump units and other equipment in 15 pump stations (including one
to be reconstructed);
(ii) Spare parts and other equipment to rehabilitate 15 other pump stations;
(iii) Spare parts for other pump stations.
(b)  Maintenance Facilities and Equipment
(i) Establishing and equipping three central workshops, 15 regional workshops and six
electrical laboratories.
(ii) Provision of vehicles and other equipment.
(iii) Construction of houses for pump operators and workshop staff.
(c)  Institutional Improvements (by technical assistance)
(i) Maintenance schedules for all pump stations operated by MED.
(ii) A cost accounting system for each pump station.
(iii) A store inventory system.
(d) Central Control System
Establishment of a central control system for the pump stations on the El Nasr Canal.
6.12   The project design had been influenced by experience with the construction or rehabilitation of
22 pump stations as components of four earlier Bank Group-assisted drainage projects (Credits 181 and
393, Loan 1235/Credit 637 and Loan 1439/Credit 719). The project design contained no policy
initiatives. MED was the implementing agency for the project, since it is responsible for the design,
procurement, installation, operation and maintenance of all major pumping facilities. The department was
established in 1920 and has "experienced mechanical and electrical engineers capable of carrying out these
activities" (SAR para. 4.01). A task force for the project had already been established in MED by the
time of project approval. However, the SAR noted that MED in the past had placed insufficient emphasis
on the supervision of the construction of pump buildings and their maintenance (para. 4.02).
Arrangements were agreed for staff assignments in MED to carry out the project, including strengthening



- 52 -
the buildings and supervision functions. The task force was responsible, among other things, for
preparing tender documents and evaluating bids for equipment supply and civil works.
6.13   Project base costs were estimated at US$40.2 million, of which the major item was pumping
station rehabilitation at US$33.8 million (84 percent) before contingencies and customs duties. The SAR
(para. 3.33) states that equipment costs, which formed the bulk of rehabilitation costs, were based on unit
prices of similar equipment procured at the time and on price quotations from suppliers. (In explanation
of large savings on equipment contracts, the PCR is more specific in stating that costs were based on
prices in the USA which turned out to be much higher in US dollar terms than prices in Europe and
Japan. This specificity was not traced in the SAR or files).
6.14   Three "areas of risk" were identified: (i) implementation delays with the pumping stations
modernization, against which risk a detailed implementation schedule included "advance procurement
actions" to facilitate the timely acquisition of equipment; (ii) that pumping stations would not be properly
operated and maintained, against which risk a covenant was included in the legal documents that sufficient
local funds would be made available for O&M; (iii) that poor maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
systems themselves would result in lower benefits to pump station rehabilitation. Reliance was placed
on existing Bank and USAID funded projects supporting irrigation and drainage infrastructure being
sufficient to ensure the systems remained in good condition-but the risk remained. If necessary a further
Bank-assisted project for O&M of the irrigation and drainage system was the back-up on this risk.
D. Implementation
6.15   The project design provided for a five year implementation period (compared with the average
for the sector of eight years). This was justified in the SAR in part by the fact that the project was to
be "implemented by a single agency which has long experience in international tendering." Despite
procurement and contracting problems, a much larger physical program was in fact substantially
completed in 7-1/2 years.
6.16   Implementation started well with tendering for equipment and vehicles proceeding and
negotiations starting for the purchase of spares from original suppliers. However, the first supervision
(12/83) also reported some delays in selecting consultants, in tendering for the Bayara pump station and
in preparing for tendering for civil works. By March 1984 a supervision mission was less upbeat noting
that the implementation schedule had not been prepared as agreed, no arrangements had been made to
carry out the civil works and, in a hint of things to come, that procurement decisions were very slow in
coming (eg. the bid evaluation report for the equipment tender for the first 14 pump stations took 15
months to prepare). Delays in the procurement process were attributed at this time to requests in the
tender documents for alternative designs, as intended in the SAR, which led to multiple proposals and
lengthy and complex evaluations (800 alternative designs were offered in one tender). Consequently the
alternatives clause was dropped in 1985 and this explanation for procurement problems, which continued,
became redundant.
6.17   By July, 1984 procurement problems, which seem to be characteristic of Egyptian projects,
started to emerge in earnest as a supervision mission reported a possible misprocurement on the US$10.4
million tender for the Bayara III pumping station (MED having proceeded with the tender without the
required Bank prior review of the tender documents). The problem was resolved without misprocurement
being declared, but this was only the first of several cases of procurement difficulties that Bank staff had
to resolve.
6.18   By the supervision mission of November, 1984 the major cost savings, which were to reshape
the project, had already become evident: "Based on contracts signed and tenders received, it is estimated
that only about US$15.0 million (of the Bank loan) would be utilized," giving savings of US$26.5
million. At the time the explanations offered for the much lower prices obtained for equipment included:



- 53 -
(a)  that SAR estimates had been based on Western (US?) prices, and many bids had gone to
Eastern European suppliers.
(b)  the US dollar had strengthened and inflation had been lower than expected.
(c)  that there had been cost savings given some reduction in the scope of work at the major
Bayara III station and two Upper Egypt stations had been dropped from the project.
(In retrospect a question remains about the low unit costs of the pumping station equipment, especially
that from the Eastern European suppliers. MED staff advised the audit mission that it was generally not
of as good quality as some of the equipment they were used to from other sources. Problems had been
experienced with the performance of some items-failing reduction gearboxes were a particular example
although these were not of Eastern European origin-such that a question remains as to whether the
specifications for some items were adequate, or whether bid evaluation was able to ensure that items met
requirements.)
6.19   The mission recommended that the identified savings be used for mainly the 59 pump stations
scheduled for rehabilitation under the proposed second project which was then under preparation. For
a while, consideration was given to additional conditionality (on cost recovery) being negotiated at the
time the enlarged scope of the project was approved, but strong arguments were offered on file against
this possibility. By September 1985 this major expansion of the project had been approved by the Bank,
in the process of which the approving senior manager noted his understanding that the Bank was
'financing a larger share of a time-slice" of the program. This was, of course, not so, since the 59 pump
stations were in MED's next phase of the program-but the files do not reveal that the query affected
approval of the change in scope. In addition to the extra pump stations, the Bank agreed to finance (from
the savings) circuit breakers for El Nasr Canal pump stations and weed screen cleaning machines.
Towards the end of the project, to use up remaining funds, the Bank also approved the financing of spare
parts for an additional 50 pump stations. Thus the project ended up constructing, rehabilitating or
maintaining 140 pump stations, compared with the original list of 30.
6.20   By early 1986 a procurement issue came to a head in that MED was using a standard procurement
document for ICB which contained a number of clauses unacceptable to the Bank. The Bank negotiated
that MED would use an acceptable document for Stage II procurement (as the additional items to be
financed were known). This mission proposed further discussions with MED to reduce the long delays
that had occurred in the evaluation of bids, award of contracts and opening of Letters of Credit (LCs).
6.21   Agreeing on suitable standard bidding documents was important to the Bank to remove the
unacceptable parts of MED's documents-which were seen to limit competition-and probably also to
reduce the repetitive work required of Bank staff in seeking amendments, tender-by-tender, in the MED
documents. But it was to take until May 1988, two years later, before the Bank recorded agreement to
use standard ICB documents. (Resolving this issue was time-consuming and included that a mission of
three Egyptian staff visited Bank headquarters in early 1988 to negotiate with Bank staff and a Bank
procurement consultant.) Procurement was then reported to be going more smoothly. But the civil works
were behind schedule in 1987/88 because of inadequate supervision by MED, contractor problems, and
delayed local currency funding by government.
6.22   Meanwhile Bank staff were reporting slow completion of the Stage I work (the original project
content) because of delays in shipment and installation of equipment by contractors. Progress was being
made, however, on procuring equipment for the management information system to improve MED's
capability, especially in the area of pumping station monitoring and maintenance scheduling. Progress
was slow in changing maintenance practices, and Bank staff continued to report that pump stations were
being maintained by "traditional practices". Such reports were repeated to the end of the project.

E. Results
6.23   The savings from much lower equipment prices allowed a great deal more work to be done at
pump stations than was planned at appraisal, as follows:

Although this table shows 140 pumping stations benefitting (based on PCR data), compared with 30
included at appraisal, a late supervision report estimated that with the use of the pool of spare parts
procured at the end with remaining funds about 325 pump stations (including deep wells) were improved
under the project. Thus, the physical achievements of the project when the Loan closed were highly
impressive. The institutional improvements were still getting underway and were duly followed-up in
the second project, but even so MED staff expressed concern to the audit that there was still a need for
assistance in managing the computer-based management systems that were introduced. Attempts had been
made to provide this technical assistance, but without the desired results.
6.24   Based on limited visits made by the audit to pumping stations and the comments of MED staff,
problems remaining include that communications between pump stations' staff and their headquarters
offices are less efficient and effective than the staff would wish if they are to operate and maintain the
stations to the standard desired. One example which may be indicative, but atypical in general, was that
a pump station was experiencing repeated failure of replacement gearboxes, had reported the problem
more than once, but had received no response as to what was to be done to save the station from potential
shutdown. (A more general problem was that pump station engineering staff were not always satisfied
as to the technical performance of some of the machinery, comparing the new items unfavorably with
those replaced. Vibration and noise were two points raised in this respect.) Hence, although at the PCR
stage institutional development results were given high marks, the audit found that in terms of evidence
in the field institutional improvement have not yet come through (even with a follow-up project) with the
expected and needed impact at pump stations. Repair and maintenance problems remained, and field staff
did not have the resources to solve them.
6.25   The central control station for the El Nasr Canal was implemented as planned, but at the time of
the audit visit, with canal supplies greatly reduced, it was not clear that such a sophisticated system would
fully repay its cost, or if it were needed at all. This would be only one of the economic and financial



- 55 -
costs of expanding irrigation off the Nubariya/El Nasr system beyond the area for which adequate water
could be supplied.
6.26   Based on energy savings and avoidance of crop yield losses, the PCR re-estimates an economic
rate of return of 36 percent (compared with 44 percent calculated at appraisal). The audit notes that such
high ERRs are common for rehabilitation projects where one weak link in a complex costly system is
being restored to design function. (Of course, with over three times as many pump stations financed as
originally planned, a high ERR is to be expected in any case in this instance.) However, the high rate
of return should be seen in perspective. The high economic rate of return for this rehabilitation project
arises largely because of the assumption on the "without project" case and a feature of the analysis of
such rehabilitation investments. On the first point, the analysis assumes that the government would not
have taken any other action (than the project) if the Bank assistance had not been available. Hence the
pump stations would have to limp along "on a shoe-string" as before, with consequent yield-depressing
effects on production. This does not seem the most likely without project situation, if only because the
returns to investment in any run-down pump station are so high. It seems more likely that the without
project case would be later rehabilitation, and probably at not such a high rate, although virtually any
such later program could be assumed, giving an infinite range of ERRs. The point is that the realistic
ERR to doing the project when it was done would be lower than the "no rehabilitation" without case
chosen-that is, the 36 percent rate of return is the upper end of a range of arguable ERRs, depending
on the "without project" assumptions.
6.27   Second, the high rate of return to rehabilitation projects should be viewed in the knowledge that,
since "bygones are bygones", it takes no account of the costs and (depressed) returns of getting to the
point where rehabilitation is needed, despite the sterling efforts of pump station staff in keeping pumps
running in difficult conditions. At this point plant and equipment are so run down and inefficient
(because of lack of maintenance and repair) that there is a high pay-off when production losses and high
running costs are reduced by new investment, that is by rehabilitation. Hence the optimum strategy is
almost always fully funded routine maintenance and repair, plus planned obsolescence and replacement
of equipment, rather than rehabilitation projects (despite apparent high rates of return). In the absence
of adequate local provisions for routine operation and maintenance, this argues on efficiency grounds for
external assistance for O&M, rather than only for periodic rehabilitation projects.
F.     Issues and Lessons
6.28   Since both the physical needs and institutional aspects of Egypt's vast irrigation and drainage
pumping industry had long been neglected, the project's priority was the highest. The addition at
appraisal of measures to strengthen MED was a valuable beginning to an institution building process
which must continue. In-country commitment to the project objectives was high. During implementation,
however, it became apparent that there was less in-country commitment to the routine processes of
implementation that had been agreed, especially to the Bank's standard procurement procedures and to
supervision of construction contractors.2? The Bank's expectation at appraisal that experience financing
22 pump stations under the four drainage projects would contribute to smooth implementation of the
project proved over-optimistic, largely because those earlier pump station investments were the
responsibility of a different agency in the Ministry of Irrigation. Resolving procurement problems took
24. The Region has commented that: 'In MED, a Directorate General of Civil Works has recently been established as
stipulated by the Second Pump Station Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 3198). This Dirctorate has engagod a local consulting office
to carry out civil designs and supervision for pump stations and infrastructure works. This in-house capability will overcome
much of the previous delays in preparation of civil designs (previously carried out by MPWWR, which resulted in considerable
delays), assistance with tender evaluation and supervision of works, in addition to training of young engineering staff of the
MED. Our supervision missions had originally suggested this approach and provide continuing support to this initiative."



- 56 -
inordinate Bank staff resources and time, and problems even then reemerged. Institutional strengthening
also proved more difficult than expected. The Bank was very flexible in agreeing to expand the project
scale greatly and to extend the closing date to permit savings to be used.
6.29   Even so the financing of replacement, repairs and spares for some 325 pump stations in 7-1/2
years (compared with the 30 in 5 years proposed at appraisal) was a substantial achievement. In parallel,
of course, MED was also implementing a similar USAID-assisted project.
6.30   The PCR identified five lessons from the project experience:
a)  the need for a realistic implementation schedule;
b)  that studies relating to institutional objectives used to be completed early 50 that there is
time for implementing institutional aspects;
c)  that a more flexible program  approach to financing, such rehabilitation would be
appropriate;
d)  that the financial capability of contractors should be a factor in their pre-qualification; and
e)  that more accurate methods of unit cost estimate are needed.
6.31   The audit, in addition, identified these lessons:
a)   The Bank should have addressed two issues at the country level rather than project-by-
project. These were the poor performance of public sector contractors (and contributing
inadequate supervision by project agencies) and the failure to use Bank procurement
procedures. The use of model bidding documents, in particular, could have been negotiated
more efficiently at the country level for all projects and agencies.' The excessive use of
Bank staff on repetitive procurement issues was not a productive use of Bank resources.
b)   The use of substantial savings to finance what had been identified as the physical content
of the follow-up project threw away an opportunity for a more substantial review of
progress and the possibility of negotiating further improvements in the program. Applying
additional conditionality was debated in the files, but an easier route was taken. It would
have been preferable to process the follow-up project (with simplified documentation) rather
than agree such a large expansion of the project without resolving emerging issues.
c)   Economic analyses of rehabilitation projects often produce high rates of return. Such
results can be misleading if they are taken to suggest that periodic rehabilitation is
preferable to regular maintenance and replacement. Rehabilitation investments follow, in
most cases such as this, long periods of neglect and financial and economic losses. The
quirk of analysis (by-gones are by-gones) which produces high rates of return to
rehabilitation should be no comfort. Regular maintenance and repair (to avoid higher costs
later) is the preferred strategy, and this supports the case for external aid for such routine
expenditures, rather than waiting for critical rehabilitation needs to be financed as urgent
capital rehabilitation investments.

7. OVERALL FINDINGS AND LESSONS
7.1   In terms of their relevance to the country and sector strategy at the time, the five projects are an
uncomfortable set as representatives of Bank operations in the 1980s in the dominant agriculture sector.
Only the Irrigation Pumping Stations project was truly central to the Bank's policy of supporting
production growth by rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure rather than by costly and lower return
expansion of the productive base. It is relevant that only the Pumping project led to a follow-up
project.' The justification for financing the New Land Project was weak (resting mainly on investment
"balance" rather than economic profitability). The Fish Farming Project was wrong in concept, scale and
design. The investment will be extraordinarily difficult to wrn round into profitability, and can only be
privatized as intended if government writes off much or all of the excessive investment and buys out
surplus staff. Both agro-industrial lines of credit suffered from poor handling by the Bank of a
forewarned (but not forearmed) foreign exchange risk problem.
7.2   In terms of their outcomes (with respect to meeting their objectives) the set had mixed
performance. On the physical side the Pumping Stations project far exceeded expectations at approval,
simply because the Bank, (a) was not sufficiently in touch with world market prices (for the equipment
needed) to get close to a reasonable cost estimate, (b) through a "happy accident", this gross cost
overestimate did not pull down the ERR to where the project was rejected (intuition would have suggested
otherwise, anyway) and (c) the Bank agreed to use the consequent surplus funds to finance the 59 pump
stations identified for the second project. But less impressive progress was made on the institutional side
in improving the management of the huge public sector pumping industry-and much is still to be done.
Despite the cost savings, doubts remain in some cases about the price-based choice of equipment given
the dissatisfaction of Egyptian staff with quality and performance (noise, vibration and reliability were
mentioned). On balance, however, the Pumps project realized benefits greatly in excess of those expected
at appraisal.  In physical terms the Agro-industrial credit projects did not fully live up to their
expectations, despite the enticement of (apparently) cheap subsidized funds (setting aside the foreign
exchange risk). Lending was much less diverse than the Bank wanted, and the peculiar inclusion of
poultry production as the largest single category (without the benefit of sub-project appraisal or sanction
by the legal documents in the first project) remains a puzzling phenomenon. The Bank's failure to deal
adequately with the implications of the feed subsidy distortion contributed to the poultry industry's
problems when market prices suddenly reigned (the Bank was unfair, at best, to blame the PBs-for not
taking the subsidy into account-when it had not appraised poultry sub-projects correctly itself). Across
all the sub-projects financed, however, the impact of devaluation (which was fully expected by the Bank)
on loan costs was disastrous to sub-borrowers, and the law courts eventually are resolving the problem
(but without the efficiency of a class action suit). Despite quite serious implementation problems at times,
the New Land project achieved most of its physical objectives and settlers are prospering (earlier schemes
were marked by settler desertions). Shortage of water has now threatened that prosperity, but this is a
common problem in Egypt to which the scheme must adjust. The outcome of the Fish Farming Project
was closer to objectives than at one stage could have been expected. But the objectives themselves now
seem far fetched, and the government has yet to control the large losses (transferring the excess resources
to a service company seems merely a cosmetic adjustment). In retrospect the venture had unrealistic
objectives and implementation plans which should not have survived Bank internal reviews during project
processing.
26. The Region has noted that: 'agro-industries have benefitted from the Small and Medium Industry Loan and the Export
Industry Loan, as well as the Second Agricultural Development Project; and the recently approved Agricultural Modernization
Project places particular emphasis on lending to agro-industries."



- 58 -
7.3    The efficiency with which all five projects were implemented left a lot to be desired, although
for different reasons and to different degrees (the Pumping Stations project being close to an exception).
The agro-industry projects performed best in this respect. Until the foreign exchange risk dampened
demand for sub-loans, the low interest rate and feed subsidy stimulated high demand. The ownership
of most operations by private sector entrepreneurs should have ensured efficient construction and start-up
of the facilities, but getting to the point where entrepreneurs were in control of sub-projects was
unnecessarily laborious and time consuming. The more independent PBs did better, not being subject
to the bureaucratic delays endemic to the public sector. Some of the procurement for the agro-industry
sub-projects also ran into problems complying with Bank requirements, but not with the habitual pattern
of non-observance of processes that plagued procurement under the other four projects (as discussed
further below).
7.4    Implementation of the New Land, Fish Farming and Pumping Stations projects was beset by the
types of problems that the files indicate were considered normal for all such undertakings in Egypt where
procurement of goods, services and civil works are involved. It will be recalled that one Bank reviewer
accurately predicted that like previous projects implementation would be delayed by cumbersome
bureaucratic procedures, slow review and letting of contracts (for construction and for consultants), and
that poor performance of public sector construction-combined with inadequate supervision by the owner,
would result in poor quality construction. This proved to be the case. (Government staff have noted that
there is a lack of competition between domestic and foreign contractors because standards are different
and Egypt has no quality control system.) Unfortunately, the Bank seemed powerless to affect significant
improvements to implementation capability, although the problems were well known and foreseen.'
What was not foreseen, or at least commented on in the files, is that the result of these inefficiencies in
Egypt is an extraordinary and, in the audit's view, unacceptable level of work for Bank staff. The
laborious Bank method of dealing repeatedly with those expected problems, without seeking a broader
accommodation with the Egyptian authorities was a wasteful use of Bank staff resources. The Bank's
files are congested with exchanges with implementing agencies on procurement problems (including for
consulting services) and construction problems. The overall pattern of these exchanges is one of
repetitive advice, and at times even admonishments, about similar failings to observe agreed and required
processes, without much sign of matters improving over the eight years or more that the projects were
implemented.
7.5    The issues raised by this situation concern both the processes involved and the nature of the
relationship between the Bank and the Egyptian agencies. There are three points to discuss relating to
(a) the use of consultants, or technical assistance, (b) the procurement of goods and services, and (c) the
quality of civil works.
7.6    It is a matter of repeated record that the Egyptian authorities resisted the suggestion that they
could benefit from technical assistance, (in these five projects, as for most Bank-assisted projects in
Egypt) and in any case were reluctant to finance consultants with Bank funds (preferring to use grant
funds). Even so there was apparent agreement to include substantial TA in these projects, but all or part
27. The Region hu commented that: 'In general, where the Bank has maintained a continuing relationship with Egypt (such
as in the drainage subsector and, more recently in irrigation pump stations), there has been a substantial improvement in capacity
building.' The Region also noted that in 1984 the Bank approved a Construction Industry Project, Loan 2460-EGT, which aimed
to help initiate policy reform and, inter alia, strengthen contractual and bidding practices in the sector. However, the project
may have had less impact than planned given that although approved in 1984, effectiveness was delayed by over three years and
US$73.8 million of the US$100.0 million loan has been cancelled. It is due to close on June 30, 1994. Thus the project came
too late apparently, from the files, to improve matters for the audited projects.



- 59 -
of these services were not used, or were hired very late.' Despite the mixed TA performance record,
the Bank continues to regard it as an essential ingredient of the development agenda. Thus the latest
sector report-An Agriculture Strategy for the 1990s (December, 1992)-includes five different TA
programs in its list of areas needing priority attention. Similarly the recently approved (March, 1994)
Agricultural Modernization Project includes provision for technical assistance.
7.7    In the cases of the New Land and the Fish Farming projects, the Bank was clearly a party to
hiring and approving the performance (through field missions) of TA services which did not provide the
inputs needed on two of the technologies involved (crop trials and fish culture respectively). It now
seems extraordinary that the crop trials for the New Land project were eventually dismissed as worthless,
on the grounds of elementary mistakes in experimental techniques, after being approved by Egyptian and
Bank technical staff,2' such that the settlers had to start cropping without a proven cropping pattern.
Similarly, it seems professionally negligent to have designed and constructed a large scale system of fish
ponds, costing several million dollars, before small scale pilot trials had established viable production
systems for Maryut conditions. Thus both these projects proved not to have benefitted to the extent one
might have expected from the employment of costly consultants, and this could have reinforced Egyptian
wariness of such services. On the Bank's side, it was ironic that in the case of the New Land project a
better result for such development was promised (as one of the justifications for Bank support) on the
grounds that the scheme would be properly planned and designed with a feasibility study, compared with
the ad hoc approach hitherto, but that this fell down in the vital area of proving the cropping pattern.
Of course, latterly the halving, or more, of water supplies to the New Land project has rendered
redundant much of the engineering and agronomy technical developments, and calls for development of
farm systems which can cope with the reduced supply.
7.8    With respect to procurement, the argument in the PCR, in one form or another, that it took time
for Egyptian agencies to get used to Bank procedures, does not hold up well against repeated evidence
in the files of the same problems recurring. Thus one agency repeatedly asked for Bank approval of an
award of supply contracts without having observed the prior document clearances by the Bank (as
mandated in the legal agreements). (The audit is concerned that some of the Bank's responses in clearing
such purchases, on only assurances that proper procedures had been observed, fell short of normal Bank
requirements). As a second example, an agency was persuaded to use standard Bank approved tender
documents (to the exclusion of some unacceptable clauses in Egyptian models) only after lengthy
negotiations during implementation, then used the agreed documents for several years, only to revert to
the old unacceptable format (without warning) some time later. The files suggest, and the audit agrees,
that the Bank's procurement procedures were not so much new to the project agencies, but were
unacceptable to project agencies in concept and inclusion of a number of the key principles designed to
ensure open competition and the best values for the buyer.'
7.9    The audit makes two final points on procurement: that being an endemic issue across all sectors,
the Bank's management should have tackled it earlier on a country-wide basis instead of allowing the
28. The audit understands that although some Egyptian agencies may agree on the need for TA, there is great reluctance to use
borrowed funds for the purpose. This attitude may be reinforced by the very high salaries of TA staff (relative to Egyptian staff)
and by a number of unfortunate experiences (including in the Technical Assistance Project-according to the PCR) where TA
has been hired over Egyptian reservations, only to performn poorly.
29. Clearly this throws into question the qualifications of the technical staff involved.
30. Government staff advised at the draft discussion meeting that standard bidding documents have now been agreed with the
Bank and that their use wiU be required for all Bank procurement. It was noted at the meeting that the root of the problem is
that Bank procurement procedures conflict with LAw No. 9, which governs all procurement unless a waiver is obtained.



- 60 -
problem to fester, project-by-project and tender-by-tender, and to create an unacceptable and unproductive
work load for Bank staff throughout the 1980s. Secondly, the solution negotiated with the Egyptians
could have included, as provided by the guidelines (OD 11.02, p. 6), some form of in-country
independent monitoring/pre-clearance system, on the Egyptian account, so that the costs of non-
compliance with routine and agreed procedures did not fall solely on Bank staff. The recent OED report
on Project Supervision has two relevant paragraphs (Box 11).
7.10    Poor construction quality and delayed completion are also apparently endemic. By all accounts
the poor performance of the public sector contractors resulted from lack of competition and lack of
penalties (for poor performance), resulting from the subsector being overstretched. This was compounded
by implementing agencies not providing sufficient on-site supervision of contractors. Indeed on this last
point, some agencies state that having contracted for a public sector contractor to construct an irrigation
scheme or fish farm, it is not considered necessary to supervise the contractor in the normal sense (of
the buyer's site engineer). As a result, the round of rehabilitation and/or reconstruction which had to
follow this lax contract supervision was routine.
Box 11: Procurement Problems 
3. 18 Though there are no comprehensive data, it appears that procurement takes between 30
percent and 40 percent of project specific supervision time (c.f. para. 2.17 and WPII paras.
6.02-6.07). Much of this time is taken up with procurement proposals which initially may be
inconsistent with Bank guidelines. Even where documents are fmally judged to be consistent
with the Bank's guidelines, very considerable amounts of tine may have to be devoted to
detailed examination and discussions with a procurement advisor. Documents which are
inconsistent with the guidelines generate even more work, as Bank staff clarify for borrowers
the options open to them under the guidelines. Though the procurement guidelines provide
considerable discretion to Bank staff, many are reluctant to use it. The very substantial hassle
which follows from any suggestion of misprocurement by an unsuccessful bidder, or firm,
intervention by officials (including Board members) to protest the exclusion of a party from a
short list or other potential contract award, even if the charge or inquiry is completely
unfounded, gives staff a little incentive to take responsibility. There is, on the other hand little,
if any, penalty for delaying procurement, in order to get a second opinion.
3.19 In principle the question of non-compliance should not occur. OD 11.02, paras. 9 to
12 clearly require appraisal of the borrower's procurement capacity, and that the project
includes provisions which will ensure its ability to comply with Bank guidelines. Given the
persistence and importance of procurement problems, despite OD 11.02, it would appear that
provision could profitably be made for independent review of documents on the borrower's
behalf, before their submission to the Bank, or use of a professional purchasing and inspection
service to do the procurement (as provided for in OD 11.02, para. 11 (b)). Total elapsed time
could well be reduced if procurement problems were resolved by the borrower, rather than
interactively between the Bank and borrower. The more general use of model bidding
documents should be able to help in this regard."
2' Extract from: 'Bank Experience in Project Supervision'. April 30, 1992, OED.
7.11    With respect to the Bank's guidelines to its staff, there are two noticeable areas where the
projects' designs and outcomes might have been somewhat different if the letter of the instructions
applicable at the time had been followed. These are:
(a) OMS 4.00 on Technical Assistance highlights early on-para. 5 (a)- that in designing such
components it is important to take account of government's attitude to financing TA through



- 61 -
borrowing. The audit found that in those several cases where TA recruitment came up
against delays and lack of action, this factor was a part of the problem and should have
been given greater weight at appraisal.
(b)  The reallocation of cost savings under the pumps project to financing the pump stations
identified for the second project required extending the loan closing date, including at the
very end to finance a final tender for spare parts. This was a breach of the management
instruction at the time which forbad extensions to use up savings.
7.12   On the borrower's side, although the PCRs document in detail overall generally satisfactory
compliance with specific legal covenants (except for a few delays and omissions), in a wider sense there
was lack of compliance in spirit, if not the letter, with the routine covenants relating to carrying out the
projects with 'due diligence and efficiency" and with observing procurement arrangements. In the first
case the cumbersome bureaucracy and staffing deficiencies were to blame. In the case of procurement
the borrower sometimes failed to observe the procedures relating to prior clearance of bidding documents
(and other steps in the procurement process) such that when the Bank was faced with a fait accompli for
an important tender it was at times flexible, perhaps to a fault, in approving tenders on the basis of
assurances that the Bank's procedures had been observed.
7.13   The overarching lessons learnt from the audit of these five projects are as follows:
(a) Sector Strategy
7.14   It was regrettable that the Bank persuaded itself to depart from its own stated priority (given the
high returns) of rehabilitating the existing productive areas (the Old Lands) for the sake of two non-
conforming outlier operations (New Land and Fish Farming). A sector strategy needs to be followed
or changed.
(b) Foreign Exchange Risk
7.15   The Bank did not handle this issue at all well, especially since it foresaw devaluation. The
current guideline on this point (OD 8.30, para. 7) would have made it more difficult for the two agro-
industrial projects to go forward: 'Where the exchange rate is judged to be significantly overvalued.....
financial sector operations are likely to be exceedingly risky in terms of both the probability of achieving
project and policy objectives and the exchange rate and Credit risk placed on borrowers." Policies for
three circumstances are then distinguished, of which the third applies in this case. Thus when both
exchange rates and interest rates are controlled (implying that sub-borrowers of Bank funds are getting
both preferred credit and preferred access to foreign exchange), the final borrower is expected to bear
the foreign exchange risk, or pay a premium interest rate to compensate the bearer of the risk (para. 78).
In this third situation the guideline ends with comment (and a footnote) especially applicable to the
projects being audited: "Participating FIs' credit decisions must take into account prospective borrowers'
ability to bear the foreign exchange risk to avoid its later being converted into a credit risk to the FU"
The footnote adds: "As noted in para. 7, there is a presumption against financial sector operations in
countries where the exchange rate is deemed to be overvalued."
7.16   Since experience has shown yet again that the policy of passing on the foreign exchange risk to
sub-borrowers (even the not so small ones) gets reversed if the risk occurs (by the courts if need be), or
bankrupts the intended beneficiary, there seems little point in adopting that course in the first place. The
Bank needs to rethink its guidelines on foreign exchange risk relating to credit lines to come up with a
more pragmatic solution which can survive the actual occurrence of devaluation (simply not lending is
not always the answer). It is the government which decides to borrow foreign exchange in order to lend
domestic currency to the FIs and final borrowers. It would appear logical to have government bear the



- 62 -
foreign exchange risk, while requiring that on-lending conditions should not be more onerous than for
other government credit. Thus in such circumstances the sub-borrower should not bear any more
exchange risk than other borrowers of domestic currency and can purchase their foreign exchange, as they
preferred in this case.
(c)  Interest Rates
7.17   This topic is now tackled more properly in a sector or economy-wide context in rural finance or
financial sector operations. It is to be hoped that the days of inconsistently bending to the wind on
interest rate issues (paras. 2.20-2.21), which undermines the integrity of the Bank-borrower relationship,
are in the past.
(d) Country-wide Implementation Capacity Issues
7.18   The volume of correspondence on file, often on repetitive implementation issues, attests to a
general lack of adequate progress during the 1980s in the quality of the Bank/country relationship. Bank
staff were at times exasperated enough to record on file their feelings over how difficult it was to
implement these projects. The procurement processes, hiring and managing technical assistance staff,
managing civil works contractors and the poor quality of civil works were habitual problems.
7.19   It was too much to expect project-specific solutions to this set of implementation problems. Given
that these implementation problem persisted throughout the 1980s without apparent improvement, a more
urgent approach by the Bank, than is apparent on the files, should have been adopted.3"
7.20   Part of the problem  was that the communication process between the Bank and Egypt was
haphazard, and clearly language difficulty was a factor. Material on the files is heavily weighted in favor
of long, detailed messages from the Bank on things that need to be done and exhortations to do them.
But in contrast there is much less in response from Egypt, and what there is may be characterized as
frequently disjointed and unclear, or even incomplete. Language difficulty is the first explanation. It
is obvious in some cases that working in English was not easy for some agencies, and there are explicit
comments on file to that effect. At the meeting in Cairo to review the draft report, it was noted that at
lower levels in the agencies English is not widely known, and that staff work on projects is constrained
by the need for translation. Alternatively, competent technical staff and managers may not participate
in project implementation if their language ability is a constraint. The lesson here is that when such a
communication problem is identified the Bank needs to make extra efforts to overcome it. Some
suggestions are:
(a)  It is not clear why the Bank felt it was Egypt's responsibility to understand and respond
only in spoken and written English, without going some way to communicate in Arabic.
The Bank could have helped by making more use of Arabic speakers and translations of
31. The Region disagree with this finding and commented: "Supervision reports are sent regularly to higher management,
and issucs have been sysematically brought up at 'problem project reviews' involving the Project Director and Progam Director
(now the Country Director) and sometimes the RVP semi-annually. The Bank has held sector implementation reviews with
senior authorities in the country when cross-cutting issuea are discussed; training seminars have been held on such matters as
procurement and disbursement. Yet, if the results do not prove satisfactory, it is nece ary to enquire why it is so. Familiarity
with the Egyptian administration would show that individual Ministries (and agencies) jealously safeguard their turf and it is
difficul to make steady progress all along the front. It is unrealistic to assume that these problems could be tackled at the
"national" level; patient and persistent efforts are needed to deal with them. In recent times, the Bank has been succeasful in
getting the agencies to adopt the standard bidding documents of the Bank."



- 63 -
important documents, and should do so, in the audit's view, in all such cases where a
language problem exists.'
(b)  Similarly the style of the Bank's communications, both letters and telexes, in what may be
described as (sometimes lengthy) flowing literary prose, often with little clear structure,
could not have helped comprehension by Egyptian readers with less than flawless English.
The itemized style of some of the Bank's supervision reporting (Form 590s), for example
some of the excellent later ones for the Pumping Stations project (Box 12), could have been
used more in letters and telexes with advantage. (What a pity the Form 590s themselves
are still held closely by the Bank as internal documents and are not sent to borrowers. If
they were, both Bank and borrower managers would have the same succinct statement with
which to identify and track the issues and as a basis for commrunicating with each other).
7.21   During the 1980s there was clearly a need to cut through to the heart of the systemic issues and
resolve them across the board, rather than persist with the labor-intensive, repetitive case-by-case, and
issue-by-issue resolutions (or often unsatisfactory compromises) that were the pattern. Towards the end
of the 1980s a few references appear to sector performance meetings, but there is little evidence on file
to suggest that sufficient efforts were made to elevate such concerns to management attention, or that
regional or senior management recognized the pervasiveness of the problems or sought to take them up.
32. The Region hur commented that: "Ambic speaing saff have beon involved in moat of the supervision and appraial
missions and the problemu of inadequate performanoe is not afributable to thi.' DIB has uggeted tut more Abic
translations are needed and dth the Bank should use Arabic/English speaking staff (Annex 3).

(i)     ................ .visited MED in June 1991 and reviewed progress in MIS activities.
Section 7:    Summary of Current Proiect Status and Major Problems:
(a)     At the request of the Borrower, the Loan Agreement Closing Date was extended from December 31, 1991
to June 30, 1992 to enable MED to complete the procurement process.
(b)     The overaU performance of the project is general satisfactory and MED are now well established in their
new Headquarters Building and mains electrical power has been connected. A new head of Projects' Sector,
Eng...., Undersecretary of State has been appointed to replace Eng.... who was promoted in April 1991
to Head of MED.
(c)     The final list of procurement items faxed by MED in October 24, 1991 was discussed during supervision
and found to be in order and this list of eleven items makes up the final procurements under Loan 2270-
EGT.
(d)     Most of the outstanding civil works wil have been completed by end of June 1992 other than workshop
building in Edfu and Bayara III pump stations both of which are expected to be completed by end of 1992.
(e)     MED has formed a General Directorate of Technical Inspection with three centers of operation, in the lower
Nile, Cairo and in the Upper Nile. The Directorate has been given ten engineers, and has carried out
routine inspections for about 90 pump stations. The Directorate is, however, stil short of staff, vehicles,
office facilities and logistics. Bank mission has suggested that G.D.T.I. be involved in future verification

Page 2
Comments on the draft report :-
- According to what was mentioned in your report as oe of the lamt leso  was
your Bankl's regret to depart firm its priority of rehabilitating the existing productive
areas ( the Old Lands ) for the sake of  n f    ation (New Land), the
point that we donlt agree with since rehabilitation of New Land is one of the
Govenment's strategy for the development of Egypt's National Economy.
In this aspect our advice is that the World Bank has to provide soft loans to efficient
egyptian banks capable of evauating projects, ctrolling the appL;cation of these
fimds and supervising the achieved results with the panned objectives .
- As for the lack of technical and administrative knowletdge and experience of
individuals in charge of the projects, it can be resolved by allocating finds to be
specified for the taining progress inside and outside Egypt to amr the project's
technical progress, taking into consideration the right selectio of efficient
managing persons and providing them with the needed delegation of authorities
subject to high quality of implementation and their change in case of poor
implementation .
- With respect to the delay of reimburments and the etension of the closing date of
loans than what was planned, this could have been resolved easily by applying a
realistic and flexible implementaion schedule for financing through technical
specialist, in addition to, conditioning the conacts with penalty clauses to asr
the project's completion in time without any delay.
- To avoid insufficient and inaccurate information that results in unsuitable cedit
decisions due to the reliance in obtaining these infornation on diffrent sourms,
there should be coordination between the Walld Bank and National Investment
Bank to quick the constroction of the proposed " Center of Induswl Infomation "
with the participation of banks, insurance companies, industrial companies and
others, in addition to, the detennination of the local industry's opportunity through
the Arab Authority for Industry .
- Concerming the foreign exchange rate and the increase of interest rates that caused
the difficulty of most of the projects, some of which were financed by NBE, studios
have been made on each project at a time with the suggestion of veral solutions to
end its difficulty through rescheduling and capitalizing part of the project's debt .
It is noteworthy that such problems had diminished now-a-days under the
goverment's strategy of emnomic reform applied recently, the unification of fbreign
exchange rates and the declining trend of interest rtes .
..



ANNEX 2

- As pegards to the language and cmmication problem, we popose that it could be
resolved through a repesetative from the World Bank profficient in both arabic
and enalish languages to act as a coordinator in negoetiations with reprsentatives
of companies suffeing from the said problem, in addition to the preparation of the
studies in both languages .
