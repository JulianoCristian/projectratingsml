Project components were modified\n            by splitting the Institutional Support for Government\n            Services from the Environmental Information Services\n            component; expanding from 150 to 600 to 844 the targeted\n            villages, while at the same time quartering the amount per\n            village and curtailing funding of social investments; and\n            adding communes to villages. The two aspects of the\n            components not completed were the opening of a boundary\n            trail and implementation of the park management plan within\n            the Baoule National Park. Lessons learned include: the\n            importance of listening and working with stakeholders using\n            participatory approaches; assessments and feedback need to\n            be backed with tangible data; economic and financial rates\n            of return need to be included in the design of monitoring\n            and evaluation; literacy is a necessary condition;\n            government, non-government, and private agencies play a\n            complementary role in assistance to local communities;\n            decentralization must be accompanied by deconcentration of\n            government services; regular supervision missions are\n            essential; and monitoring and evaluation should remain\n            simple and integrated while involving decision makers at\n            every level."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
