   OED Mission:         Enhancing       development        effectiveness     through     excellence     and i~dep@ndence          in evaluation.


About     this Report
       The Operations        Evaluation     Department     assesses     the programs     and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes:     first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation             process and to verify that the Bank's work is
producing     the expected       results, and second, to help develop          improved     directions,  policies, and procedures         through
the dissemination        of lessons drawn from experience.            As part of this work, OED annually          assesses     about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending        operations.     in selecting operations     for assessment,       preference    is given to those that are
innovative,     large, or complex;       those that are relevant to upcoming          studies or country evaluations;         those for which
Executive     Directors    or Bank management           have requested      assessments;       and those that are likely to generate
important     lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical            approaches      selected for assessment        support    larger evaluation
studies.
       A Project     Performance        Assessment      Report    (PPAR)    is based on a review of the ~mpiementation               Completion
Report (a self-evaluation          by the responsible       Bank department)        and fieldwork    conducted      by OED. To prepare
PPARs,      OED staff examine           project files and other documents,          interview   operational    staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing       country     for onsite discussions       with project staff and beneficiaries.        The PPAR thereby          seeks to
validate    and augment        the information       provided   in the ICR, as well as examine         issues of special       interest to broader
OED studies.
       Each PPAR         is subject    to a peer review process        and OED management            approval.    Once cleared        internally,  the
PPAR is reviewed           by the responsible        Bank department       and amended       as necessary.      The completed        PPAR is then
sent to the borrower         for review; the borrowers'        comments       are attached     to the document      that is sent to the Bank's
Board     of Executive      Directors.    After an assessment        report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed              to the public.


About     the OED Rating           System
       The time-tested        evaluation     methods     used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World                   Bank's work.
The methods         offer both rigor and a necessary           level of flexibility  to adapt to lending     instrument,      project  design, or
sectorai    approach.      OED evaluators         ail apply the same basic method           to arrive at their project     ratings.   Following     is
the definition     and rating scale used for each evaluation              criterion   (more information      is available    on the OED website:
http://woridbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.htmi).
       Relevance       of Objectives:        The extent to which the project's          objectives   are consistent     with the country's
current development           priorities   and with current     Bank country      and sectorai     assistance    strategies    and corporate
goals (expressed          in Poverty    Reduction     Strategy    Papers,   Country     Assistance    Strategies,    Sector Strategy       Papers,
Operational      Policies).     Possible    ratings:   High, Substantial,     Modest,    Negligible.
       Efficacy:     The extent to which the project's            objectives  were achieved,       or expected     to be achieved,       taking into
account     their relative     importance.      Possible   ratings:   High, Substantial,     Modest,    Negligible.
       Efficiency;      The extent to which the project           achieved,   or is expected      to achieve,    a return higher     than the
opportunity      cost of capital      and benefits    at least cost compared        to alternatives.    Possil~le ratings:     High, Substantial,
Modest,      Negligible.    This rating is not generally        applied   to adjustment     operations.
       Sustainability:       The resilience       to risk of net benefits   flows over time. Possible         ratings:   Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely,   Highly Unlikely,       Not Evaiuabie.
       Institutional      Development          Impact;    The extent to which a project improves            the ability of a country      or region
to make more efficient,           equitable     and sustainable     use of its human, financial,       and natural    resources      through:    (a)
 better definition,     stability,  transparency,      enforceability,    and predictability    of institutional   arrangements        and/or    (b)
 better alignment       of the mission and capacity          of an organization      with its mandate,      which derives      from these
 institutional   arrangements.         institutional   Development       Impact includes     both intended      and unintended       effects of a
 project. Possible       ratings:   High, Substantial,      Modest,    Negligible.
       Outcome;        The extent to which the project's           major relevant     objectives    were achieved,      or are expected        to be
 achieved,     efficiently.   Possible     ratings: Highly Satisfactory,      Satisfactory,     Moderately    Satisfactory,      Moderately
 Unsatisfactory,       Unsatisfactory,       Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Bank     Performance;          The extent to which services         provided    by the Bank ensured        quality at entry and

Preface

          This is the Project Performance       Assessment Report     (PPAR) for the Mali Natural
Resource Management           Project (Cr. 23700), for which    a credit in the amount US$20.4      million was
approved     in May   1992. The project     closed on December    3 1,2000,     after a two and a half year
extension.    An Implementation      Completion    Report (Report    No. 22447) was submitted       by the
Africa   Region   on June 29,200     I.

          This report was prepared       by the Operations   Evaluation   Department      (OED) based on the
completion     report, the Staff Appraisal     Report (Report   No. 10370, May 1, 1992), the Development
Credit Agreement,       review   of Bank files and a survey of literature.    An OED mission traveled      to
Mali in October 2002 where it discussed the project with Bank staff, relevant government
officials,  nongovernmental       organizations,  beneficiaries,  donors, consultants,     and academics.  The
cooperation     and assistance of all stakeholders     and government     officials  is gratefully
acknowledged      as is the support of the staff of the World     Bank Country       Office in Bamako.   The
report also benefited     from the preliminary     findings  of an OED desk review,       Community-Driven
Development:      Lessons from     the Sahel-An    Analytical   Review. Since the project involved
building,   in the village communities,      the capacity to manage their natural resources, the
assessment findings       will inform  the ongoing    OED evaluation    of community-driven       development
(CDD)     efforts supported    by the Bank.

          Following     standard   OED procedures,     the draft PPAR was sent to the borrower        for
comments      before being finalized.     In accordance with the Bank's disclosure policy, the final
report will be available      to the public following   submission   to the World Bank's Board of
Executive     Directors.

Summary

          The Natural    ResourceManagement(NRM) Projectin Mali was approvedin May 1992
for a credit in the amount US$20.4          million.  The project closed on December       31,2000,     after a
two andahalf yearsextension.

          Mali's  natural resources have experienced          severe degradation   over the years. The
country's   vulnerability   to drought    gives natural resources like trees, rangelands,     and pastures
particular  importance.    Over the years, the Malian        government   has attached high priority     to
developing    effective  strategies for environmental       management.    In the early 199Os, the Bank and
otherdonorssupportedseveralsmallparticipatorynaturalresourcemanagementexperimentsin
Mali.   Some of the pilots that adopted an integrated        approach to resource management       were
designed and implemented        in participation    with local populations  and showed considerable
promise.Hencethe governmentapproachedtheBankto supportanationwideprogram.
Accordingly,    the NRM    Project was designed as the first phase of a long-term        20-year program.

          The primary objective of theNRM Projectwas to introducea rational land usesystem
that would halt and ultimately      reverse natural resource degradation,       the greatest threat to
sustainableagriculturalgrowth in the country.Specific project objectiveswereto: (i) build the
capacity of local communities        to manage their own natural resources, and build institutional
capacity within    the Ministry   of Agriculture,     Livestock   and Environment    (MAEE)     to enable it to
advisevillages on thesematters;(ii) build anenvironmentalinformation systemfor coordinating
and guiding    the diverse initiatives   underway      throughout   the country,  and incorporate   the lessons
of thosefield experiencesinto a nationalnaturalresourcemanagementstrategy.Mali alsohasa
large and diverse wildlife     population    and the project was also to support preservation        of Mali's
biodiversity   through   sound management         of the Baoule National   Park.

          The project introduced      the borrower     and the communities    to an innovative    inter-sectoral
planning   tool with the potential    to reverse natural resource degradation       in the country.   The
intervention   was designed to be a "process"         project in which building   the capacity in the
community     to manage their own natural resources was a more important              aspect of the design than
the actualphysical investments.The projectwasto be implementedin 150villages in 3 regions.
However     pressures to disburse quickly and achieve greater project impact led to significant              and
premature   scaling up at the Mid-Term        Review     (MTR)    stage and later. The scaling up changed the
dynamics andshiftedthe emphasisin the latterpart of theproject to meetingthenumbertargets.
The attention   to the whole process of creating community            awareness and capacity was diluted.

          The PPAR ratesthe overall outcomeasmoderatelysatisfactoryratherthansatisfactory.
Substantial   investments    in land and water conservation       measures in various villages were made.
A significant amountof infrastructure(schools,wells, granaries,healthclinics, etc.)was
constructed.   However    the project was not successful in resolving       some critical institutional    issues
fundamental    to "establishing   a rational land use system." Land tenure insecurity remains a critical
concern with consequent negative impact on incentives and, hence, attempts at rationalizing                 land
use. The project was also not able to equip the Baoule Park with a system that would stop or
reverseits degradation.Though the settingup of a National EnvironmentMonitoring Facility was
a project sub-component,       environmental      monitoring   did not become functional    until 1997.

          The PPAR ratessustainabilityasunlikely becauseof severalfactors,amongothers,the

provided   to communities     to design and implement        their community    natural resource management
plansled to substantialcapacitybuilding at the community level, field observationsand
conversations    with various stakeholders       raise concerns about the quality    of the capacity built. The

violations  and the scaling up at the time of the mid term review was heavy handed and in total
disregard to the spirit of collaboration     and empowerment        that the project was attempting       to build.
Moreover,thoughtheNRh4 Projectwasthe first phaseof a long term program,the Bank hasnot
followed   through  effectively  and in a timely manner on the planned next phase. The Community
BasedRural DevelopmentProjectis meantto be a follow-on to the NIX&lProject,but it hasnot
yet been approved    (Bank approvaldateNovember2004)anda gapof a coupleof yearsis enough
to lose the momentum      of the first phase. Borrower     performance       is rated satisfactory.

          The assessment notes some issues that merit consideration              in future Bank interventions.
The experience    of the Mali NRIVI Project also offers three important            lessons for future Bank-
supported   community-driven      development    interventions     in Mali and elsewhere:

                  Innovative,   complex, and process-oriented        Bank interventions      (like the Mali NRM
                  Project)requirestrongandconstantBank managementoversightto ensurethat
                  implementation     is aligned with design and that Bank procedures and policies are
                  strictly met.
                  In interventions   like the Mali NRM. Project, performance            indicators need to be
                  designed upfront     to monitor  and track qualitative      as well as quantitative   progress
                  on achievement     of objectives. Although     it is difficult  to measure the quality of
                  capacity building    and community    participation     in decision making,      in the absence
                  of anyattempts,it is likely to receivelessattentionasprojectteamsbecome
                  preoccupied    with meeting progress on quantitative          targets.
                  The harmonizationof thenaturalresourcemanagementregimewith the
                  decentralization   process is an issue that needs urgent attention.         Although   the
                  commune     is the lowest level of government       in the country, most of the activities
                  supportedby theNRM Projectwerecarriedout atthe village level. Clarity on how
                  activities begun at the village level will continue to receive support in order to
                  becomesustainableis essential.

1a        Background

11        Mali is a large, landlocked        country  in Sahelian West Africa.         With an annual per capita
income of US$240,        it is one of the poorest countriesin the world with someof theworst social
indicators.*   Almost    64 percent of the population        lives in poverty     and21 percentin extreme
poverty.*Although poverty is primarily a rural phenomenonin Mali, it is alsoon the increasein
urban areas.

12        Agriculture    and livestock     together provide      livelihood    to about 80 percent of the
population    and account for nearly 50 percent of the country's               GDP. About     9 percent of Mali's
land area is underforestcover, anadditional 14percentis wooded,while a largepart of the north
is semi-desert   or desert with sparse or no vegetation.            Pastoralism    is the dominant   production
activity  in the semi-desert      region, though    livestock    production     is also important   in other parts of
the country.Lessthan a third of the country's land areais arable.Agriculture, evenin the
southern part of the country,        where rainfall   is relatively     abundant   but variable, is constrained    by a
poorroadnetwork andmarket infrastructure,inadequatestorageandprocessingfacilities, high
exposure to climatic      risks, weak institutional      and legal environment,        and inadequate     technical
skills. Agricultural    production--of       yams, cassava, maize, sorghum,           groundnut,   and beans-is
largely rain-fed.    The country has significant        irrigation    potential   associated with the Niger River
but little of it has been tapped. Rice remains the principal              irrigated  crop in Mali. Commercial
crops,mainly cotton, areprimarily grown for export.

13*       Mali's   natural resources have experienced            severe degradation      over the years. The rapidly
rising population     in the country has put increasing         pressure on both agricultural       and non-
agricultural   lands. Limited      development     of the modem        energy sector and consequent        increasing
demandfor fuelwood          andcharcoal,which meet 90 percentof the domesticenergyneedsof the
country,   has contributed      significantly  to deforestation.       Recurring   droughts   have further
contributedto the processof desertificationin the Sahelregion.

 14       The region's     vulnerability    to droughts     gives natural resources like trees, rangelands,        and
pasturesparticular importance.Overthe years,the Malian governmenthasattachedhigh priority
to developing     effective   strategies for environmental         protection    and management.     Mali's    move
toward    decentralization     in the past decade, together        with the disappointing     results of past
centralized    top-down     approaches     to natural resource management,           spurred interest in
participatory    approaches     in the country.    The government        has also attempted     to reorient   laws and
strategiestoward greaterparticipation oftheruralpopulation with the assistanceof the World
Bank and other donors. In the early 199Os, the Bank and other donors supported several small
participatorynaturalresourcemanagementexperimentsin Mali. Some of the pilots that adopted an
integrated   approach to resource management            were designed and implemented           in participation   with
local populations     and showed considerable         promise. Hence the government           approached    the Bank to
support anationwideprogram.Accordingly, theNatural ResourceManagement(NRM) Project was
designed as the first phase of a long-term         20.year     program.     The project was also part of the
National Program to Control Desertificationissuedin 1985andupdatedin 1987.

 15       The primary      objective    of the NRI!vI Project was to introduce         a rational land use system
that would halt andultimately reversenaturalresourcedegradation,the greatestthreatto
 sustainable   agricultural    growth   in the country.     The project     was based on the terroir     land
managementapproach(Box 1). Specific project objectives wereto: (i) build the capacityof local

communities     to manage their own natural resources, and build insti~tional              capacity within   the
Minis~     of Agriculture,     Livestock  and Environment       (MAEE)    to enable it to advise villages on
these matters; (ii) build an environmental        information    system for coordinating       and guiding   the
diverse initiatives   underway     throughout  the country,     and incorporate   the lessons of those field
experiences    into a national    natural resource management       strategy. Mali also has a large and
diverse wildlife   population     and the project was also to support preservation         of Mali's  biodiversity
through   sound management         of the Baoule National     Park. Project objectives remained       unchanged
throughout    the project period.

PROJECT DESIGN

21        The design of the project was ambitious,         complex,    and innovative.    It sought to slow, stop,
aid ultimately    reverse natural resource degradation        in Mali by introducing      a sustainable   land use
system that could balance resource use with regeneration.            The project design provided        for a
"process-oriented"     project   that emphasized    putting  the communities      in the decision making
position  by transferring     the management     of the natural resources to them (Box 1) and putting           the
government     in a supportive    and advisory role.

22        The project    was to assist villagers in setting up and implementing          community    land
 l


management      plans. The project design emphasized          the development     of specific project   details on
the basis of local priorities,    in response to local problems      and in keeping with local potential.
Investment    in training   and skill development     was expected to enhance the capacity of the
communities     to identify   their needs and make decisions.      In preparing    land management       plans, the
capacity-building     exercise was to encourage       communities     to think in terms of ail possible uses of
their land. Communities        could then select from investments       that would stop degradation        of the
soil (water harvesting,      erosion control,  soil conservation,    vegetation   rehabilitation).  A limited
amount of social and production         investments    (up to 30 percent of the cost of a given community
NRM)     with immediate      impact on the community's       life, such as market gardens, livestock
improvement,      small irrigation   schemes, grain storage facilities,     mills, water supply (wells and
boreholes),   village  schools and health units were also to be supported.          Besides meeting      their
immediate    needs, such investments       were to help build village     confidence    in the project   and test
the organizational     capacity   of the communities.     The project was preceded by a four-year
preparation   period   at least half of which was used to test the innovative         participatory   approach.3

23        An important      reason why the Malian      authorities  were interested    in such a national
intervention    was because past isolated pilots interventions        (paragraph    1.4) had not been very
effective  in dealing with issues like land tenure and decentralization4           Secure land rights and clear
legislation  governing     the use of resources are essential if communities        are to have a genuine
interest in planning     for better use of land and are to feel secure about making labor and cash
investments    in land improvement.       Accordingly,    the project was to help develop and test practical
and acceptable     solutions   to problems   of legislation  and land tenure.

Box 1: The Community           Land    Management        or Gestion de Terroir      Approach

During the 1990s the Bank provided support for the terroir approach in several countries in the Sahel
region: Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Bank projects were designed to be first phases of 20,year
programs. A terroir is a physical area of land and water regularly used by a community              for subsistence.
This community,      whether a part of one village or a group of villages, is bound together by common
interests in the agricultural,   forest, pastoral, wild game, and fish resources of the territory. The terroir
approach gives responsibility       for management       of these natural resources in the terroir      to the local
communities.    The aim is to create conditions          for the use of natural resources that are sustainable,
environmentally    friendly, socially and economically appropriate. The approach requires that communities
come together and prepare a `l"erroir Management Plan' for the natural resources in the area. Since it deals
with a range of natural resources, the plan needs to be long-term and include land-use rules governing
access to and exploitation   of common assets such as pasture, forests, and water. Specific land improvement
investments are made mainly on common lands, but may also be made on individual                     holdings. A key
principle of this approach is tailoring interventions to the local context as each area of land has its own
characteristics and dynamics. A blueprint approach cannot work. In addition, the communities need to have
an interest in implementing      the plan. Hence the need for the plan to be designed by the community.           The
local government plays a crucial role in providing technical assistance and guidance. NGOs can also play a
major role in helping communities come together to develop such plans.

24        In addition   to pastures and village lands, the project was also to help stabilize and
preserve Mali's     biodiversity    through   support   for the Baoule Conservation      Area. The
implementing     unit for the Baoule Park component            was the Baoule National      Park Authority
(OPNBB)      of the National     Forestry Directorate.     Project support was to help reverse degradation
trends in the national     park through    redefining    its boundary,   revamping    park infrastructure,
establishing   livestock    corridors and building      capacity   for park management.     The project    was also
to provide   support for the preparation       and execution     of community-based      NRIvI plans in 10
villages that were initially     part of the park but were removed         from the reserve because of the
modifications    in the park boundary,       and for which     tenure was transferred    to the communities.     The
Baoule National      Park component       was financed     in parallel  by UNDP     and IDA,   with the former
playing   the lead role on the donor's side.

25        Project activities    were expected to help improve         the quality of life of about 95,000 rural
pkople living in the project area. It was also to contribute           toward  enhancing    the importance    of
women in natural resource management              as specific attempts     were to be made to consult with
them in villages before      decisions were made on issues like location          and operation    of water points,
movement     and management         of livestock,   and location,   choice and operation     of collective,  food
processing    equipment.

26        Given the ambitious       project objectives,     it was realistic to limit the scope of the project to
 150 villages (including     the 10 which were initially       inside the park) in 3 regions of the country
during the first phase (paragraph         1.4). It is unfortunate   that pressures to disburse quickly     led to
scaling up of the operation       significantly   at the Mid-Term      Review   (MTR)    stage (see paragraph
2.12 for a full discussion).      In 1998, in testing the terroir     approach   at the commune     level, the
number    of villages   was further increased.

27        It may have also been unrealistic         to expect that the relationship    between   the government
 aid the communities       could be transformed       into a cooperative    one in the short time frame of a
Bank project     with the communities       taking the lead and the government         playing  a supportive    role.
 In the past, the administration      and enforcement       of rules and laws by the government,        especially
    departments     dealing   with forestry, had been largely authoritarian.         With the scaling up and the

pressure to cover even more villages quickly,           the task of building      capacity in the communities
and putting    them in the leadership      role became even more difficult.


PROJECT COMPONENTS AND FINANCING                      PLAN

28        Project preparation      was carried out in coordination        with FAO-CP       and other donors and a
 l


multi-donor     appraisal   was fielded in November-December              199 1. The project was approved          in
May    1992 and became effective         in February   1993. The MTR took place in November                  1995. The
project was restructured       in May    1998. It closed in December        2000, after a two and a half year
extension.

29        Project objectives     were to be achieved through         five components:
 l




     *    Community        Natural     Resource    Management        was the largest component          and involved
          identification,    design, and implementation        of community-based         natural resource
          management       plans in 150 villages. When the number            of villages was increased
          substantially    the resource allocations     for the component       were not changed.

     0    Baoule     National    Park and Biosphere        Reserve      was to design and implement          a
          management       plan for the national    park and the establishment        and execution       of
          community-based        NRIvI plans for the 10 villages that were initially           part of the park
          (paragraph     2.4). In addition,   support was to be provided         for rehabilitation    of internal
          trails, rehabilitation    and up-grading    of some existing buildings,        vehicles,    and equipment,
          and temporary       technical  support.

     *    Institutional     Support    for Government        Services was to provide        the government       with
          environmental       and institutional   monitoring    facilities and finance the additional         technical
          support required      to set up, implement,     and monitor     community      NR.IvI plans.

     l    Skills Development         and Public    Awareness      was to provide for the cost of implementing
          the training   program,     public awareness and information          campaigns.

     0    Technical      Assistance    and Research      was to provide     financial   support for technical
          assistance, audits, consultant       services, applied research and studies.

2.10      As appraised      the project was to be co-financed        by Norway,     Germany,      and UNDP.       Of the
total project cost of US$32.1        million   at appraisal,  IDA was to contribute        US$20.4      million  (64
percent of total project      cost), Norway    US$5 million,     Germany      US$1.2 million       and UNDP      US$1.5
million.   The Malian     contribution     was to be about US$4 million         equivalent    (12 percent of total
project   costs) in the form of labor and cash from the beneficiaries.             The IDA credit, and the
Norwegian      amount    were fully disbursed. Actual project          costs at closing were US$32.48          million.


PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

2.11      Implementation       began with the holding       of several launch workshops,          training   sessions,
and team-building       and capacity-building      exercises with government          staff at various levels. Field
activities  did not begin until early 1994 and much of the time in the early period was spent on
diagnosis   and planning.

2.12      Several crucial changes in the scope and organization               of the project design were made at
mid-term:     a fourfold   increase in the number      of villages to be covered (from          150 to 600); the
reduction   of investments      at village level; speeding up of the diagnostic          and planning      phases of the
     ect; a stop on the funding       of social investments;     improving     linkages with agricultural       research
and extension;      and making     greater use of field-based     technical   government       staff. It is not clear

                                                                5


what motivated        the changes introduced         at MTR    because the supervision          report prior to the mid-
term had reported        satisfactory    progress on development           objectives.    The pressure to scale up
seems to have come from a high-level               Bank mission that preceded the MTR?                 Achieving      greater
speed in disbursement          appears to have been a critical         factor!     Project documents       also note that the
change was made to "achieve greater project impact."                    However,       this was interpreted      to mean
covering    a larger number        of communities.      The effect that rapid scaling up would              have on the
quality of support       seems to have received much less attention                than warranted.

2.13       In December        1997, a Bank mission noted that the project was a major promoter                        of
decentralization       and local community         empowerment.         It was then decided that the project           should
contribute    to the ongoing       decentralization     process in the country by helping            communes        design
and implement        their land and natural resource management                  plans. A retrofitting     mission was
carried out in May         1998 and the project was extended.             During     the additional   two and a half years
it was to provide       support to 50 communes          by helping      them prepare communal           natural resource
and rural development           plans similar to the ones prepared           for the villages. As a result, the total
number     of villages     targeted increased from 600 to 800. By project closing, supervision                       documents
report that a total of 844 villages and 58 communes                   had been reached. However,            a large number
of communities        that were included       in the last years of implementation            did not achieve the final
implementation        and investment       phase because of insufficient           funds.

2.14       Lack of knowledge           of Bank procedures,        lack of coordination,       shortage of government
technical    staff, restructuring      of the Ministry     of Agriculture,       Livestock    and Environment,        and the
high level of illiteracy        in the communities      also affected      implementation.       The tremendous        increase
in targets since the mid-term           adversely    affected   the quality of the support provided             to the      I
communities.       Very little progress was made on the environmental                    monitoring     component
between     1993 and 1996 because of technical              difficulties,    lack of coordination,       and procurement
procedures,     and work started only in 1997. This was unfortunate                     as the component        was crucial to
the monitoring       of environmental        impacts.

2.15       Though      project documents        show adequate compliance              with the administrative,
accounting,     and financial       requirements,    representatives       from the private sector, who had
participated    in project activities,      complained      to the assessment mission that they had not received
payment     for work contracted.         This has negative       implications      for the promotion      of private sector
participation     in such Bank supported          interventions.

RELEVANCE

31.        Project relevance is rated substantial.            Although       the project was complex          and ambitious,
its objectives     were sound and important           for the country      and in keeping with the government's
 strategy for ensuring        efficient  and sustainable     use of natural resources in Mali.            Land degradation
is one of Mali's       most serious environmental          problems.      The National      Plan for Desertification
Control    issued in 1985 included          a serious commitment          to the issue. The project        was meant to be

 6. OED observations     are based on information  contained  in an internal   communication    (1996) found in project files.
This ~o~unication       clearly noted that by quadrupling   the number    of villages to be covered by the project from 150 to
     and cutting by half the amount which had been planned         to be invested in each village  at appraisal, there would be
progressive  reduction    in the disbursement  lag.

the first phase of a long-term         pro~am      and built on the experience        of past Bank and other donor
projects in the agriculture        and forestry     sectors. By enabling     the communities       to better plan for the
use of natural resources available to them, the project was to help improve                      the quality   of life of a
significant    number     of villagers. Moreover,       a system of sustainable natural resource management
could help reduce the vulnerability            of the poor to disasters.

32         The participatory      approach that the project        supported    was in keeping      with the increasing
emphasis on stakeholder           participation    in the implementation      of Bank projects.      Today the Bank
regards empowerment           of the poor as central to the fight against poverty.'             Section 4, paragraphs
4.3-4.4 below      provide    a detailed discussion      on the project's     participatory     aspects.


EFFICACY

33.        Efficacy    is rated substantial.      The gestion desterroir approach introduced               the borrower
and the communities          to an innovative     inter-sectoral   planning    tool with the potential      to reverse
natural resource degradation           in the country.    Even though     it was scaled up by more than 400
percent, the project       succeeded in meeting        several quantitative     targets: the number       of villages
covered, number        of sub-project      investments    made in the selected villages,         and number     of persons
trained.   The ICR notes that the project reached 844 villages and 58 communes.                        It also notes the
number      of villages that benefited       from different    kinds of investments.'      A significant     amount of
infrastructure     (schools, wells, granaries, health clinics, etc.) was constructed.               However,     on the
basis of field visits and conversations           with government       staff, this assessment questions         whether
there are adequate        resources available      for operation   and maintenance        (O&M)      of infrastructure
constructed      in the villages. The ICR also notes several other factors that are constraints                  on
sustainability.     Among     others, these are poor management            skills among the villagers        due to
illiteracy,   lack of labor for maintenance          due to migration,     and poor incomes generated           by ill-
chosen investments.

34          Substantial    investments      in land and water conservation         measures in various villages
(water harvesting        techniques,    erosion control,     agro-forestry    plantations,    firebreaks)   were also
made. Project documents           note the substantial      improvements      in soil fertility.   The ICR notes that
production      increases in sorghum         and millet   were 200 and 300 percent respectively.            Assessment
mission     field visits to sub-project       sites and conversations     with villagers     found that the
conservation       measures undertaken         under the project have had positive results. However,               the
villagers    did not appear to be undertaking           the same kind of land conservation           measures on other
village lands after the completion            of the project.  This could be for any of four reasons: first,
because the villagers        are not completely       convinced    about the usefulness of the measures; second,
because they are convinced           about the usefulness       of the measures but lack the resources to carry
them out on their own; third,            they are convinced      about the usefulness of the measures, are willing
to put in the resources, but are not trained well enough to carry out the land improvement
measures on their own and have no technical                 guidance   from an outside organization;          fourth,   they
are convinced,       willing,   trained well enough and have the resources, but are not willing                  because
issues of land tenure and legal ownership               do not ensure that returns will flow back to the
community.        All four hypotheses have implications            for the sustainability     of efforts begun under
the project.     Moreover,     since monitoring      of project   impact was not started until         1998, it is difficult
to make an objective         assessment of how much the land conservation                measures that were

undertaken     actually    contributed  to stemming      and reversing degradation        in project   villages over
pre-proj ect conditions.

35        The project also resulted in substantial         capacity building      for planning     and implementation
in the government        at the central, regional,   and local levels. However,        it is again not clear how
much the project       succeeded in putting     the government       in a supportive    role with the community
taking the lead (para 2.1). Although          the communities      visited appear to have acquired         the
capability    to come together and prepare natural resource management                  plans and prioritize
investments,      mission observations     suggest they have not reached a stage, nor is their relationship
with the local government          changed to the extent, where they can `demand'             support    services from
the government.       It is unrealistic for this to happen in the short time frame of a Bank project.
There are also concerns about the quality            of the capacity built in communities          to manage their
resources, especially       after the MTR     scaling up, for several reasons. First,        since no qualitative
indicators    tracked improvement        in capacity it is difficult    to judge exactly how much improvement
over pre-project      conditions    was made. Second,       given the preference      for social investments
(paragraph     3.12), it is also not clear how much capacity has been built in the community                    to work
toward    meeting     their long-term   development       needs as opposed to the ability       to prepare a list of
investments      that they would like undertaken         in the village through     international    donor support.
Some analysts might argue that given the scarcity of resources available,                   and the poverty      of the
area, this is natural.     However,    experience    shows that even where resources are scarce,
communities       find ingenious     ways of collecting     resources to meet their needs when they know that
no outside resources will be available,          for example,     for social events, like funerals,      which are
traditionally    elaborate    affairs in most of West Africa.       For these life-cycle     events even the poorest
of families     in a community      are able to raise substantial     resources. This is possible because within
the village    there is solidarity    and villagers   come to each others' help and pool resources in times
 of need. While      villagers   are expected to contribute      in cash or kind to sub-project       investments     they
 identify  for support with donors, An issue which needs to be examined                   further   is whether   such a
 strategy,  in which donor support is readily         available    for meeting village needs without          significant
 effort  on the part of the communities,        could be creating a culture of dependency.            This issue is
 expected    to be given significant     attention   in OED's CDD evaluation.

 36        The project was not successful in resolving           some critical institutional    issues fundamental       to
  l


 "establishing     a rational land use system. " Land tenure insecurity remains a critical concern with
 consequent     negative impact on incentives and, hence, attempts at rationalizing               land use.g The
 project completion       report acknowledges      it as a constraint   on project sustainability.    This is not to say
 that the importance      of this issue was not recognized       by the project design. Indeed, there is
 considerable     evidence in project files to show that the issue was considered             critical at the project
 preparation     stage and was flagged as a major concern in the project appraisal document.                  It was a
 basic justification     for a program with a national      focus (paragraph 2.3). However,          during
 implementation       these issues were not given the attention        they deserved, particularly       after the mid-
 term, as the focus was on meeting quantitative            and disbursement      targets. One possible reason for
 this could have been the fact that it was not clearly spelt out at project preparation               which of the five
 project  components        (para 2.9) would be directly       responsible   for addressing it.

 37        The project      was also not able to equip the Baoule Park with a system that would                  stop or
 reverse its degradation.       The management        plan for the whole park was produced            but not
 implemented.       The creation of transhumance          corridors,  though planned,      was not achieved.      Despite
 the realignment      of the park boundary      and the investments       in infrastructure,   the pressures on the

park from humans and livestock           continues.   Neither   was the project able to involve        neighboring
communities       in the management       of the park, even though a total of 45 villages compared             to the
target of 10 which were previously          within  the national     park, were provided     with assistance in
designing     and implementing       community     development      plans. The improved      management       of the
park was expected to increase the wildlife          by 100 percent. However,         an adequate monito~ng
system to be able to assess the increase in wildlife          was also not established.      Further,    there has
been lack of adequate O&M           of infrastructure    constructed    in the park.


EFFICIENCY

38         A qualitative    assessment of efficiency      supports a rating of modest.       As in most such
  l


projects,    no financial   or economic     analysis was undertaken       at either the appraisal or completion
stage. The ICR notes that this was because a large share of the project expenditures                    were for
capacity building,      natural resource rehabilitation      activities,  and social investments       for which
economic      and financial   outputs are very difficult     to measure. However,        an attempt    at calculating
an economic       rate of return for individual    economic     and productive     investments     should have been
made at least at the ICR stage. The absence of baseline data, though,                remains a serious challenge
to the measurement        of economic     impact  of the project.

39         The assessment field trip also noted low rates of utilization            of some of the sub-projects,
particularly,     dispensaries.  O&M     and management       of other investments      due to illiteracy    or lack of
capacity in the communities         has been raised as a concern even by the ICR. The assessment was
not able to undertake       an independent     economic    analysis for the project.     Given the shortcomings
in the M&E,       it was not possible to build an estimate of the benefits         flowing   from the project,
particularly     those related to increase in the capacity of the community.

3.10       Further,   the scaled-up project was able to reach a far larger number            of villages than
visualized    at appraisal. Since the total credit amount was not increased, this brought                down
considerably      the total project expenditure     per village or per household       from what was anticipated
at appraisal.     However,   reduction    in the budget   envelope adversely affected        the quality of the
input.** Since little, if any, monitoring       of achievements      was qualitative,   it is difficult   to assess
how changes in expenditure          affected  the capacity building      exercise in the village communities.


OUTCOME

3.11       On balance, the assessment rates overall outcome              as moderately     satisfactory.     OED rates
outcome      as moderately    satisfactory   when a project is expected to achieve its major relevant
objectives    with significant    shortcomings.     The shortcomings       outlined  under efficacy      are
significant.

3.12       The intervention     was designed to be a "process"         project in which building       the capacity in
the community        to manage their own natural       resources was a more important          aspect of the design
than the actual physical investments.          The project began testing an integrated         approach     to rural
space management         in Mali, however,     during   implementation      the pressure to scale up changed the
dynamics      and the emphasis in the latter half to meeting          the number    targets. As designed,      the
social investments      were to help build confidence        in the project and test the organizational
capacity of the community.         It seemed a good idea to have these as a confidence              building  exercise


10.The project completion report notesthat the 400 percent increasedueto the scaling up in terms of number of
vill..ges to be reachedwasdone without budget increasesandcouId not bemet with aproportional increaseof staff

                                                               9


pa~icularly     since past relations between        the state and the communities         had been autho~ta~an         and
the project   was attempting      to put the communities          in the decision making      role with the
government      playing   a supportive    role. However,       data available    from the project office in Mali
shows that on project closing nearly 40 percent of the total amount spent on sub-project
investments     was for social investments,        about 27 percent was related to natural resource
management,       12 percent was for productive           investments,    and about 20 percent was related to
agriculture    and livestock activities.     Given that at MTR         a decision was made not to allow any
further   social investments,     the nearly 40 percent of the total was more than the amount just
needed for "confidence        building."    It raises concerns because on project closing the O&M                 of these
facilities  is an important    sustainability     issue. It also raises questions about the understanding            of
the capacity-building       exercise among project         field staff that were working       in the villages. For a
full discussion     on this issue see paragraph       4.4.

3.13      The assessment also has concerns about the environmental                    impact   of the Baoule National
Park component.        It was a major shortcoming          that despite interventions     in a national    park no
environmental       assessment was done (for more on this see paragraph                3.25). Implementation        of the
Baoule component         required realigning      the boundaries      of a national   park, and the rehabilitation      of
roads inside the park-both         activities   with potential      for serious environmental       implications.
Although     the park area has been substantially           reduced, there has been no decrease in human and
animal pressure on it (paragraph          3.7).

3.14       In fairness, it is worth noting      that the project was clearly intended          to have a positive
impact on the environment.         The appraisal      document      had realistically   noted that any program        that
simultaneously      seeks to enhance production           and protect the natural resource base can have
negative    impacts that need to be foreseen          and provided      for in terms of mitigation     plans.
Consequently,       as a condition    of disbursement,       no withdrawals     were to be made for expenses
under the Baoule National         Park component        until new park boundaries         satisfactory   to IDA had
been adopted      by the borrower      and a statement       of its impact on the environment        and indigenous
people had been reviewed.         Project files do note that all the conditions          of disbursement      had been
met. However,       it is not clear how satisfactory        was the statement      of the impact on the environment
and indigenous      people. Despite extensive         search, the document        containing    the statement of the
impact    on the environment       and indigenous      people has not been found.         Conversation     with Bank
staff involved     in project implementation         in Bamako showed that they were not even aware that
such a document        had been produced.       Though      the setting up of a National      Environment
Monitoring      Facility  was a project    sub-component,          environmental    monitoring     did not become
functional    until   1.997. Further, the ICR notes that during proiect implementation                there was a
significant    area of natural habitat that was converted            to~btton   fields.


SUSTAINABILITY

3.15       On balance,     sustainability-the       resilience to1 risk of net benefits     over time-is      rated
unlikely.    This is because of several factors. First, the project was meant to be the experimental
first phase of a long-term       program.     Therefore,     it is unreasonable    to expect that elements of
sustainability    would    have been built in the short first phase, though            one would     expect to see
movement       toward    sustainability   in the second phase. Concern          that preparation     for a second phase
had not begun before the closing of the project can be seen in supervision                     documents.    The project
closed in December        2000 and no immediate            second phase followed.       A new project, called the
Community       Based Rural Development            Project (CBRD)        is under preparation     and is meant to be a
follow-on     to the NRIvi and the Grass Root Hunger Poverty Projects in Mali.                    However,    it is yet to
be approved      and there has already been a considerable              gap since the closing of the NRIVI Project
   `th negative    consequences      for sustainability.     Besides, the considerable      time gap has already
resulted    in loss of trained personnel       that had worked       under the project.

3.16        Second,the project was scaled up at the MTR stage, and later again in 1998. Overall, this
involved      a total increase in villages to be covered from 150 to 800 (an increase of more than 400
percent)     with no increase in the total credit amount or total project cost. Such a dramatic increase
in targets made it very difficult           to allow for the essential elements of sustainability                to be put in
place in the communities.            The ICR itself acknowledges            that, of the communities         reached through
the project,     only a few have been provided             the level of assistance needed for them to reach an
acceptable      level of capacity and investments              that would allow for sustainability.

3.17        Third, issues regarding           land tenure and legal ownership           of collective    investments,
critical to providing       incentives      for communities        to manage the resources in a sustainable manner
and have an interest in making              investments      in the land, have yet to be resolved.

3.18        Fourth, a large amount of infrastructure                was constructed      at the village level, but there are
few arrangements         evident at the community             level for its maintenance.       Though     community
members       may be aware of the importance               of maintenance      and a significant      number      of them may
have been trained,        in reality,    the lack of available resources on a continuous              basis to allow for
O&M       was observed in the field to be a significant              constraint.   Neither    the local government           nor
the community         has the resources to pay for a trained doctor or nurse to staff the dispensaries or to
allow for continuous          O&M.      The story would        have been very different        if the development          plans
had linked and balanced productive                with social investments         in the community,        i.e., the income
from the productive         investments        providing    the resources to pay for the O&M             of the social
investments.       In recognition      of this problem,       the proposed     Community       Based Rural Development
Project is attempting         to link income       generation     with upkeep and maintenance            of investments."        If
such an approach         is followed,      sustainability     of investments     under that project will likely be
assured, however,         it is difficult    to say what will happen to past investments.              Social investments
were meant to be a very small part of project                  financing   in the NRM. Project. In practice, despite
the fact that their financing          was banned after the MTR,            they account for almost 40 percent of total
sub-project      investments.

 3.19       Fifth, as already noted, the project focus was to be on village-level                     capacity development
and planning       and empowerment             of village communities.        However,     with scaling up, the whole
process of creating community                awareness,    and of diagnostic       and strategic planning         was rushed,
 and attention     to it was diluted.

 3.20        Sixth, in the NRIVf Project the focus was on the terr&u approach at the village level.
 Although      the approach was widely            appreciated,     the terroir was not a legal entity. With
 decentralization      in Mali the commune            and not the village has been made the lowest level of
 government.       When the project was retrofitted              in 1998, it was proposed        to provide     support to a
 limited    number    of communes          for developing       commune-level       development       plans. The focus in the
 CBRD       project is also at the commune            level. It is not clear what this means for village-level
 activities   supported     by the NRpvl Project in the past, and whether                the new project will provide           the
 level of assistance to those village communities                  that had in the past received some assistance but
 less than the amount required             to reach an acceptable        level of capacity and investments           that would
 allow them to become            sustainable.




 11. The initial  documents    for the project note that in previous  rural development   projects sustainability  has been a
 major issue for investments made at the community          level and hence this is to be an important  focus of the new project.
 In particular  the documents    note that no investment   will be financed  unless there are income generating     activities to
 enable communities     to pay for services provided     by these investments; there is capacity to efftciently   manage these
      stments, there is sufficient   demand for these services, input supply is available   to keep these investments running
      other necessary infrastructures    are available  to operate these investments and link them to the market.

                                                                 11




3.21       Institutional   development       impact     is rated substantial.        The training     and extension
program      led to significant     awareness of the gestion des terroir             approach      at the community       level.
Training     of women was also emphasized.               The support that the project provided              to communities      to
design and implement           their community         natural resource management            plans led to substantial
capacity building       at the community        level, though,      as already noted, the assessment does have
concerns about the quality          of the capacity built.

3.22       At the commune         level the elected members of the Commune                    Council    are often members
of NRl!++JVillage     Committees.       The project       documents      see this as a demonstration          of project
success with community            empowerment          and capacity building.        However,      OED experience
suggests that there is need to exercise caution in drawing                    this conclusion      since such a situation
could arise because of elite capture at the level of both the village NRNI committee                             and the
Communal        Council.   Unfortunately,       the assessment mission did not have time to explore this issue
further   in the field. However,        the OED CDD evaluation              will examine      issues of elite capture in the
context    of its country     studies.

3.23       Substantial     capacity was also built in the various government                  institutions,     including    the
Ministry     of Agriculture,    Livestock     and Environment,         involved    in project     implementation.      Though
late in the project cycle, the project also succeeded in building                    an environmental         information
system. Training       and technical     assistance provided         by UNDP        improved      the institutional    capacity
of the park staff. A large number           of extension       agents were mobilized          of which a significant
percentage      were women.


BANKPERFORMANCE

3.24       Bank performance         is rated unsatisfactory          for several reasons. There were at least two
safeguard     violations   and OED's guidelines            call for Bank performance           to be rated unsatisfactory
when there are any safeguard            violations.*2     However,     even if the safeguard         violations    had not
occurred,     OED would        rate Bank performance           as unsatisfactory      for the other reasons noted below.

3.25       First, regarding       the safeguards,      the project was classified        as Environmental         Category     D.
According       to OD 4.00, October        1989, Category        D projects were Environmental               Projects for
which     environmental      assessments (EAs) may not be required                 since the environment          would be a
major focus of project preparation.            However,       in October      1991 (before project appraisal, which
took place in November-December                 1991), OD 4.01 had been issued, which dropped                      Category    D
and included       only three project categories.*3          Since the categorization         had changed and the project
involved     changing    the boundaries       of a national     park, it should rightly       have been reassigned to
Category      A. But, with the change in the applicable              OD, in practice       the D category was interpreted
to be a Category       C project    in which no EA was required.              Hence, important        environmental       issues
were not given the attention          they should have been. The park boundaries                   were realigned,      its size
was reduced by 30 percent, and a significant                 number     of villages that were inside the park were
moved      out. It would    have been a different         matter if the realignment         was fixing      a problem,    i.e., a
reclassification     of a boundary      that had been wrongly           drawn for a national         park and if villages that


12. It is not clear whether there was a third safeguard violation.    Resettlement    issues may have arisen during the
realignment   of the park boundary   and this would    have triggered  Operational   Policy 4.12 on Involuntary    Resettlement.
A significant   number of villages  that were initially  part of the park were removed     from the reserve because of the
modifications   in the park boundary.

were inside the park had been farming           the land. However,      the reclassification    actually resulted in
a significant    area that had been under natural habitat being turned into cotton fields. This is
acknowledged       by the ICR. It is surprising     that this issue was not flagged       during project
supervision.

3.26      The second violation      relates to the Indigenous      People's safeguard.       A condition    of
disbursement      for the project was the adoption      by the Borrower       of new boundaries      for Baoule
National   Park, and a statement      on its impact on the environment          and indigenous     people and its
review by IDA.       Since there were indigenous       people issues the Indigenous         Peoples' safeguard
should have been triggered.

3.27      Second, the scaling up at the time of the mid-term             review    and later was heavy-handed
and in total disregard of the spirit of collaboration         and empowerment         that the project was
attempting    to build. Project files show that there was little consultation            with other donors
involved    in the project and the implementing         agency staff were also not consulted.         Moreover,
rapid scaling up added to the complexity          of the operation     with negative     consequences     on project
implementation.      Two of the concerns that had been raised at the project negotiation                stage was the
complexity     of the project   and adequate resources for implementation.

3.28      Third,    the Bank has not followed       through    effectively   and in a timely manner on the
planned   next phase. The CBRD          is meant to be a follow-on       to the NRM. Project, but it has not yet
been approved      and a gap of a couple of years is enough to lose the momentum                  of the first phase.
Moreover,     a large number     of the technical   staff trained under the earlier project have also moved
away.

3.29      Fourth,    one of the risks identified     by the appraisal document         was insufficient
understanding      of the community      based natural resource management             approach.   Participatory
development      was recognized     to be time-consuming        and requiring     sufficient  attention   up front in
training  and capacity building.      However,     in recommending        rapid scaling up, Bank staff showed a
lack of understanding       of the participatory    approach.

3.30      Finally,   given the complexity       of the operation,    supervision    should have been more
intense than it actually was.14


BORROWERPERFORMANCE

3.31      On balance, borrower        performance     is rated satisfactory.

3.32      The borrower      was committed      to the development       approach    and endorsed it during a
regional   meeting    on desertification    and natural resource management            in Segou, Mali,    in 1989.
The Quality      Assurance Group Quality        of Supervision    Assessment       confirms   this commitment.     The
government      provided    adequate   support to the project and the main coordinating            and
implementing       agency was well organized        and had committed        staff. However,     the performance    of
the park authority     was not up to the mark and frequent          changes in leadership       there were partly
responsible     for the less-than-adequate     performance      of the Baoule National       Park component.
Government       enforcement     of the conservation     law was also weak, with negative          consequences     for
the implementation       of the park component.




 14. This was flagged as a concern by the Bank's Quality  Assurance  Croup Quality  of Supervision  Assessment 3.

                                                          13


3.33      Repeated restructuring      of the ministry    in charge of the project,    shortage of government
technical   staff, and lack of coordinating      authority   in the project's   Central Implementing       Unit were
other factors that also negatively      affected  implementation.



40        Evaluation Findings

41        This assessment notes some issues that merit consideration              in future Bank interventions.
k addition,    since the project   design incorporated      a participatory    approach,  the design and
implementation       of the demand and supply components           have also been assessed on their
participatory     aspects.


OUTPUTSVERSUSOUTCOMES

42         The project experience     shows that as designed the project clearly emphasized              outcomes.
The original     design was reasonably      well thought    through    and incorporated    a specific plan for
phasing    of village participation   in the project, indicating     the importance     of achieving     outcomes.
But it seems the distinction      between    outcomes    and outputs became blurred        in the designing     of
project monitoring       and evaluation   as M&E    indicators    were largely to track outputs (number          of
villages approached,      number    of NRM. plans prepared,        etc.). With the scaling up after MTR,        the
emphasis     shifted completely    from outcomes      to outputs. The underlying       assumption     in the scaling
up seems to have been that the achievement            of outputs would      somehow    result in the achievement
of effective   outcomes.


PROJECTPARTICIPATORYASPECTS

43         The project did succeed in including        the village communities       in the decision-making
piocess. It had several features that were meant to promote              empowerment.      Two aspects of the
project   design were to promote      empowerment.        First,  the project provided    for local participation
in the identification     and implementation     of rural development       and natural resource management
activities.  It was to put communities       in the center of the decision-making        process and provided
for the development       of local incentives   and skills in development       planning,   implementation,      and
management.       Indeed,  allocation  of responsibility     and authority   to communities     was recognized      as
the key to success. Village      Natural    Resource Management          Committees    were constituted      early in
the process as an essential initial point of contact. The community              was to lead in allocating     land
use according      to community    goals and there were to be clear, openly negotiated            agreements
between     administrative    and technical   authorities   and local communities.      At least until it was
scaled up, project teams used participatory         rural appraisal and devoted       considerable     time and
resources to getting the community          to understand     the gestion des tevroir approach. Identification
of potential   activities  was a multi-stage    process involving       diagnosis,  planning,  and prioritization.

44.        Second, participating     communities     could choose from a variety of social and productive
investments     that met their priority   needs (see para 2.2). The project also provided           substantial
support for capacity building.       However,    the project experience      raises questions about the         .
relevance    of the community-level      capacity building      exercise. What determines       that the capacity
building    component     has achieved   its purpose? Is it the ability to get communities         to quickly
identify   their priorities  so that the project  can disburse relatively      quickly-or     is it to establish
community      capacity for long-term      sustainable development?        Utile   the capacity-building      effort
clearly succeeded in training       the villagers  to prepare development        plans and identify     their needs
asst`evident in the sub-project    selection process, it was wanting        in developing    in them the capacity

to balance their long term with their short term needs. As already noted, social and productive
investments      rather than those investments            that actually reverse the degradation          of the natural
resources formed          the largest percentage,       in terms of resources spent, of sub-projects            undertaken."
In selecting     sub-projects      to be financed,      poor villagers may sometimes           have difficulty     in giving
preference     to the long-term        (investments      that would reverse the natural resource degradation)
over meeting       their immediate        needs in the short term (social investments).             Communities       without
access to schools and health centers may see their short-term                      needs as more important.          Benefits
from investments          that are meant to reverse natural resource degradation                 materialize   over the long
run, and, particularly         in situations   where the tenurial       arrangements      are unclear, communities          may
have doubts about the benefits             that they can reap Tom these investments.               This risk was noted by
the Mid-Term        Review       mission.   The capacity-building         exercise needs to be planned         so that it is in
tune with the expected project             outcomes      and does not serve to meet project outputs only.



50         Lessons

51         The experience         of the NIUvl Project offers three important             lessons for future Bank-
supported      CDD interventions          in Mali and elsewhere.

Lesson     1:

Innovative,     complex,       and process-oriented         Bank interventions       (like the Mali NM        Project)
require    strong and constant Bank management                    oversight    to ensure that implementation          is aligned
with design and that Bank procedures                 and polices are strictly        met.

At least three aspects of the project            could have benefited         from greater Bank management
oversight.     First,    the project began testing an integrated            approach     to natural resource management
in Mali.    However,       during    implementation        the decision made by a Bank mission changed the
dynamics      and the emphasis in the latter half to meeting                the number      targets. This could have been
 avoided had more attention             been given to whether the recommended                scaling up at the mid-term
would jeopardize          basic project     objectives.    The ICR itself notes that one solution would have been
to stick to the project targets and closing dates as planned                    and to launch a second phase early with
 larger targets, more financial           and human resources, drawing            lessons from the first phase.

 Second, the safeguard           violations    could have been easily avoided had there been greater vigilance
 exercised in applying          the Bank's Operational          Policies.

 Third,    the project was designed          to be an experimental         first phase of a long term program.           The
 gap in time in getting         a second phase approved            has had tremendous       negative   implications      for
 sustainability.     Such lack of adequate          follow    through   lowers the perceived        value of Bank
 statements     in appraisal reports professing            commitment       for follow-up     phases. This is partly a Bank
 budget management            issue and partly an issue of weak rural sector input into the Country
 Assistance     Strategy.

 Lesson     2:

 In interventions       like the Mali     NM     Project, performance          indicators    need to be designed upfront
 to monitor     and track qualitative        as well as quantitative        progress     on achievement      of objectives.
 Although     it is dtflcult    to measure the quality of capacity building             and ~ommuni~ participation           in




 15. If the purpose was only confidence      building   (as noted in para 2.2), smaller and less expensive social investments
     Id have been undertaken      as large social investments like schools diminish    the importance  of the natural resource
 management     activities  from the perspective   of the villagers.

derision makingsin the absenceof anyattempts,it is likely to receivelessattentionasproject teams
becomepreoccupiedwith meetingprogresson quantitativetargets.

During    project implementation,      more attention    was given in the project to completing      the number
of sub-projects,   disbursing  the credit amount,      and holding    the identified number of training
courses. All of the supervision      reports cite progress in terms of number        of communities    reached,
number    of extension  agents, number      of villagers   trained, etc. mere     the reports note that capacity
of the government     or communities     has been improved        they give no indication    as to how this was
assessed. The reports provide      little information    on qualitative  progress on the extent of capacity
built in the communities     to manage their environment.         The importance     of qualitative monitoring
and evaluation    in a process-oriented    project cannot be overemphasized.

Lesson 3:

Theharmonizationof the natural resourcemanagementregime with thedecentralizationprocess
is an issuethat needsurgent attention.Although the communeis the lowestlevel of governmentin
the country,most of the activities supportedby theNM Project werecarried out at thevillage
level. Clarity on how activities begunat thevillage level will continueto receivesupportin order
to becomesustainableis essential.

With decentralization     in Mali,  the commune      and not the village    has been made the lowest level of
government.     When the project     was retrofitted   in 1998, it was proposed to provide        support to a
limited   number   of communes     for developing     commune-level      development    plans. The focus in the
CBRD     project is also at the commune       level. It is not clear what this means for village-level
activities  supported  by the NRlkI Project in the past, and whether         the new project will provide     the
level of assistance to those village communities          that had in the past received some assistance but
less than the amount required      to reach an acceptable       level of capacity and investments     that would
allow them to become       sustainable.
