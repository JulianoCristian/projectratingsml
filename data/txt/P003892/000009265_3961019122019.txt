IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(Loan 2773-IND)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fisheries Support Services
Project in Indonesia, for which Loan 2773-IND in the amount of US$ 24.5million equivalent was
approved on December 19, 1986 and made effective on May 7, 1987.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1994, the original closing date.  On
February 26, 1993 and July 20, 1993, amounts of US$ 2.9 million and US$ 1.6 million were canceled
from the loan. Final disbursement took place on May 5, 1995, at which time a balance of US$ 3.6
million was canceled. Cofinancing for the project was provided by the Government of Indonesia.
The ICR was prepared by Jan Pruntel, East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by
Gershon Feder (Division Chief, EA3AG).
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission,
November 27 - December 19, 1994. It is based on material in the project file. The borrower
contributed to preparation of the ICR by presenting views reflected in the mission's aide-memoire,
preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and initial preparation and commenting on the
draft ICR

FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(Loan 2773-IND)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.          The Bank has been involved in two earlier fisheries development projects in Indonesia
(Cr. 21 1-INS, effective January 1971 and closed June 1978; and Cr. 480, effective January 1975 and
closed December 1981). The emphasis in these projects was on financing of fishing vessels for state
enterprises and cooperatives, with half of the second project (Cr. 480) focused on aquaculture. The
economic rate of return (ERR) estimated at completion of the first project was negative and of the
second, 29%. The main lessons learned from previous projects are: (a) state enterprises, while often
the only choice for operation of shore facilities, are not very efficient at fishing; (b) aquaculture
development provided essential employment and income to a large number of subsistence fish farmers;
and (c) credit recovery from farmers and cooperatives should take place at the time of fish catch
delivery and marketing.
Project Obiectives
ii.         The project's main objective was to increase non-oil exports by providing support
services for private investments in the fisheries sector, while reducing government subsidies. The
project provided funds for the following major components:
(a)        physical infrastructure rehabilitation, including 295 km of primary and secondary
brackishwater canals serving 11,000 ha of ponds (tamnbaks) in South Sulawesi, 5,000 ha
in Aceh, and 2,000 ha in Southeast Sulawesi;
(b)        strengthening coastal aquaculture shrimp farm development by improving access to
water supplies, better on-farm water control, farm management, through improved
credit delivery and the provision of investment support to fishermen and fishermen's
groups;
(c)        improving supply of shrimp seed (post larvae-PL) to fishermen in the project area
through the provision of credit for the establishment of fry rearing and distribution
facilities and technical assistance to private sector hatcheries;



iin
(d)        strengthening marketing support services for marine fisheries involving the construction
of a cold store, ice plant and freezer, and restructuring of state fisheries enterprises;
(e)        fisheries technique development (adaptive research);
(f)        training and technical assistance for DGF manpower development, planning, and for
project preparation; and
(g)        a small pilot component for ensuring environmentally sound coastal aquaculture
development, involving the poorest coastal fishermen.
iii.        To promote the achievement of project objectives, the Loan Agreement stipulated the
establishment of a Project Coordination Committee, a Project Liaison Office in the Directorate General
of Fisheries (DGF) and a Technical Committee for Inftastructure Improvement consisting of
representatives of DGF and the Directorate General for Water Resources Development (DGWRD).
The latter intensively consulted with farmers, in particular during the design stage.
iv.         The project objectives were complex and risky (para 1.2). Because of delays in
implementation and emphasis on proper designs and implementation, the project area has been reduced
from about 18,000 to 12,000 hectares (para 3.11). The credit component for tambak improvement
failed because of Bank Rakyat Indonesia's (BRI) reluctance to engage in high risk lending following the
farmers' poor repayment records (paras 1.3, 2.2).
Implementation Experience and Results
v.          The project has so far achieved most of its stated objectives (para 2.1); however,
sustainability of the tambak component is uncertain and will largely depend on future government
commitment to implement the agreed Operational Plan. Its actions to reduce disease risk by improving
production practices are going to be very important (para 4.1). Sustainability of the relatively small
marine fisheries component is, however, likely (para 4.2).
vi.         Project costs at closing, which was on schedule, are about US$ 23.8 million, about 60%
of the appraisal estimate. This lower cost can be explained by the reduction in tambak area by one
third; and the devaluation of the Rupiah by 30% during the project period. A change in financing
arrangements was the shift from the use of credit for the financing of tertiary canals to public funds
(para 3.6).
vii.        Key factors affecting achievement of major objectives are given in Chapter 3 and
include: (a) high intensity stocking and production which is partly responsible for high incidence of
shrimp diseases in particular in Aceh province (para 3.2); (b) the earthquake that hit Flores island in
December 1992 and which destroyed the onshore facilities (para 3.3); and (c) shortage of shrimp PL
and milkfish fry affecting production in particular in Southeast Sulawesi (para 3.4). Factors subject to
government control include: (a) lack of coordination between implementing agencies (para 3.5); (b)
failure of the tambak improvement credit component and the subsequent implementation of tertiary



iv
canals on government grant funds (para 3.6); and (c) land acquisition problems in Aceh and South
Sulawesi causing delays in project implementation (para 3.7). Factors subject to agencies control
include: (a) design flaws affecting water circulation which was in part responsible for the incidence of
shrimp disease (para 3.11); (b) monitoring quality of civil works (para 3.112); (c) establishing extension
services and the appointment of Zone and Block Managers (para 3.13); (d) selection of expensive
fishing vessels (para 3.14); (e) selection of the wrong nucleus estate firm responsible for the operation
of the fishing vessels (para 3.15); and (f) insufficient monitoring and evaluation capacity of the agency
(para 3.16).
viii.        Bank performance has been deficient in project identification, preparation assistance
and appraisal (para 5.1) and the Bank did not sufficiently realize that there was no well proven model
for intensification of the small-scale tambak sector; there was also insufficient understanding of how to
create a realistic tuna component (para 5.2). Borrower's performance has been deficient in particular in
project preparation and implementation coordination (para 6.1).
ix.          Project outcome has been rated satisfactory as the project achieved most of the stated
objectives and the re-estimated rate of return (ERR) is about 15 percent (para 7. 1)
Summary of Findings. Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned.
x.           Inadequate project preparation both by the Borrower and the Bank caused considerable
implementation setback as reflected in the reduced project area.  Provided that Government
implements the agreed Operational Plan, in particular by ensuring adequate funding and staffing, the
project will most likely be sustainable. However, farmers must better cooperate and jointly improve
production practices thus reducing disease risks. Key lessons learned are:
(a)         thorough project preparation is a prerequisite for successful implementation; in case of
uncertainties  regarding   new   technologies  and  institutional  arrangements,
implementation should start on a pilot basis rather than full scale;
(b)         project agencies tend to work closer together at lower levels of Government; placing
responsibility at the District rather than Central level generally improves performance.
Supervision missions should focus on improving agency coordination, in particular at
central level;
(c)         when using private parties in a project, a suitable selection procedure, which takes into
account competence and experience should be followed;
(d)         shrimp cultivation is a risky venture; to avoid diseases, schemes should be operated as
designed and Government should impress on farmers not to misuse the system by over-
intensification in order to make quick gains; and
(e)         as farmers generally did not have land certificates as collateral, banks were reluctant to
provide agricultural credit.  Land titling under the national program  should be
accelerated.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(Loan 2773-IND)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1.    Project Objectives
1.1   The project's main objective was to increase non-oil exports by providing support services for
private investments in the fisheries sector, while reducing government subsidies. This was to be
achieved by: a) improvement of water supply and productivity of coastal aquaculture (tambaks); b)
improvement of technical and managerial performance; c) strengthening of services to coastal
aquaculture (credit, extension); d) focusing fisheries research on problems directly affecting production;
e) encouraging private sector investment in marketing support; and f) restructuring of State Fisheries
Corporations.
1.2   The project objectives were complex and risky and very demanding on the main implementing
agency, the DGF. If the appraisal mission had fully recognized that the project involved uncertain
technologies, which were untested on a large scale, it might have instead designed pilot operations,
focussed on answering key technical design, institutional technical support and risk questions. This
would have reduced the size of the tambak component, possibly to a size even smaller than the
(reduced) final area now covered by project facilities, and might have increased the research
component. Under the circumstances prevailing at the time of appraisal, the design of the marine
component appeared reasonable.
1.3   In view of the risk of tambak improvement credit (known from previous projects, and from the
refusal of at least one bank - Bumi Daya - to participate in the project on account of their stated
inability to control risks), the appraisal mission could have given more attention to the institutional
requirements of the BRI because the experience of this bank indicated the need for caution and in-
house specialized experience in lending for tambaks. BRI hardly lent and the Bank did not disburse for
the tainbak improvement credit component; this part of the loan was therefore canceled. Creating a
credit component as a pilot might have allowed BRI to develop suitable arrangements for its credit
operations before applying them as standard all over Indonesia.



2
2.    Achievement of Project Objectives
2.1    The project has so far achieved most of its stated objectives. From a macro-economic
perspective, the project contributed to the increase of non-oil exports through the export of shrimp and
tuna fish. The project also substantially improved water supply in the entire revised project area and
provided the basic tools to improve productivity; it improved services to tambak farmers through the
appointment of Zone and Block Managers and the creation of farmer's groups. The project had some
impact on research, did support investment in cold storage facilities by the private sector, and initiated
absorption of a State Fisheries Corporation into a private company. It was successful in poverty
reduction by allocating the project financed fishing vessels to relatively poor fishermen. By favoring
coastal aquaculture intensification over clearing mangrove swamps to create new ponds, the project
environmental impact has been positive/neutral.
2.2   The credit component for tambak improvement failed because of BRrs reluctance to engage in
across the board high risk lending without sufficient tools and knowledge to reduce risks. The failure
of the credit component, which can be partly attributed to the absence of land titles, forced the Bank to
accept an arrangement for funding tertiary canals which was similar to what it initially rejected: from
public sector funds.
2.3   The marine component was kept in the project because of Indonesian interest in encouraging
the nucleus estate (NES) concept, while the Bank wanted to use it as a showcase for State Fisheries
Corporation privatization. However, its impact demonstrating these principles has been less than
hoped for. Although the viability of using private companies to support small scale fisheries was
ultimately proven by the project, this component succeeded solely on account of the quality of the
management of the private company which ultimately managed the project financed fishing fleet. The
crucial importance of management effectiveness on the success of such ventures was already well
known from similar operations in other parts in Indonesia, but it received only cursory attention during
appraisal.
2.4   The fleet of 26 fishing vessels financed by the project was tiny in comparison to the entire
fishing fleet in the area. The impact on foreign fishing, the original objective, must have been very
small indeed. More fundamentally, this objective is effectively controlled through sector policy guiding
foreign investment, which was beyond the scope of this project.
3.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
3.1   The loan was approved in December 1986, became effective in May 1987 and closed as
scheduled on December 31, 1994 . During the first two years of implementation, disbursements were
on target or ahead of appraisal estimates. However, three sets of factors affected implementation
performance thereafter. First factors not generally subject to government control including: a) over-
intensification of tambak production which is partly responsible for high incidence of shrimp diseases in
particular in Aceh province; b) the earthquake that hit Flores island in December 1992 and which
destroyed the onshore facilities; and c) shortage of shrimp PL and milkfish fly affecting production in



3
particular in South East Sulawesi. S  factors subject to government control including: a) lack of
coordination between implementing agencies; b) failure of the tambak improvement credit component
and the subsequent implementation of tertiary canals on govenmment grant funds; c) land acquisition
problems in Aceh and South Sulawesi causing delays in project implementation; d) land tax, ISF
introduction and operation and maintenance (O&M) funding; e) supervision of the coastal fisheries
development pilot component; and f) excess cold storage capacity on Flores island. Third, factors
subject to agencies' control including: a) design flaws affecting water circulation which was in part
responsible for the incidence of shrimp disease; b) monitoring quality of civil works; c) establishing
extension services and the appointment of Zone and Block Managers; d) selection of expensive fishing
vessels; e) selection of the wrong nucleus estate firm responsible for the operation of the fishing
vessels; and f) insufficient monitoring and evaluation capacity of the agency. These factors are
discussed in some detail next.
3.2    The infrastructure provided under the project has been designed for relatively modest levels of
shrimp culture intensification of less than one ton/ha/year. Farmers introducing high intensity stocking
and production not only expose themselves to considerable risk of disease and subsequent crop failure,
more importantly they expose low intensity farmers around them to the same high risks, as the present
system cannot avoid that polluted water and disease from the high intensity farms enters the low
intensity farms. In spite of extension efforts by DGF, in Aceh the effect of disease has been most
pronounced; many high intensity farms have been affected by complete loss of crop, affecting
surrounding farmers as well. In South Sulawesi the incidence of disease is picking up parallel to the
expansion of high intensity farms, while in South East Sulawesi where no such farms have yet been
introduced, disease has been reported mainly only in hatcheries.
3.3   In December 1992, a severe earthquake followed by tidal waves completely destroyed the
onshore cold storage, brine and ice making facilities financed by the project. The entire building and
waterfront collapsed; the ground level subsided some 2-3 meters and the area is now partly under
water. Fortunately, the fishing vessels were not damaged except three, which needed minor repairs.
The insurance claim for the lost facilities was finally honored in late 1994 and it is understood that P.T
Bali Raya (PTBR) used the money to settle its outstanding loan with BRI. Because of other private
facilities now operating in the area, there is no apparent need to rebuild.
3.4   In South East Sulawesi, production levels have increased over those in non project areas, but
are still modest compared to South Sulawesi. In addition to more conservative attitude of the less
experienced farmners, an important reason for this low production is an acute lack of shrimp PL and
milklcsh fry following serious disease problems in the hatcheries and subsequent bankruptcy of the
supply company. Meanwhile, another private company, P.T. Perken Putera, has initiated operations,
following the NES approach. It supports supply of shrimp PL as well as processing and marketing of
shrimp.
3.5    One of the factors affecting project performance which is subject to Government control is
project coordination. Although the central Project Coordination Committee (PCC) was established by
decree, it rarely met in later years and did not review project progress and plans in quarterly review



4
meetings as supposed in the SAR And while the Project Liaison Office (PLO) took the lead in starting
up the project, the two main implementing agencies, DGF and the DGWRD, later on worked quite
independently making it difficult for the lead agency (DGF) to monitor implementation progress.
Program coordination was more efficient at the Provincial and in particular the District level, where the
agencies worked well together under local leadership. This has had a favorable effect on the outcome
of the project.
3.6   Farmers were expected to finance the tertiary canal system from credit provided under the
project. However, due to poor repayment records on previous loans, BRI declined to make this credit
available. Government then requested the Bank and the mid-term review mission (November 1991) in
principle agreed to finance this component from the loan, provided that GOI could give evidence that
farmers were too poor to develop these canals at their own cost. As data showed that the average
income of the project beneficiaries was about three times that of poor families, the Bank rejected loan
financing and GOI decided to finance tertiary canals from its own funds. Although this has caused
some delays in project implementation, GOI then speeded up construction of tertiary canals, achieving
95 percent progress by the end of Government's FY95. The remaining area will be completed in FY96.
3.7   Land acquisition problems emerged early during implementation.   Despite financial
compensation, this caused considerable implementation delays in Aceh and about 1,000 hectares of
tambak development was canceled as these could not reasonably be implemented during the remaining
project period. Similar problems occurred in South Sulawesi, where no financial compensation was
made and farmers donated their land. In view of the huge increase in land values, beneficiaries
generally accepted this condition, as on average only about 4 per cent (ranging from 1-10 per cent) of
their land was needed for rehabilitation of the primary and secondary canal systems. Although all
farmers signed agreements declaring that they would donate their land, in some areas farmers' groups
changed their mind during construction. This resulted in cancellation of two contracts covering about
450 hectares.
3.8    During the course of the project, awareness for scheme O&M has significantly improved both
at central and local levels. Government now recognizes that the maintenance costs for tarnbak schemes
are generally higher than for irrigation schemes; budget allocations have increased from about
Rp35,000 to over Rp5O,000 per hectare. In addition, the collection of an Irrigation Service Fee (ISF)
was introduced in South Sulawesi and will be gradually expanded to cover agl improved tambak
schemes thus ensuring future O&M financing. Parallel to the introduction of an ISF, Government
reassessed land values and is now collecting over 30 per cent more land tax (PBB) than in 1990.
Because of high returns to shrimp cultivation, these higher farmers' contributions appear to be justified.
3.9    As provided for in the SAR, between 1987 and 1990, a Coastal Zone Pilot Component was
carried out under a contract between the Ministry of Population and Environment (MPE) and a Non
Government Organization (NGO) covering several villages on the North coast of central Java. The
results were evaluated by two universities, and except for the hatcheries part, considered
unsatisfactory. The MPE then requested and the Bank agreed to repeat the experiment in South
Sulawesi to be implemented by one of the universities. After review of their proposal in June 1993, the



5
Bank concluded that further support to this component would depend on Govemment's commitment
to continue the work after loan closing. However, as no such commitment was made the experiment
was discontinued.
3.10   Since 1989, PTBR operated the cold storage (500 mt), brine freezer (40 mt), ice plant (10 mt)
and workshop, which were partly financed from the loan through BRI. Because of lack of working
capital, operations stopped in March 1992, well before it was destroyed by the earthquake that struck
later that year. After March 1992, fishermen sold their catch to other private cold storage facilities in
the area which had developed since appraisal. Before the earthquake, the cold storage capacity at
Maumere was about three times larger than the available catch and therefore under-utilized. Although
some facilities were destroyed, the remaining capacity is sufficient to handle the present catch.
3.11   The mid-term  review  mission noticed several design flaws in tambak schemes under
implementation and recommended review of all designs and to carry out remedial works. This was
followed up by the implementing agencies, and where physical conditions permitted, particular
attention was given to: a) separating inlets from outlets to ensure the exchange of pond water; b)
connecting tambak with irrigation schemes where appropriate, thus ensuring optimum mix of fresh and
saline water, and c) preventing sedimentation of inlet/outlets by means of gabion groynes structures.
DGWRD implemented the remedial works in a satisfactory manner and the present canal system is
adequate for shrimp fanning at the designed extensive production levels. Largely because of this
emphasis on remedial works rather than expansion of scheme rehabilitation, the project area has been
reduced from the SAR estimate of about 18,000 to 12,000 hectares.
3.12  In the early project years, the quality of civil works was often unsatisfactory. In particular poor
compaction of embankments along canals and the presence of organic materials in fill was observed by
early Bank supervision missions. These problems were addressed through: a) greater attention given
to supervision and quality control; b) training of selected PWRS staff on construction supervision; and
c) establishment of and close monitoring by the Quality Assurance Office in DGWRD which was
established with support of another Bank financed project (Ln. 3392-IND). These interventions,
initiated by the Bank, brought significant improvements in construction quality.
3.13   After following frequent training programs, extension services provided by the Zone and Block
Managers to farmers and their interaction with farmers, has gradually improved. However, for Block
Managers to perform their tasks effectively, further strengthening of the Water User Associations
(WUA) is essential. Stronger and better functioning WUJAs are a prerequisite for tackling the serious
disease problems.
3.14   The Bank should not have approved the procurement of relatively overpowered and very
expensive fishing vessels that were neither initially accepted by the fishermen nor economically viable,
and in addition had not yet been tested in the area. The vessels were solely accepted on the
recommendation of the Ministry of Finance that this was what the fishermen wanted. That these
vessels are currently making money for their owners is the result of a substantial depreciation of the
value of the vessels when they were sold by PTBR to P.T. Perken (PTP) and the changing behavior of



6
tuna stock near Flores island, which require fast boats able to reach the more distant fishing grounds,
which better suits the fast vessels financed under the project compared to the slower but much cheaper
traditional wooden vessels.
3.15  In hindsight, the wrong firm (PTBR) was selected to manage the fishing vessels and to
introduce the NES concept. It would have been more prudent if a marine fisheries firm had been
retained through a suitable selection process. Almost immediately after completion of the onshore
facilities and delivery of the boats, PTBR lacked working capital and was unable to support the
fishermen in a satisfactory way. Also loan repayment (including interest) fell rapidly behind and caused
BRI to accept a considerable loss when the vessels were transferred to PTP. While current production
levels are still below the target of 100 ton/year/vessel, arrangements made by PTP reflect strong
management and marketing skills of this company. As PTP has also satisfactorily introduced the NES
concept in other parts of Indonesia, prospects for future sustainable performance are good.
3.16  DGF, as the lead agency, did not have the in-house capacity for effective monitoring and
evaluation of project performance. Although Block and Zone Managers collect detailed infornation
on cropped area and production, there has been no proper processing of the data and reporting. In
September 1994, the agency agreed to engage the services of a local consultant to prepare an adequate
input into the Bank's ICR and the agency's own PCR.
4.    Project Sustainability
4.1   Sustainability of the tambak component is uncertain and will largely depend on future
Government commitment to implement the agreed Operational Plan. Its actions to deal with the
disease issue and private sector (NGOs) involvement to motivate farmers' groups effectively in
improving production practices and thus reducing disease risks, are going to be very important.
Attracted by the prevailing high shrimp prices, the incentives for farmers to adopt high risk stocking
and production practices will be substantial, and the social restraint imposed by farmers' groups and
civil servants may not balance farmers' greed. In recognition of the disease problem, the Government
has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen its national shrimp health
management capabilities. Shrimp Disease and Diagnostic Service Centers will be set up, including the
provinces covered by the project.
4.2   Sustainability of the marine fisheries component is likely.  With its strong management
capabilities, PTP has made arrangements to improve crew incentives, disposal of the catch, baitfish
arrangements and training. PTP is using collector vessels to enable the fishing boats to move to the
best seasonal fishing areas. The vessels themselves, heavily powered, fast, appear well suited to handle
the changing fishing circumstances of the area. At current levels of indebtedness, vessel operators are
making good money and are well motivated.
4.3   Sustainability of infrastructure works supported under the project would depend not only on
GOI's commitment and level of O&M funding provided but to a larger extent on the cost recovered



7
from the beneficiaries and consequently a reduction in O&M contributions by the public service
provider.
5.    Bank Performance
5.1    Bank performance has been deficient in project identification, preparation assistance and
appraisal, but has been generally satisfactory in supervision. Project design changed frequently during
preparation, appraisal and negotiations, the victim of changes and often conflicting views about
objectives and sector strategy in Indonesia and in the Bank. This caused basic technical and
institutional issues to receive insufficient attention. The project design was not helped by the fact that a
joint sector strategy study with ADB was executed parallel to the preparation process, not before.
When the strategy was finished, it did little to stabilize or converge the views in Indonesia and in the
Bank about the project.
5.2   The changing focus of the project created major problems with detailed preparation and design,
despite the fact that the entire preparation took about five years. The Bank did not sufficiently realize
the disease risks involved in promoting intensive shrimp monoculture and there was equally insufficient
understanding of how to create a realistic tuna component. The changing focus took the attention
away from basic technical issues and most of the design had to be done during implementation of the
project. This has been a major factor behind some of the implementation problems, including design
mistakes and uncertainty about key design parameters. During implementation supervision, designs
had to be revised and remedial works had to be executed to establish an satisfactory and sustainable
infrastructure.
5.3    The project was ambitious and complex, with multiple components dispersed over many
geographical areas. This complicated project implementation and caused a heavy burden on Bank
supervision.
6.    Borrower Performance
6.1    Borrower's performance in preparing the project has also been deficient as views in DGF and
Bappenas about key issues like the NES concept, credit, coastal zone management, resource surveys,
and the funding of the private sector (PTBR) sometimes differed or changed, possibly on the account
of personnel changes. General project implementation coordination by DGF has been inadequate;
however the provincial services and in particular the District services have been working well together.
Performance of field staff (Zone and Block Managers) has improved and is generally satisfactory; their
motivation to interact with the farmers and combined with their technical skills, are important for future
project performance.
7.    Assessment of Outcome
7.1   The outcome of the project has been rated satisfactory. The project achieved most of its stated
objectives. The re-estimated rate of return (ERR) is 14.7 percent (15.3 percent for the tambak and 6.0



8
percent for the much smaller tuna components) against an appraisal estimate of 24 percent. The lower
estimated ERR is caused by the incidence of shrimp disease, which has suppressed production, and by
the increase of costs. The latter is partly the result of not using Conversion Factors in the analysis. The
application of the Conversion Factors used during appraisal would increase the ERR to some 22
percent, mainly because of the higher than expected shrimp price. Although sustainability is still
uncertain and very much depends on Government's commitment to implement the agreed Operational
Plan, initial actions have been encouraging.
8.    Future Operation
8.1   The ICR mnission of November-December, 1994, reviewed the Operational Plan and was
satisfied with it. Government gave assurances that the financial implications of the plan would be
reflected in its annual budgets starting FY96.  The plan clearly presents the institutional and
management aspects that need attention to ensure satisfactory operations. Its main elements are: a)
technical audit: a joint verification of scheme completion by DGF, DGWRD and WUAs to ensure that
it can function as designed; b) permanent employment of Zone and Block Managers to continue
technical support to farmers; c) arrangements for the financing of O&M, including introduction of ISF
in all project areas; d) setting up of a Task Force to combat shrimp and fish disease including financial
support by ADB for setting up Shrimp Disease Diagnostic and Advisory Service Centers; e)
Monitoring and Evaluation activities compiling and analyzing data at the farm, district, provincial and
national levels; and f) production input demand projection and marketing plan including production
quality control at public and private hatcheries.
8.2   Bank follow-up action (support to AARD under the proposed ARM II project) will be geared
towards ongoing research activities related to tuna stock assessment and, depending on the availability
of funds, research on environmental management of shrimp ponds. Further support could be
considered under the Regional Agriculture Development projects now under preparation. Such
support should focus on technical, socio-economic, institutional, and policy questions, which need to
be approached in "pilot" circumstances, and, when adequately resolved, the findings should be
translated in provincial or national programs.
9.    Key Lessons Learned
9.1   a)    thorough project preparation is a prerequisite for successful implementation; in case of
uncertainties  regarding  new  technologies  and  institutional  arrangements,
implementation should start on a pilot basis rather than full scale;
b)    project agencies tend to work closer together at lower levels of Government; placing
responsibility at district rather than central level generally improves performance.
Supervision missions should focus on improving agency coordination, in particular at
central level;



9
c)    when retaining private parties in a project, a suitable selection procedure which takes
into account competence and experience should be followed;
d)    shrimp cultivation is a risky venture; to avoid diseases, schemes should be operated as
designed; Govermnent should impress on farmers not to intensify to make quick gains;
e)    as farmers generally did not have land certificates as collateral, banks were reluctant to
provide agricultural credit.  Land titling under the national program  should be
accelerated; and
f)    in terms of poverty alleviation the project would have achieved more if its activities had
focussed more on South East Sulawesi rather than South Sulawesi.

FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(LOAN 2773-IND)
November-December 1994 Supervision Mission
S U M M A R Y
World Bank Mission:       Messrs. J. Pruntel, G. van Santen, M. Hasan and
S. Prayitno.
GOI Counterparts:         BAPPENAS, DGF, DGWRD (DOS), PRIS, Fisheries Services and
BAPPEDA in Aceh, S. Sulawesi, S.E. Sulawesi, and
Nusa Tenggara
Purpose of the Mission:
This was the final supervision mission prior to the closing date of the
Loan  (December 31,  1994).   The mission followed-up on findings  and issues
identified by earlier supervision missions. In particular, the mission assessed:
(a) the degree of achievement of project objectives; (b) prospects for project
sustainability; (c) Bank and Borrower Performance; (d) project outcome; and (e)
review the operational plan prepared by the Borrower. The mission also provided
advice and support to the Borrower for preparing its own contribution to the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
Current Project Status:
Rehabilitation and construction of main and secondary canal system
(tambaks)  completed;  tertiary canal system completion about 90%.   Remedial
measures to improve water circulation in South Sulawesi have been successful and
risk of disease was reduced. Actual area developed exceeds revised SAR target
as farmers adjacent to the schemes convert paddy fields into tambaks. Funding
for O&M remains at satisfactory levels; ISF pilot project was introduced in South
Sulawesi.   Production data  (yields/area)  are inconsistent and need further
review. Main problems are: a) the incidence of disease, in particular in Aceh,
where a large part of the area is affected resulting in a serious drop in shrimp
production; b) shortage of shrimp fry in Southeast Sulawesi. The insurance claim
for cold storage, destroyed by earthquake in 1992, was settled. PT Perken Putra
has hire/purchase agreement with 26 fishermen for their boats.   Catches have
increased and performance of marine fisheries component has improved.
Main Agreements:
Main agreements are contained in the "Operational Plan" to be executed
after Loan closing (December 31, 1994).  Elements of the plan are:  a) early
verification of tambak scheme infrastructure to ensure that systems can perform
as designed; b) appointment of zone and block managers as permanent staff; c)
introduction of ISF in all schemes; d) tackle the disease problem (assistance by
ADB and WB under project ARM-II); e) implementation of M&E system; and f)
improving quality control measures at shrimp hatcheries. DGF also agreed to:
a) provide the Bank, by January 31, 1995 with accurate production data; and b)
prepare, by March 31, 1995, its own contribution to the ICR.

FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(LOAN 2773-IND)
November - December 1994 Supervision Mission
(Implementation Completion)
AIDE MEMOIRE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.    A World Bank mission,  comprising Messrs. J. Pruntel, M. Hasan (RSI),
G. van Santen (World Bank), and S. Prayitno (Consultant) reviewed progress on
project activities. As the Loan closes on December 31, 1994, this was the final
supervision of the project, at the same time laying the groundwork for the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission provided advice and support
to the Borrower for preparing its own contribution to the ICR. On November 30,
1994 an introductory meeting was held at the Directorate General of Fisheries
(DGF). This was followed by field visits to Aceh, South and Southeast Sulawesi
and Flores where detailed discussions were held with project staff, the
Provincial and Kabupaten services.   A wrap-up meeting chaired by Mr. Djoko
Sugiarto, Director of Planning, DGF was held on December 15, 1994. This Aide
Memoire records the mission's main findings and recommendations and is subject
to review and confirmation by the Bank's management. A copy of the Operational
Plan prepared by the Borrower is attached to this Aide Memoire (Attachment 2).
The mission would like to express its thanks for the assistance and courtesies
extended to it during the review.
II. PROGRESS ON ACTIONS AGRBED WITH PREVIOUS SUPERVISION MISSION
2.    The  following  main  actions  agreed with  the  previous  mission  were
implemented:
a) construction of civil works (main and secondary canals) was completed in
all schemes;
b) O&M and extension training programs were executed as planned;
c) the ISF pilot project was introduced in S. Sulawesi;
d) the insurance claim for cold storage (Maumere) was settled.
Further actions are pending regarding:
a) review of lay-out of tertiary canals to ensure integration with main
system; and



b) promote marketing and seed production, particularly in Southeast Sulawesi.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
COASTAL AOUACULTURE
Implementation Program of Infrastructure
3.    Rehabilitation and construction of main and secondary canals throughout the
project areas with a total of about 12,000 ha has been accomplished
(Attachment 1).  The total area served will likely expand to over 12,000 ha, as
many farmers outside the project boundary, especially in Aceh and S. Sulawesi,
are converting their paddy fields to tambaks.   Remedial measures on intake
modification to overcome sedimentation problems at eight intakes in S. Sulawesi
have been completed.   Performance and overall configuration of gabion groin
structures in S. Sulawesi looked sound and is expected to induce self-flushing
in a sustainable way.   Installation of flap gates and additional fresh water
supply canals to improve water management in Aceh and S.E. Sulawesi have been
completed. Construction quality in general is acceptable.
4.    The mission is concerned that the constrtction of drainage canals of the
irrigation scheme upstream of the tambaks at Jeumpa Peusangan has not been
implemented in good coordination with water use for tambaks as recommended by an
earlier Bank mission. The mission reiterated its recommendation to carefully
review this during the verification process (para 6) taking into account the
possible impact of diluted pesticide in waste water from paddy on shrimp culture.
5.    Construction of tertiary  development  under GOI  financing  (FY94/95),
covering a total area of 2,300 ha in Aceh and S. Sulawesi is ongoing and progress
is about 50%.   The mission reiterates the need to integrate the supply and
drainage system of the main system with tertiary systems to ensure proper water
management. In particular, DGF should ensure integration during the completion
of the remaining 590 ha tertiary development in S. Sulawesi under the FY95/96
program.
Verification of Tambak Schemes
6.    An important factor in project sustainability is the transfer of a tambak
scheme from implementation to the O&M stage. A transfer process and procedure
should be formulated with the objective to undertake a technical audit to ensure
that a scheme is complete and operational. The verification process should be
undertaken in-house by representatives from implementing units (i.e. the Project
Office of P2DR and Dinas Perikanan) and the unit responsible for O&M (i.e. local
authorities through Bappeda and Cabang Dinas of PRIS and Water Users
Associations). Completion of the O&M preparation activities such as organization
and staff employed, O&M facilities and manual should also be verified. If the
scheme cannot function properly, remedial works should be undertaken under the
responsibility of implementing units prior to transfer to O&M.   The mission
strongly recommends that an effort be made to undertake this as an integral part
of the Operational Plan.
2



OMeration and Maintenance
7.    In all project provinces, the O&M organization has been set up under Cabang
Dinas of PRIS with adequate staff at each level. A sub-ranting (juru) covers
about 1,000 - 1,500 ha and two or three sub-rantings are headed by a ranting
(pengamat).  The average budget provided for O&M of the main system has been
increased from an average Rp.19,000/ha in FY92/93 to Rp.56,000/ha in FY94/95,
which is about double the budget allocated for O&M of rice irrigation.  This
should be maintained in the coming years. To provide the O&M staff with proper
manuals, DGWRD is now preparing the O&M Manuals for three provinces to be
completed by the end of December 1994. These manuals are prepared by three local
consulting firms: PT Mediatama Indokonsult, PT Team Indodesign and PT Anindya
Wiraputra Konsult. O&M training for jurus and pengamats emphasizing on on-the-
job training has been conducted for all three provinces.
8.    Introduction  of  an  Irrigation  Service  Fee  for  tambaks  progresses
satisfactorily. The area covered is about 5,658 ha in three districts (Pinrang,
Maros and Barru). Formation and training of supervision teams at district as
well as Kecamatan/Desa level, issuance of Bupati's Decree, formation of P3A
together with its training, have been completed in October 1994. The consultant
(Euroconsult and Pusat Pengembangan Agribisnis) is now conducting land
registration, inventory of service level, lay out and socio-hydrological maps,
preparation of tariff assessment, and service agreement. Since the tambak water
supply is different from common irrigation systems, application of ISF for tambak
water supply needs special attention and should be monitored and evaluated by
central as well as provincial (Tingkat I) level.
Current SVstem Performance
9.    Patterns of development of the aquaculture component in each of the three
provinces are becoming clearer following completion of most of the infrastructure
works. While several factors currently determine individual pond performance
under the project, one stands out: the way the farmers manage their own tambaks
and jointly manage the water supply system, which in turn determines the
increasingly serious impact of shrimp diseases.
10.   System management.  The infrastructure provided under the project has been
designed for relatively modest levels of shrimp culture intensification 1. Such
operations would not require the sophisticated water and pond management systems
High intensity operations require sophisticated canal and pumping
systems, pond designs and management, and very carefull management of individual
ponds, to ultimately ensure optimal growing conditions and relatively low levels
of stress for shrimp. High levels of stress will make shrimp populations much
more susceptible to disease; in low intensity operations stress will occur only
if major deviations take place from optimal conditions - the system is more
tolerant in reacting to mistakes -, while in intensive operations the
requirements are much more exacting. The key feature of the system - separate
water inlets and outlets for each pond, ensuring that contaminants from one pond
cannot enter other ponds - is still not well understood by farmers and
extension staff; many farms take water and drain water into the same canal. This
enhances the chances of disease spreading.
3



of high intensity farms, provided shrimp cropping intensity levels would without
exception remain modest, possibly less than 1 ton/ha/year.   In the system
designed for the project, farmers introducing high intensity stocking and
production not only expose themselves to considerable risks of crop failure as
project infrastructure and system management are not designed for these
operations, more importantly they expose low intensity farmers around them to the
same high risks, as at present the system cannot avoid that polluted water and
disease from the high intensity farms will enter the low intensity farms.
11.   As discussed below, the incidence of disease in two out of three project
areas suggests that weak pond and system management, including the increasing
frequency of unsustainable levels of intensive stocking is currently the
singlemost important factor determining project performance.  The strategy to
address the immediate need for further improvements in pond management and
particularly exclude high intensity operations in low intensity areas, would need
to combine: a) stronger efforts to train block and zone managers, and through
them farmers, b) strengthening the effectiveness of water user groups, resulting
in improvements in water management - including fresh water mixing - and agreed
and enforced limits on stocking densities in each individual group, c)
continuation of the verification review ensuring that the system operates as
designed, assisting farmers in making needed improvements in ponds and teriary
canals, and d) the introduction of provincial licensing arrangements for high
intensity farms which would restrict such operations to areas outside low
intensity farming areas.
12.   Shrimp Disease.   2 As a result of weak system management, disease is
increasingly affecting pond production inside and outside the project area. In
Aceh the effect of disease has been most pronounced; many high intensity farms
are affected by complete loss of crops due to disease, affecting surrounding low-
intensity farmers. Reportedly, in Simpang Ulin disease has affected over three-
quarters of all the farms in some blocks, in Samalanga several blocks reported
that less than half is being affected. In South Sulawesi the project area was
widely affected prior to infrastructure construction in 1991, possibly reflecting
the prevailing poor infrastructure, system management and low quality seed.
Since then two relatively disease free years have occurred, but the incidence of
disease is picking up parallel to the expansion of the number of high intensity
farms, in some areas reportedly affecting some 30 percent of the farms. While
much less serious than the situation in Aceh, the rapid expansion of the
conversion of rainfed paddy fields into tambaks in the project area, increasing
the (unplanned) demand for water from the newly constructed canal system, in
combination with the uncontrolled introduction of high intensity operations
suggest that the risks of disease may be increasing rapidly.   In South East
Sulawesi no disease has been reported; no high intensity operations have yet been
introduced.
13.   The  strategy  to  address  the  disease  issue  should  include  several

demonstrated vividly in China, Taiwan, Equador and most recently Vietnam. The
impact of disease on shrimp culture worldwide is estimated at several billion
US Dollars per year at present.

components. Foremost would be the improvement in system management discussed
above.   In addition the Government should follow the recommendations of the
'Larkin Report', which studied the issue in detail in early 1994. Particularly
it may: a) strengthen the ability of staff of the Dinas Perikanan to detect and
diagnose diseases, by providing equipment and by strengthening the role of
existing fisheries research facilities with special laboratories to specialize
in disease identification and control; b) expand and intensify the role of the
existing special shrimp disease taskforce in developing and implementing a
nationwide strategy to address the issue3; c) take immediate steps to introduce
quality control and ultimately compulsary health certificates for all fry
delivered from all commercial and public hatcheries, and d) introduce minimum
quality standards for farmers growing fry from PL 15 to PL 25.
14.   The impact of disease is considerable.  Farmers in Aceh appear most able
and willing to intensify farming operations, nevertheless, the average level of
production, considerably affected by disease, still remains relatively modest.
Farmers in S. Sulawesi have also increased production, and, being less affected
by disease, average levels of production appear considerably higher than in Aceh.
In S. E. Sulawesi production levels have increased over those in non-project
areas, but are still relatively modest compared to S. Sulawesi, reflecting more
conservative attitudes of the less experienced farmers, and an acute lack of
shrimp fry following the bancrupcy of the only private hatchery in the province.
The mission received several sets of data concerning past and present shrimp and
milkfish production in the project area; showing considerable inconsistencies.
Similarly, no consistent and complete data are available for the area of
'spontaneous' development adjacent to the project area. The mission requests
that DGF provide the final data on total production, production/ha and total area
(including spontaneous expansion) by January 31, 1995.
Marketing and Shrimnv Prices
15.   The rapid expansion in shrimp culture in Indonesia has led to a substantial
improvement in the supply industry. Shrimp fry production has increased very
rapidly, causing shrimp fry prices (the major cost factor for most farmers) to
decline from Rp. 30 per piece (PL 15) during appraisal to Rp 8-12 per piece at
present, except in S. E. Sulawesi (Rp 20)., Marketing of shrimp and milkfish does
not create many problems, as the shrimp processing industry is well developed and
short of raw material, and local demand for milkfish remains strong. Prices paid
for shrimp (Rp 18,500.-/kg of '35 count' tiger shrimp) are high in comparison to
several years ago, partly reflecting the impact of disease on major shrimp
producing countries in the world. While world prices may decline somewhat if
major producing countries are able to reduce the effect of disease, price levels
are likely to remain above long term averages for some time to come.
Proiect Organization and Co-ordination
3      The mission strongly recommends that strategies being developed in
Equador and China be considered in the Indonesian context. Particularly China is
making substantial efforts, funded in part by external donors, to diagnose the
causes of the disease problem, and develop a nationwide strategy to address it.
5



16.   Project co-ordination at the central level has weakened since the previous
mission. In particular the new organizational set-up at DGWRD, with two regional
directorates involved in the project, combined with newly appointed staff
replacing the original (and knowledgeable) staff, has made it more difficult to
interact with DGF.
17.   At the provincial and field levels, interaction between provincial dinas
and local zone and block managers leaves room for improvement. The mission noted
an improvement in the performance of zone and block managers and their
interaction with the farmers. However, for block managers to perform their tasks
effectively, strengthening of the Water Users Associations (WUAs) is essential.
A stronger and better functioning WUA is a prerequisite for tackling the serious
disease problems.
Coastal Fisheries Development Pilot Component
18.   The Coastal Fisheries Development Pilot project has not been successful.
After a less than satisfactory attempt by an NGO (Yayasan Dian Desa) in several
villages on the North coast of Central Java, also the second pilot in South
Sulawesi has been discontinued as no firm government commitment was made from
local funding after the loan closing date.  (see Aide Memoire of November 1993,
para 19). The only realized benefit of this project component seems to be an
increased awareness of staff at Hasanuddin University (Ujung Pandang) of the
problems associated with tambak development.
Marine Fisheries
Onshore Facilities
19.   The mission visited in Maumere the site of the cold storage facilities
financed under the project, which were destroyed during the earthquake and
Tsunami in 1992. The entire building and waterfront apparently collapsed; the
groundlevel has declined some 2-3 meters and the area is now partly under water.
The mission understands that the insurance claim of the owner (P.T. Bali Raya)
has finally been honoured, and that the company used the money to settle its
outstanding loan with BRI.
Fishing Vessels
20.   Of the 26 boats financed under the project, one has been damaged during the
earthquake.   The others, having been taken over from P.T. Bali Raya by P.T.
Perken on March 31, 1994, (see previous Aide Memoire for details), are currently
producing fish at an average of some 70 tons/year, levels well exceeding those
recorded by P. T. Bali Raya in 1991/92. P.T. Perken has entered into a hire-
purchase agreement with the original fishermen of P.T. Bali Raya, through which
they would acquire vessel ownership after repaying a loan of Rp. 36.6 million
(18% interest) over 4 years. While current production levels are still below the
target 100 ton/year/vessel, arrangements made by P. T. Perken to improve crew
incentives, disposal of the catch, baitfish arrangements, and train fishermen and
crew are clearly paying off. P. T. Perken uses seven collector vessels in the
area to collect the catch and provide ice and fuel, enabling project vessels to
6



move to the best seasonal fishing areas. Tuna prices paid by P.T Perken are
higher than those offered by P.T Bali Raya, reflecting strong international and
local (Java) markets, and strong marketing skills of the company.
21.   While doubts have been expressed in the past about the costs and technical
suitability of these vessels, current performance suggests that, at current
levels of indebtedness, vessel operators are making good money; some have started
construction of new houses. The vessels themselves, heavily powered, fast, but
with a limited baitwell and fish hold capacity, appear well suited to handle the
changing fishing circumstances in the area. For as yet unclear reasons, fishing
areas have moved farther off-shore and away from baitfish areas, necessitating
the vessels to increase navigation time to and from the fishing grounds each day
from three to up to six hours. The fast project boats appear at an advantage
over the larger but much slower traditional wooden pole and line vessels
operating in the area.
IV. OTHER MATTERS
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS
22.   No audit reports are outstanding.  Efforts are being made by the Government
auditor to submit the FY93/94 audit reports by the deadline of December 31, 1994.
DISBURSEMENTS
23.   As of December 15, 1994 an amount of about USD 16.0 million has been
disbursed out of the revised loan amount of USD 20.0 million. The balance in the
main undisbursed loan categories are: a) civil works at about USD 2.0 million;
and b) consultants/training at about USD 1.0 million. The mission informed the
Government that only expenditures incurred before the closing date (December 31,
1994) would be eligible for reimbursement and that all claims should be submitted
to RSI before April 15, 1995.
LOAN COVENANTS
24.   The Borrower is in compliance with all major loan covenants.
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
25.   The mission discussed the new Bank procedures regarding project completion
reporting and Borrower agreed to prepare its own contribution to the ICR by
March 31, 1995.
26.   The first step in the new Bank procedure is the preparation, by Borrower,
of an Operational Plan (Attachment 2). The mission reviewed the plan, including
performance indicators to monitor operations and development impact and is
satisfied with the proposal. Government assured the mission that the proposed
Operational Plan would be implemented fully after the project completion date
(December 31, 1994) and that the financial implications of the plan will be
reflected in the annual budgets, starting with the DIP of FY95/96.

FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(LOAN 2773-IND)
OPERATIONAL PLAN
AFTER PROJECT COMPLETION
(Prepared by DGF)
I. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Verification of Scheme completion
1.    After physical construction has been completed a verification of scheme
completion will be undertaken during FY95/96 to ensure the satisfactory
functioning of the completed irrigation system. The verification will be
undertaken jointly by DGWRD, DGF and the farmers (WUAs) to be served through
Block and Zone Managers (or extension workers) involved in scheme implementation.
The verification process will consist of a technical audit to confirm completion
of civil works and operation of irrigation system as agreed when the scheme was
approved for implementation. It would also verify completion of the preparation
for O&M activities, and the scheme would then be tested to confirm that it can
function as designed.
Future development
2.    In order  to optimalize  tamnbak  intensification  and  to  sustain  it's
development, the farmers require administration, technical back-up and financial
support. In anticipating this requirement, institutional arrangements will be
encouraged through the setting-up of business partnerships between the farmers
and private sector. This will involve the application of NES Scheme, utilization
of KKPA facilities and UPP Scheme (Development Service Unit). The Provincial
Fisheries Office will be reinforced with appropriate staff and will have to
administer the activities of the tambak operations.
3.    The role of Zone and Block Managers has proven successful and effective in
maintaining an essential dialogue between farmers and the Government. Before the
status of Zone and Block Managers can be made permanent under the Dinas Perikanan
structure, during a transition period (one to two years after project completion)
they will remain in place to continue to provide extension services and assist
the farmers in obtaining all production inputs, credit and information required
for improved shrimp farming financed through APBN budget. The Zone and Block
Managers will ultimately be appointed into functional positions (jabatan
fungsional) as specialist/field extension worker to ensure that extension and
other services as specified above will be continued.
4.    The extension services will be undertaken in line with the national
intensification program framework which is regulated under the Joint Decree
between Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Agriculture no. 65/1991 and
no. 539/1991. In this regulation, both DGF and Dinas Perikanan have to continue
their major role in supporting technical back up on fisheries extension to the
fish farmer.



Operation and Maintenance
5.    The O&M for primary and secondary canals will be undertaken by the
Government (DGWRD) and the cost will be shared with the farmers through IPAIR or
ISF.   (current programs  assume farmers would contribute about  50%).   The
preparation for ISF introduction in South Sulawesi is currently being undertaken
under the framework of  ISSP-II  which  commenced  in March  1994.   Although
institutional and procedural arrangement are similar to ISF - paddy, there are
specific arrangements for tambak that require further analysis, such as:
a)    fee assessment in relation to a higher system maintenance and different
service classification; and
b)    approach to sanction due to non-availability of two pond gates (inlet and
outlet).
6.    Considering that ISSP-II does not cover Aceh and Southeast Sulawesi, the
preparation for ISF introduction in those areas is envisaged to be financed under
Government budget. The O&M for tertiary canals will be the responsibility of the
farmers through WUA/P3AT. As reported, currently three P3AT exist, one each in
Aceh, South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi. The formation of other P3ATs will
be pursued in the future.
II. MANAGEMENT ASPECTS
Reduce the incidence of disease
7.    To cope with shrimp disease problems, in 1993, under the INTAM program
(which covers also Aceh, Sulsel and Sultra) the Government has set up a Task
Force for fish/shrimp disease. The Task Force is responsible for monitoring and
developing a strategy to address the issue and a program for undertaking
preventive measures.   The DGF has formulated a Guideline for Prevention and
Curative measure of Disease in Shrimp Culture and disseminated is to the
provincial fisheries office.  In anticipating possible disease outbreaks in the
future, such as in the case of Aceh; there is a necessity to improve
infrastructure  facilities  and  system  management  including:    i)  design,
construction and operations systems; ii) stocking levels in each area adjusted
to the capacities of the irrigation system; and iii) introduction of siltation
ponds in each irrigation system in order to improve the quality of water supply.
In recognition of this problem the government requested advisory technical
assistance from ADB to strengthen its national shrimp health management
capabilities. The main objective of the TA was to develop the national shrimp
health management program aimed at protecting its shrimp culture investment from
the present and future disease and environmental problems threatening the shrimp
culture industry in Indonesia. The study has been completed in July 1994 and
recommended action for immediate, short-term (1 year), medium term (3 years) and
long-term (more than 3 years) action which covers among others establishment of:
i) Shrimp Health Management Office (SHMO) in Brackishwater Aquaculture
Development Center Jepara; ii) Shrimp Disease Diagnostic and Advisory Service
(SDDAS) in Aceh, North Sumatra, Lampung, West Central - East Java and South
Sulawesi; iii) Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) program; iv) Brood Stock Development;
v) Strengthening and Environmental Management; vi) Human Resource Development;



and vii) Upgrading of Extension Service.
8.    With respect to the project areas and following the above study, efforts
will be made to:
a)    develop a training program to teach selected staff at the Block and Zone
level;
b)    provide diagnostic equipment at Zone and Provincial level; and
C)    disseminate  Guidelines  for Prevention of Disease  in Shrimp Culture,
Environmental Management of Shrimp Culture and Environmental Monitoring &
Evaluation of Shrimp Culture (prepared by consultants of the ADB - TA
Shrimp Health Management and Disease Control Study).
9.    As part of its strategy to address future disease problems, the Government
will use the proposed verification of system design to ensure that the system
will operate as designed, including on farm arrangements for gates, the
consistent use of separate intake and outlet canals etc. In addition the
Government would like to use the WUAs to assist in improving the management of
individual  ponds  and  the  water  supply  system,  including  guidelines  for
intensification, a key factor in any strategy to address the disease problems.
10.   To fully utilize the existing capacity in the country for analysis of
diseases and the development of preventive strategies, the government would
encourage closer cooperation between the shrimp research institutes in Maros and
Jepara, and encourage further training of high level disease specialists. In
addition, the Government would obtain external support for ongoing research
activities related to all aspects of diseases in shrimp, possibly under the
proposed ARM II project currently being appraised by the World Bank.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting.
11.   As a part of the INTAM program, M&E activities are being implemented in
accordance to INTAM requirement as follows:
a)    monitoring activities on the farm will continue to be the responsibility
of Block Managers; at sub-District level of Block and Zone Managers; at
the district level of Zone Managers and the Dinas Perikanan Tk. II; at
Provincial level of the Dinas Perikanan, while at national level they are
coordinated by the Directorate of Program;
b)    M&E activities will be conducted through several steps, including sampling
through  field  visits,  data  analysis,   report  compilation,  and  a
coordination meeting at District, Provincial and National level at.least
once a year;                                                               I
c)    evaluation of the INTAM program would be conducted at the completion of
every crop and every year in order to provide data on realization of
production targets, the effects of the application of the introduction of
improved technology, analysis of trends in production and productivity of
tambaks and constraints in input supply, credit and infrastructure
performance;



d)    M&E activities would be conducted by using M&E forms as well as reporting
forms issued by DGF.
Production input demand and marketing
12.   DGF has formulated an annual projection plan for production input demands
in order to facilitate sustainable tambak intensification.   The plan covers:
type and amount of inputs, producer/distributor and the distribution mechanism.
The implementation will be regulated by Governor's Decree.
13.   Production quality control is being carried out, since production process
up to post harvest stage is based on DGF guidances. For those who engage with
Nucleus Estate company, marketing is conducted by the company while for those who
are not engaged with a Nucleus Estate company, products can be marketed through
KUD.
14.   The Government will take steps to define quality control measures at the
nation's hatcheries both public and private. Improving the operational standards
of hatchery production will be the first objective of longer term program to
develop the ability in Indonesia to produce and deliver certified disease free
shrimp fry.
Marine Fisheries
15.   In the Marine Fisheries Component of the project the Government will
support continuation of the current arrangements between the vessels financed
under the project and the private sector.

FISHERIES SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
(Loan 2773-IND)
BORROWER CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
1.        Project Objectives
1.1.      The main objective of the project was to increase fish
production and export of fish and fishery products by supporting
private investments in the fisheries sub-sector, while reducing
subsidies on fishery credit. Such objective was  to be achieved
by: i) improving water supply and productivity of brackishwater
ponds  (tambaks),  ii)  strengthening  technical    and  managerial
capacities of field staff and tambak farmers, iii) strengthening
support services to coastal aquaculture, iv) encouraging private
investment in- and strengthening of- marketing support services
for marine fisheries, and v) restructuring of state-owned fishe-
ries enterprises (viz. Loan Agreement No. 2773-IND, Schedule 2).
1.2.      The project objectives were highly challenging as well
as very demanding not only on the Directorate General of
Fisheries (DGF) who had overall reponsibility for project imple-
mentation and coordination, but also on the Directorate General
of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), the Bank Rakyat Indonesia
(BRI), the Ministry of Population and the Environment  (MPE) and
the Provincial Governments. In addition, the project also si-
multaneously introduced important policy initiatives which repre-
sented significant departures from- and improvements over- past
policies and practicies in fisheries sub-sector administration
including: i) enhancing the role of private sectors, ii) reduc-
tion of subsidies for fisheries credit, iii) involving private
processors in channelling fisheries credit, and iv) poverty
alleviation (viz. SAR No. 6290-IND, para 2.24).
1.3.      Furthermore,  there was inadequacy in the  preparation
of the coastal aquaculture component as it was formulated insuf-
ficiently thorough and much later after the preparation of the
initial proposals (in November/December 1984) which were oriented
towards large investments in state fisheries companies and marine
fisheries.     The     preparation      stage  and  its  follow-up
Mission/consultants not adequately covered soils, topography,
hydrology,  land  tenure  and  socio-economical  aspect  of   the



proposed areas. At appraisal stage (February/March 1986), coastal
aquaculture component in fact was taken as the major activi-
ties under the project. All these brought about difficulties in
the implementation of the project and risks in the achievement of
the proje,ct objectives. This was among others shown in  BRI's
hesitation to lend credit to tambak farmers and delay in reha-
bilitation/construction of canals cum land acquisition. The
project might have instead included more marine fisheries.
2.        Achievement of Project Objectives
2.1.      The project significantly achieved  most of its objec-
tives. The project favourably supported increase in production
and export of shrimp and skipjack. With regard to coastal aqua-
culture component, the project substantially improved water
supply through the rehabilitation of primary, secondary and
tertiary canals  serving   the entire  revised project  area of
nearly 12,000 ha and laid a strong basis for the improvement of
tambak productivity: improved water supply, fielding of suffi-
ciently trained field staff (90 Block Managers and 9 Zone
Managers) equipping them with necessary field equipments, better
extension and field supervision, and formation of shrimp farmer's
groups. The credit portion was however not realized and this
jeopardized tambaks intensification programme.
2.2.      The project  also extended credit to fishermen for the
provision of 26  fibreglass boats (initial  provision  was  for
wooden boats) and did support investment in marketing/processing
facilities  (cold storage,  ice maker and brine freezers) by PT.
Bali Raya (PTBR), a private company jointly approved by BRI, DGF
and the World Bank. Initially this nucleus estate and small-
holders (NES) concept run project activity demonstrated good
performance. The take-over of the activity by PT. PERKEN (PTP) in
1994 and good performance so far promises prospects for sus-
tainability.
2.3.      The  project  clearly  demonstrated  policy  and  strong
efforts to alleviate poverty -among the low income and poor
fishermen/fishfarmers,  the project beneficiaries.  The   project
also mitigated coastal degradation by supporting coastal aquacul-
ture intensification rather than clearing mangrove.
3.        Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the
Project
3.1.      The  Loan Agreement  was  signed  on  6 February  1987,
negotiated on 3 - 7 November 1986, became effective in May 1987
and closed as scheduled on 31 December 1994. During its first two
years of implementation, the project performed  highly satisfac-
tory and disbursements-were on target or even ahead of appraisal
2



estimates. There are however three sets of factors   that   af-
fected implementation performance thereafter. First, those not
generally subject to government control including: i) over-inten-
sification of tambak operation combined with inadequate water
supply aind exchange  causing deterioration of or-farm aquatic
environment which was primarily responsible for high incidence of
shrimp diseases particularly in Aceh, ii) shortage of shrimp
fries affecting production in particular in South East Sulawesi,
and iii) the earthquake (tsunami waves) that hit Flores island
(where Maumere is located in) in December 1992 and which de-
stroyed all the on-shore facilities financed out of the project
loan.
3.2.      Second,   factors   subject   to   government   control
including: i) failure of the provision of credit for tambak
intensification, ii) land acquisition problems causing delays in
the rehabilitation/construction of canals in Aceh and South
Sulawesi and subsequently affected the performance of the coastal
aquaculture component (which is in fact the major part of the
project) and the overall project implementation, iii) excess cold
storage capacity in Maumere due to the issuance of license
to other companies, after project investment,   for construction
of new ones, and iv) insufficient coordination among implementing
agencies.
3.3.      Third,  factors subject to implementing agencies'  con-
trol including:  i) indeaquate   monitoring of quality of civil
works, ii) design flaws affecting water exchange and circulation
which was partly responsible for high incidence of shrimp
disease, iii) responsibility gap between the Provincial Fisheries
Service (PFS)/Provincial Project Development Office (PPDO)   and
the District Fisheries Service (DFS) especially in relation to
supervision of Zone and Block Managers, iv) selection of rela-
tively expensive fibreglass fishing boats, and v) closed manage-
ment/intransparancy of the nucleus company in assisting the
participating fishermen to operate the fishing boats. Some of the
above factors are self explanatory and those remaining are dis-
cussed in greater detail below.
3.4.      BRI was responsible for the provision of credit pro-
vided under the project for the intensification of coastal aqua-
culture component which included financing of production inputs
(mainly shrimp PL, feed, and pumps as necessary) and tertiary
canal. However, due to poor repayment records on previous loans,
BRI declined its interest in 1991 to extend this credit to-shrimp
farmers. In fact, this reason  was for long time well known to
BRI, and therefore it might have instead formulated the coastal
aquaculture component and agreed something different during
appraisal/loan negotiations.
3.5.      In particular in  relation to  tertiary  canal develop-
3



ment, the Government then requested the Bank   and the Mid-term
Review Mission in November 1991  agreed in principle to finance
this component from the loan, provided that GOI could give evi-
dence that shrimp farmers were too poor to develop these canals
from thei:r own cost. GOI provided full reasons not only on
average  income of the farmers   ground but also on the fact that
some farmers were affected by the interrupted operation of their
ponds while construction of primary/secondary canals underway,
and on the need to cross-compensate part of the tambaks surren-
dered to the project without any compensation. It took very time
consuming discussions between GOI and the Bank which in the end
(in 1993), the Bank rejected loan financing and GOI decided to
finance tertiary canals from its own funds. Otherwise, the in-
vestment on main canals would have been wasted and jeopardized
the intensification programme intended. This has caused delays in
project implementation, nevertheless GOI (DGF and PFS) then
speeded up construction of tertiary canals achieving nearly 1006
progress by the end of GOI's FY 1994/95.
3.6.      At  the  early  stage  of  project  implementation,  all
shrimp farmers in the project areas signed agreements declaring
that they would not ask for compensation and would donate their
land if the project found it necessary for construction  of the
primary/secondary canals. Land acquisition problems arose after
the first year of implementation in Aceh and later in South
Sulawesi when some farmers changed their mind during construc-
tion. Regardless of steady hard work of the Provincial and Dis-
trict authorities in particular, this caused not only consider-
able delays in the rehabilitation of primary/secondary canals and
subsequently in the overall project implementation and even
resulted in cancellation of two contracts for about 450 ha. Both
facts in para 3.5. and 3.6. confirmed the real need for adequate
sociological and socio-economical study when involving small-
holders as beneficiaries (viz. paras 4.7. and 6.13., Preparation
Report, 25 February 1985).
3.7.      BRI extended credit to PTBR for construction of cold
storage (500 mt) , brine freezer (40 mt) , ice plant (10 mt) and
workshop. Operation of the fish-ing boats under the NES approach
as well as the  utilization of the on-shore facilities were of
satisfactory performance untill the Provincial Government of East
Nusa Tenggara (PFS) issued licenses to local companies in 1989/90
for establishment of other cold storages creating excess cold
storage capacity (about three times larger than the available
production) and competition among local fishermen. This greatly
affected the operation of the NES approach where some partici-
pating fishermen illegally sold their catch to other private cold
storages in Maumere. The situation was even worse after March
1992 when PTBR due to lack of working capital, stopped its opera-
tion. In this case, condusive policy environment in which the
project is implemented, plays a pivotal role to achieve its
objectives.
4



3.8.      As stated in para 1.2., coordination  among  the imple-
menting agencies was one of the key words to project success. The
Project Coordination Committee (PCC) at the central level,
chaired by the Director General of Fisheries, was set up in 1987
by the Decree of the Minister of Agriculture. The Committee
regularly met   and did review project progress and plans in
quarterly review meeting till 1990/91. Considering the stage of
project implementation, magnitude and nature of the problems in
the fields,   with full support from the Project Liaison Office
(PLO), monthly meeting at the working staff level combined with
more  intensive  site supervision with the   provincial  project
staff (DGF/PFS and DGWRD/ Provincial Swamp Development Project)
where instead established thereafter.
3.9.      Results of the working staff meeting then were reported
to concerned Directors, and finally to the respective Director
General. Both Director Generals, DGF and DGWRD (Director of
Swamps), were therefore well informed of the progress and
problems, and provided directives for solution. Such implementa-
tion progress and problems as well as recommendations alternative
were also submitted to a   less frequent meeting of PCC.  The
tertiary canal development for instance, was decided in this way.
PCC decided, while discussion was underway with the Bank, to
start tertiary canal development in FY 1990/91 right after BRI
declined its willingness. The process shows relatively time
consuming and longer road to reach decision. In addition, annual
project budgeting and planning was rarely reviewed in PCC
meeting. Two important lessons were: i) project coordination
would be more effective at the lower/working staff level (as
supposed by the PCC); this was demonstrated at the Provincial and
at the District level in particular, and ii) lack of incentive
made it difficult to establish smooth coordination.
3.10.     Although DGWRD fully completed detailed design of the
entire tambaks area during FY 1987/88 - 1991/92 followed by
gradual constructional works, unsatisfactory quality of civil
works   was observed in the early project years.  Insufficient
compaction of embankments along canals and the presence of or-
ganic materials were noticed several times during site super-
vision  (joint  DGF/PFS  and  DGWRD/Provincial  Water  Resources
Service - PWRS team) and the Bank Supervision Missions (viz.
Bank's Mission Aide Memoire/BMAM, May/June 1989) . With strong
Bank support, significant improvement in construction quality was
brought in later years. In addition, several serious design flaws
were also found (viz. BMAM, November 1991) that partly con-
tributed to high incidence of shrimp disease. Based on Bank
Mission's suggested actions for follow up, DGWRD properly imple-
mented the remedial works. The scaling down of the project area
from the SAR estimate of 18,000 to about 12,000 ha was primarily
due to the emphasis on remedial works in addition to land acqui-
sition problem.
5



averaqe  income
3.11.     Despite efficient coordination at the provincial level
and in particular the distridt level, there was lack of clarity
in the division of responsibility between the PFS/PPDO and the
DFS especially in relation to supervision of Zone and Block
Managers.-In addition, inadequate provision of local budget for
DFS made them less mobile. Strengthened support by DFS for Block
Managers to work closer and effectively with shrimp farmers and
their groups (Water User Association/WUA) would be the key to
sustainable tambaks intensification.   The lesson was that suffi-
cient resources at the district level are needed to support
implementation success.
3.12.     One of the major weaknesses in the operation of NES
approach in Maumere was intransparancy of PTBR (Maumere Branch)
in the early project years. It was difficult to obtain among
others catch data, operating costs of boats, repayment record of
credit per participating fisherman. At the same time, during
project review meeting, BRI provided only cumulative figures for
26 boats. Not untill the Bank's Mid-term Review Mission in Novem-
ber 1991, easier access to field data of boats was possible. The
situation was worse in the operation of the NES due to: i) lack
of live-bait available in  Maumere and adjacent areas, and ii)
PTBR lacked working capital in 1992 and was unable to favourably
support the fishermen. DGF through the UNDP/FAO and GOI resources
provided support for exploratory fishing (bait-fish survey,
fishing gears trial, and stock survey).
3.13.     One of the main thrusts of the project was the intro-
duction of the NES concept in the fisheries sub-sector. Consider-
ing development constraints in the beginning of the 1980s: seri-
ous budget constraints, low income and poor fishfarmers/fisher-
men, vast resources of coastal aquaculture and marine fisheries
and potential private sectors (shrimp/fish marketing and pro-
cessing companies) in addition to growing markets for shrimp and
tuna/ skipjack, the project was therefore formulated and directed
to increase production and export of shrimp and skipjack, raise
incomes of fishfarmers/fishermen by expanding job opportunities,
encourage private sector's partic-ipation in fisheries, mobilize
resources available locally, and reduce burden of government
budget. The NES concept was considered as appropriate and  cap-
able to institutionalize a number of policy initiatives brought
in by the project. The concept itself was very good but its
introduction and operationalization has encountered a lot of
problems. More thoughts on the NES are required for its future
development.
3.14.     In terms of incentive, the project was very  efficient.
Unfortunately, there was no extra-incentive for project staff as
well as for those involved in the implementation coordination.
All the project staff had "double jobsf: in their existing agency
and with the project without any extra allowance provided.
Another kind of incentive, training for instance, as in the case
6



of overseas training proposal, was not approved by the Bank. In
addition, there was no technical assistance for capacity building
to back up the project organization and the implementation coor-
dination. Those highly motivated, young and energetic men/women
with direct supervision and directives of their D;rector General
(and Directors) did the job, and they did it.
4.        Achievement of Project Output
4.1.      Coastal Aauaculture. By the end of GOI's FY 1994/95,
the project successfully completed rehabilitation/construction of
about 871 km canals, including primary (129 km), secondary (315
km) and tertiary (427 km) canals serving the total tambaks area
of about 12,000 ha (SAR estimate: 110 km of primary and 185 km of
secondary canals) . Training for field staff: 90 Block Managers
(450 m/m) and 9 Zone Managers (45 m/m), training for the project
shrimp farmers, 99 packages of field water/soil quality equip-
ments,  and 78 motorcycles  (for Block Managers),   7 mini buses
(for PFS/PPDO) and 6 of 4x2 vehicles (for Zone Managers) were
provided. DGWRD also: i) provided equipments and training for
field water resources staff (juru and pengamat air) and ii)
carried out study for the identification of potential areas for
tambaks development.  Technical assistance to strengthen shrimp
hatchery management capacities  as well as to study shrimp post
larvae marketing and distribution was done. In addition, the
Brackishwater Aquaculture Development Center, Jepara, who pro-
vides technical/technological support for tambaks development,
was equipped with shrimp disease laboratory equipments using part
of the loan. Rural Extension Centers (RECs) were also established
in the three Provinces funded under the Third National Agricul-
tural Extension Project (Loan No. 2748-IND, viz. Agreed Minutes
of Negotiations, 7 November 1986).
4.2.      Marine Fisheries. Under the project,  cold storage (500
mt), brine freezer (40 mt), ice plant (10 mt) and workshop were
constructed. Credit was extended for the provision of 26 fibre-
glass fishing boats of 15 GT each.   To support the NES opera-
tions, DGF through its Fishing Technique Development Centre,
Semarang, using the UNDP/FAO (INS/86/021) and GOI resources pro-
vided support for fishing technique development (exploratory
fishing, bait-fish survey, trial of fishing gears, stock survey)
and for training of participating fishermen (35 m/m). The project
also equipped the Centre with fishing gear laboratory equipments.
4.3.      Coastal Zone Pilot Component. A small pilot component
intended to ensure environmentally sound coastal aquaculture
development, involving the poorest coastal fishermen in several
villages on the north coast of Central Java, was implemented
under the contract between the Ministry of Population and the
Environment (MPE) with Yayasan Dian Desa, a non-government or-
ganization based in Yogyakarta. Except for the hatchery part, the
7



results were considered unsatisfactory. In addition, the proposed
second pilot experiment in South Sulawesi has been discontinued
as no firm GOI's commitment was made to finance after the loan
closing date (viz. BMAM, November, 1993 and December, 1994).
4.4.      Restructuring of Public Fisheries Enterprises. Budget
provision for assisting GOI in valuation of assets of public
enterprises in fisheries and preparation of proposals for leasing
facilities and forming joint ventures with private sector was not
utilized. The Government (the Ministry of Finance) instead under-
took overall study and assessment of the viability of all public
enterprises and together with the Ministry of Agriculture sup-
ported joint operations with private companies. In 1989 for
instance, PT. Perikanan Samudera Besar based in Bali established
joint operation with PT. Bali Raya.
4.5.      Strengthening  Planning  and  Manpower  Development.  As
provided for in the SAR, technical assistance to strengthen
planning capacities of DGF, to prepare REPELITA V of fisheries
and a fisheries sector plan and to prepare proposals for manpower
development was not realized. GOI instead, using Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) resources (TA No. 847-INO) carried out Fisheries
Economy Study for the preparation of plans for REPELITA V (1989-
94) and a fisheries sector plan. The project also financed prepa-
ration study for Second Fisheries Support Services Project.
Although provision for training was provided, no training for DGF
staff was made as the Bank viewed that the budget was not intend-
ed for this activity.
5.        Project Sustainability
5.1.      Project sustainability is seen in the context of: i)
smooth transfer of project to normal administration primarily
from the central level to provincial authorities, ii) realistic
and clarity of operational plan beyond the project closing date,
iii) GOI commitment and the level of resources provided to sus-
tain  project operation and maintenance (O & M) , and iv) effec-
tiveness of field staff to perform their tasks especially to work
with  farmers'  groups.  Since April  1995,  transfer  of  project
activities from project status to DGF/DGWRD has been gradually
initiated. Inventory of project assets has started. Verification
of all physical assets in the Provincies will be carried out in
May - July 1995 in cooperation with PFS/PWRS and other concerned
agencies. Based on this step, transfer of project to provincial
authorities would be finalized. The role of provincial and dis-
trict authorities (in particular PFS, PWRS, DFS and BAPPEDA) is
paramount to project sustainability.
5.2.      Operational Plan after project completion was agreed by
GOI and the Bank (viz. BMAM, December 1994) . Sustainability of
the project activities and benefits, and the coastal aquaculture
8



component in particular would  largely depend on GOI commitment
to implement the above Operational Plan. DGF/PFS's budget for FY
1995/96 indicates relatively sufficient resources. Budget for the
supply of  field equipments  is partly provided  (40 packages).
Learning -from the experience of disease outbreak in Aceh, such
equipments for Block and Zone Managers   are essential.  In this
context, DGF efforts to strengthen its national shrimp health
management capabilities should be realized. Based on successful
introduction of Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) pilot project in
South Sulawesi, the collection coverage will be gradually ex-
panded to all improved tambaks schemes in the area and similar
study on ISF for Aceh and South East Sulawesi will be carried
out. Credit (through local banks) for farmers in the area also
needs to be mobilized. In addition, i) budget provision for 0 &
M of primary/secondary canals under DGWRD/PWRS, and ii) further
formation and strengthening of shrimp farmers's groups/WUAs by
the provincial/district authorities would strongly sustain im-
provement in water supply and circulation in- and outside tam-
baks. The last matter is the finalization of the future status of
Zone and Block Managers within the normal administration of the
Ministry of Agriculture. The proposal is to include all of the
field staff under the Integrated Rural Agriculture Programme by
FY 1996/97.
5.3.      The marine fisheries component in Flores is likely to
sustain.  PTP  has  demostrated  its  strong  fishing  operational
management and marketing skills and has made significant improve-
ment of the NES operations since the take-over in March 1994
(viz. BMAM, December 1994). That the project has increased skip-
jack production and export are obvious. What uncertain is whether
one day within the life-time of the boat, the participating
fishermen be able to own the boat. In this connection, the PFS of
East Nusa Tenggara should closer monitor and provide support as
necessary.
6.        Bank Performance
6.1.      On  average, Bank performance has been satisfactory. As
stated in paras 1.2. and 1.3., Bank performance was deficient in
project preparation/formulation and appraisal. Most of the design
for physical rehabilitation had to be carried out during project
implementation and sociological/socio-economical aspects were not
adequately covered. Although the project felt that the Bank was
very rigid as experienced  by protracted discussions especially
on financing of tertiary canal development and overseas training,
during implementation, the Bank provided positive and strong
support. Despite insufficiency in staff inputs, supervision has
been generally satisfactory. There have been tough times both
experienced by the Bank staff and GOI which conditioned improve-
ments in implementation of the project.
9



7.        Borrower Performance
7.1.      The Borrower (DGF) was keen to introduce the NES con-
cept both in the coastal aquaculture and marine fisheries compo-
nents. The NES approach, introduction of a number of important
policy initiatives in fisheries  (para -1.2.)   and GOI's budget
constraint during the appraisal/negotiations stage and in the
1980s demanded extra hard-work for the project to be properly
implemented. Span of control for DGF's implementation coordina-
tion - DGWRD, Provincial Governments, BRI, MPE and DGF - was not
strong enough. Although the project organization was deficient
(in fact, heavy was on the PLO as supposed by the Project De-
velopment Office as provided for in the SAR), financial incentive
for project staff was insufficient, full-time staff appointed to
facilitate implementation of daily activities was not available,
and capacity building (including provision for consultants) for
project staff was not provided, nevertheless, all project staff
both at the central (including Project Liaison Office) and pro-
vincial/district levels have demonstrated full commitment, seri-
ousness, transparancy, and hard-work. The project staff have
gained a lot, not in terms of any form of incentive but develop-
ment experience.  Satisfactory outcome   of the project was the
result of cooperation among the implementing agencies.
8.        Other Matters
8.1.      Audit and Accounts. No audit reports are outstanding.
Efforts are being made to prepare the FY 1994/95 audit reports.
8.2.      Loan Covenants. The Borrower is in compliance with all
major loan covenants.
9.        Lessons Learned
9.1.      Some lessons that  can  be learned  include: i) a well
prepared/formulated project is one of the keys to project success
taking into account all key technical, technological, institu-
tional, managerial, and policy related issues; ii) when project
involves smallholders as beneficiaries, adequate sociological/
socio-economical study is required; iii) a condusive broader
policy environment as experienced by the NES operations in Flores
is needed to favourably implement a project; iv) to support
tambaks intensification programme, national land titling program-
me is needed for provision of land title and thereby would ease
credit delivery ; and v) reasonable incentive for project staff
and for effective coordination among implementing agencies is an
important factor for smooth implementation of a project.
