hopes to\n            achieve greater private investment in the export oriented\n            segments of the fisheries sector, as well as increased\n            productivity and efficiency in investments and poverty\n            alleviation through further development of this sector.  The\n            Fisheries Support Services Project to be implemented over a\n            seven year period includes (i) the rehabilitation of 295 km\n            of primary and secondary brackish water canals serving\n            18,000 ha of shrimp ponds in South Sulawesi, Aceh, and\n            Southeast Sulawesi; (ii) provision of credit and technical\n            support for shrimp farm development, for the establishment\n            of fry rearing and distribution facilities run by fishermen;\n            and (iii) provision of credit for expanding private cold\n            storage facilities for marine fisheries in East Nusa\n            Tenggara and for purchase of 26 pole and line vessels.  The\n            project further provides technical support for adaptive\n            research, manpower development, planning and project\n            preparation in the Directorate General of Fisheries; (v)\n            support for restructuring state fisheries enterprises; and\n            (vi) development of a small pilot component to promote\n            environmentally-sound coastal aquaculture development\n            involving the poorest coastal fishermen."}, "docdt": "1986-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
