The extension is necessary to allow\n            sufficient time for the delivery of the large medical\n            equipment mentioned above. In November 2011 the Bank team\n            carried out an implementation support mission of the Project\n            and reached agreement with the Ministry of Health on the\n            action plan for the implementation of the remaining project\n            activities. This short extension will also ensure a\n            successful completion of all project activities, including\n            installation and testing of the purchased medical equipment.\n            In addition, the extension of the Grant will ensure\n            completion of the only remaining Technical Assistance (TA)\n            activity, which supports the Health Insurance Institute in\n            developing the secondary legislation for the Health\n            Financing Law."}, "docdt": "2012-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
