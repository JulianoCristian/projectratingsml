"Ratings for the Health System\n            Modernization Project for Albania were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Program was able to\n            achieve success because reforms spanned key areas of the\n            health care system starting with the stewardship functions\n            of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in health policy development\n            and the Health Insurance Institute (HII) in health financing\n            and provider payment reforms. The capacity of the Government\n            to absorb technical assistance and implement complex\n            institutional changes should be carefully evaluated to\n            ensure knowledge transfer and a sustainable impact of the\n            activities started under the Project. Close coordination and\n            collaboration with United States Agency for International\n            Development (USAID), World Health Organization (WHO), and\n            Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) in supporting\n            implementation aspects of the program helped keep key\n            activities on track and ensured complementarities of\n            interventions. Since both the PIU and the Bank have no\n            built-in capacity for the review of technical specifications\n            and bid evaluation reports of medical equipment, the launch\n            of procurement for medical equipment should allow more time\n            in the procurement plan for the review of bidding documents\n            and bid evaluation reports. Moreover, the bid validity\n            period should also be for a longer period to avoid extension\n            of bid validity period. The development and integration of\n            health information systems in the health sector is complex.\n            If a sector needs intervention in the implementation of a\n            new information system, it is important that there is a\n            specific team working on it right from the beginning of the\n            Project, and adequate time, resources, and attention should\n            be given on a priority basis. It will be important for the\n            Bank to find a way to keep supporting the follow-up actions\n            of the reforms introduced under the Project. Without a\n            follow-on project, the Bank will not have leverage with the\n            government regarding the reforms introduced."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
