                         The development objectives of this project are (i) to improve the capacity of the MOH and HII to effectively formulate and implement health policies and reforms
                         in provider payments, monitoring and quality assurance, (ii) to improve both the access to, and quality of, primary health care services, with an emphasis on
                         those in poor and under-serviced areas, and (iii) to improve governance and management in the hospital sector.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Health System Modernization Project (HSMP) has shown good progress, especially after the project restructuring, which included reallocation of funds (October, 2011). While
                         most project activities are completed, there are still few key activities under implementation, such as: (i) purchasing of medical equipment for the cardiology and pediatric departments
                         in Tirana hospital, (ii) technical assistance (TA) for the rationalization plan for hospitals, and (iii) TA for extending training of primary health care staff to three more regions in the
                         country (Tirana, Durres and Elbasan). Despite the overall good progress, strong commitment is needed from the MoH side to ensure successful completion of all project activities.
