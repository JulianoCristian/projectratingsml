                         The development objectives of this project are (i) to improve the capacity of the MOH and HII to effectively formulate and implement health policies and reforms in
                         provider payments, monitoring and quality assurance, (ii) to improve both the access to, and quality of, primary health care services, with an emphasis on those in poor
                         and under-serviced areas, and (iii) to improve governance and management in the hospital sector.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Most project activities have been successfully implemented, with the remaining expected to be completed within project closing date (June 30, 2012). The PDOs are successfully
                         achieved. The four outcome indicators and most intermediate indicators are met successfully.

                         The original project has twice undergone level II restructuring. Following the project restructuring, good progress has been noted in implementation of all activities. Initially the project

                         other main project activities, including: (i) purchasing of the IT system for the Health Insurance Institute, and (ii) production of health cards for the entire population. Key reasons for
                         these delays were the lack of Health Insurance Institute decision on key directions to develop the IT system for the whole health insurance, as well as change in Government decision
                         on financing the health cards for the entire population, from its own budget (as part of the ID cards). In order to overcome the delays and better align with Government priorities in

                         reforming the sector, agreement was reached on revising certain project activities. The first project restructuring was completed in May 2010, and comprised: (a) the revision of a
                         number of project activities (including: cancellation of "quality improvement grants", revision of "medical equipment for regional hospitals" and adding the TA support for "privatization
                         of non-medical activities" in the regional hospitals) as well as the results framework; and (ii) an 18 - month extension of the original closing date from September 30, 2011 to March
                         31, 2012. The second restructuring was approved in October 2011, and comprised: (i) the revision of few project activities (including: further strengthening of regional hospital
                         capacities, as well as testing the national rationalization plan in two pilot regions), and cancellation of certain project activities (including: cancellation of the software for the Health
                         Insurance Institute IT system - agreed to be purchased by other donors, and "provision of the unit costs", which has been taken over by the Government under its own budget). A
                         second extension was granted in February 2012, until June 30, 2012, to ensure successful completion of two big procurement packages on medical equipment (amounting US$ 3,2
                         Million). Currently, all activities are implemented, while the medical equipment under the two packages, are being successfully delivered.
