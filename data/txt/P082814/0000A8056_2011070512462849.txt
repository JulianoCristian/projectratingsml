                         The development objectives of this project are (i) to improve the capacity of the MOH and HII to effectively formulate and implement health policies and reforms
                         in provider payments, monitoring and quality assurance, (ii) to improve both the access to, and quality of, primary health care services, with an emphasis on
                         those in poor and under-serviced areas, and (iii) to improve governance and management in the hospital sector.

                         project completion: (i) the information technology (IT) system for the Health Insurance Institute, and (ii) finalization of the evaluation process for purchasing medical equipment for
