through the\n            addition of new gas-fired generating capacity; 2) strengthen\n            the high voltage (HV) transformation capacity in Viet Nam;\n            3) assist the government in the introduction of private\n            power in the country; 4) strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) through technical\n            assistance and training; and 5) assist in the formulation of\n            a national strategy and master plan for rural\n            electrification. The project will finance the following\n            components: 1) installation of 2x150 megawatt (MW) gas\n            turbines for the first 450 MW Combined Cycle (CC) power\n            block of the Phu My power station; 2) addition of about 900\n            megavolt-amperes (MVA) of such capacity in other parts of\n            the country; 3) resettlement and compensation of persons\n            affected by the Phu My plant; and 4) consulting services\n            for: (a) project design and supervision for Phu My; (b)\n            development of a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) type of\n            arrangement for the second CC power block of Phu My on the\n            basis of competitive bidding; (c) technical assistance and\n            training for EVN managerial staff; (d) master plan for rural\n            electrification; and (e) technical studies for the Dai Ninh\n            hydropower project."}, "docdt": "1996-01-02T00:00:00Z"}
