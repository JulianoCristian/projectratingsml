In\n            2002, half of Vietnam's electric capacity was coming\n            from hydropower plants, which is unreliable during times of\n            drought. The government decided to promote private sector\n            participation as part of its strategy to address the need\n            for increased power generation capacity. The Phu My complex\n            consists of five gas-fired electricity generation plants,\n            70km southeast of Ho Chi Minh City which in time will\n            produce up to 4,700 gigawatt hours of power per year.\n            Following extensive efforts on energy reform in Vietnam\n            through numerous projects aimed at delivering affordable\n            energy to rural areas, as well as upgrading existing\n            capacity to meet the growing demands of urban areas, IDA\n            helped finance the first phase of the Phu My 2 (PM2) power\n            project. Another part of the World Bank Group, the\n            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provided\n            risk guarantees to Singaporean and French investors. As one\n            of the country's first power Build-Operate-Transfer\n            project, PM3 is creating a roadmap for others on the\n            responsibilities and sequencing of plant transfer to locals.\n            The project is also a good model for public-private partnership."}, "docdt": "2007-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
