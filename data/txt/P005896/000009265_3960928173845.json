The water\n            supply components are: (a) to drill and equip a new\n            borefield near Tarim; (b) to construct water storage\n            reservoirs and a distribution system in Tarim and adjacent\n            villages; (c) to provide water meters, tools, and\n            operational equipment; and (d) to provide technical\n            assistance for construction supervision, the establishment\n            of management information and inventory control system, and\n            to devise a manpower development program and training.  The\n            sewerage sector components are: (a) a pilot wastewater\n            demonstration project; (b) a financing and cost recovery\n            study of the sewerage sector; (c) to update sewerage\n            designs; and (d) training.
