Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) principally,\n            the strength and competence of the project implementation\n            unit Emergency Reconstruction Unit (ERU), coupled with\n            continued Government support were able to surmount difficult\n            conditions; (ii) adequate front-end arrangements and\n            preparation, including a thorough damage, assessment and\n            robust institutional arrangements, ensured that project\n            objective were very relevant to the government needs;(iii)\n            clarity and simplicity of project design assured that all\n            parties involved had a crystal-clear understanding of\n            objectives and selection criteria; (iv) flexibility and\n            responsiveness of  International Development Association\n            (IDA) to Borrower needs during project implementation\n            maintained a high level of goodwill between the two sides."}, "docdt": "1995-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
