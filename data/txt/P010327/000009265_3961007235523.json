Sector\n            Adjustment Loan for Pakistan was satisfactory. The project\n            achieved most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was substantial, sustainability is likely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, where stabilization is a precondition for\n            other policy reforms, treat it as such, rather than as a\n            parallel and independent target. Second, the Bank and\n            Borrower should focus on a few key conditions, clarifying\n            any sequencing issues and their interrelationships. Third,\n            where major reforms are contemplated, break them into phases\n            with the expectation of a follow-up program and loan to\n            follow should the first phase be implemented successfully.\n            Fourth, the Bank and Government should carefully assess the\n            capacity of the agencies to implement new activities. Fifth,\n            the audience for discussing reforms through seminars, study\n            tours, and written information should be broadened. Sixth,\n            clearly monitorable targets and conditions should be defined\n            to reduce debate during implementation about the meaning of\n            targets and conditions. Seventh, when there are no\n            overriding sequencing issues, have upfront action on the\n            most important conditions. Finally, conditionalities should\n            be defined in a manner that targets the real variables under\n            the program rather than intermediate variables."}, "docdt": "1995-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
