the first of a series of three PALs\n            designed to support the Government's reform program\n            over the period to 2007. The PAL program reflects the\n            Government's overarching objectives of establishing\n            solid economic growth, reducing poverty and joining the\n            European Union. These objectives will be addressed by\n            focusing on five key, cross-cutting themes: establishing\n            public sector accountability; instilling financial\n            discipline; instituting regulatory reforms; following good\n            social and environment risk management practices; and\n            ensuring property rights. In addition, the PAL provides\n            continuity with previous adjustment operations b y ensuring\n            sustained progress on the structural reforms begun under\n            Private Sector Adjustment Loans 1 and 2, while at the same\n            time introducing a new program of phased public sector and\n            regulatory reforms that emphasizes institutional development\n            and effective implementation. The program is divided into\n            two parts. The first part focuses on reforming core public\n            sector institutions and processes. The second targets the\n            public- private interface and regulation of markets."}, "docdt": "2004-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
