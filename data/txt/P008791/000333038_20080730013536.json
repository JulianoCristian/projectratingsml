outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the strong\n            leadership by the Prime Minister's Chancellery was\n            crucial for the success of the PAL1, but with hindsight more\n            attention can have also been paid to strengthening capacity\n            in the other parts of the Government. Such stronger\n            capacity, and a revamped public administration, can have\n            helped sustain the momentum on reforms even after the\n            strategic goal of European Union (EU) accession was met and\n            after the new government came to power. As with other\n            middle-income countries with access to capital markets or EU\n            resources, being flexible is important. This lesson will be\n            of particular importance for the World Bank's\n            engagement with the countries of the western Balkans. For\n            these countries, as prospects of EU accession firm, EU funds\n            will increase and private foreign capital strengthen,\n            building on rising investor confidence."}, "docdt": "2008-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
