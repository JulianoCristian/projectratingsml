        Objectivesand  PAL 1 is the first o f a series o f three PALs designed to support the
        Description:   Government's reform program over the period to 2007. The PAL program
                       reflects the Government's overarching objectives o f establishing solid
                       economic growth, reducing poverty andjoining the European Union. These
                       objectives will be addressed by focusing on five key, cross-cutting themes:
                       establishing public sector accountability; instilling financial discipline;
                       instituting regulatory reforms; following good social and environment risk
                       management practices; and ensuring property rights. In addition, the PAL
                       provides continuity with previous adjustment operations by ensuring
                       sustained progress on the structural reforms begun under Private Sector
                       Adjustment Loans 1 and 2, while at the same time introducing a new
                       program o f phased public sector and regulatory reforms that emphasizes
                       institutional development and effective implementation.

                       The program is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on reforming
                       core public sector institutions and processes. The second targets the public-
                       private interface and regulation of markets.

                       Part 1 Core Public Sector
                                Judicial reform
                                Civil service reform
                                Policy formulation
                                Transparency rules
                                Public expenditure management

                       Part 2: The Public-Private Interface and Regulated Markets
                                Privatization, restructuring and establishment of efficient markets
                                Energy sector reform
                                Mining and infrastructure reform
                                Business environment
                                Labor markets
                                Capital markets

                       The Letter o f Development Policy provides further details on the PAL 1
                       program and the Government's plans for PALs 2 and 3.
        Benefits:      First, the proposed PAL supports the Govemment's economic program to
                       achieve sustained growth, reduce poverty and progress towards EU

          accession,   Second it provides incentives to complete the process of
          structural reform begun undeu tlve PSALs. Third, in conjunction with the
          package of technical assistance offered under the Public and Private
          Institution Building Loan (PFIBL) and coordinated with other donor
          programs, it provides a structured framework for implementing the more
          complex institution-building tasks necessary to achieve the other program
          objectives. Fourth, the program supported by the loan complements and
          reinforces the IMFPrecautionary Standby Agreement.
Risks:    Implementation risk is high. The institutional weaknesses that the PALS
          seek to overcome, present one of the main challenges to implementation.
          The Superior Council on Public Policies and Structural Adjustment with the
          Prime Minister as President and supported by three cabinet level Vice
          Presidents (Minister of Public Finance, Minister of Administration and
          Interior, and General Secretary of Government) has been established to
          minimize this risk through regular meetings to ensure effective monitoring
          and coordination. This is supplemented by a PPIBL-financed PAL
          implementation unit under the Chancellery of the Prime Minister's Office
          and new Public Policy Unit established as permanent body in the office of
          the General Secretary of Government.

          There are political risks. The rulingparty did poorly inthe local elections
          inJune and the outcome of the fall parliamentary andpresidential elections
          i s now uncertain. This creates a risk that the authorities may backslide on
          reform commitments. This is mitigated by the fact that both the Bank and
          the Fundhave insistedon pre-announcement of reform measures including
          planned privatization sales,       gas price increases,     electricity tariff
          adjustments, and mine closures and layoffs, which means the Government
          has, to a large extent, already absorbed the political cost of these reforms.
          Another area of risk i s election-induced expenditure increases for pensions,
          public sector wages or ad hoc, one-off investment projects which might
          compromise the       Fund's SI3A and set in motion a chain of
          macroeconomically destabilizing events. However, these expenditures are
          closely monitored by the IMF in its quarterly reviews and they have been
          the subject of several joint (Bankr'Fund) communications to the authorities.
          Finally these risks are reduced by relatively strong economic growth, by the
          social support measures in the PAL program, and by the strong incentives
          provided by the prospect of ELJaccession and the important role the both
          the PAL and the IMF program play in this process. It is possible that the
          elections will result in a different political party forming the new
          government, but the polls indicate that the strongest electoral competitors to
          the rulingparty are highly supportive of the PAL reform agenda.

          Moderate financial risk is associated with an expanded program. This i s
          tempered by the relatively strong reserve position and the modest level of
          external debt. However, with the larger current account deficit, the
          favorable access and terms that Romania has enjoyed in international
          financial markets could deteriorate, increasing financial risk, should one or
          more adverse developments occur such as failure of the IMF program
          combined with, say, failure to attain the "functioning market economy"
          designation from the EU.

                   External shocks could affect macroeconomic stability.      Romania has
                   enjoyed strong export growth especially into the European market.
                   Remittances and FDI are expected to play and increasingly important role.
                   These factors have buffered the recent sharp rise in the current account
                   deficit which could worsen further if global growth were to weaken.
                   However the risks of this are not high. The IMF Precautionary Standby
                   Agreement was approved by the IMFBoard inJuly.

A.1MacroeconomicDevelopments and Prospects

1.       The performance of the Romanian economy during transition has been mixed, but
EU accession aspirations have enhanced macro-economic stability and spurred renewed
commitment to reforms in recent years. Romania's reform efforts during transition were more
uneven and less decisively aimed at systemic transformation than those of its EU accession
peers. Recurrent policy slippages during the nineties resulted in macroeconomic reversals, with
significant drops in output and bouts of high inflation. Over the last three to four years renewed
stabilization efforts have begun to break the "stop-and-go" reform cycle, sustain growth and
bring down inflation to more manageablelevels. The macro stabilization program was supported
by a SBA with the IMF' and included a combination of tight monetary policy and more rigorous
fiscal discipline. This has led to a sustained decline in inflation and the containment of budget
deficits. The SBA was complementedby advances in structural reforms under PSAL Iand I1and
steps by the Government to accelerate privatization, increase energy tariffs and apply stricter
financial discipline in the enterprise sector. On July 7 this year the IMF approved a 24-month
precautionary SBA. The new arrangement aims at strengthening macroeconomic stabilization
and structural reforms in the run-up to EU accession in 2007. The program is designed to
address the recent surge inthe current account deficit, rapid credit growth, and the need to bring
inflation down to single digits.

2.       The challenge is to sustain the macrOeconomic progress made so far. With strong
support from the PAL program, Romania is pursuing a broad reform agenda, including
institutional, governance and economic restructuring reforms, which are anchored in the process
of EU accession. Positive growth has been re-established at 4.5 to 5 percent, led primarily by
investment and exports. Inflation has declined from above 40 percent in 2000 to 15 percent
(yoy) in 2003, the lowest level since the start o f the transition.         Good macroeconomic
performance contributed to reaching a record level o f official reserves of over US$7 billion in

2003-an       impressive increase of US$3.5 billion since 2000. The banking sector is on firmer
footing and direct lending by the central bank has been eliminated. In contrast to the past,
privatization is picking up momentum-in               2003, 17 large loss-making state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) were privatized and labor retrenchment in the railway sector was around 14 percent or
some 16,500 positions. Progress in stabilization and growth contributed to a decline in poverty
to 25.7 percent in2003.

3.       But vulnerabilities remain. As a result of its reform efforts, Romania enjoyed renewed
access to international financial markets. This has allowed policy-makers to tolerate payment
arrears to the budget and state-ownedutilities. Aggregate consumption has also increased and is
now being driven by the rapid expansion of consumer credit, raising concerns about the
sustainability of growth in the medium-term and highlighting the need to press ahead with
enterprise and public governance reforms. A sharp increase in the minimum wage at the
beginning o f 2003, slippages in public sector wage policy and enterprise financial discipline,
including enterprise arrears, and delays in privatization and company restructuring have
prevented inflation from falling more quickly. The consolidated budget deficits have been
contained in recent years, but endemic tax and inter-enterprise arrears continue to feed a sizable
quasi-fiscal deficit.

4.       The external position has improved, but risks remain. The sudden surge in aggregate
consumption in the last quarter of 2003 widened the current account deficit to 5.9 percent o f
GDP. While there are no expectations of majior financing difficulties in covering the current
account and budget deficits in the foreseeable future, risks and vulnerabilities triggered by credit
expansion growth and exchange rate volatility continue. The commercial deficit is expected to


                                                       -8-

remain high throughout 2004, but some o f the gap will be offset by increases in net transfers
from abroad, especially by remittances from Romanians working abroad. Estimates suggest that,
in 2003, Romanian workers sent home remittances approaching the equivalent o f $2 billion (or
3.5 percent o f GDP). To curtail consumer credit expansion, real interest rates have been kept
high. Nominal interest rates fluctuate at between6-7 percent (for the Ministry o f Public Finance
T-bills) to as much as 20 percent (for commercial banks lending) above the expected inflation.
Improved access to international capital markets has been reflected in a continuing decline in
Romanian bond spreads, which are traded lately at between 100-150 basis points over the
comparable maturity German bunds, and in an increase in the average maturity o f the foreign
debt portfolio. External debt is buildingup slowly, if measured as a share o f GDP (around 34.6
percent at end-2003). The share o f the public and publicly guaranteed debt in total is now around
62 percent. Debt service is expected to rise moderately inthe next three years, largely because o f
private borrowing, which has a 2- to 3-year average maturity. Short term debt is steady at around
$0.5 billion.

5.       FDI inflows are expected to increase, but linger below potential, reflecting a weak
but improving business environment. Since the beginning o f the transition cumulative foreign
direct investment crossed the $10 billion thresholld in September 2003. During2003, FDIinflows
were estimated at around $1.5 billion, exceeding by over 20 percent the level o f the previous
year. In 2004 they are expected to increase by a further 25-30 percent following the likely
privatization o f several important companies in the energy sector. However, this i s only around
$480 per capita, several times lower than in neighboring CEE acceding countries2. Both the
volume and the composition o f the FDI inflows are linked to the progress achieved in
privatization and investor perceptions of the business environment. So far, FDI has been
concentrated primarily in labor-intensive, low value added, export-oriented industries, while
greenfield investment has been limited.

6.       The conduct of the monetary policy has been simplified by reforms in the banking
sector. In the past, the central bank's efforts to achieve price stability were complicated by the
presence of large insolvent state banks. Bancorex, the largest bank in Romania, now liquidated,
and Banca Agricola, now privatized, had been used by the state to channel large volumes o f
quasi-fiscal support to loss-making enterprises. The restructuring o f the banking sector has
provided the central bank the scope to address iiiflationary pressures with disciplined monetary
policy. In order to pursue disinflation and curb unsustainable growth in aggregate demand, the
intervention rate o f the central bank was raised by approximately 2 percentage points before
being cut back by 1.25 percentage points in recent weeks, as inflation pressures have subsided.
As inflation is falling, further interest hikes are not expected, but the central bank might resort to
other tools at its disposal, including an increase in the minimum reserve requirements for the
commercial banks and administrative barriers, to restrict borrowing by non-government, if
aggregate consumptionpressures persist.

7.       Sustained progress in growth and investment depends critically on important
institutional reforms. Weaknesses in the judicial system, poor accountability, and widespread



 For comparison, the cumulative FDIinflows per capita were, a1 cnd-2002, $3,808 for the CzechRepublic, $2,400 for Hungary,
$1,911 for Slovakia, $1,204 for Poland and $587 for Bulgaria.

perception o f corruption negatively affect the business environment and private sector
investment and improvements in public administration, policy formulation, and public
expenditure management are needed. The level of primary expenditure, as a percentage of GDP,
is not a major concern, and i s in fact lower than in several EU member countries. However,
there is poor prioritization and allocational inefficiency. Public spending on education (around
3.2 percent o f GDP in 2003) and health (around 4.0 percent o f GDP in 2003) remains lowest
among the CEE countries, insufficient to support longer term growth and sustain the confidence
o f the domestic and foreign business communities. The costing systems and financing
arrangements, especially for services, provided at sub-national levels are in need o f a major
overhaul.        Substantial resources are still channeled to loss-making sectors, such as mining,
energy and railways, and to support a highly redistributional welfare system. The pay-as-you-go
state pension system expends around 7-8 percent of GDP, and runs a deficit estimated at around
1 percent o f GDP per year, as the number o f recipients has grown substantially relative to the
number o f contributors.

8.        Noteworthy progress has been made on structural reforms, but some of the
challenges of economic policy remain from early transition. These challenges include the
completion o f the privatization agenda and addressing the financial problems o f the SOEs,
including the payment arrears. There has been considerable acceleration inprivatization recently,
but the initial pace was slow. Employment inthe private sector3has exceeded 70 percent o f the
total in 2003, and the labor force employed In SOEs has declined substantially. Recently the
Government has reduced the number o f large loss-making entities by completing a series o f
important privatization deals, such as steel makes Siderurgica (8473 employees), tractor maker
Tractorul Brasov (3,403 employees) and truck maker ARO Campulung (3498 employees).
However, some which remain have proved diffficult to sell and liquidation i s the only credible
option. In addition, some companies which were unsuccessfblly privatized have reverted to the
state, due to the failure o f the buyers to observe contractual obligations. Privatization in the
energy sector was slower than hoped but is now advancing. Final sales contracts have now been
signed for Petrom, the national oil company, and for the first two o f eight electricity distribution
companies. Competitive bids have been received for the two gas distribution companies. In an
Economic Retreat with investors and the IFIs in January this year, the Government reiterated its
commitment to continue to pursue reforms vigarously, with support from the precautionary SBA
with the IMFandthe PAL.

9.        Important steps have been taken towards improving the performance in the energy,
rail and mining sectors, although these remain the main causes of arrears accumulation
and subsidies. Reforms in energy consisted of measures to improve financial discipline and
adopt hard budget constraints, as well as restructuring and privatization. The Government, has
increased energy tariffs and disconnected certain non-payers resulting in improved financial
performance and reduced cost to the budget. The total implicit subsidies and losses in the energy
sector have decreased from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to 2.8 percent in 2003. In electricity,
tariffs already recover the average cost level. The energy bill collection rates have also, with a
few exceptions, improved in 2003, especially in electricity. Yet, pricing, arrears accumulation



 Private sector employment i s defined as total employment incompanies where majority shareholding (over 50 percent) is held
by private entities.


                                                            -10-

and collection performance still constitute important challenges which adversely affect public
finances and macroeconomic stability. Some tariffs are still below cost recovery prices,
especially in heating, and the low domestic wellhead price for natural gas inhibitsinvestment and
fields development. Inrailroads, under the IMF Stand-by, there have been substantial layoffs and
planned track closures, but subsidies and paymelit arrears (especially social contributions) still
remain. In2003, non-payment of taxes and utilities was lei 2 trillion and subsidies and transfers
were lei 5.2 trillion (0.6 percent of GDP). In mining, the early progress made under PSAL I
proved difficult to maintain and subsidies and losses remain high. Mining sector non-payment of
taxes and utilities was lei 3 trillion and there was an equivalent amount of losses despite
subsidies of roughly half this amount. The total amounts to roughly 5.8 percent of GDP.        A
strategy of restructuring has been prepared amid includes mine closures and layoffs, with
accompanying social support programs where necessary. In both mining and rail, substantial
restructuring and closures are needed. The authorities have begun with the decision in 2003 to
reduce the work force in the railway sector by I S percent and close 3000-3500 kilometers o f
track. The authorities also agreed to close 30 mines and layoff SO00 miners in 2004. Further
closures and layoffs have been agreed in the context of the mining sector strategy which will
phase out support for the mineral sector by 26307 as requiredby the EU, and for the hard coal
sector by 2010.

10.        Measures to deal with the financial sector risks and institutional shortcomings will
help create conditions for an effective channeling of the savings to facilitate investment.
While growing fast from a low base, Romania's financial sector remains small relative to other
countries in the region with comparable income levels. The relative underdevelopment of the
financial sector is a matter of public policy concern as limited access to credit may stifle
profitable investment opportunities and growth, especially inthe context of the large investments
in infrastructure and environment required by EW accession. Moreover, financial markets in
Romania do not provide widespread access to financial services to economic agents nor do they
seem to sufficiently finance some of the fastest growing segments o f the economy such as small
and medium enterprises (SMEs). The quality and price of the financial services including bank
credit, capital market transactions and the payments system, could be improved. Average
maturities are short, while real lending interest rates remain high. This is the consequence of a)
the tight monetary policy of the central bank needed to consolidate macrostabilization, and
reflected inhighreserverequirements for the commercialbanks4and a high nominal intervention
rate; and b) of the reluctance of the banking systemto lend to the real sector, still perceived as a
risky undertaking. Improved financial sector performance will be neededto allow the adjustment
to new patterns of production and resource realllocation, as the economy becomes more oriented
towards the EU in anticipation of accession. As interdependencies within the system become
stronger, effective oversight and strong management in financial institutions will become crucial.



  Reserverequirements levels are 18 percent for ROL-denominotedl deposits and 25 percent for forex deposits. The intervention
rate o fthe central bank is 20 percent.



                                                             -13-

In parallel with the strengthening of the banking environment, conditions will need to be
improved to support the development of other channels of financial intermediation, including
capital markets, insurance and pensions, in order to diversify part of the demand for credit away
from the banking system and provide the economy with diversified sources of longer-term
funding.

11.      Reforms undertaken in recent years have substantially consolidated the banking
system, but the non-banking financial sector remains underdeveloped.The authorities have
been remarkably successful in stabilizing the banking sector over the past years. At present, no
systemic threat to the banking system is foreseen. Banks are highly liquidand well capitalized,
and are not connected through the interbank and capital markets. The banks can deal with
considerable stress from the corporate sector. They have a preference for high liquidity and the
overall level of lending to the corporate sector is low, although bank lending is rapidly
increasing. At the same time, the rapid growth of credit to the private sector since early 2002
may create additional risks for individual banks. Already, reported levels of non-performing
loans have been revised upward as a result of the introduction of new loan classification and
provisioning rules. More than 50 percent of capital is fixed assets in many banks, posing
valuation and measurement problems. Capital could be further affected by increases in risk
associatedwith a rapidly expandedloan portfolio. Inparticular, rapid growth of foreign currency
loans could lead to debt service difficulties should the ROL depreciate. The capacity of the
central bank to supervise and monitor the banking sector has been consolidated substantially.
Banking supervision is in compliance or largely in compliance with nearly all Basel Core
Principles and is solid enough to monitor and manage the risks in banks, although work remains
to be done to strengthen supervision on a consolidated basis, and to assess market risk and
country risk. The PAL supports the privatization with strategic investors of the two remaining
state banks, BCR and CEC.

A.2 AddressingPovertyandImprovingthe Dseliveryof Public Services

12.      Poverty reduction can best be achieved in Romania by pursuing a two-pronged
strategy consisting of improvingthe functioningof public institutionsand establishingthe
fundamentals for economic growth. In Romania there is a strong association between
economic growth and poverty reduction. During the period 1997-1999, when the economy
contracted, poverty worsened substantially, a trend which was reversed during 2000-2003, when
the economy improved and the poverty rate fell to an estimated 25.1 percent (headcount) in
2003, from 35.9 in 2000. The magnitudes are quite striking and projections from the Poverty
Assessment (2003) suggest that maintaining an annual growth rate of 5 percent in GDP per
capita would reducepoverty by almost halfby 2007 (see Table 6 for annual projections). Growth
has tended to increase inequality. However, the increases are modest and current levels of
inequality in Romania are comparable to those in other CEE countries5 and below other
developing countries with a similar GDP per capita. This suggests that growth needs to be a
central component of the poverty alleviation strategy and attention must be paid to countering




 InequalityinRomania, as measuredby the Gini coefficient, bas increasedfrom 30.5 in 1997to 32 in2002. For comparison,
other Gini coefficients were 37.1 for Bulgaria (in2000), 27.3 for. the CzechRepublic (in2002), 28.0 for Hungary (in2001), 35
for Poland(in2002) and51.8 for Russia(in2001).

growth-constraining factors such as macro instability, corruption, weaknesses in the business
environment andthe inflexibility of the labor markets.

13.       Answers to the question of how to sustain the growth to reduce poverty can be
found in part from a comparison of Romania's progress in structural reforms with other
countries in the region. Indicators of progress of structural reforms between 1999 and 2003 are
shown in Figure 7. The figure distinguishes between two types of reforms. The first relate to
changes in basic market structures typical of the early stages of transition; and the second to the
deeper more complex reforms that involve privatization of large scale enterprises, financial
sector development, and changes in institutions and governance structures. The figure reveals
two clear patterns. One is that in Romania, progress on the first stage reforms appear to have
stalled, albeit at a high level. The other is that, relative to its accession peers, Romania lags in
implementing second phase reforms. However, these data may not capture some of the
acceleration in first stage reforms than has taken place in the last 12 months. In particular the
sharp rise in privatization efforts including Petroin, the electricity distribution companies and
other manufacturing concerns are likely to be reflected in an improvement in the next round of
EBRDtransition indicators.

14.       Further insight into how to sustain paverty-reducing growth can be gained from an
examination of relative performance within the Romanian economy, which reveals a
vibrant periphery and a stagnant core. In this context, trade performance represents a
particularly bright spot. Romania's share in the EU external imports increased every single year
from around 0.32 percent in 1993 to around 1.015 percent in 2002. Among CEEC-9, Romania's
export performance to the EUmarkets matches that of the relatively large and industrially more
advanced economy of the Czech Republic. Only Estonia (30 percent) and Slovakia (22 percent)
had average export growth rates, measured in terms of change in the share of exports in EU



                                                              -15-

external imports, higher than Romania (20 percent). This performance was accompanied by
equally strong expansion of imports, indicating im part progress in industrialrestructuring leading
to the emergence of new exporters competitive in international markets. These appear to be
linkedto FDIandde novo companies, particularly SMEs. Romania's most rapidtrade expansion
into the EUmarkets occurred in 2000-2003 despite adverse external market conditions and slow
growth in the EU economies, suggesting that Romanian exporters have firmly established
commercial presence inthe EUmarkets.

15.    The solid performance in trade contrasts sharply with the dismal performance of
the large unrestructured industries and SOEs. These have stagnant or declining output and
continue to run up debts to the state budget. Slow progress in the enterprise sector is keeping
Romania from re-allocating resources from low productivity activities to more productive and
potentially competitive sectors. This exerts a drag on per capita income growth. Even the
growing export sector tends to be dominated by unskilled labor intensive products. While in the
short run this reflects the comparative advantage of the country, the continued dominance of
unskilledlabor intensive commodities defies the experience of most other CEEC-9 countries. In
most of these countries, the initial gap between their endowment inrelativelyhighly skilled labor
and the factor intensities of their exports, has been closed fairly rapidly, primarily due to the
large FDI inflows. Without hrther expansion of private sector activities in the economy,
increased labor market flexibility, and a predictable policy environment, Romania will fail to
build comparative advantage in high tech and skilled labor-intensive production. Without
economic restructuring, and market-driven mechanisms for reallocating resources, including
labor, from low to higher productivity activities, and FDI flows to upgrade technology,
Romania's potential competitiveness and growth potential risks beingcapped.

16.    Labor market flexibility remains limited, affecting sustainable job creation and the
needed reallocation of labor. Labor reallocation i s fundamental for a successful transition in
Romania. Sectoral employment structure differs significantly between Romania and the EU
economies in spite of important positive changes taking place in the last several years.
Employment in agriculture and in the heavy and network industries remains unsustainably high.
At the same time, employment in services is halfthat inthe EU. Throughout the transition, labor
mobility has been impeded by a combination of temporary and permanent factors, with the


                                                      -14-

weight unbalanced towards the former. Some of current flows are likely to be reversed through
the liberalizationof the markets and the removal off the existing constraints. Labor reallocation i s
expected to be multidimensional, with workers changing not only their companies, but also
sectors, occupations and location. This could be severely hampered by impediments to labor
mobility, poorly developed employment exchange facilities, excessive specific and non-
transferable training and distortionary subsidies. To address these constraints the framework for
the labor markets needs to be revisited, includingby amending the Labor Code.

17.     The 4.5 million people working in the Romanian agriculture today are equivalent to
an astonishing 72 percent of agricultural laber in all the 15 EU countries. This i s the result
of land restitution polices, combined with ecoiromic collapse and substantial losses of jobs in
urban-basedand large state-owned industrial enterprises. Infact, while the share of agriculture in
GDP declined from 23 percent in 1990 to 13 percent in 2000, the share of agricultural labor
increased to over 30 percent of total employmead. The agricultural work force is large, old,
unproductive and poor, or vulnerable to poverty. There is scope for reforms that will lift
agricultural productivity through adjustment of pricing and subsidization policies and
rationalization o f taxes, the incidence of which is highly uneven across agricultural products.
These changes will be strongly conditioned by the EU accession process and by future changes
that will have to be made in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. But, regardless of these
changes, it is clear that there will have to be a very substantial exodus of people from the
agricultural sector into new jobs in services and export industries. The need to absorb these
agricultural sector workers, as well as the contiiiuing flows from mining, rail and other declining
sectors, highlights the importance of establishingflexible markets and supporting structures.

18.     Challenges remain in education and health. Romania has been implementing
comprehensive education reforms aimed at modernizing the system to meet the emerging
challenges of a free market economy, as well as the competitive pressures posed by EU
accession. Nevertheless, there is inequitable access to education between urban and rural areas
and income groups. Quality and relevance require improvement, and capacity constraints inhibit
decentralized management. There is a need to reform not only the system of education, but also
the financing mechanisms, in order to improve efficiency and autonomy at the school/district
level. There are two linkages between poverty and education. First, better educated adults earn
more and householdsheadedby more educatedadults are less likely to be poor. Second, poverty
has implications for children's schooling in a given household. For example, 39 percent of poor
children aged 15-24 are not in school and didnot attend vocational or high school compared with
10 percent for non-poor children of the same age group. The health sector has greatly improved
its emergency response and other services, but remains seriously deficient in meeting the
population's basic health needs. The poor are particularly vulnerable, as informal payments are
rampant, basic health services are weak and financing goes primarily towards the urban-based
hospitals. Elevenpercent o fpoor households have no health service intheir locality, as opposed
to 5 percent for the non-poor. Lower socio-economic background individuals are less likely to
have health insurance and low-income househralds are much less likely to know someone who
can help solve their health problems. Poor children fare much worse than non-poor children
when it comes to school enrollments, and both, health and education, are key determinants of

                                                       -17-

employment and wages. If the education and health status o f the poor does not improve, a
poverty-trap i s inevitable, where a large majority o f children coming from poor households
become the poor of the future. Education and health investments, if properly channeled to
benefit poorer segments of population, would both reduce inequality and ensure a satisfactory
long-term economic growth performance.

19.     Reaching the Millennium Development Goals. The Millennium Development Goals
(MDG) are expressed as improvements targeted for 2015 relative to performance in 1990.
Because of the weak economic growth in much o f the 1990s, Romania i s likely to have difficulty
achieving the MDG o f halving o f poverty rates over this period. School enrollments rates were
already high at the end o f the Ceausescu period and the 100 percent primary enrollment MDG
target is reachable, but even this modest increase will require improvements in school financing
mechanisms and efforts to enhance quality. Similarly, the trends in health are such that the
MDGs can be reached, but serious issues of budgeting, finance and hospital management must
be addressed to keep the process on track. HIVI'AIDS and child mortality targets are within
reach, but the incidence of tuberculosis has risen sharply. The MDGs for water access are likely
to remain illusive, reflecting significant challenges in infrastructure and service provision more
broadly.

                                   B. THEGOVERNMENT'S              PROGRAM

20.     The elections of November 2000 ushered in a new government and a new policy
agenda driven by several development goals. The Government's priorities outlined in its
Governance Program 2001-2004 included: enhanced economic growth; reduction o f poverty and
unemployment, and integration into the European Union and NATO. The Government's 2004
economic agenda, rolled out at the recent Economic Retreat, recognizes the growth-poverty


                                                      - 1 8-

reduction nexus and the importance o f maintaining the "hard earned" macro-stability. On this
occasion the Government reiterated its commitment to a successfd precautionary SBA with the
IMF, and to implementationo fthe PALagenda.

B.l Core Public Sector

Judicial Reform

21.     The Romanian Government has launched a number of important initiatives since
2000 aimed at reforming the judiciary and strengthening rule of law in the country. In
September 2003, the Government adopted a comprehensive Judicial Reform Strategy for 2003-
2007 and a detailed Implementation Plan, with a timetable and required financial resources. The
Strategy paper outlines the following strategic objiectives o f the reform process: enhancing the
rule o f law in the country, strengthening institutional independence o f the judiciary, increasing
efficiency o f courts and professional level of judges and court personnel, improving the quality
o f judgments and legal predictability in dispute resolution, and achieving compliance with the
EUstandards andregulations.

22.     In October 2003, constitutional amendments were adopted through a national
referendum which introduced important changes in the judicial area. These include: (i)
enshrining the principles o f the judiciary as an independent branch o f power, and the right to a
fair trial within a "reasonable time"; (ii)transformation o f the Supreme Court o f Justice into a
High Court of Cassation and Justice, responsible for ensuring the consistent interpretation and
implementation o f laws throughout Romania; and {iii) a revised composition and mandate o f the
Superior Council o f Magistracy which would strengthen its role as an institutional guarantor o f
judicial independence.

23.     Romania still needs to address some key issues facing the judiciary, particularly, in
light of its EU accession efforts. The P A L program will provide support for addressing these
issues, including: fix-ther strengthening o f the institutional independence o f the judiciary through
the enhanced role of the Superior Council o f Magistracy; increasing accountability ofjudges and
the court system for timeliness and quality o f their work; a more efficient organization o f the
court system; and improving the system o f court financing.

CivilService Reform

24.     The Government program seeks to esttablish a more meritocratic, professional,
depoliticized civil service, funded with a sustainable public sector wage bill and transparent
salary setting. The program i s founded on the establishment o f a comprehensive set o f
monitoring indicators agreed with the Civil Servants National Agency (ANFP) and the
progressive improvement o f these indicators over benchmark levels. The Civil Service Law was
recently overhauled as part o f the Government's package o f anti-corruption measures. Over the
series o f PALs a revision o f the Civil Service Law is anticipated, and a new law on Civil Service
Salary setting will be adopted.      A computerized human resource management information
system will be developed over the course o f the PALs, with assistance from the EC, the World
Bank and the Government's own resources, to ensure that the ANFP has the capacity to monitor




                                                 -19-

and enforce the civil service management requirements of the Civil Service Law and its
subsidiary legislation..

Policy Formulation

25.     The Government program makes important strides in strengthening administrative
accountability in the areas of policy formulation, free access to information, and
anticorruption. The proper direction for reform o f the policy formulation process, long subject
to excessive reliance on emergency ordinances, was taken with the passing of the Law on
Decisional Transparency in early 2003, and with the Constitutional changes later that year
limiting the scope of emergency ordinances. The Government has established a new Public
Policy Unit (PPU) in the office of the General Secretary of Government structured on the lines
advocatedby the PAL team to build policy formulation capacity with better and more transparent
stakeholder consultation and more orderly pre-cabinet, inter-ministerial reconciliation processes.
Adoption of new formal policy-making procedures is planned during the in PAL program to
allow better strategic prioritization and enhanced fiscal impact assessment, and increased
credibility of the State and the Anti-corruption program. To this end, an initial draft "Guide
Concerning the Design, Implementation and Evaluation of Public Policy at the Central Level"
has been prepared. Technical assistance i s being mobilized from the U.K.,the European Union
and the Bank to aid in these reforms, under terms of reference developed jointly by the EC, the
Bank and DFID.

Transparencyand Anti corruption

26.     The Law on Free Access to Informatiam, passed in 2001, provided an important
step forward in developing a system of open and accessible government.                 This Law,
developed during a broad-based and productive public dialogue, outlines ex oficio information
to be providedby every governmental body, the limited criteria by which a request under the law
may be rejected, and the processes and deadlines for making and responding to requests. Several
NGOs and think tanks have produced detailed studies testing the implementation of the law,
studies that have revealed both successes and implementation challenges. The program calls for
similar monitoring of the LFAI as device for periodic feedback on progress.

27.     Reducing corruption has been high on the Government's agenda since the adoption
of the National Program for Prevention of Corruption and National Action Plan against
Corruption in 2001. Both documents laid out an agendao f actions aimed at buildingsystems of
transparency and accountability to complement strong enforcement of anticorruption legislation.
Progresshas been made on a number of fronts, including the adoption of freedom of information
legislation, the establishment of a National Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office (NAPO), and
various sectoral reforms. Since its establishment, in September 2002, over 250 persons have
been sentenced for corruption-related activities (around 25 percent of those charged by NAPO
for corruption -related offenses). InMarch of 2003 further legislative advancements were made
with the establishment of public asset declarations by public officials, and new legislation on
conflicts of interest. The Government program deepens these reforms by strengthening both the
substance and the implementation arrangements for both asset declarations and conflict o f
interest prohibitions, and expands the reforms to cover another persistent problem, the use o f
gifts as surrogate unofficial payments. The asset declaration has been amended inMay 2004, as



                                              -20-

a measure under the PAL, in order to introduce more clarity in the format o f the reporting. All
the candidates for the June 2004 local elections ffiilled in the improved version of the declaration.
The asset declarations of all public officials, including of senior civil servants, are posted on the
web sites o f their respective institutions.

Public ExpenditureManagement

28.     Public Expenditure Management is undergoing major changes and several new
components and tools have been introduced to the modernize Public Financial
Management (PFM) and governance. These include the introduction of a medium term
perspective and programs with quantitative performance indicator into the state budget,
modernization and upgrading of the Treasury system, introduction of accrual-based accounting,
internal audit and an external financial audit by the Court o f Accounts in line with lnternational
Standards of Accounting. Following the recommendations of the draft Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the overall management and coordination of these reform
efforts and the capability of public sector managers to apply them effectively will be enhanced.
This will be ensured by the establishment of an inter-ministerial PFM reform management
structure set up by the Ministry of Public Finance, atraining program for public sector managers,
and by supporting professional certifications of internal auditors, expectedto effectively promote
management accountability.

29.     Effective Decentralization and Improved Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations.
Government of Romania has taken several steps to resolve outstanding issues neededto make its
decentralization and intergovernmental system more effective and efficient among the central
government, counties, communes, and municipalities. However, these efforts have been partial,
and have not resolved key issues affecting local administration in Romania. Further reforms are
needed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency o f local service delivery. In June 2003, an
emergency ordinance was adopted (45/2003) t~ replace the existing Law on Local Public
Finance (LLPF 189/98). This ordinance articulates some of the decentralization principles more
clearly, and provides some borrowing flexibilitiy to local governments. However, it introduces
changes in the intergovernmental transfer system, , which do not represent unambiguous
progress. The Govemment recognizes the need to develop an adequate framework for tackling
further sector decentralization-financing     and assignment of fimction issues-and        to resolve
current misalignments between fiscal decentralization and functional devolution to sectors that
have been decentralized, inorder to minimize horizontal and vertical imbalances.

30.     Since the early years of transition tor a market economy and a democratic society
Romania has pursued a comprehensive education reform program. Reforms have improved
quality in education through the adoption of a new curriculum framework, the ability of schools
to choose among several textbooks, new assessmentand evaluation systems and teacher training
innew teaching methodologies. The reformhas now moved to a new phase aimed at improving
education equity and efficiency. The objectives o f this phase are to provide more adequate and
equitable financing for education and to align the roles and responsibilities o f education
authorities at the central and local level with financial decentralization. Specific programs for
rural students and other educationally deprived groups (e.g. Roma) have been launched. Other
essential steps needed to achieve these objectives include: (i)       adoption of an improved per
student, cost-indexed fbnding formula for basic and secondary education in order to reduce



                                                -2 1-

inequities and provide incentives for efficiency; (ii)  development o f a mechanism to provide
adequate financing for upper secondary schools that serve multiple communities, as well as for
capital investments; (iii)empowerment o f schools and local authorities to manage schools locally
(including teacher recruitment, assignment, and professional development).

31.     The Government is pursuing an ambitious program of structural and financial
reform in the health sector. The objectives o f this program include developing consistent and
rational approaches to providing sustainable sources o f financing for the health insurance system
at the national and local level, reducing actual and perceived corruption, improving transparency
in the health sector, and improving focus of health care providers on outputs and outcomes and
increased quality, effectiveness and efficiency o f service delivery. Essential elements o f this
program include: (i)the development o f health facility rationalization strategies at the judet
level, and the implementation of these strategies to reduce overcapacity and increase access to
appropriate high quality health services; (ii)changing the mechanisms for paying health
providers to ensure that they contain appropriate incentives for providing effective, efficient and
high quality services; (iii) revision o f funding mechanisms for the National Health Insurance
House and Regional houses to provide stable, predictable, and sustainable levels o f financing;
and (iv) changes to the systems o f provider contracting and reimbursement to ensure maximum
levels o f transparency and reduce corruption inthe health system.

32.     The government recognizes the need far pension reform. While the authorities have
recently taken steps to introduce second and third pillars to the pension system it i s clear that
placing the first pillar on a sound financial footing i s the first priority. Accordingly, the
Government has prepared a strategy for the adjustment o f key pension parameters that will
enable the system to face demographic challenges and provide adequate coverage at sustainable
costs to the budget. This includes progressive raising o f the retirement age, equalization o f the
retirement age for men and women and shifting o f several o f the non-pension related
expenditures from the pension system to the budget.

B.2 The Public Private Interface and Regulated Markets

Privatization

33.     The current privatization program focuses on manufacturing and infrastructure
SOEs. The privatization focus o f the two previous structural adjustment loans (PSAL Iand
PSAL 11) was on reducing the role o f the state in manufacturing and banking and in the second
adjustment loan, PSAL 11, a program o f infrastructure privatization was launched.              The
government plans to complete privatizing SOEs in manufacturing and the energy sector
(electricity and gas) to privatize the last two commercial state banks and has closed the state
privatization agency, APAPS. Residual firms that are to be liquidated or that are under court
procedures have been transferred to a new agency AVAS. This transfer consolidates the
portfolios o f the old asset management company AVAB with that o f APAPS in a manner that
streamlines the privatization and liquidation processes. Best practices for transparent and
competitive privatization procedures, will be followed for these privatization sales.




                                               -22-

Energy Sector

34.     In July 2003 the Government approved and published a strategy - The Road Map
for the Energy Field - for the development of the energy sector with the focus on gas and
electricity sectors. The strategy has short-term (2003-2004), medium-term (2005-2007) and
long-term (2008-2015) dimensions. One of the means for implementing the strategy is the
privatization o f state-owned oil, and gas and power enterprises. The privatization of the national
oil and gas company Petrom as well as the gas and power distribution companies was launched
under PSAL 11. Over the course of the PAL program the other gas producer, Romgas, the
remaining distribution companies as well as three large power generation companies will be
privatized.

35.     The Government is aware that the implementation of such an ambitious
privatization program in the energy sector will be a major challenge in the current global
privatization environment. However, the Government i s determined to proceed so as to: (a)
secure the significant investment resources that will be necessary for the rehabilitation and
expansion of production/generation and distribution systems, which the public sector alone will
not be able to fund or mobilize; and (b) develop a more efficient and increasingly competitive
energy sector, to energize and enhance the competitiveness of the Romanian economy. Energy
sector reforms already accomplished by the Government, including the restructuring and
unbundling of the oil, gas and power companies, the establishment of the gas and electricity
regulatory authorities, and price liberalization (oil) and tariff adjustments (gas and electricity),
haveplaced Romania ina strong positionto move forward with theseprivatizations.

36.     Energy services will be improved through liberalization with targeted support to
low-income households. Economic stagnation in the 1990s led to inadequate investments and
insufficient maintenance and rehabilitation of aging energy facilities and networks.     Now that
Romania's economic growth is accelerating, pressureon services will increase. This is far more
than a sectoral issue.    Adequate supply of energy is an essential prerequisite for achieving
sustainable economic growth without which it will be difficult for Romania to bothimplement its
social programs/poverty alleviation agenda and improve and maintain necessary fiscal discipline
for sustainable development.        Another challlemge is the need to comply with various EU
directives and other minimum standards needed to join the European Union. Considerable
technical skills and a well-educated labor-force able to learn more, are available. Private sector
management skills and private financing will be needed - public sector skills andpublic finances
alone will not suffice - and therefore privatization is an integral element of the service delivery
program. The oil sector has already been opened. The liberalization of the gas and electricity
sectors is a key element of the Government's strategy spelled out in its Road Map in order to
meet EU's market requirements and directives, and to subject the increasingly private service
providers to competitive market forces. In the district heating sector the focus will be on
restructuring and consolidation, to improve heating services and reduce subsidies through
efficiency improvements and targeting.

37.     Service delivery issues vary greatly in various part of the energy sector and
therefore very different approaches are necessary.




                                                -23-

   0    The oil sector has been liberalized and major private companies (including Lukoil, OMV,
        MOL, and Shell) are already present. With the privatization of Petrom, service delivery
        will be almost entirely entrusted to the private sector, apart from minority government
        holding inPetrom and continued public ownership of the petroleum transport network.
   0    The electricity and gas sectors will be liberalized, in accordancewith the Road Map and
        EU requirements. Romania is a signatory of "the Athens Memorandum" - the
        Memorandum of Understanding on the Regional Energy Market in South East Europe
        and its Integration into the European Community Internal Energy Market - on December
        8, 2003 in Athens, Greece, whereby the countries of South East Europe formally
        expressedtheir commitment to what is currently called the Energy Community o f South
        East Europe (ECSEE) '.             Romania's national energy reforms are aligned with ECSEE's
        regional requirements and will also facilitate its integration into the EC's internal market
        as part of its EU accession. Market opening has already been started. The largest
        industrial electricity and gas consumers now have the freedom to choose their gas
        supplier.       Market opening will continue, in parallel with further adjustments in the
        producer and retailprices of gas (bringing them gradually in line with import parity) and
        electricity tariffs (cross-subsidies have largely been eliminated but continuing
        adjustments will be necessary to cover the increasing costs of supply and provide for
        adequateretums for sustainable operations).
   0    District heating systems across the country have losses which burden central and local
        budgets. Raising resources for the financing of district heating (and other urban
        infrastructure such water & sewerage systems and roads) has emerged as a major
        challenge. Some district heating systems have already been closed and further closures
        are likely in the coming years. Plants closures, disconnections and high heating prices
        are pressing human issues, as heating is a basic need in Romania's winter. The Central
        government has been forced to provide increasingly costly ad-hoc supports and will have
        to continue to do so until more satisfactory solutions to these heating issues are
        implemented.            A district heating strategy has been prepared and will be implemented
        during the PAL program. Measures will include mandatory heat metering and heating
        control measures such as thermostatic valves and improvements in the structure of
        heating tariffs, so as to give the heat consumers the ability and incentive to control their
        heating and heat consumption.
   0    Social protection measures are an integral part o f energy reforms.                 Price reforms and
        tariff adjustments in gas, electricity and district heating will take into account the ability
        of low-income householdsto pay for their basic energy services and will be accompanied
        by targeted subsidies to ensure continued access. Electricity tariffs already include a
        well-functioning mechanism to support basic electricity needs. In district heating, a
        major shift from producer subsidies to targeted consumer subsidies will be implemented
        gradually in line with the sector restructuring. In the gas sector, a similar program to
        support low-income householdswill be developed.

Reforms in Mining and Infrastructure

38.     The government recognizes the need for restructuring in the enterprise sector to
limit the fiscal burden of current subsidies and losses. Accordingly, the authorities have
prepared a detailed strategy for restructuring the miningsector with schedules for the closure o f
non-viable mines, and special programs for employment and social mitigation. In addition, the
Ministry of Transport has adopted a restructuring program for the state airline Tarom prepared
by an international advisor.

39.     The restructuring program aims to establish the Romanian railway companies as
viable businesses with good productivity. The Railway Law passed in 1997 and amended in
2003 provides the legal basis for restructuring by establishing three railway companies: the
infrastructure company, the freight service company, and the passenger service company. Rules
exist for private operators' entry to the market; ten already have done so. The freight service
companies have freedom to set tariffs, there are public service obligation (PSO) contracts with
the Government for the desired non-commercial passenger services, and the non-core activities
of the state-owned railways have been privatized. Continuing restructuring foresees further
reductions in the railway labor force, rationalization of the railway network and services,
completion of interoperability and safety regulations consistent with EU directives and practice,
modification of track access charges to better reflect costs and competition, and the privatization
of the State-owned freight service company. Part of restructuring is also the upgrading of the
rolling stock for both freight and passenger services, and full implementation of the Integrated
Railway Information System(IRIS). Inshort, the aim is to ensure fair competition and financial
viability of the railways under prevailingmarket conditions.

40.     The restructuring program aims to achieve management of the road sector more
efficiently, with cost-effective use of public fonds and privatization of supplier functions to
ensure competition. Until now, the Bank has been concerned with the roughly 11,500km of
main roads which are administered and managed by the National Administration of Roads
(NAR), recently reorganized as State-owned caiyorate entity. Counties Cjudets) are responsible
for the rest of the public road network (app. 66,500 km) with management capabilities lesser
than NAR's.       The restructuring focuses on improving NAR's planning and management
capabilities, privatization of its force account organizations, equipping NAR and county road
management entities with management systems far allocating the road budget between the three
functional road classes (main, county, and local roads--excluding streets and town/village roads),
and between regions (aggregations of counties as they are too small for cost-effective road
management), and for the prioritization of road works. Recommendations will also be made for
road user charges.       It is expected that (a) by end-2004, NAR reorganization has been
consolidated, its corporate planningprocessesestablished, and privatization o f the force accounts
has begun; and (b) by end-2006, the road management and associated data systems are in place
to permit cost-effective allocation of funds and prioritization of road works; the administration
and management structure of the entire road sector has been reconsidered and changed if so
desired; and the road user charges revised to colter 70 percent o f the road costs, including the
facility costs and their maintenance, environment and accidents costs caused by roads and road
transport.

BusinessEnvironment

41.      In order to strengthen the Corporate Governance of the enterprise sector the
Government prepared draft legislation which is currently being discussed with stakeholders. In
addition, the Government requested the Bank's support for conducting a ROSC assessment on
the corporate governance principles applied in the OECD countries as a basis for further
improvingthe currently proposed legislation.

42.     Following the actions successfully implemented under the PSAL I1 program, the
Government approved a new Action Plan #cor          remove the administrative barriers and
improve the business environment. This Action Plan is being implemented satisfactorily, and
i s helping to simplify administrative and regulatory procedures and to the decrease of the
transaction costs for business entry and operation. As part of this Action Plan, a second baseline
Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey (ARCS) will be conducted with FIAS support
beginning during 2004. Also, the Silent Approval Law which was recently passed, will
contribute to the decrease of corruption and implicitly to the reduction of transaction costs. By
2005, administrative and regulatory requirements for entry of new businesses and operations
would be in linewith those inEUcountries.

43.     The bankruptcy legislation has been updated in line with the recommendations
coming from the consultants engaged under the BSAL 2 program. A ROSC assessment on the
insolvency and creditor rights, that has been conducted by the Bank at the request of the
Government identifying fhrther refinements of the legislation as well as steps to improve
implementation capacity. By end of 2005, the number of pendingbankruptcy trials in courts will
be significantly diminished,as well as the averageduration of such trials.

44.      Improvements will be introduced to the transparency in the functioning of firms.
Financial reporting and auditing requirements in Romania are currently in transition from
compliance with national standards to compliance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), International Standards on Auditing (ISA), and the acquis communautaire.
Romania has achieved great progress in law. The Government is now working on better
implementation by pursuing an action plan to improve the compliance with these enhanced
requirements and ensure they are effectively enforced. The Ministry of Public Finance i s
preparing a policy document that maps out the areas of focus to enhance the quality of financial
reporting in Romania building on the policy recommendations made in the accounting and
auditing ROSC published in September 2003. The policy document will specify the actions to be
taken to implement the rec'ommendations. High quality financial information will strengthen the
country's financial architecture and reduce the risk of financial crises. In addition, it will help
attract foreign investment and mobilize domestic savings.

Labor MarketReform

45.     In 2002 the Government adopted a comprehensive employment plan aimed at
stimulatingjob creation, encouragingentrepreneurshipand providingequal labor market
opportunitiesfor men andwomen. The planprovides the legal basis for the implementation of
labor market reforms. Building on the provisioiis of the employment plan, the fiamework for
labor market policies has been strengthened and the institutional capacity of the agencies



                                              -26-

responsible for drafting and implementing labor policies has been consolidated. Expenditure on
active labor market policies has increased and so did the effectiveness of the interventions. The
government now plans to introduce measures to enhance the flexibility of the labor market to
facilitate labor mobility that will ease enterprise privatization and restructuring and sectoral
reforms. Initial steps inthis direction will include revision of the Labor Code to reduce the costs
of hiring and dismissal, with a view to stimulating sustainable job creation, and eliminating
unnecessary labor costs and improving competitiveness. A broader set of labor market reforms is
envisaged over the medium term, in line with the objectives of the employment plan. These will
involve additional legislative, policy and institutional changes in areas affecting labor market
flexibility and competitiveness, includingthose related to unemployment insurance and pensions.

CapitalMarketReforms

46.      As part of its strategy to foster develapment of the private sector, the Government is
implementing a comprehensive program of reform of capital markets and non-bank
financial institutions (NBFIs). The Government considers that the development of capital
markets and NBFIs will play a critical role in financial sector deepening and diversification,
offering new options for savings mobilizatioii by households, broadening access to private
finance for investment by the central and local governments and private firms, and transferring
risks to those economic agents that are best able to manage them. This will be key to achieving
successful integration within the EU single financial market and to efficiently absorbing EU
ISPA and structural funds as an integral part of Romania's EUaccessionstrategy.

47.      The Government's program in this area rests on three fundamental elements: (i)
strengthening the market legal and regulatory framework, focusing in particular on securities
markets, mutual and private equity funds (including SIFs), pension funds, insurance, mortgage
markets, and leasing; (ii) strengthening the capacity of market supervisory agencies, focusing on
the securities exchange commission (CNVM), the insurance supervisory agency, and the pension
supervision entity to be created; and (iii)deepening capital markets through market-based
enhancement instruments, focusing on the local government bond market and on the mortgage
insurance market. With these steps the Government seeks to establish more efficient and more
diversified securities markets and NBFIs; transparent regulation of SIFs as regular private equity
funds; growing corporate bond market to finance investments by mediumand large enterprises;
stability of local public finances and sustainable local public debt; more transparent securities
markets and investment funds; growing and transparent insurance markets; a sound market for
mortgage securities; and increasedtransparency of capital markets andNBFIs.

48.      This PAL is one of a series of three a ustment operations. The current loan is the
first of these and is expected to be followed by two further loans which would be completed in
the next CAS programming cycle prior to Romania's anticipated accession to the EU. The full
details of the PAL 1 conditions as well as the triggers for PALS2 and 3 are specified in the
Policy Matrix and the Government's Letter of Development Policy which are attached as

C.2 Themes and Objectives

49.     The PAL program reflects the Government's overarching objectives of establishing
solid economic growth, reducing poverty and joining the European Union. These objectives
will be addressed by focusing on five key, crass-cutting themes: establishing public sector
accountability; instilling financial discipline; instituting regulatory reforms; following good
social and environment risk managementpractices; and ensuring property rights. The program i s
divided into two parts. The first part focuses           011 reforming core public sector institutions and
processes. The second targets the public-private interface and regulation of markets. Within
each part are program components which are related to the cross-cutting themes in an
interlocking and complementary fashion as shown in Table 4 below. For instance, privatization
contributes to financial discipline and regulatory reform. Moreover, each theme is supported by
several components as, for example, financial discipline is supported by improved public
expenditure managementpractices and the energy sector reforms.

C.3 Links to PreviousAdjustment Operations

50.     The PAL program provides continuity with the previous Private Sector Adjustment
Loans 1and 2 by ensuring sustained progress on the structural reforms begun under those
operations. The two PSAL programs had provisions for dealing with many large loss-making
industrial enterprises including the privatization of two large steel operations, two aluminum
enterprises, two major vehicle manufacturers and the large petroleum and gas enterprise Petrom.
The privatization agency APAPS sold or closed and liquidated a significant portion of its
portfolio of failing enterprises. At the same time money-financed directed lending through the
banking sector was ended and the large loss-making bank Banca Agricola was closed.



                                                     -28-

Nevertheless, there remains a block of loss-makers that are the source o f large quasi-fiscal
deficits and arrears to state budget and to other enterprises. Table 5 shows how these and other
the PSAL legacy issues will be will be handled under the PAL program. The remaining SOEs,
many of which are in the energy sector, will be sold or liquidated and the subsidies and arrears
will be reduced. Miningoperations which are non-viable will be closed and remaining mines put
on a sound financial footing. Similarly, the state presence in the banking sector will be ended
with the sale of a majority in BCR stake to a strategic investor and the privatization o f the last
remaining state bank CEC.

5 1.     Some components of the PSAL programs were finished more quickly than expected
and a few will only will be fully completed under the PAL. The privatization sales o f Petrom
and BCR took longer than expected. The sales agreement for Petrom was not signed until July
2004 and was the principle reason for the delay in the closure of PSAL 2. This was partly a
matter of gathering political will but some lags were related to the mechanics of privatization as
well as lack of clarity about land ownership. Other energy sector privatizations also took longer
than anticipated. A key factor here was the need to address the need for tariff and regulatory
policy changes in advance of the privatization sales as was the case with the gas and electricity
company privatizations This has lead to a different approach in the PAL program which gives
much greater prominence to development of sector strategies for including pricing, tariffs and
regulation. Gas and electricity prices change schedules have been agreed and publicly announced
as part of PAL. This was necessary to get the PSAL 2 program completed and will facilitate
subsequent privatizations. Another difficult area concerns collection rates for electricity and
partly reflects the setting of a very high target collection rate. Collections for district heating
however, lagged considerably reflecting the need for a more comprehensive strategy for reform.
Much of the capital stock in district heating very old, inefficient and high cost. Simply raising
tariffs to cost recovery levels and trying to enforce collections is not an appropriate approach.
The need for a broader policy context and strategic approach has therefore been incorporated in
the designof the PAL. Miningsector reforms were notpart of the core conditionality of PSAL 2
the progress made under PSAL 1was not maintained. The strategydevelopedwith Bank support
during PSAL 2 was never adopted by the government and subsidies and losses actually
increased. The program has been strengthened under PAL. Under PAL 1the program has been
adopted by the government and publishedand includes specific mine closures subsidy and loss
reductions reflected inthe triggers for PAL 2.

52.      Privatizations lagged initially but then accelerated in the latter part of PSAL 2. Lack
of commitment was initially a factor but there was also a learning curve for the APAPS and the
MEC, particularly for the privatization o f larger and more complex companies. There was a
realization of the importance of using privatizationadvisors effectively and having appropriately
formulated accounts to facilitate due diligence. These lessons have been learned and will mal&
future privatizations easier. Towards the end of PSAL 2 an increasing number of privatized
enterprises reverted to the APAPS portfolio when new owners failed to meet certain conditions
of the privatization sales. These bounce-back firms were not subject to specific PSAL 2
conditionality but provision has been made to cover them in the PAL. There might have been
faster progress in reducing the number of SOEs if bankruptcy proceedings were invoked more
readily. The Bankruptcy law has been revised and further revisions may be introduced in later
PALS.

53.      Several elements of the PSAL programs such as the liquidation of Bankorex went
faster than expected. The unbundling of the power sector companies well in advance o f the
privatization also happenedrelatively early and has yet to happen in some other countries o f the
region. Similarly the adoption of the Minimum Income Guaranteed program was regarded as a
successfuland effective component ofthe program for poverty alleviation.

54.      While completing this important structural reform agenda, PAL introduces a new
set of phased public sector and regulatory reforms that emphasize institutional
development and effective implementation. These new areas include: reform of the court


                                               -30-

system and thejudiciary; reform of the civil service through amendment of the civil service law
and establishment of performance monitoring, pay, grading and promotion systems;
enhancement o f policy formulation processes; strengthening of transparency and governance
instruments including the Law on Declaration of Assets and Gifts for politicians and high civil
servants as well as the Law on Conflicts of Interest. Intandem with the progressive energy sector
privatization program, the PAL provides for reforms in the regulation of markets for natural gas
district heating, and electricity. Further regulatory reforms are projected for labor markets,
capital markets (including the regulatory framework for SIF equity funds), for pension and
insurance supervision and for mortgage markets.

55.     These are areas in which Romania lags other recent EU accession countries and in
which the Bank has comparative advantage in providing assistance. Reform of the judiciary
and the courts has been repeatedly been flagged by the EU as an area in which Romania must
catch up and it remains one of the few chapters of the acquis that Romania has not yet closed.
The Bank conducted a Diagnostic Review of the Legal and Judicial System which laid the
ground for a policy dialogue on judicial reform, and was extensively used by the Government
while developing its Judicial Reform Strategy off 2003. Administrative reforms for the civil
service and policy formulation have been challenging for Romania. These are not areas that are
directly covered by the acquis. However, they lie at the heart of the problems of implementation
capacity that affect a broad range of government and are consequently o f concern to the EC.
Bank expertise stemming from experience with other countries in the region is contributing to a
joint support effort. The newly established Public Policy Unit in the office of the Secretary
General of Government was set up largely along lines advocated by the PAL team in
consultation with advisors from DFID. Technical assistance to deepen capacity is being
mobilized from the U.K., the European Union and the Bank to aid in these reforms, under terms
of reference developedjointly by the EC, the Bank and DFID.

56.     Romania scores at the low end of most surveys of transparency and anti-corruption.
For example, the value of Transparency International's annual Corruption Perception Index for
Romania, has been since 1996 consistently well below the average for the CEEC-10 and in2003
its value was 35 percent below the average for the CEEC-10. This i s mirrored in the Bank's
Governance Matters I11 indices for Eastern Europe (2002). Romania's index for control of
corruption was lower than those for all of the CEEC-8 as well as Bulgaria and Croatia. The Bank
supported the Diagnostic Corruption Survey (2002) which was used in formulation of the Anti
Corruption and Governance legislation in2003. The Bank engagedthe authorities in dialogue on
subsequent revisions to the law on the declaration of assets and on changes proposed for the law
on conflict of interest and on gifts. While individual country standards and laws in these areas
vary widely, evenwith inthe EU, the Bank is inapositionto give advice on best practices.

57.     The EBRD transition indicator for enterprise reform in Romania in 2003 was 2.0 (
maximum 5). This is 1.2 points lower than the average for CEEC-8, the largest difference
of any of the nine EBRD indicators. Much of this is accounted for by the energy sector,
underscoring the need for the Bank to stay engaged in this sector. In addition to supporting the
further privatization efforts, the Bank is able to advise on a variety of technical matters including
evaluation of municipal plans for restructuring district heating, the introduction o f metering and
two-par tariffs and alignment of hydro and thermal pricing. This will help guide the authorities




                                                -3 1-

and will also being used by the IMF in setting benchmarks and structural policy conditions in
their SBA program.

58.     Reforms in the capital and labor markets are needed to help establish a functioning
market economy. Romania didnot meet this part of the Copenhagen criteria that was metby all
the recent accession countries as well as Romania's regional peers Bulgaria and Croatia. Inthis
connection the 2003 regular report specifically notes that although a new labor code was
introduced in 2003 there is a need to reduce rigidities in the labor market including restrictive
conditions for fixed term contracts, procedures for individual dismissals, and a centralized
bargaining system that prevents appropriate wage adjustment. The Bank is able to support the
introduction of necessary legislative changes through focused technical assistance that it i s
providing on labor market conditions and reform impact, and it has been able to help the
authorities establish the consultative framework necessary to build support for reforms among
stakeholders.

59.     The PAL is supported with a substantial technical assistance program. The PAL
program, especially the newer public sector and regulatory components will require technical
assistance to underpin the necessary institutional-building activities. In close cooperation with
the authorities, $10.7 million has beenprogrammed for this purpose usingthe Public and Private
Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) as well as funds available under a Bank-administered Dutch
grant. These T A activities cover virtually all program components with major blocks devoted to
public expenditure management, judicial reform, policy making and transparency, privatization.
A complete listingofthese T A activities byPALprogram component is providedinAnnex 8.

C.4 Links to Other Bank Programs and the Programs of other Donors

60.     The PAL has close links to other Bank activities. Recent AAA has had a important role
in shaping the PAL program. For instance the PEIR completed in late 2002 provided policy
analysis on public expenditure management, pension reform, resource allocation in the health
sector and an innovative chapter on reforming the budget process in the judiciary. Similarly the
CFAA completed in late 2003 gave further specific recommendations on PEM reforms. Other
AAA usedinpreparingthe PAL included the DiacgnosticSurveys of CorruptioninRomania done
in 2000 covering households, enterprise nianagers and public officials, and the report
Understanding Public Sector Performance inTransition Countries Romania Slovakia and Kyrgyz
Republic, the Financial Sector Assessment Program done jointly with the IMF, and the Country
Economic Memorandum, both completed in FY03. Future supporting AAA that will feed into
the downstream PALSincludes work on Public Expenditure Management in FY05, a CPAR in
FY06 and a PER in FY 07. The PAL also has mutually reinforcing links to existing and future
lending operations. In the HD sectors the PAL focuses primarily on public expenditure
management issues, and benefits from ongoing projects such as the Health Sector Reform APL
(which includes work on hospital rationalization) and the Rural Education Project the Electricity
Market Project, and APL for development o f the South Eastern European Regional Electricity
Market, and investmentprojects for district heating and railroads. A detailed list o f the Bank's
related AAA and lendingactivities is providedby PALprogram component inAnnex 9.

61.     The Bank has had extensive dialogue with the multilateral and bilateral donors and
with the European Commission. The objecttive has been to ensure that policy positions and



                                                -52-

advice are well coordinated and to ensure that supporting technical assistance resources are
utilized in an effective manner at reasonablecounterpart funding cost to the GOR. The Bank has
worked very closely with the EC on policy conditionality and TA. Drafts o f the PAL
documentation have been shared with the EC from the outset and incorporate their comments. A
detailed list of the relevant activities of the other donors is provided by PALprogram component
also appears in Annex 9. Main features of this include the joint efforts in the areas of Civil
Service Reform andPolicy Formulation where the Bank, the EC, EUPhare, US Aid, and the UK
all have T A activities. Coordination has been effected through joint funding arrangements and
through trilateral dialogue with the client as inthe case of establishment of agreed sets of CS and
policy formulation monitoring and performance indicators. Extensive coordination efforts have
been made in other elements o f the PAL program including the energy sector where the EU is
providing TA to the gas and electricity regulators, and the EU, the EBRD and US Aid are
hndingprivatizationadvisors for severalof the energy companiesthat are to beprivatizedusing
transparentprocess under the PAL.

C.5 Cooperationwith IMF

62.     The IMP completed a Standby Agreement (SBA) with the conclusion of its fourth
Review on October3,2003, andit approved a mew PrecautionarySBA on July 7,2004. The
authorities want the SBA in order to ensure that the macroeconomic environment remains stable
and to send a positive signal to the international community and financial markets. The SBA is
precautionary and will not be drawn upon unless needed. At current levels of foreign exchange
reserves and external debt, the need to use the Fund's short term resources in unlikely. At the
same time the Bank's plannedlendingprogram is increasing. This reflects the fact that the Bank
program is for medium to longer term projects and reforms. The Bank is helping to meet
infrastructure requirements of EU accession particularly in roads, rail, and energy. District
heating reforms and miningclosures are also longer term challenges. Similarly, the institutional
and governance reforms in health, education and public administration that the Bank program is
supporting will last untilaccessionand beyond.

63. ' An Ex-Post Assessment of Fund Programs in Romania (EPA) was passed by the
IMF Boardin April 2004. It included recommendations, endorsedby the Board, that the new
SBA include strong up-front prior actions and benchmarks in structural areas and that the
program runfor 24 months. This means that the pattern establishedunder the previous SBAs and

(2.6 CountryAssistance Strategy Update

64.       The World Bank has been active in Romania since 1991and has built up a portfolio
of 40 Bank-financed operations with total commitments of US$4.0 billion. Romania's
portfolio is the fourth largest in ECA in terms o f number o f projects and the fourth largest in
terms o f commitments. The active portfolio as off June 30, 2004 consists o f 20 projects with
aggregate net commitments totaling US$1,333.7 million and a total undisbursed balance o f
$894.2 million. Sector composition in terms of net commitments is dominated by energy and
infrastructure (42 percent, seven projects) and the social sectors (15 percent, four projects).

65.       The performance of the active portfdio of 24 projects* under implementation
continues to be satisfactory. Performance has been satisfactory overall since 2000, with few
unsatisfactory projects. With the exception o f the Rural Development Project, all unsatisfactory
projects have been in problem status for relatively short periods o f time, as proactive measures
were taken and issues resolved over time. Commitments at risk are currently 9.1 percent. The
disbursement ratio at end FY04 was 18.1 percent, higher than the overall ratio for ECA. Both
the realism and pro-activity indices are 100 percent, indicating a sound and robust approach to
portfolio management.              Portfolio management efforts have intensified recently with the
introduction o f quarterly reports on actions agreed with the government duringthe JPR

66.       A new Country Assistance Strategy will be prepared in the second half of calendar
year 2005 and will cover FY06-08. Parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for
November this year. While the most recent CAS was for the FY02-04 period it seems
appropriate to delay the preparation and issuance o f the next CAS in order to allow time for the
newly elected officials and their staffs to settle in and become familiar with their assignments as
well as with Bank programs. Consequently this section o f the Program Document constitutes an
update o f the last CAS for the intervening period and proposes an interim lending program for
FY05 untilthe new CAS can be finalized.

Reforms to Date

67.       The 2002-2004 CAS focused op three main themes in support of Romania's
overarching objective of EU accession: (a) targeted poverty interventions in the delivery o f
key social and infrastructure services, especially in rural areas; (b) laying the policy and
regulatory framework for the private sector-led growth necessary to sustain the poverty reduction
efforts; and (c) support for institution building and governance reform aimed at breaking key
constraints to private sector-led growth.

68.       Macroeconomic developments have met or exceeded expectations. GDP growth was
sharply higher than anticipated early in the CAS period and has generally held to targets
thereafter. Tax revenues have consistently exceeded the IMF forecasts, budget deficits have been
less than projected, and export growth, especially into the EU has been surprisingly strong
despite the relatively weak economic performance of the EU economies through the period.
Monetary, inflation and exchange rate developments have all been satisfactory, enabling the IMF
to complete its Standby Agreement in October 2003 and launch a new one in July o f this year.


* The portfolioincludes four GEF projects and a PCF.

As in most other Eastern European transition economies, the current account deficit increased
more than anticipated, inpart becauseof the robust growth and increasesinprivate sector credit.
External debt is also higher than projected but poses no serious threat at current levels.

69.     Strong growth is largely responsible recluctions in overall poverty rates. Much of the
poverty in Romania is also fairly shallow and hence can be mitigated by economic growth.
However, some challenges remain as there are packets of deep povertywhich have provento be
immune to general economic growth. Such pockets importantly include many rural areas, small
towns, and ethnically excluded groups, especially Roma.

70.     Reform progress has been significant and has accelerated over the CAS period.
PSAL 1and 2 had a substantial structural reformagendafocusing largely onprivatization and on
restructuring inthe energy sector. Inaddition the CAS called for financial sector reforms and for
initial steps the area of governance and institutional reform. The successes inthese areas enabled
Romania to remain inthe highcase scenario as outlined inTable 6.

Overall Performance and Lessons Learned

71.     The conditions for high case were substantially met. However, as noted in Table 7,
with respectto energy sector arrears reduction, collection for district heating is lagging and there
is a small shortfall in electricity collections. 111 addition, the privatization of 100% of the gas
distribution sector is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed in October. The
actions under the PSAL 2 program took longer to complete than was anticipated under the CAS
with the result that PAL 1 was not completed in the FY 02-04 period. Key lessons learned
include the following:

    0   There is a need to addressthe need for tarifff and regulatory policy changes inadvance of
        the privatization sales as was the case with the gas and electricity company privatizations.
    0   Collectionrate targets for electricity were set very high.
    0   Lags incollection rates indistrict heating reflect a the need for a more comprehensive
        strategy for reform. Much of the capital sttack indistrict heating very old, inefficient and
        high cost. Simply raising tariffs to cost recovery levels and trying to enforce collections is
        not an appropriate approach.
    0   Long delays inthe privatization of Petrorn were initially attributable to a lack of political
        will andto lags related to the mechanics ofprivatization andto lack of clarity about land
        ownership.

72.     These lessons have shaped the approach in the PAL program. The PAL gives much
greater prominence to development of sector strategies and setting of pricing, tariffs and
regulation. Gas and electricity price change schedules have been agreed, publicly announced and
the first rounds of increases introduced. Under the PAL a detailed district heating strategy has
been developed and the gas distribution companies sales contracts have been signed. The sales
contract for Petrom has now been signed.

73.     Privatization targets for other firms were all met. Initial slowness may have reflected
a lack of commitment but there was also a learning curve for the APAPS and the MEC,
particularly for the privatizationof larger and more complex companies. There was a realization
of the importance of usingprivatizationadvisors efffectively and having appropriately formulated
accounts to facilitate due diligence. These lessons have been learned and will make future
privatizations easier. The PAL program includes provision for offering further companies for
sale and meeting targets for privatization sales set in terms of numbers of employees. Towards
the end of PSAL 2 an increasing number of privatizedenterprises were revertingto the APAPS
portfolio when new owners failed to meet certain conditions of the privatization sales. These
bounce-back firms were not subject to specific PSAL 2 conditionality but provision has been
made to cover them inthe PAL.

74.     In the financial sector the high case actions were all undertaken. But while the
privatization advisor for CEC Bank was hired, the progress towards actual sale has been slow.
Offering BCR to a strategic investor was not listed as one of the high case actions, but it was a
central part of the PSAL2 program and proveddifficult. Requests for expressions of interest had
to be issued twice. Some expressions of interest were rejected in the first round because they
were put forward by consortia that included state banks. Some potential bidders may have
concluded the authorities were not committed to selling. This, and a general decline in market


                                                -37-

conditions resulted in the failure o f the second request for expressions o f interest and the
subsequent involvement o f IFC and EBRD as an interim step towards finding a strategic
investor.   Nonetheless, in view o f the importance o f finalization o f the bank privatization
program, PAL-2 has benchmarks relating to completion o f sales. In addition, in the context o f
the PALprogram, the Bank, in conjunction with tlhe IMF, will continue to support strengthening
of banking supervision and monitor performance of banks.

75.     The governance and institutional reform actions were also taken. What was
envisaged in the last CAS was the first steps irm a longer term process that would be more fully
developed in the next CAS period. The P A L program now builds on this base with a focus on
judicial and civil service reforms, introduction o f a new policy formulation component and
further refinements of the anti corruption legislation and the equalization formula.

76.     There was a very evident shift in the commitment of the authorities towards the end
of 2003. A key factor in this positive development was a hardening o f the stance o f the EC as
regards accession. The failure to gain the ``functioning market economy" status in the fall 2003
Regular Report was an early signal to the authorities. The subsequent messages delivered by the
Commissioner Verheugen regarding the need far serious reform were unmistakable. A second
factor was the high degree o f coincidence o f opinion about the nature o f reforms needed and
recommended by the Bank, the Fund, the EC and the bilateral donors, which left little room for
further debate or delay. Finally, there was the urgency that the authorities felt about closing the
PSAL 2 program and the SBA and launching the next Bank and Fund programs before the
elections, and the 2004 Regular Report.

77.     The last two Governments of Romania have made very substantial progress
addressing problems, but in sequential manner which is likely to continue.                There are
roughly three slightly overlapping periods to consider. The first period followed the sharp
contraction o f 1997-99 which convinced the authorities o f the necessity o f addressing the serious
macroeconomic problems through a sharp tightening o f fiscal and monetary policies, a
substantial nominal depreciation and closurekale o f the large loss-making state banks. The
second period embraced the structural reforms of the PSAL 1and PSAL 2 programs. As with the
first period reforms, it took some time for the authorities to recognize and react to the reform
needs, but they have now done so - mostly from mid-2003 on. Looking forward it is clear that
institutional and governance reforms are the next and final wave. There may again be a
recognition and reaction lag, and these challenges have intrinsically longer implementation
times. Structural reforms will continue. Among these are a few for which greater progress had
been expected by June 31, 2004 when the last CAS expired. These include completion of the
sales o f BCR, CEC Bank, Petrom and the gas distribution companies as well as more
fundamental reform o f the district heating and miningsectors.

 78.    Other lessons have been learned during the last CAS period. First, close cooperation
with the IMF and EC has been, and will continue to be, critical to success of the Bank's overall
program. Second, the poverty reducing effects o f general economic growth need to be
 supplemented by special measures targeted on tlhe pockets o f deeper poverty. Third, in pursuing
EU accession, the Government has displayed a tendency to formulate and adopt legislation too
quickly and without adequate consultation, strategic vision and consideration o f implementation
issues. This is generally not because o f specific demands made by the EC, but it highlights the



                                               -38-

need for both close collaboration between the              ank, the EC, the IMF and other partners in
matters ofpolicy formulation, as well as the need for greater focus on implementation.

TheLendingProgram over the Medium Term

79.     The lending program has been planned on the basis of targeting areas in which Romania
needs to catch up to other accession countries and by identifying how the Bank can best
complement the programs of other development partners including the EU, the IMF and the
bilateral donors. As discussed above, the main catch-up areas include: structural reforms in
energy (particularly district heating) and mining; institutional and governance reforms in the
judiciary and public administration, and infrastructure development needed for EU accession.
The program outlined below focuses on these wihile exploiting areas in which the Bank has
comparative advantage in delivering support. This involves a doubling of the envisaged lending
in FY05 ($690 million relative to $300-$350 million per year under the expired CAS and an
average $335 million in the 1990s). Such an increase is justified because of the acceleration of
reforms in the last year which has taken Romania to the high case o f the CAS. Moreover, as can
be seen from Table 8, there is strong commitment in all these areas and a limited number of
actions still pending (last column).

80.     The proposed FY05 program is designed to support EU accession through
sustaining and accelerating the reform process. The EBRD transition indicators presented in
Figure 7 above suggest that Romania has lagged other accession countries in making structural
reforms. While the data may not capture the most recent spurt of reforms, it is clear that strong
support from the Bank the over the medium term will be needed to complete this process.
Particular focus over the next CAS period will be needed in the energy sector to achieve the full
market liberalization requiredby the EU. This will be done in close cooperation with the IMF.
As in the past, the Bank's assistance and technical expertise in framing the medium term
objectives will be complemented by shorter interval Fund conditionality and quarterly
benchmarks. Inaddition to the energy sector conditionalityinthe PAL the mediumterm program
includes provision of a partial risk guarantee: in support of the privatization of electricity
distribution as well as an Energy Community of Southeast Europe Project. To achieve the
functioning market economy status and to withstand the economic pressures of integration into
the EU market, Romania needs the support off the PAL program in areas relating to the
improvement of the business environment, labor and capital' including development of the debt
market, pensions and mining sector reform. The mining sector reforms will be supported by a
Mine Closure Project that among other things responds to the concerns about the persistent
pockets of poverty. While the acquis is relatively silent on specifics of policy formulation,
judicial reform and transparency mechanisms, the EC has been preoccupied with issues o f
governance and anti-corruption. These are areas in which the Bank is uniquely well positioned
to assist.




 The PAL. has a component on capital markets that deals with NBFIs.

82.     The proposed FY05 lendingprogramisambitious.             The project milestone dates in
Table 8 above are all concentrated in the firsthalffof FY05. These dates are indicative and itis
possible thatsome of them may slip intothe latter half ofFY05. The election willbe demanding
of the leadership's time and the fall session of Parliament will be shorter than usual. Lending
operations require Parliamentary ratification. However, as indicated in the final column of the
table, the need for government actions, especially thosethat require legislation and substantive
debate, is limited.TheModernizingAgricultureKnowledgeandInformationSystemsProject;
and the PartialRisk Guarantee areat a sufficiently advancedstateof developmentthat it should
be possible for them tobe ratified by thecurrentparliament. Thereis a good prospect that either
the Knowledge Economy projector the Health Reform project, or both, canbe negotiated before
the election. These projects would likely have to be ratified by the new parliament inor around
March 2005, with the Board consideration priorto July 1,2005.

Political Risks

84.      The elections in the fall present some political risks. There i s always a risk that
election pressures undermine the resolve o f the leadership to stick to necessary, but politically
difficult reforms. The temptation for the current ruling party (PSD) may be greater as they did
unexpectedly poorly in the local elections in May. These risks, however, are mitigated by a
number o f factors. One area o f risk i s that the authorities approve unplanned increases in
expenditures, which would be most likely in respect o f pensions, public sector wages or ad hoc,
one-off investment projects. However, these are closely monitored by the IMF in its quarterly
reviews, and they have been the subject o f several joint (BanWFund) communications to the
authorities. A second area o f risk concerns back-tracking on structural reform commitments.
However, this i s mitigated by the fact that both the Bank and the Fund have insisted that these
commitments be pre-announced. Planned privatization sales, gas price increases, electricity tariff
adjustments, mine closures and layoffs, and most o f the other measures that are to be taken over
the medium term have all been made public. The government has, to a large extent, already
borne the political cost o f these things. Finally, there is a reform momentum associated with
much o f the structural change agenda. Privatization advisors have been contracted, the sales have
been advertised, tariff adjustment schedules needed in order to sell network utilities have been
confirmed to prospective buyers and due diligence procedures are underway. Nothing o f course
i s totally irreversible, but mechanisms for most of the reforms expected between now and the
elections, and beyond, have already been set inmotion.

85.      Some post-election political risks exist as well. The election results may well be close
and this creates uncertainty. Ifthe ruling party wins again, it would be reasonable to expect that
reforms would continue as planned and at a similar pace. However, the most likely alternative to
the PSD would be a coalition o f two parties that are known to be reform-oriented, and committed
to EUaccession goals. Either way the risk to the PAL 1program is minimal. For the investment
operations, these are built on sound technical basis and there i s a broad and deep ownership. If
PSD wins there will be minimal disruption. Lf there were a change in government there is a
likelihood of delays since the new government may require clarifications on the concept, scope,
etc. However, continuity will be maintained at the technical level - the civil servants that the
Bank team deals with. Another mitigating factor is the fact that the projects reflect EUpriorities
and do not serve any political constituencies o f the PSD government.

86.      OED will evaluate the impact of           ank programs and the Country Assistance
Evaluation will be an importantinput to the preparation of the full CAS. A QAG review o f
the current portfolio vis-&-vis the CAS objectives has been commissioned, and the results are
expected shortly.

External Financing, Creditworthinessand Bank's Exposure Management

87.      Romania's external financing requirements are expected to increase over the period
2004-06. Under the assumption o f sustained economic growth, the external financing needs,
including a build-up in forex reserves, would expand from around US$7.0 billion currently to
over US$9.1 billion in 2006. This dynamic assumes improved access o f Romania to the private
international capital markets.      Significant progress in structural reforms, including the
acceleration o f privatization, especially in the energy sector, and the improvement in the

functioning o f the business environment are expected to lead to a significant increase in annual
FDI inflows, which could expand by over 30 percent by 2006. This would contribute
substantially to financing the current account deficit, which is likely to remain above 5 percent
of GDP over the period 2004-06. Romania should also benefit from increased EU grant
financing support (Phare, ISPA, Sapard), although absorption capacity remains limited.

88.     Creditworthiness of the country has improved significantly in the last years. Total
external debt outstanding and disbursed is projected to increase from around US$19.6 billion
currently to around US$27.8 billion at the end of 2006. However, as economic growth would
continue to remain robust, the ratio of total external debt to GDP is expected to fluctuate between
around 33-36 percent by 2006. During this period, total debt service is likely to grow moderately
to around US$4.7 billion per year in 2006. In the absence of substantial adverse shocks to the
economy, no servicing problems are envisaged for the country's foreign debt obligations.
Official reserves have reached record highs and represent around 3.5 months of imports, while
short term debt is only around 3 percent of the total debt outstanding and disbursed, limiting the
country's vulnerability to unexpected reverses i a i capital flows. As domestic interest rates are on
a downward trend, the Government's intention is to resort to larger extent than in the past to
domestic savings to finance the fiscal deficit, wliich should reduce the need to seek external
capital. However, the public sector remains outsized and subsidies and arrears of SOEs,
particularly those in the energy sector, transportation and mining, continue to place a significant
drain on public resources. Elections later this year could test both stabilization policy and
credibility of Romania's commitment to meet the EU accession deadline of 2007. Even if the
government can resist political pressures and accelerate reforms sufficient to gain EU entry on
schedule, Romania will continue to face enomiaus structural, social and political challenges for
many years. Hence, despite positive recent progress in some areas, a longer track record o f
sustained economic and political stability will be needed to consolidate a more favorable
assessment of Romania's creditworthiness.

89.      The Bank's exposure to Romania should remain manageable but downside risks
still exist. The Bank remains the largest creditor to Romania, accounting for about 12.8 percent
o f the total debt outstanding and 10.6 percent of the public and publicly guaranteed debt service
at the end o f 2003. Because o f the major role the IFIs played as lenders o f last resort in
Romania's external financing in the late nineties, given the country's constrained access to
capital markets at the time, preferred creditors still account for a relatively highpercentage o f the
public and publicly guaranteed debt service. However, as the ability of Romania and Romanian
companies to raise public and private debt on the international markets at a reasonable cost
continues to improve, the share o f the public and publicly guaranteed debt in total debt (now
around 62 percent) i s not expected to increase, despite the large financing requirements to meet
EU accession standards, such as for infrastructure and environment. Consequently, even if the
Bank continues to remain engaged on a significant scale in the reform process in Romania, its
relative exposure, as defined by the standard benchmarks, will remain below the guideline
thresholds. Debt service to IBRD is projected ta remain stable at around 1.0-1.1 percent o f
exports, andincrease slightly from around 11percent in2003 to 13 percent in2006 o f the public
and publicly guaranteed debt service (as other preferred creditors such as the IMF disengage
faster). The ratio o f preferred creditor debt service to public debt service i s expected to slightly
increase to 32.7 percent in 2006. The IBRD's share in total debt outstanding will continue to
steadily decrease from around 13 percent in 2003 to around 9.6 percent in 2006. However a
downside scenario could emerge from failure to contain expenditures in the period before the
election causing the IMF SBA program to fail. This combined with backtracking on the
privatization or failure to gain the functioning market economy status from the EU could shake
investor confidence causing FDI to fall and lending spreads to increase. Slowing o f structural
reforms could jeopardize the fiscal position and reverse the disinflation process further
undermining confidence. In addition continued health o f the financial sector could be weakened
by ongoing rapid credit growth. While this downside scenario is unlikely to emerge and would
probably not result in loss of access to external financing, it needs to be considered in light o f the
pressure it would put on Bank exposure and preferred creditor exposure ingeneral.

C.7 ImplementationandMonitoring

90.      A Superior Council on Public Policies and Structural Adjustment (SCPPSA) has
been constitutedfor implementationand monitoringof the PAL program. Itmet in its first
full session with the main members of the PAL team and a representative o f the EC on
December 2,2003 and is expected to meet regularly through the PALperiod. The Prime Minister
acts as President and there are three cabinet level Vice Presidents (Minister o f Public Finance,



                                                -44-

Minister of Administration and Interior, and General Secretary of Government). This body will
have oversight as well of the related activities itz public administration reform supportedby the
EU, an arrangement which will ensure appropriate coordination of PAL and EUprograms. The
General Secretary of Government will have special responsibilities for PAL implementation in a
manner that anticipates the fuller development of the GSG's office as the entity responsible for
the policy formulation function within government. A Public Policy Unit has been formed as a
permanent body in the GSG's office for this purpose. Inaddition a PAL implementation unit has
been established with funding from the Public: and Private Institution Building Loan to assist
with the day-to-day monitoring of PAL activities and will exist for the duration of the PAL
program.

91.    The PAL program is supported by several poverty and social impact assessment
(PSIA) activities. A Poverty Assessment was completed last year establishing a baseline for
poverty measures. Then an initial assessment was made inthe fall of 2003 of the likely impact of
gas price increases on lower income families. This study will be repeatedwith more recent data
during 2004. Ongoing work under the health sector APL, the Mining Sector Social Mitigation
Project and its successor operation, and the Jiu Valley Project will give further analysis o f the
impact of PAL policy reforms. Candidates for fiirther PSIA work in support of the PALSinclude
impact of remaining privatizations and mineclosures and the impact of pension and health sector
reforms.

92.    During the course of the three PALS the government will produce quarterly
progress reports. These will provide information on the status of implementation of each of the
PAL conditions and triggers as well as tracking performance on a set of indicators. The
indicators which are shown in Annex 10 below are intended to show the progress that the PAL
program is having in producing desirable outcomes in each of the program components. These
reports will be produced quarterly by the PAL,Implementation Unit and will include updates of
the information inAnnex 10.

C.8 LoanAdministration

93.    Borrower and Loan Amount. The proposedPAL 1will have a loan amount of US$l50
million equivalent to be disbursed in Euro to be made to the Government of Romania,
representedby the Ministry of Public Finance. The loan will be a single tranche, variable spread
loan with a 17 year maturity including a grace period of 5 years.

94.    Disbursement. In accordance with the February 8, 1996 Operational Directive on the
Simplification of Disbursement Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sectoral Adjustment
Loans, funds disbursedunder the proposed PAL, 11 will be released against satisfactory progress
inthe reforms set forth inthe loan. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, thus
evidence will not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement requirements be
necessary. Upon approval of the loan and notification by Bank of loan effectiveness, the
government will submit a withdrawal application.         The Ministry of Finance will open and
maintain a Deposit Account in the National Bank of Romania NBR. IBRD will deposit the
proceeds of the loan into this Deposit Account at the request of the Ministry of Finance. Ifafter
the loan proceeds are deposited in the NBR account, the proceeds are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD will require the borrower to either: (a) return



                                               -45-

that amount to the Deposit Account for use for eligible purposes or (b) refund the amount
directly to IBRD.

95.      Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provisions o f the Loan Agreement.          Such accounts and records will be
maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank. An audit o f the Deposit Account will be carried
out by an external independent auditor acceptable to the Bank to provide assurance on the
compliance with specific Bank requirements regarding the maintenance and use o f the Deposit
Account. The audit will be carried out inaccordance with terms o f reference that were agreed at
negotiations and will require both an audit opinion and a separate management letter concerning
any material weaknesses in accounting and internal control systems that come to the auditor's
attention.  A format for the report o f the sources and uses of funds from the Deposit Account is
to the Loan Agreement. The audit o f the Deposit! Account for the period ending December 31,
2004 would be completed and the audit report submitted to the Bank by April 30,2005.

96.      Environmental Impact. The environmental classification is U which means that
OD8.60 applies and an assessment o f environmental policies and practices is recommended
(although not required).   The EU requires EA systems that meet its standards and this will
provide substantial impetus to government efforts to improve their systems. However it i s clear
that at present Romania i s short o f the EU requirements. Accordingly environmental ESW is
planned in FY06, the objectives of which are to: (a) evaluate the rules, procedures and
institutions for environment and social assessment relating to public investment decisions in
Romania, (b) assess the conformity o f these with Bank and EU requirements for environmental
and social safeguards and (c) make recommendation o f the changes needed to arrive at a stage
where the national practice inthese areas would be acceptable to the Bank.

97.      Compliancewith BankPolicies. The loan complies with all applicable Bankpolicies.



C.9 Risksand Benefits

98.      Benefits First, the proposed PAL supports the Government's economic program to
achieve sustained growth, reduce poverty and progress towards EU accession.            Second it
provides incentives to complete the process o f structural reform begun under the PSALs. Third,
in conjunction with the package o f technical assistance offered under the Public and Private
Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) and coordinated with other donor programs, it provides a
structured framework for implementing the more complex institution-building tasks necessary to
achieve the other program objectives. Fourth, the program supported by the loan complements
and reinforces the IMF program.

99.      Implementation risk is high. The iiistitutional weaknesses that the PALS seek to
overcome, present one o f the main challenges to implementation. The Superior Council on
Public Policies and Structural Adjustment with the Prime Minister as President and supported by
three cabinet level Vice Presidents (Minister of Public Finance, Minister o f Administration and
Interior, and General Secretary o f Government) has been established to minimize this risk
through regular meetings to ensure effective monitoring and coordination. This i s supplemented


                                               -46-

by a PPIBL-financed PAL implementation unit under Chancellery of the Prime Minister's Office
and new Public Policy Unit established as a permanent body in the office o f the General
Secretary o f Government.

100.     There are political risks. Local elections were held inJune o f 2004 and will be followed
by parliamentary and presidentialelections inNovember. The rulingparty did poorly inthe local
elections and the outcome o f the fall elections has become less certain. This creates a risk that the
authorities may backslide on reform commitments or that they may adopt spending increases that
would threaten the IMF program. However, in addition to the risk mitigation factors discussed in
more detail above in the section on the CAS update, these risks are reduced by relatively strong
economic growth, by the social support measures in the PAL program, and by the strong
incentives providedby the prospect o f EUaccession and the important role the both the PAL and
the IMF program play in this process. The Regular Report o f November 2004 will strongly
condition political behavior especially as the authors o f the 2003 report were unable to confirm
that Romania had established a "hnctioning market economy'' status critical for that accession
process. It is possible that the elections will result in a different political party forming the new
government, but while this could cause a temporary pause in the investment projects in the
Bank's portfolio as new officials become familiar with the projects, the polls indicate that the
strongest electoral competitors to the ruling party are likely to be highly supportive o f the PAL
reform agenda.

101.     External shocks could affect macroecmomic stability. Romania has enjoyed strong
export growth especially into the European market. Remittances and FDI are expected to play
and increasingly important role. These factors have buffered the recent sharp rise in the current
account deficit which could worsen further if global growth were to weaken. However the risks
o f this are not highand Romania's external debt and reserve position are good.

        Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:




                Re: PAL 1-Letter of Development Policy


               We gratefully acknowledge this opportunity to request the support of the World Bank in
pursuing our medium term goals of improving economic growth, reducing poverty making the
structural and institutional changes necessary to meet the demands of successfulentry inthe European
Unionin2007.

   Looking forward, our challenge is to consolidate the gains made in macro stabilization and to
complete the remaining structural reform agenda while at the same time moving into a new phase of
transition that will focus on implementation of key institutional changes necessary to support our entry
into the EuropeanUnionin2007. Central to this will bethe improvement inthe functioning o f markets,
the deepening of public sector administrative and institutional capacities, and the refinement of
regulatory processes.

   We have adopteda program that is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on reforming core
public sector institutions and processes. It iilicludes judicial reform, reforms to the civil service,
mechanisms of policy formulation and transparency, and enhanced public expenditure management
with particular emphasis on budgeting mechanismsineducation, health and pensions.The second part
targets the public-private interface and regulation of markets.      It focuses on completion of the
privatization program, deepeningenergy sector reffarms, improvingthe business environment, labor and
capital marketreforms and speedingup reforms in mining and railroad sectors. This latter part of the
program buildsonthe progresson structural reformbegununder the previous PSALprograms.

President
The World Bank

    We have worked closely with the World Bank team to developing this program. The implementation of
the PAL 1components now lays the foundation for a phased set of reforms encompassing two subsequent
PAL operations to be concludedby 2007. Inthe elaboration of the PAL program we have paid particular
attention to issues of sequencing and pacing of reforms andhave devised a set of monitorable indicators to
ensure sustained progress throughout. Inaddition we have defined a set of specific actions that are critical
to the success of the program andthese are identifiedas triggers for the future PALS.

                                              BACKGROUND

    Over the last four years we have made sustained efforts to stabilize the economy. Under a Standby
Agreement successfully concluded with the IMF inOctober 2003 we used a combination of tight monetary
policy and more rigorous fiscal discipline to achieve a sustained decline in inflation and contain budget
deficits. This was complemented by advancesinstructural reforms under the World Bank's PSAL Iand I1
programs, steps to increase energy tariffs, application of stricter financial discipline to delinquent
enterprises and completionof a series of important privatization deals, such as Galati Steel Plant, Tractorul
and Roman Brasov and ARO Campulung. Positive economic growth returnedin2000 accompanied by a
surge in exports reflecting progress in economic reforms, including setting the exchange rate at a
competitive level, achieving a large degree o f fiscal consolidation, gradually lowering the tax burden on
labor andadvancing onbanking andenterpriseprivatization.

    Important steps have been taken towards improving the performance in the energy, miningand
transportation sectors, although these sectors remain the main source of arrears accumulation and
subsidies. Our reforms inenergy have consisted O f measures to improve financial discipline and the adopt
hardbudget constraints for enterprises, as well as iizstitutional restructuringandthe privatization. We have
increased energy tariffs and a taken determined stance against non-payers. The energy tariffs adjustments
have significantly improved the financial performance of the enterprises operating in the sector and have
reducedthe cost to the Government budget. The total implicit subsidies andlosses inthe energy sector have
decreased from 4.7 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 2.8 percent in 2003. Yet, both pricing and collection
performance still constitute important challlenges,        which adversely affect public finances and
macroeconomic stability. Tariffs are somewhat below cost recovery levels in electricity and are
substantially below inthe heating sub-sector, and the domestic wellhead price for natural gas i s well below
the import price. The losses from lowprices and non-collection continue to place burdens onthe companies
inthe energy sector andonthe consolidatedbudget. It i s estimated that in2003 these losses and subsidies
amounted to $1.6 billion. In railroads, under the IMF Stand-by, there have been substantial layoffs and
planned track closures but subsidies and payment arrears (especially social contributions) still remain. In
mining, the early progress made under PSAL Lhas not beenmaintained and recently subsidies and losses
have beenmounting. A vigorous programof mine closures andlayoffs, with social support programswhere
necessary, i s a clear priority.

    W e have launched a comprehensive program for institutional development and governance to
provide a better business climate and foster economic growth. This has included an ambitious
legislative program. An extensive set o f new laws has recently been adopted including a large package of
Anti Corruption andGovernance legislation, a Law on Decisional Transparency, a Law on Free Access to
Information, a new Civil Service Code, a Law on Local Public Finance and a Law on Local Public
Administration. In addition we held a constitutional referendum which was necessary for constitutional
amendments neededto introduce new legislation on reform of the judiciary and the court system. Further
laws directly affecting the business environment a i d the functioning o fmarkets include a new Labor Code,
and new bankruptcy legislation. While these represent significant improvements, the volume and speed of
adoption of this legislationmeant frequent use o f emergency decrees and similar instruments, and relatively
limited parliamentary debate or public consultatian. Consequently, there remains an important task of
refining and improving upon these important first steps. In addition we recognize that such institutional
reforms need a significant implementationeffort. This task remains largely ahead o f us andwe will tackle it
withthe assistanceof the PAL andthe associatedPPIBL.

                                                                                                        2

          We remain committed to efficiently and effectively delivering public services. We havejust
      revised the education legislation with a view to improving the financing formula based on per student
I
I     costs, and increasing the direct responsibilities of school management. Similarly, we have prepared a
      comprehensive strategy for reforming the health sector focusing on hospital rationalization, and
      improved payment mechanisms, health insurance funding and transparency. We have set a course for
      consolidating the first pillar of the public pensiaii system andhaveadoptedthe legislation necessary for
      the eventual introduction of second and third pillars. These programs are closely linked with our

Ji    decentralization efforts, and with the assistance ~fthe PAL, we are seeking to implement reforms for
      the improved delivery of public services in a manner consistent with an overall framework of
1i    intergovernmental fiscal arrangements.



                                                    THEPROGRAM

          Our over arching goals are to achieve strong but sustainable economic growth, to reduce
      poverty and adopt the reforms necessary to enable us to accede to the European Union in 2007.
      We seek to maintain and average growth 4.5 -5.0 percent annually over the period 2004 2006 while
                                                                                                -
     reducing total poverty to 15.3 percent and extreme poverty to 4.7 by end 2006 compared with 28.9
     percent and 10.9 percent respectively in 2002. We will maintain a stable macroeconomic environment
     withcontinuing reductionsinthe inflationrate, steady reduction of arrears to state budget, limitedfiscal
      account deficits, foreign exchange reserves and current account balances inline with the provisions of
      the IMFPrecautionaryStandbyAgreement

     Part 1: Core Public Sector

     JudicialReform

          W e have launched a number of important initiatives during 2000-2003 aimed at reforming the
     judiciary and strengthening rule of Iaw            ip1 the country. In September 2003, we adopted a
     comprehensiveJudicial Reform Strategyfor 2003-2007 anda detailed Implementation Plan, with atime
     table and estimatesfor requiredfinancial resources. The Strategy paper outlines the following strategic
     objectives o f the reform process: enhancing the rule o f law in the country, strengthening institutional
     independenceo fthejudiciary, increasingefficiency of courts andprofessionallevel ofjudges andcourt
     personnel, improving quality ofjudgments and legal predictability in dispute resolution, and achieving
     compliance withthe EUstandards andregulations.

          In October 2003, constitutional amendments were adopted through a national referendum
     which introduced important changesin the judicial area. These include: (i)     enshrining the principles
     o f the judiciary as an independent branch of power, and the right to a fair trial within a "reasonable
     time"; (ii) transformation of the Supreme Court of Justice into a High Court o f Cassation and Justice,
     responsiblefor ensuring the consistentinterpretation and implementation of laws throughout Romania;
     and (iii) revised composition and mandate of the Superior Council of Magistracy (SCM) which would
     strengthenits role as an institutional guarantorofjudicial independence.

          W e still need to address some key issues facing the judiciary in support of our goal of EU
     accession. With assistance from PAL program we will take steps to address these issues, including:
     further strengthening of the institutional independenceof the judiciary through the enhanced role o f the
     Superior Council o fMagistracy; increasingaccountability o fjudges andthe court system for timeliness
     andquality oftheir work; more efficient organization of the court system, and improving the system of
     court financing. These objectives will be pursuedactions directedat:

          0   Expanding the SCM's authority in the areas o f judicial appointments, magistrates' career and
              court administration and establishmentoffapermanently functioning administrative structures of
              SCM;


                                                                                                             3

      Introduction of changes in the organization o f the court system, including downsizing or
      consolidating certain courts (depending on the caseloads), introduction of specialized courts or
      specialized panels within courts, revision of jurisdictional boundaries between courts to
      eliminate duplication and inefficiency andffrequent grantingofnew trials;
      Development and use by the courts, SCM and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) of objective
      standardsfor evaluation ofjudicial performanceand regular publication ofjudicial performance
      indicators to increaseawarenessbyjudges andpublic ingeneralaboutjudicial performance.

      Enhanced court administration mechanism resulting in more efficient allocation and use of
      financial and human resources within the court system, better maintenance of court facilities,
      modernized case management system and improved IT support, and professional training of
      court personnel
      Increased transparency in administering court affairs (particularly, assignment of cases to
      judges, allocation of financial resources, nomination for training, etc.) through transfer o fcertain
      administrative functions from court presidents to professional court administrators (economic
      managers)
      Uniform standards and procedures far the preparation of courts' budgets and financial
      management of courts and increased capacity o f courts and SCM to prepare and administer
      budgets
      Enhanced accountability of the judiciary for efficient use of budgetary resources for the court
      system(directly accountablefor efficiency gains)
      Establishment of high-quality and sustainable training mechanisms for judges and court
      personnel, particularly, inthe areao fcontinuesjudicial education


Desired outcomes include thefollowing:
      Reduction of time spent by court presidents and judges on administrative and other routine
      matters by 30percent
      Increased pro$ssional level of judges as monitored through number of judges undergoing
      continuing legal education,performance eimluations andjudicial performance indicators.

Civil Service Reform

   We are seeking to establish a more meritocratic, professional, depoliticized civil service, funded
witha sustainable public sector wage billandtransparent salary setting. Our programis founded onthe
establishment of a comprehensive set of monitoring indicators agreedwith the ANFP andthe
progressive improvement o fthese indicators over benchmark levels though the series o fPALS. The
Civil Service Law was recently overhauled as par&of our package o f anti-corruption measures. Revision
ofthe Civil Service Law is anticipated inPAL 3 reflecting implementation experience gained inearlier
PALS 1and 2. Adoption o f a new law on Civil43ervice Salary setting i s envisaged for PAL 2. The
program is supported by a set oftechnical assistanceactivities funded by PPIBL and closely

     Policy Formulation and Transparency
         We have madeimportantstridesinstrengtheningadministrativeaccountability inthe areas of
     policy formulation, free access to information,and anticorruption. The proper direction for reform
     of the policy formulation process, long subjectto excessive relianceon emergency ordinances, has been
     taken with the passingof the Law onDecisional Transparencyinearly 2003, andwith the Constitutiond
     changes later that year limitingthe scope of emergency ordinances. We establisheda new Public Policy
     Unit (PPU) inthe office of the General Secretary of Government structured on the lines advocatedby
     the PAL team to build policy formulation capacity with better and more transparent stakeholder
     consultation and more orderly pre-cabinet inter ministerial reconciliation processes. An initial draft
     "Guide Concerning the Design, Implementation and Evaluation of Public Policy at the Central Level"
     has beenpreparedandwill be revisedthrough aprocess of developingpilot policy proposals. Technical
     assistance is being mobilized from the U.K., the European Union and the World Bank to aid in these
     reforms, under terms of referencedevelopedjointly by the EC, the World Bank andDFID. Adoption of
     new formal policy makingproceduresis anticipated inPAL 2, basedon lessons learnedthrough the pilot
     policy proposal development process. Desired ciutcomes include a more stable legal framework and
     greater decisional transparency.
         The Law on Free Access to Information,passedin 2001, providedan importantstep forward
     in developing a system of open and accessible government. This Law, developed during a broad-
     based and productive public dialogue, outlines ex ofJicio information to be provided by every
     governmental body, the limited criteria by which a request under the law may be rejected, and the
     processes anddeadlines for making andrespondjingto requests.

number of fronts, including the adoption of freedom of information legislation, the establishmentof a
National Anticorruption Prosecutor's office, and various sectoral reforms. In March of 2003 further
legislative advancements were made with the establishment of public asset declarations by public
officials, and new legislation on conflicts of interest. Our program deepens these reforms by
strengthening boththe substance and the implementation arrangements for both assets declarationsand
conflict of interestprohibitions. Desired outcomes include: Greater con$dence on thepart of thepublic
that the Government's attention to transparency and reducing corruption is genuine, as measured by
public opinion polls and surveys including the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS) III2005, andgreater transparent-y through thepublication of the index of declarations

PublicExpenditureManagement

    Public ExpenditureManagement is undergoingmajor changes and several new components
and tools have been introduced to the modernize Public Financial Management (PFM) and
governance. This includes the introduction of a medium term perspective and programs with
quantitative performance indicators into the state budget, modernization and upgrading of the treasury
system, introduction of accrual-based accounting, internal audit and an external financial audit by the
Court of Accounts in line with International Standards of Accounting and Auditing. Following the
recommendations of the draft Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) the overall
management and coordination of these reform efforts and the capability of public sector managers to
apply them effectively will be enhanced. This will be ensured by the establishment o f a PFM reform
management structure set up by the Ministry of Public Finance, by a training programfor public sector
managers, and by supporting professional certifications       of internal auditors effectively promote
management accountability. The desired outcomes are: 0) A coherent, coordinated and effective
steering of the governance and PFMreform, ensuring a successful and documented outcome of reform
efforts; (ii) practices reflecting new governance nodel, emphasizing management responsibility as
opposed to central, third party control; (iii) strong internal audit Capabilities to support and promote
governance and PFMreform.

    Romania has been engaged in a comprehensive education reform since its early years of
transition to a market economy and a democratic society. Until now the reform lead to an improved
quality in education through the adoption of a new curriculum framework, the possibility o f schools to
choose among several textbooks, a new assessment and evaluation system and teacher training innew
teaching methodologies. The reform has now mowed in a new phase, aiming at improving education
equityand efficiency. The objectives ofthisphase are to providemore adequateandequitable financing
for education and to align the roles andresponsibilities of education authorities at the central and local
level with financial decentralization. Specific programs for rural students and other educationally
deprived groups (e.g. Roma) have been launched. Other essential steps needed to achieve these
objectives include: (i) adoption of an improved per student, cost indexed funding formula for basic and
secondary education in order to reduce inequities and provide incentives for efficiency; (ii)
development o f a mechanism to provide adequate financing for upper secondary schools that serve
multiple communities, as well as for capital investments; (iii)        empowerment o f schools and local
authorities to manage schools locally (including teacher recruitment, assignment, and professional
development). The desired outcomes of these reforms are: (a) improved education quality as evidenced
by assessments and examinations results;          (3) improved cost-eflectiveness in education, and (c)
reduction in drop-outs of students in lower secondary education.

    W e are pursuing an ambitious program af structural and financial reform in the health
sector.   The objectives of this program include: developing consistent and rational approaches to
provide sustainable sources of financing for the health insurance system at national and local level,
reducing actual and perceived corruption, improving transparency in the health sector, and improving
focus o f health care providers on outputs and outcomes and increase quality, effectiveness and
efficiency of service delivery. Essential elements of this program include: (i)          the development of
health facility rationalization strategies at the judet level, and the implementation o f these strategies to
reduce overcapacity and increase access to appropriate high quality health services; (ii)       changing the
mechanisms for paying healthprovidersto ensure that they contain appropriate incentives for providing
effective, efficient andhighquality services; (iii)  revise the funding mechanisms for the National Health
Insurance HouseandRegional housesto providestable, predictable, and sustainable levels of financing;
and (iv) change the systems for provider contracting and reimbursement to ensure maximum levels of
transparency andreduce corruption inthe healthsystem. The desired outcomes of thisprogram are: (a)
a balanced budget in the health insurance fund and elimination arrears in the sector. (b) Achievement
of better balance in allocation of healthsector expenditure by reaching a ratio ofpublic expenditure on
acute hospital services to expenditure on outpatient care (target to be determined in PAL 2 on basis of
results of PPIBL-supported health sector financing study) and ratio multi-day to same-day hospital
patient treatment earget to be determined in PAL 2); (c) improved incentives of payment system and
increase efficiency of health care services delivery by extending new payments system to all acute care
hospitals; (2) improved access to health services by the poor and vulnerable groups (targets to be set
during PAL 2 on basis of TA on informal payments under PPIBL); (e) a decreased level of informal
payments (targets to be set during PAL 2 on the basis of the TA on informaE payments under PPIBL); &I
and availability of transparent information on sowces and uses of funds for health, including informal
payments throughpublication Nation HealthAccaitnts dataprepared under the Health APL


    W e recognize the need for pension reform. While we have recently taken steps to introduce
second and third pillars to the pension system it i s clear that placing the first pillar on a sound financial
footing i s a priority. Accordingly we have prepared a strategy for the adjustment o f key pension
parameters that will enable the system to face demographic challenges and provide adequate coverage
at sustainable costs to the budget. Desired outcome: maintenance of apublic pensions fiscal deficit of
less than approximately I percent of the GDP, imluding any deficit resulting3om transition to the
secondpillar.

     EffectiveDecentralizationand Improved IntergovernmentalFiscalRelations. We have taken
several steps to resolve outstanding issues needed to make its decentralization and intergovemental
system more effective and efficient among the central government, counties, communes, and
municipalities. However, these efforts have been partial, and have not resolved key issues affecting
local administrationinRomania. Further reforms are neededto improve the effectiveness and efficiency
o f local service delivery. InJune 2003, anemergency ordinance was introduced (45/2003) to replace the
existing Law on Local Public Finance (LLPF 1891'98). This ordinance, currently under debate in the
Parliament, articulates some of the decentralization principles more clearly, and provides some
borrowing flexibility to local governments. However, it introduces changes inthe intergovernmental
transfer system, particularly on the equalization pmcess, which are in many respects steps backward.
GOR recognizes the need to develop an adequate fiamework for tackling further sector
decentralization-financing    and assignment of function issues-and    to resolve current misalignments
between fiscal decentralization and hctional devolution to sectors that have been decentralized, in
order to minimize horizontalandvertical imbalances.

     We plan to introduce a set of policy and process reforms aimed at improving the decentralization
framework, intergovernmental fiscal system, andbuilding the central and local capacity to support local
administration. Desired outcomes are: strengthened intergovernmentalframework for decentralization,
enabling legislation, and decentralization strategy; improved public debate, participatory processes,
and intergovernmental dialogue for reforms of local administration; and clarity in functional
assignmentsandjurisdiction among all levels ofgovernment, inparticular for local government tiers.

Part2 :The Public Private Interface andRegulatedMarkets

Privatization,Restructuringand Establishment af Efficient Markets

   Our current privatization program focuses; an manufacturing and infrastructure SOEs. The
   privatization focus of the two previous structural adjustment loans (PSAL Iand PSAL 11) was on
   reducing the role of the state in manufacturing and banking and in the second adjustment loan
   (PSAL II),  a start was made on privatizing infrastructure. The proposed PAL series of loans will
   focus on finishing privatizing state owned enterprises in manufacturing; substantially privatizing
   state owned enterprises in the energy sector (electricity and gas) and on privatizing the last two
   commercial state banks.


                                                                                                     10

The use o f best practice including transparent and competitive privatization procedures, successfully
introduced in the PSAL I,and used in both PSAL Iand PSAL I1 will be continued in the PAL
privatizations.    The desired outcomes are: the completion of the            privatization of the state
manufacturing sector in Romania; the moving into theprivate sector of electricity and gas distribution
and much of the electricity generation; the govsrninent s exitfiom the commercial banking sector with
thePrivatization of the two remaining commercial state banks, BCR and CEC; and an increase in the
private sector's share of GDP to 75percent.

    We approvedand publisheda strategy -RoadMap for the EnergyField, July 2003 -for the
development of the energy sector (with the focus on gas and electricity sectors) in the short-term
(2003-2004), medium-term (2005-2007) and long-term (2008-2015).              The PAL energy program i s
premised on the Road Map and supports its implementation. One o f the means for implementing the
strategy is the privatization o f state-owned oil, and gas and power enterprises. The privatization of the
national oil and gas company Petrom was launched under PSAL 11. The privatization o f the other gas
producer, Romgaz, is included inthe PAL program. The privatization of the gas andpower distribution
companies was launched under PSAL I1and will be completed under the PAL program. Finally, the
PAL program includes the privatizationof three largepower generation companies.

    We are aware that the implementationaf such an ambitious privatization program in the
energy sector will be a major challenge inthe current globalprivatizationenvironment. However,
we are determined to proceed so as to: (a) sewre the signijkant investment resources that will be
necessaryfor the rehabilitation and expansionofproductiodgeneration and distributionsystems, which
the public sector alone will not be able to fund or mobilize; and (6) develop a more efJicient and
increasingly competitive energy sector, to energize and enhance the competitivenessof the Romanian
economy. Energy sector reforms already accomplished by the Government, including the restructuring
and unbundling of the oil, gas and power companies, the establishment of the gas and electricity
regulatory authorities, and price liberalization (oil) and tariff adjustments (gas and electricity) have
placedRomania ina strong position to move forward withthese privatization.

    Energy Services will be improvedthrough liberalizationwith targetedsupport to low-income
households. Economic stagnation in the 1490s led to inadequate investments and insufficient
maintenance andrehabilitation of aging energy facilities and networks. Now that Romania's economic
growth is accelerating, pressure on services wilJ increase.      This is far more than a sectorial issue.
Adequate supply' o f energy i s essential prerequisites for achieving sustainable economic growth.
Without economic growth momentum, it will be difficult for us to both implement our social
programs/poverty alleviation agenda and improve and maintain necessary fiscal discipline for
sustainable development.       Our desire to join the European Union adds to the country's energy
challenges the need to comply with various EU-directives and other minimumstandards. Considerable
technical skills and a well-educated labor-foke able to learn more are available.          Private sector
management skills and private financing will be needed public sector skills and public finances alone
                                                            -
will not suffice -and therefore privatizationis am integralelement ofthe service delivery program. The
oil sector has already beenopened. The liberalizationo fthe gas and electricity sectors i s a key element
o f our strategy spelled out in the Road Map far the Energy Field, July 2003, in order to meet EU's
market requirements and directives and to subject the increasingly private service providers to
competitive market forces.       In the district heating sector the focus will be on restructuring and
consolidation, to improve heating services and reduce subsidies through efficiency improvements and
targeting.

    Service delivery issues vary greatly in variolas part of the energy sector and therefore very
differentapproaches are necessaryandwill besupportedunderthe PAL program:

        the oil sector has been liberalized and m4or private companies (including Lukoil, OMV, MOL,
        and Shell) are already present. With the privatization of Petrom, service delivery will be almost
        entirely entrusted to the private sector, apart from minority government holding in Petrom and
        continuedpublic ownership of the petroleum transport network;

                                                                                                        11

    0   the electricity and gas sectors will be liberalized, in accordance with the Road Map and EU
        requirements. Romania is a signatory o f the Athens memorandumfor the development of the
        South East Europe Regional Energy Market (SEEREM). Romania's national energy reforms
        are aligned with SEEREM's regionalrequirements andwill also facilitate its integration into the
        EC's internal market as part o f its EUaccession. Market opening has already been startedand
        the largest industrial electricity and gas consumers now have the freedom to choose their gas
        supplier. Market openingwill continue, in parallel with continuing adjustmentsin the producer
        and retail pricesof gas (bringing them gradually inline with import parity) and electricity tariffs
        (cross-subsidies have largely been eliminated but continuing adjustments will be necessary to
        cover the increasingcosts of supply andprovide for adequate returns for sustainableoperations);
    0   district heating systems across the country make losses and burdencentral and local budgets.
        Raising resourcesfor the financing of district heating (and other urbaninfrastructure suchwater
        & sewerage systems and roads) has emerged as a major challenge.            Some district heating
        systems have already been closed and further closures are likely inthe coming years.       Plants
        closures, disconnections and high heat prices are pressing human issues, as heating is a basic
        need inRomania's winter. Central government has been forced to provide increasingly costly
        ad-hoc support and will have to continue to do so until more satisfactory solutions to these
        heating issues are implemented.       A district heating strategy is being prepared and will be
        implementedduring the PAL program, Measures will include mandatory heat metering and
        heating control measures such as thermostatic valves and structural improvements in the
        structure of heatingtariffs, so as to give the heat consumersthe ability and incentives to control
        their heatingandheat consumption; and
    0   social protection measures are an integral part of energy reforms.       Price reforms and tariff
        adjustments in gas, electricity and district heating will take into account the ability of low-
        income households to pay for their basic energy sewices and will be accompaniedby targeted
        subsidies to ensure continued access. Electricity tariffs already include a well-functioning
        mechanism to support basic electricity needs. In district heating, a major shift fkom producer
        subsidies to targeted consumer subsidieswill be implemented gradually in line with the sector
        restructuring. Inthe gas sector, a simihr program to support low-income households will be
        developed.

Desired outcomes include (In electricityl: market liberalization meets EU's 2007 requirements;
substantial private investment securedfor the power sector; efficient and competitive power sector
capable of meeting consumer demand; social protection to ensure access to electricity supply to low-
income households; and (In gas sector): market liberalization meets EU's 2007 requirements; private
investmentsecuredfor gas distribution andproduckm; an efJicientand competitive gas sector capable
of meeting consumer demand; social protection to ensure supply to low-income households; Improved
heating services including giving consumers th2 ability and incentives to control their heating and heat
consumption; reduced producer subsidies and improved consumer subsidies targeting low-income
households.

    We recognize the need for restructuringin the enterprise sector to limit the fiscal burden of
current subsidies and losses. Accordingly we have prepared a detailed strategy for restructurhg the
mining sector with schedules for the closure of nan viable mines and specialprograms for employment
and social mitigation. In addition, the Ministry of Transport has engaged an international advisor to
prepare a restructuring program for the state airline Tarom. Desired outcomes: Elimination of operating
losses of Tarom and maintenance of positive operatingprojt in line with the business andJinancial
restructuringplan. Elimination by 2007 of state aidfor mining of lignite and non-metallic ores in line
with the mining sector strategy through targeted equal reductions equivalent to 25percent of the 2003
state aid levels. This will be accomplished by privatisation some of these mining units, closure of non-
viable units and reductions in the number of minitg sector employees. State aid in hard coal will be
reduced annually by amounts equivalent to I 4 3 percent of the 2003 state aid. Our restructuring
program aims to establish the Romanian milway companies as viable businesses with good
productivity. The Railway Law passed in 1997 and amended in 2003 provides the legal basis for
restructuring.
                                                                                                         12

 It has instituted three railway companies: the infrastructurecompany, the freight service company, and
the passenger service company. Rules exist for private operators' entry to the market; ten already have
done so. The freight service companies have freedom to set tariffs, there are public service obligation
(PSO) contracts with the Government for the desired non-commercial passenger services, and thenon-
core activities of the state-owned railways have been privatized. Continuing restructuring foresees
further reductions in the railway labor force, rationalization of the railway network and services,
completion o f interoperability and safety regulations consistent with EU directives and practice,
modificationo f track access charges to better reflect costs and competition, andthe privatization of the
State-owned freight service company. Part of restnicturing i s also the upgradingof the rolling stock for
both freight and passenger services, and full implementation of the Integrated Railway Information
System (IRIS).     In short, the aim is to ensure fair competition and financial viability of the railways
under prevailingmarket conditions. The desired outcomes are: By end-2004, reduction of the railway
labor force by 25 percent compared to the level at end-2001; and by end-2006, achievement of            a
Working Ratio of 1I5percentfor CFR In3astructura; 88percentfor CFR Marfa; and IO0percentfor
CFR Calatori; debtserviceratio of 1.5for CFRMcarjaa;and elimination of arrears in social taxes to the
State.

    The restructuring program aims to achieve management of the road sector more efficiently,
with cost-effective use of public funds and privatization of supplier functions to ensure
competition.     Until today, the Bank has been concemed with the main roads, app. 11,500 km,
administered and managed by the National Administration of Roads, NAR, recently reorganized as
State-owned corporate entity. Counties (judets) are responsible for the rest of the public road network
(app. 66,500 km) with management capabilities lesser than NAR's. The restructuring focuses on
improving NARs planning and management capabilities, privatization o f its force account
organizations, equipping NAR and county road management entities with management systems for
allocating the road budget between the three functional road classes (main, county, and local roads--
excluding streetsand towdvillage roads), and betweenregions (aggregations of counties as they are too
small for cost-effective road management), and for the prioritization o f road works. Recommendations
will also be made for roaduser charges. Thedesiwd outcome is: road user charges revised to cover 70
percent of all road maintenancecosts excluding investments

BusinessEnvironment

    In order to strengthen the Corporate Ghvermance of the enterprise sector we prepared draft
legislation which is currently being discussed with our social partners. In addition, we requestedthe
Bank's support for conducting a ROSC assessment on the corporate governance principles applied in
the OECD countries in order to fisther updatethe currently proposedlegislation. Desired outcomes: By
2007, the legal framework for corporate gavemzance will be in compliance with international
standards.

    Following the actions successfully implemented under the PSAL I1program, we approved a
    new Action Plan to remove the administrative barriers and improve the business
   environment. This Action Plan i s satisfactorily being implemented so far, and its actions will lead
   to the simplification of administrative and regulatory procedures and to the decrease o f the
   transaction costs for business entry and operation. As part of this Action Plan, a second baseline
    Administrative and Regulatory Cost Survey (ARCS) will be conducted with FIAS support
    beginning of 2004. Also, the Silent Approval Law which was recently passed, will contribute to the
    decrease o f corruption and implicitly to the reduction o f transaction costs. Desired outcomes: By
    2005, administrative and regulatory requirementsfor entry of new businesses and operations would
    be in line with those in EU countries; Reduced time and money costsfor opening a new business;
    and signijcant increases in FDIand increaselaportion in theform of Greenfield investment.

    The Bankruptcylegislationhasbeenamended. Further refinementsinthe legislationand stepsto
improve implementation arrangements will be made in line with the recommendations of the ROSC
assessment on the insoIvencyand creditor rights, that has beenconductedby the Bank at ow request. At
the same time, the transparency ofthe firms functioning will be improved by the measures included in
the Action Plan, to be approved by the GOR, incorporating the recommendations of the recently
completed ROSC assessment on Accounting and Auditing procedures. Desired outcome: By end of
2005, the number ofpending bankruptcy trials in courts, as well as the average duration of such trials
andpost-trial procedures will be significantly dii'lninished.

    Improvements will be introduced to the transparency in the functioning of firms Financial
reporting and auditing requirements in Romania are currently in transition from compliance with
national standards to compliancewith InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS), Intemational
Standards on Auditing (ISA), and the acquis eommunautaire. In law, Romania has achieved great
progress in law. In practice, compliance with `these enhanced requirements is not yet effectively
enforced.

   Improving corporate financial information is one of the key components of sustainable
economic development in Romania. First, high quality financial information will strengthen the
country's financial architecture andreduce the risk of financial crises and scandals and all the negative
economic impacts they have, as demonstrated both in Romania and internationally. Second, it will
contribute to foreign investment, and will promote the international growth o f Romanian enterprises.
Finally, it will help mobilize domestic saving.

   This objectivewillbeachievedthrough:

       The preparationby the Ministry o f Public Finance of a policy document that maps out the areas
       o f focus to enhance the quality of financial reporting in Romania and reflects the existing and
       looming acquis communautaire and builds up on the policy recommendations made in the
       ROSC-accounting and auditing report published inSeptember 2003. The policy document will

Labor Markets

  In2002we adopteda comprehensive employmentplan aimedto stimulatejob creation, encourage
  entrepreneurship and provide equal labor market opportunities for men and women. The plan
  provides the legal basis for the implementation of labor market reforms. Building on the provisions
  of the employment plan, the framework for labor market policies has been strengthened and the
  institutional capacity o f the agencies responsible for drafting and implementing labor policies has
  been consolidated. Expenditure on active labor market policies has increased and so did the
  effectiveness o f the interventions. In this context, the PAL supports measures to enhance the
  flexibility of the labor market to facilitate labor mobility, enterprise privatization and restructuring,
  and sectoralreforms. A first step inthis direction consists inthe revision of some of the provisions
  o f the Labor Code in order to reduce the casts of hiring and dismissal, with a view to stimulate
  sustainablejob creation, and eliminate the'umecessary labor-related costs for enterprises so as to
  maintain and improve their market competitiveness. A broader set of labor market reforms i s
  envisagedover the mediumterm, in line with the objectives of the employment plan. These would
  involve additional legislative, policy and institutional changes in areas affecting labor market
  flexibility and competitiveness, such as unemployment insurance, pensions and labor policies. The
  desired outcomes are: Marked and sustainable improvements in the following labor market
  indicators: labor participation rate, employmenttopopulation rate, the share of long term (over 12
  months) unemployed to total unemployed, fhe youth unemployment rate to total unemployed,
  employmentin servicesas a share of the laborforce.

 CapitalMarkets/Non-BankingFinancial Institisfions

    As an integral part of its strategy to foster the development of the private sector, we are
 implementing a comprehensive program of refarm of capital markets and Non-Bank Financial
 Institutions (NBFIs).         We consider that the development o fcapital markets andNBFIswill play
a critical role in financial sector deepening and diversification, offering new options for savings
mobilization by households, broadening access to private finance for investment by the central
government, local governments and private firms, and transferring risks to those economic agents that
are best able to manage them. We see this as key to achieving successful integration within the EU
single financial market and efficiently absorbing EU Phare and structural funds as an integral part of
Romania's EUaccessionstrategy.

    Our program in this area rests on three: fundamental elements: (i)       strengthening the market
legal and regulatory framework, focusing in particular on securities markets, mutual and closed end
funds (including SIFs), pension funds, insurance, mortgage markets, and leasing; (ii)strengthening the
capacity o fmarket supervisory agencies, focusing onthe securities exchange commission (CNVM), the
insurance supervisory agency, and the pension supervision entity to be created; and (iii)   deepening
capital marketsthrough market-based enhancement instruments, focusing on the local government bond
market and on the mortgage insurance market.

 The desired outcomes are: improvements of 0.25per year in average Peer Review scoresfor National
Securities Commission starting in 2004; improvements of 0.25per year in average Peer Review scores
for Insurance starting in 2005; andprogressive redvction of spreads by 100 basispoints per year

    W e have appointed a Superior Council on Public Policies and Structural Adjustment
(SCPPSA) responsible for implementation and monitoring of the PAL program. The Council met
in its first full session with the main members of the PAL team and a representative of the EC on
December 2, 2003 and is expectedto meet approximately monthly through the PAL period. The Prime
Minister acts as Presidentand there are three cabinet level Vice Presidents(Minister of Public Finance,
Minister of Administration and Interior, and General Secretary of Government). This body will have
oversight as well of the related activities in pubIic administration reform supported by the EU, an
arrangement which will ensure appropriate coordination of PAL and EU programs. The General
Secretary o f Government will have special responsibilities for PAL implementation in a manner that
anticipates the fuller development of the GSG's office as the entity responsible for the policy
formulation function within govemment. A Public Policy Unithas beenformed as a permanentbody in
the GSG's office for this purpose. In addition a PAL implementation unit is being established with
fundingfrom the Public andPrivate institution BuildingLoanto assist with the day-to-day monitoring
of PAL activities andwill exist for the durationo fthe PALprogram.

     W e have agreed with Bank staff on comprehensive package of technical assistance
implementation support measures usingPPI L resources as well as other donor funds. These are
largely focusedonthe institution building initiatives particularly inthe public sectorportion o fthe PAL
program and they include provision for seminars and workshops for consensus building and
dissemination o fnewer concepts associatedwithpublicadministrationreform.

    Duringthe course of the three PALSwe will produce quarterly progress reports. These will
provide information on the status of implementationof each of the PAL conditions and triggers as well
as tracking performance on a set of indicators. These are h l l y detailed in the Program Document and
are intendedto show the progressthat the PAL program i s having inproducing desiredoutcomes. These

On July 7, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2004 Article IV Consultation with Romania.

Background

After uneven performance in the 1990s, macroeconomic policies improved in 2001-03.
Macroeconomic imbalances were reduced through fiscal policy, measures to improve the
financial performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and accelerated privatization.
TheNational Bank of Romania (NBR) slowed the depreciation of the leu and achieved
substantial disinflation, lowering the annual inflation rate from 40 percent in early 2001 to
12.3 percent in May 2004. Macroeconomic stabilization, which preserved the competitiveness
achieved with the 1999 depreciation, and prospects for EU accession created a positive supply
responseand facilitated rapid growth over the last three years.
However, in 2003 domestic demand picked up and the current account deficit widened,
reflecting a sharp increase in credit to the private sector and a large minimum wage increase in
January 2003. As a result, final domestic demand grew faster than output and the current account
deficit widened to 5.9 percent of GDP.

Fiscal policy provided continued support for macroeconomic stabilization. Far-reaching value-
added tax (VAT) and profit tax reforms and improvements in tax administration strengthened
revenue collections despite sizable cuts in social security contribution rates. With interest
payments declining, the budget deficit was reduced relative to GDP from 2.6 percent in 2002 to
2.3 percent in 2003. The authorities were also successful in reducing losses from quasi-fiscal
activities. After a delayed policy response to higher international prices in early 2003, gas prices
have been increasedsubstantially since mid-2005, and electricity prices were brought to the cost
recovery level in September 2003. Collection rates in the gas and electricity sectors increased
significantly, but progress has been insufficient indistrict heating.

After a decade of slow privatization, a large-scale employment reduction program facilitated an
acceleration of the privatization program. Overall, 35 large companies with over 112,000
employees were privatized in 2001-03, half of which were privatized in the last year. Although
energy sector privatization has been slow, a number of important privatizationprojects are now
close to completion, the most important of wUiic11 is the privatization of oil and gas producer
Petrom, the largest company inthe country.

Executive BoardAssessment

Executive Directors commended the Romanian authorities for the prudent conduct of
macroeconomic policies and progress with structural reforms. These achievements have
contributed to a decline ininflation and to Romania's strong economic growth over the past three
years.

Directors stressedthat sustaining strong growth over the mediumterm will require further efforts
to complete macroeconomic stabilization and accelerate structural reform. In particular,
continued disinflation and containing the current account deficit within a safe range, in the
context of the current exchange rate-based stabilization framework, will require further efforts to
reduce the budget deficit over the medium term, eliminate losses and quasi-fiscal activities in
state-owned enterprises, and implement a strict wage policy. In the structural area, Directors
emphasized the importance of completing the privatization agenda and stepping up efforts to
improve the business climate, especially governance. It will be particularly important to keep up
the momentum on these policies in the run-up to the general elections inNovember 2004 and in
their immediate aftermath.

Directors commended the authorities' plan to lower the general government deficit in the context
of the amended 2004 budget, and to use any additional revenue for further deficit reduction.
They stressed the importance o f maintaining a sufficiently tight fiscal policy over the medium
term. Directors encouraged improvements in the structure of revenue and expenditure to support
further budget consolidation efforts. They welcomed the reduction in Romania's high social
security contribution rates, and supported further cuts inthese providedthey are accompanied by
a broadening of the tax base and improvements intax administration. Directors cautioned against
eroding the value added and profit tax bases through the granting of exemptions. They strongly
supported efforts to reduce subsidies, and noted that expenditure will need to be carefully
prioritized to make room for planned increases iiiinfrastructure investment. Itwas suggestedthat
the articulation of a medium-term expenditure framework could usefblly support such efforts.

Directors generally considered that the current monetary policy framework, which features a
gradually declining targeted depreciation rate ais a nominal anchor, has been a key factor
underlying the success in reducing inflation. Directors agreed that once inflation has been
brought down to single-digit levels and wage discipline in state-owned companies strengthened,
inflation targeting will become a viable framework for the medium term. Steps to strengthen the
central bank's independence in line with Maastricht requirements, are welcome, and Directors
encouragedthe authorities to step up efforts to fulfill the institutional, operational, and analytical
prerequisites for the introduction of inflation targeting in 2005. Directors noted that the banking
systemremains healthy, and that recent measures havebeen effective incontaining the growth of
household credit. Nevertheless, they recommended that the authorities remain vigilant and
prepared to take additional measuresshould the brisk growth of credit resume.

Directors stressed the need for hard budget constraints on state-owned enterprises.
They welcomed the measures directed at reducing tax arrears and the nonpayment of utility bills,
particularly inthe miningand railway sectors. Directors supported the closingofunviable

operations, with appropriate provision for relocating and retraining employees, and the
adjustment o f prices to fully cover costs. They commended the authorities' decision to raise gas
prices to import parity, and also encouraged them to implement the recently-approved strategy
for the district heating sector.

Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to prudent wage policies, considering that this
will be critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing state-owned enterprise
losses. While commending the moderate increase o f the statutory minimum wage and the tight
state-owned enterprise wage program in 2004, they urged the authorities to remain firm in the
implementation o f these policies. They also underscored the need to keep wage settlements in
collective labor contracts in line with productivity growth, thereby protecting employment and
competitiveness.
Directors stressed that preserving labor market flexibility will be key to keeping the economy on
a fast growth path and completing the far-reaching restructuring process. Accordingly, they
urged the authorities to review the provisions in the newly-approved Labor Code that have
adversely affected flexibility and increased the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.

Directors welcomed the authorities' plan to offer most o f the state-owned companies outside the
energy sector for sale by end-2004. They also stressed the importance o f accelerating
privatization in the energy sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue reducing
employment in state-owned enterprises, as they considered this necessary for reducing losses and
accelerating privatization.

Directors commended the authorities for the recent progress in improving the business climate,
including judiciary reform and the implementation o f measures to fight against corruption.
To attract higher private investment, it will be crucial to sustain these institutional reforms,
further strengthen the fight against corruption-in   particular through further efforts to increase
the independence and effectiveness o f the judiciary-and    improve transparency in privatization
and public procurement.

It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Romania will be held on the 24-month
cycle, subject to the provisions in the decision an the consultation cycles approved by the Board
on July 15,2002.
