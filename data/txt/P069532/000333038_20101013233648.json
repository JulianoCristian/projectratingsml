Social Investment and\n            Employment Promotion Project for Bulgaria were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            well-designed sub-projects can simultaneously create\n            short-term jobs and improve infrastructure and facilities\n            that are critical to preserving country's human\n            resources. Well-targeted micro-projects can be a\n            particularly useful instrument at the time of economic\n            crisis to ensure employment and keep families from falling\n            into poverty. Sub-projects can contribute to country's\n            broader efforts to decentralize the provision of public\n            goods and services to local governments in a way that also\n            helps local governments fight poverty. The experience of\n            social funds around the world suggests that delegation of\n            sub-project preparation and implementation tasks to local\n            governments bodes well for greater benefits in terms of\n            local governance, accountability, local capacity building,\n            and sustainability of local services. Indicators for the\n            achievement of project outcomes need to be selected from\n            those available sources of data that are periodical enough\n            to enable measuring of outcomes by project closing."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
