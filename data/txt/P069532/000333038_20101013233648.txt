Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To improve the standard of living of people who are locked in persisting pockets of
poverty in Bulgaria, concentrated regionally, among the long-term unemployed, and
among specific ethnic minorities (Roma, Turkish). Because these targeted vulnerable
groups suffer from multiple disadvantages (e.g., exclusion, weak social capital, poor
access to markets and basic services, low employment, low income), the Project will
achieve its objective through complementing the existing, relatively good social
protection system by offering a range of instruments, all focused on building the assets,
individual and communal, of poor and vulnerable people living in these pockets.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Social Investment and Employment Promotion Project (SIEP) supported the
Government's strategy to reduce poverty, to develop Bulgaria's social capital and to
improve the status of minorities and women. The SIEP was financed through two loans.
The original loan in the amount of EUR 50.8 million was approved on December 17,
2002 and became effective on April 15, 2003. The Additional Financing (AF) in the
amount of EUR 15 million was approved on March 21, 2007 became effective on
November 9, 2007. The SIEP was the second World Bank-financed operation supporting
the social sector of Bulgaria.1

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Social capital was weak in local communities in Bulgaria and therefore inadequate to
fight poverty. Bulgaria entered the transition after almost 50 years of communist rule
that destroyed community self-reliance, broke up traditional community organizations
severely weakening social capital and leaving the society poorly equipped to deal with
transition-related social shocks. After the democratic change, partial decentralization of
responsibility for social assistance to local governments, without adequate financial
resources, left poorer municipalities at a disadvantage to confront poverty. Municipal
authorities, the smallest legal units of government administration (covering from 6,000-
40,000 individuals in dozens of settlements), were often far removed from poor
communities and faced multiple pressures. In this environment, municipalities were ill
equipped to encourage community initiatives to improve the local economy or social
services. Communities, on their part, lacked experience with grass root initiatives and
had inadequate skills to articulate their problems, find local solutions or apply for co-
financing from the central Government or international donors. They also had limited
capacity to implement, properly account for, and report on projects' results.

Pockets of poverty persisted and threatened further economic progress, representing a
challenge to reduce poverty in the country. The Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) for the updated Poverty Assessment found that in 2001, after four years of
successful economic reforms, poverty was still more than twice the levels of 1995 (12
percent versus 5.5 percent). The economic crisis highly increased poverty levels to 36
percent in 1997. Forward looking economic reforms not only brought about four years of
growth (1998-99: 3 percent yearly; 2000-01: 5 percent yearly) and reduced transient
poverty by two-thirds, but also reduced the depth and severity of poverty compared to the
crisis years, but the poverty rate was still above 20 percent.

The decline in measured poverty rates took place within the context of increasing
unemployment, suggesting a large role for social assistance income, informal
employment, and remittances in mitigating the impact of labor shedding in the formal
sector. The proportion of poverty was higher among the unemployed and economically

Initiative Fund (Loan No. 4411-BUL), approved on 11/20/1998 and closed on 04/30/ 2001.

inactive people. While the share of households headed by an unemployed person grew
from 7 percent to 18.6 percent between 1997 and 2001, individuals in households whose
head was unemployed made up almost 40 percent of the poor. In the context of
increasing unemployment, the impact of social protection transfers on poverty was
sizable. Bulgarian households, on average, derived 12 percent of their income from
social assistance. The share of household income derived from social assistance jumped
to more than one-third among the poor. The poverty rates in the group receiving social
benefits were estimated at 20.6 percent before receiving social assistance versus 14.9
percent after receiving social assistance.

Government Strategy

The October 2001 Executive Program of the Republic of Bulgaria, identified
developing social capital and improving social integration as the second most
important priority after maintaining macroeconomic stability and creating a conducive
environment for investment and broad based economic growth. Enhancing the flexibility
of the labor market, developing a vibrant social dialogue, and continuing the social
protection system reforms to better address the needs of the most vulnerable groups were
at the center of the social development objectives of the Government. In December 2001,
the Government organized two high level policy seminars to discuss social policies,
including building capacities for poverty monitoring and social capital development and
to refine policies guiding Government support to micro and small businesses.

As part of this effort, the Government aimed to strengthen its capacity to monitor
poverty, consumption, incomes, labor markets and social programs and to formulate
social policies by strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Labor and
Social Policy (MoLSP), and the National Statistical Institute and the Employment
Agency (EA). The Government was to use the improved monitoring capacities and the
results of the Bank's Poverty Assessment 2001 update to prepare a poverty map for the
country. The poverty map was to be used to target additional interventions to the
remaining pockets of poverty.

In addition, the Government started to take actions to integrate ethnic minorities into
mainstream Bulgarian society and to address the large range of problems faced by the
poor and vulnerable children. The Government finalized a Framework Agreement on
the Integration of the Roma in the Bulgarian society and established a National Council
on Ethnic and Demographic Issues.

Rationale for Bank involvement

The 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS - No. 17655), identified the Social
Investment and Employment Promotion Project (SIEP) as the key Bank investment
lending instrument to support Bulgaria to reduce poverty, develop its social capital,
and improve the status of minorities. The CAS recognized that a special strategy was
needed to reach the pockets of long-term poverty. While four years of economic growth
reduced transient poverty by almost two-thirds, it failed to prevent doubling the size of
the pockets of long-term poverty, especially among ethnic minorities, long-term


                                           5
unemployed and large households concentrated in certain geographical areas. To address
this problem, the CAS expected SIEP to upscale the successful experience gained under
the Regional Initiative Fund 2 (RIF). Although the RIF proved to be very effective in
reaching the most vulnerable groups and communities, it was too small to prevent the
development and expansion of pockets of long-term poverty. The SIEP was the primary
instrument with which the Bank supported the Government's efforts to assist these people
and communities to alleviate poverty. The SIEP intended to make more resources
available to these communities for demand driven projects. It supported a broad
spectrum of activities aiming at reducing long-term poverty and accelerating social
capital formation in these vulnerable communities. The SIEP was to introduce
community driven development to enhance the use of these additional resources.

The CAS argued that by supporting community driven development in poor
communities and municipalities, the SIEP would prepare the ground for the third
Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL III). After the expected improvements in local
capacities to respond to economic and social challenges to be supported by the SIEP, the
Project was to catalyze and facilitate the development of the PAL III to focus on labor
market and social policies, with particular attention to long-term sustainability of the
social protection system, and the restructuring and consolidation of the health and
education sectors.

Preparing for EU accession, a priority of the CAS, was also to be addressed through
the overall strengthening of the Social Investment Fund (SIF) and the Employment
Agency (EA) to be supported by the Project. In addition to covering the immediate short
and medium-term poverty alleviation objectives, strong SIF and EA were to grow into
broader instruments for channeling EU structural funds.           Building appropriate
instruments for implementing EU structural funds was one of the significant accession
challenges for Bulgaria.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The PDO was worded differently in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and in the
Loan Agreement.

According to the Loan Agreement, the PDO was to reduce poverty and increase social
capital among the socially most vulnerable groups (long-term unemployed and ethnic
minorities) and poor communities through targeted interventions that fostered initiative
and self dependence in these communities.

  Regional Initiative Fund (Loan No. 4411-BUL), approved on 11/20/1998 and closed on 04/30/ 2001 was
the first World Bank-financed operation supporting the social sector of Bulgaria.




                                                 6
According to the Project Appraisal Document, the PDO was to improve the standard of
living of people who were locked in persisting pockets of poverty in Bulgaria,
concentrated regionally, among the long-term unemployed, and among specific ethnic
minorities (Roma, Turkish). The Project was to achieve its objective through
complementing the existing, relatively good social protection system by offering a range
of instruments, all focused on building the assets, individual and communal, of poor and
vulnerable people living in these pockets.

The Key Outcome Indicators were consistent in all documents. They were:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO remained unchanged.

The Results Framework for the original Loan also remained unchanged. However, as part
of Additional Financing approval, a slightly revised Results Framework was introduced.
The following Outcome Indicators were dropped from the Additional Financing Results
Framework: "Lower poverty headcount in targeted poor communities" and "Shorter
spells spent as unemployed or under the poverty line". At the same time one new
Indicator was introduced: Number of community level maintenance committees in place
with capacity to manage operation and maintenance of assets. Therefore, the revised
Results Framework for the Additional Financing was:

Overall
     More effective partnership between central government and local communities in
     addressing local problems (from beneficiary assessment);
     More vibrant community driven development in targeted poor communities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target groups of the Project were long-term unemployed and, among them,
specific ethnic minorities (Roma, Turkish). In practice, however, the Community
Infrastructure for Development Initiative (CIDI) Component benefited almost the entire
population from the participating municipalities.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The SIEP project had three components:

Component 1: The Community Infrastructure for Development Initiative (CIDI) (Total
baseline cost3  53. 60 million) addressed issues related to empowerment and integration
of targeted communities and of inadequate access to basic infrastructure and services, by
allowing communities to identify and manage development investments of greatest local
priority. It was expected that the investments would also lay the groundwork for
improved market access and human capital development--preconditions to enhancing
employment opportunities and reducing poverty.

The CIDI component supported provision of technical assistance, goods, and training to:
(i) improve delivery of social and economic services for the population in poor areas; and
(ii) enhance social capital, social awareness, and social institutional capacity of poor
communities and local governments to, among others, stimulate local development and
provide social services to the population in poor communities. It also provided small
grants through a participatory approach to support community and municipal sub-projects
to improve delivery of social and economic services for the population in poor areas. The
sub-projects also enhanced social capital, social awareness, and social institutional
capacity of poor communities and local governments to, among others, stimulate local
development and provide social services to the population in poor communities.

Component 2: The Bulgarian Active Labor Market Initiative (BALMI) (Total baseline
cost  11.50 million) identified medium-term economic and labor trends information and
provided active labor services to assist economically disadvantaged individuals in poor
communities to extend and use their human capital productively, particularly in the
context of changing economic and labor market conditions.

The BALMI component supported: (i) provision of technical assistance and goods to
assist unemployed individuals in poor communities to re-enter the labor market through
the development and use of a labor market information system; (ii) provision of active
labor services to unemployed individuals in poor communities, made available through
local employment bureaus throughout the Borrower's territory in accordance with the




3
    Total baseline cost includes original Project costs plus Additional Financing.

Operational Manual; and (iii) provision of technical assistance to carry out an impact
study related to the implementation, evaluation and results of Active Labor Services.

Component 3: Project Management (Total baseline cost  0.70 million) supported
provision of goods and technical assistance, including the financing of audit services for
the Project, and financing of incremental operating costs with respect to project
implementation.


1.6 Revised Components

In early 2006, the Government expressed its desire to continue its partnership with the
Bank in implementing EU-funded projects through the CIDI and BALMI frameworks.
The Government requested additional financing of Euro 15 million with a loan extension
of one year, to December 31, 2008. The request was justified by the need to finance
community investment programs in 2007 and 2008, while adjusting the role of Social
Investment Fund (SIF), originally established as a second tier budget holder entity within
the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MoLSP), to a project implementation agency
capable of facilitating the absorption of EU structural funds.

On the basis of good project performance, an Additional Financing in the amount of Euro
15 million was approved by the Board on March 2007 to scale up the CIDI component to
allow the SIF to adapt its structure, programs, and procedures for the purpose of
accessing other sources of funding for its activities, particularly EU structural funds.

It was expected that with additional financing the programs planned to be implemented
by the SIF would cover both gaps: (a) part of the SIF programming planned to benefit the
municipal-level, and (b) community level needs that were not covered under any of the
EU operational programs.

Given that the European Social Fund financed very limited amounts of infrastructure, and
CIDI's traditional municipal portfolio seemed to be excluded from the financing stream
of the various "Human Resources Operational Programs", SIF was to act as a
complementary financier of such programs for municipalities, while looking for non-
Bank sources of funds to continue this type of work.

The SIF Community Initiative sub-component linked well with the EU concept of
community in disadvantaged areas (e.g. the LEADER+4 concept). SIF was to contribute
by funding, through the Community Initiative, the establishment of LEADER+
community bodies by providing seed funds (micro project funds) to such communities
during 2007-2008, until EU funds become available.


4
  LEADER+ was one of the four initiatives financed by EU structural funds and was designed to help less developed
rural actors consider the long-term potential of their local region. Encouraging the implementation of integrated, high-
quality and original strategies for sustainable development, it had a strong focus on partnership and networks exchange
of expedience. The concept was fully in line and seemed to cover the same areas that SIF was targeting.



                                                          10
1.7 Other significant changes

Given the additional financing, the following changes were introduced:

   1. Euro 10 million was added to the CIDI Municipal Initiative sub-component to
      fund social infrastructure that was not covered by the EU financed programs
      normally covering infrastructure ­ examples of such infrastructure were
      municipal educational and health infrastructure, social homes, etc.
   2. Euro 5 million was added to the CIDI Community Initiative sub-component. The
      community financing sub-component was to focus on the EU model for funding
      disadvantaged communities and the LEADER+ approach. Close to 20 such
      community initiative groups had already been created, but this was insufficient to
      cover the whole country. Funding from the EU for these groups was not available
      before 2008. It was therefore agreed that SIF would finance: (i) technical
      assistance to micro projects to build communities eligible/able to apply for EU
      financing; and (ii) micro project seed funds to finance community development
      priorities as set up in the community development strategies under the LEADER+
      model.
   3. The Project was extended until December 31, 2008 and the disbursement schedule
      was revised to incorporate both the original loan and the Additional Financing.
   4. A new Procurement Plan was developed, including original Loan and Additional
      Financing, as well as increased thresholds for procurement methods and
      respective review thresholds. Increases were in line with the new regional
      thresholds.

The Additional Financing Loan became effective on November 9, 2007, 13 months
before the Project's revised closing date of December 31, 2008. Therefore, on December
11, 2008, the Government requested another extension of the closing date to complete
planned activities. The Bank agreed to extend the closing date for another year, to
December 31, 2009.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The Project encountered several factors that had an impact on its implementation and
outcomes.

    There were delays at the beginning of Project implementation due to the
    changes in the Government at that time.

    In 2004 and 2005 the Project experienced budget issues beyond the direct
    control of the implementing agencies. The budget ceiling established by the
    Ministry of Finance for expenditures from the loan and for co-financing,
    approved as part of the National Budget framework for 2004 and 2005, was
    significantly lower than the Project's needs and the projected disbursement
    plan. As a result, at the end of 2004 and the end of 2005, the Project was
    unable to pay against signed contracts. This lack of budget headroom left

                                          11
        small and medium contractors in the field without pay for a period of up to
        seven months. As a result, the Counterpart Funding rating for the Project was
        downgraded to Unsatisfactory.

        There were also delays in implementation of the Community Initiative sub-
        component under the CIDI due to lack of clarity on types of beneficiaries that
        could be funded from the loan. For example, trade unions wanted to bid for the
        Community Initiative projects, but were refused by the SIF Steering Committee5.
        This dispute delayed the implementation of the Community Initiative sub-
        component for nine months in 2006.

        There were significant delays in the implementation of activities under the
        BALMI component. The first contracts under this component were signed almost
        two years after the effectiveness of the Project.

        There was lack of information on some indicators under the Project. This has been
        documented in Aide Memoires and ISRs since the Mid-term Review of May 2005.


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) team rates project preparation,
design and quality an entry Moderately Satisfactory.

The background analysis supporting the Project was sound. The SIEP built on the
successful entry strategy into the sector, through the Regional Initiative Fund (RIF)
Project. The Project was designed with considerable attention to implementation
experience, and took into consideration lessons learned under the RIF as well as from the
updated Bulgaria 2001 Poverty Assessment. The SIEP was designed to directly support
key development objectives of the Bulgarian Government and, as such, was entirely
consistent with the Government's strategy.

There was an adequate commitment of the Government at the preparation of the
Project. To consolidate and systematize lessons learned from the RIF Project, the
Government and the World Bank conducted a series of seminars with social fund
stakeholders. The lessons learned were incorporated in the SIEP design.

The risk assessment assumptions made at appraisal reflected a good understanding of
the social sector in Bulgaria. The team identified well the main risks to Project
implementation and proposed adequate mitigation measures. These mitigation measures
have been implemented.




5
  SIF Steering Committee was in charge of approving policies, providing guidance and oversight of the SIF
administrative work, and endorsing SIF financial reports and any changes to the Operations Manual.



                                                   12
However, realism of the expectations at project design had moderate shortcomings. It
was not realistic for the team to think that one project would reduce poverty. On the
other hand, the ICR team recognizes that most projects prepared with the Bank's support
in the 1990s included very ambitious development objectives, often unlikely to be
achieved under a single project, and with difficulties to establish attribution.


2.2 Implementation

The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) team rates project
implementation as Satisfactory.

The Project was implemented over seven years and rated as Satisfactory throughout its
implementation, with the exception of a period in 2005 where it was rated as Moderately
Satisfactory due to the budgetary issues described in Section 2. The Project was never at
risk during implementation.

The Midterm Review (MTR) of the Project was carried out in May 2005. The MTR was
instrumental in taking stock of progress and serving as the basis for the Government to
request the Additional Financing and propose a revision of the Results Framework (as
discussed further below).

The Borrower requested Additional Financing based on sector dialogue and good
performance of the Project.    The Quality at Entry of the Additional Financing, which
looked into implementation aspects of the SIF operation, was reviewed by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG). The QAG Panel rated the Quality at Entry of this task as
Satisfactory. Key panel conclusions were:

   The Additional Financing was well prepared and well integrated into the overall Bank
   assistance strategy.
   The Project represented a good use of Additional Financing to build the capacity of
   the client to utilize substantial funding arriving from the EU in the near future.
   The Additional Financing helped ensure both a smooth transition to new financing
   and the sustainability of results from previous Bank investments.

During project implementation, the Bank team, signaled by the Borrower, brought up to
the Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) two cases of suspicious behavior by
companies participating in SIEP sub-project bids. The final report from INT on these
cases is not yet finalized and the team has no access to the draft.

Despite delays, described at the beginning of the section 2, overall the Project had a good
implementation record.




                                            13
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E are rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

The monitoring and evaluation arrangements described in the PAD were based on an
already developed M&E system by the Regional Initiative Fund (RIF) and supported by
the existing Management Information System (MIS). While the definition of selected
outcome indicators was found adequate to monitor progress toward achieving PDO, they
could not be monitored with the available instruments at SIF. The Team selected these
indicators believing that SIF would be able to monitor them by enhancing their M&E
system. However, the Mid-term Review conducted in May 2005 indicated that SIF was
unable to monitor outcome indicators "Lower poverty headcount in targeted poor
communities" and "Shorter spells spent as unemployed or under the poverty line" with
available monitoring instruments and country data. The results framework was modified
during the processing of the Additional Financing to enable appropriate measurement of
achievements.

The MIS was effective in monitoring Project implementation progress including sub-
project types, progress and quality of sub-projects, and financial and technical
compliance and outputs, but it was not able to monitor the Project's impact on poverty.
To compensate for the lack of relevant poverty data, the Borrower carried out two
beneficiary assessments. These assessments confirmed that the project was on target in
achieving majority of its Project Outcome Indicators, namely: More effective partnership
between central government and local communities in addressing local problems;
Increased number of beneficiaries utilizing improved infrastructure and services; More
comprehensive labor market and economic information available in three regions; and
Net impact of active labor market services significantly positive for majority of
participants. However these assessments were not sufficient in providing all necessary
data to enable measuring achievements of all Outcome Indicators. Therefore, a
standalone Impact Evaluation of the CIDI component was commissioned and completed
close to the end of the Project. The Impact Evaluation confirmed that, as described in
paragraph 3.2 and in Annex 5, the Project was achieving more vibrant community driven
development in targeted poor communities with targeted level of satisfaction with the
availability, quality of infrastructure, utilities and social support services provided
through the sub-projects, and responsiveness to community-felt needs.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard compliance is rated Satisfactory. The environmental category for this project
was F (Financial Intermediary). Design of civil works included an evaluation of their
environment impact and this was used as one of the criteria for sub-projects to be
financed. Supervision reports from environmental consultants confirmed that
environmental considerations were taken appropriately. No ecological or environmental
harm were caused in the process of implementing sub-projects. The sub-project sites
were either in built-up areas or outside villages. When underground structures were laid
on arable land or meadows, re-cultivation using humus was carried out, thus the soil was

                                          14
restored. In case that a completed sub-project was in a built-up area, the surroundings
were developed in relation to its purpose (parks, bowers, pavements, etc.). Sub-projects
that did not fit the requirements of the Government's Environmental Protection Act, the
Protected Areas Act, and the Water Law, were not financed.

Financial Management (FM) is rated Satisfactory. FM was rated Satisfactory
throughout implementation. The financial management aspects of the SIEP were
managed by the SIF, which was established as a second tier budget holder entity within
the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MoLSP). The SIF was responsible for FM,
including flow of funds, budgeting, accounting, reporting, and disbursements. The SIF
had experienced staff, capable of maintaining up to date records and preparing financial
management reports on a timely manner. Withdrawal applications were prepared
regularly and supporting documentation was complete. FM arrangements of the Project
were reviewed regularly and found to be satisfactory. The Project's audit reports were
submitted to the Bank within the agreed timeframe. No major issues were identified.
However, in 2006 and 2007 the auditors gave a qualified exception opinion given that
money was transferred from the Designated Account to the various sub-project
commercial accounts before the actual work on the sub-projects was performed. This
issue was discussed between SIF management and the Bank and it was agreed the SIF
would obtain the Bank's approval before any such transfers were made in the future. No
such transfers were made starting with 2008. The 2009 audit is expected to be finalized
before the end of June 2010.

Procurement is rated Satisfactory. Procurement was rated Satisfactory throughout
implementation. As specified in the PAD and the Operational Manual of the Project, the
overall responsibility for procurement activities, including planning and monitoring of
contract implementation belonged to SIF. Procurement activities performed under the
Project were done in accordance with agreed procurement methods and were considered
of satisfactory quality during implementation. The Operation Manual, as well as the
Procurement Plan was updated each year to reflect progress on the ground and any issues
rising during implementation.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Project built capacity of national and local governmental institutions to prepare and
manage self-standing social projects in infrastructure and services.

The activities implemented under the Community Infrastructure for Development
Initiative (CIDI) component were important for building the capacity of municipalities
and communities to prepare sub-project proposals, following specific program
requirements and qualifying criteria. Municipalities are now using the experience gained
under the SIEP to apply to the EU-funded Regional Development Operational Program.

The activities funded under the Bulgarian Active Labor Market Initiative (BALMI)
component revamped the funding approach of the Employment Agency and helped
Bulgaria meet specific labor market challenges. In addition, these activities prepared the


                                           15
country for effective use of EU funds in the area of labor markets. Finally, the Project
was successful in creating a package of ready programs for financing under the EU
Human Resources Development Operational Program (HRD OP). The Employment
Agency is now using the guidebooks and toolkits developed under the Project to run
similar programs. Through the beneficiary assessments, the local governments and
applicants to the EU program, reported knowledge gained under the BALMI component
as one of the main capacity-building tools for preparation of EU-financed projects.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

As previously stated, the Project's Development Objective was stated differently in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the Loan Agreement. At the same time, the
outcome indicators were consistent in all project documentation. An ECA_wide review
of compliance of PADs and Loan Agreements has reviewed SIEP, and concluded that the
PDO in the PAD was just an expanded, more verbose version of the PDO in the Loan
Agreement, with no difference in substance. The ICR team also concluded that since the
PDO difference was a matter of semantics and the outcome indicators for both were the
same, the ICR's outcome assessment would apply to either development objective. To
facilitate the preparation of this ICR, the PDO listed in the Loan Agreement is the one
used throughout the document.

 The ICR found that the Project's objective of "reducing poverty and increasing social
capital among the socially most vulnerable groups (long-term unemployed and ethnic
minorities) and poor communities through targeted interventions that foster initiative and
self dependence in these communities" was highly relevant and continues to be relevant
to the Bulgarian priorities and the Bank's strategy for the country. In its updated
National Reform Program 2008-2010 ­ a key requirement under the EU Lisbon Jobs and
Growth Strategy ­ Bulgaria has committed to continuing implementing fiscal and
structural reforms. Furthermore, the National Employment Strategy 2008-2015 adopted
by the Council of Ministers in April 2008, focuses on active labor market policies and
puts emphasis on capturing the long-term unemployed and other vulnerable groups.
Implementation of the strategy should help address skill gaps and enhance employment
prospects.

The Project's objective is also consistent with the three priority areas laid out in the
current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report No. 36146-BG):

a. Raising productivity and employment in support of private sector-led growth along
   the lines of the EU's Lisbon Agenda.
b. Fiscal sustainability and improved capacity for absorption of EU funds.
c. Poverty reduction and social inclusion.

However, as already indicated, it was not realistic to have poverty reduction as the
development objective of a single project.


                                           16
Project design, with two components, was relevant to the Development Objective and
country needs. Implementation arrangements were well designed based on previous
experience from Regional Investment Fund (RIF) Project. To consolidate and systematize
lessons learned from the RIF Project, the Government and the World Bank conducted a
series of seminars with social fund stakeholders. The lessons learned were incorporated
in the SIEP design.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of Project Development Objective (PDO) is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

Level of achievement of Outcome Indicators:

As discussed in the Monitoring and Evaluation section above, given that the Borrower
had not been able to monitor outcome indicators "Lower poverty headcount in targeted
poor communities" and "Shorter spells spent as unemployed or under the poverty line"
due to the lack of country data, the Results Framework was revised at the time of the
Additional Financing and these indicators were dropped while one new indicator was
introduced "Number of community level maintenance committees in place with capacity
to manage operation and maintenance of assets." The evaluation of the achievement of
Project Development Objective was based on the review of all Outcome Indicators, for
the original Loan and for the Additional Financing; given that 70% of overall Project
financing was under the original Loan.

By Project closing, ten out of twelve outcome indictors had been either achieved or over-
achieved, while two were not measured, as described below:

       "More effective partnership between central government and local communities
       in addressing local problems" was achieved as measured by the decreased
       percent of canceled sub-projects (less than 1% versus 1% target).

       "More vibrant community driven development in targeted poor communities"
       was achieved as measured by the positive results of the Impact Evaluation of the
       CIDI component.

       "Number of beneficiaries utilizing improved infrastructure and services" was over
       achieved as measured by the number of beneficiaries having access to improved
       infrastructure services (231 municipalities/communities versus targeted 200
       municipalities/communities).

       "Number of community level maintenance committees in place with capacity to
       manage operation and maintenance of assets" was over achieved as measured by
       101 maintenance committees established compared to 64 targeted. (added under
       the AF)


                                           17
   "Target beneficiary and program administrator assessments: attitudes towards
   each other; and at least 60% level of satisfaction with the availability, quality of
   infrastructure, utilities and social support services provided through the sub-
   projects, and responsiveness to community-felt needs" was achieved as measured
   by the CIDI component Impact Evaluation (60% targeted value was reached).

   "Satisfactory technical audit showing that the completed micro-projects are being
   operated and used by the beneficiaries for the intended purposes" achieved as
   measured by 98% satisfactory audits conducted after completion of every
   completed sub-project.

   "Level of social capital and civic engagement in communities" was achieved as
   measured by the CIDI component Impact Evaluation. In particular, the Impact
   Evaluation points to: (i) improved conditions for easier movement of people with
   disabilities (treatment group 75.5%, compared to 47.3% in comparison group);
   (ii) improved health status of people in social establishments was 75% versus
   42.2% for comparison group; and (iii) the effect on a higher level of involvement
   and solidarity among the people for the treatment group is 82.4% while for the
   comparison group it is 73.7%.

   "More comprehensive labor market and economic information available in three
   regions" was achieved as measured by BALMI component output indicators: (i)
   short-term labor market survey designed and pilot tested; (ii) semi-annual surveys
   completed in three Oblasts; and (iii) administrative framework, including
   information system automated management in place to manage service
   contractors and provide gross impact evaluation data.

   "Active labor market services provided to about 25,000 unemployed with gross
   registered employment/job creation data" was partially achieved based on the
   achievement of the following indicators:

   (i) Employment Services: Over achieved placement rate of 31.1% (versus 25%
        target).
   (ii) Retraining: Over achieved placement rate of 43% (versus 40% target) for
        institutional training; and 81.7% for on the job training (versus 75% target).
   (iii)Small Business Assistance: Not achieved. Only 0.3% business start-up versus
        5% targeted; 0% of business survival rate after one year for incubators while
        the target was 90% survival rate.

   "Net impact of active labor market services significantly positive for majority of
   participants' was achieved as measured by beneficiary assessment.

3.3 Efficiency

An economic analysis of the Project was not carried out at its completion. At the same
time, the SIEP was in general considered to be efficient in terms of organization, process
and cost of implementing the works. Its tenders produced final prices that were in many
cases considered the lowest on the market or in comparison to the tendering procedures
under the national procurement law. One example is that SIEP staff claims the cost they
were getting for changing window frames (e.g. of schools) with energy-efficient PVC
frames were the lowest offered in the country. It is seen from the data available that the
sub-projects, especially during the last two rounds, took one year or less from Steering
Committee approval to its completion and on average less than 50 days from the date of
the tender to beginning of implementation of the construction works on site.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Project had two overarching development objectives, both focused on the socially
vulnerable groups: (i) reducing poverty and (ii) increasing social capital. Regarding the
first objective, due to the lack of data and other relevant evidence on the Project's
contribution to poverty reduction, the ICR team was unable to determine whether the
Project achieved this part of the objective. Regarding the second objective, on the basis
of the outcome indicators (discussed above and in Annex 2), the ICR team concluded that
the Project's impact on social capital was satisfactory. Overall, given the Project's high
relevance to country priorities, alignment with the CAS, and achievement of its
outcome indicators, the ICR team concluded that the project's achievement of the PDO
is Moderately Satisfactory.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Based on the results of the Impact Evaluation of the CIDI component, the Project
successfully reached the poorest groups in Bulgaria and promoted social development by
empowering beneficiaries. Key relevant conclusions of the evaluation include: (i) 54%
of funds or 51% of sub-projects were directed to the poorest population; (ii) access to
services and basic infrastructure improved - 75% of social services beneficiaries claimed
that their health condition improved and 75.5% claimed that conditions for easier
movement of disabled significantly improved; and (ii) the beneficiaries felt 25% more
empowered than their peers in comparison group.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The SIEP made a major contribution in building the capacity of municipalities and
communities for the preparation of project proposals, following specific program
requirements and qualifying criteria. Municipalities are now able to apply to the EU-

                                           19
funded Regional Development Operational Program. Based on survey conducted in
November 2009, 99 percent of Communities and Municipalities applied directly for EU
structural funds after receiving SIF support.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The ICR team rates the risk to development outcome as moderate as the Project
significantly contributed to preparing Bulgaria to tap into resources from the European
Union to continue supporting municipalities and the labor program. The activities
supported by the Project prepared the country for effective use of EU funds in the area of
labor markets and ensured that the country is ready to tap on these resources. A package
of programs ready for financing under the EU programs was developed and the
Employment Agency is already using the guidebooks and toolkits from BALMI to run
similar programs. Municipalities are using the experience gained under the SIEP and are
applying to the EU-funded Regional Development Operational Program.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The ICR team rates Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry as Moderately
Satisfactory, based on the following: (i) consistency with Government's priorities and the
objectives of the CAS and 2001 Poverty Assessment; (ii) assessing risks realistically and
including appropriate mitigating measures in project design; (iii) ensuring
implementation capacity of the institutions involved; and (iv) extensive experience in
social protection and related areas in Bulgaria via investment and adjustment lending.
The team was also broad based, incorporating needed expertise. The shortcoming
identified in the preparation was the Results Framework of the Project. As discussed
earlier, on one hand the Project's Development Objective itself was overly ambitious and,
on the other, the number of outcome indicators was too broad and some not measurable
by available data. Additionally, many indicators lacked targets.

As already mentioned, the Quality at Entry of the Additional Financing was reviewed by
the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). The QAG Panel rated the quality at entry of this
task as overall Satisfactory.


                                           20
(b) Quality of Supervision


Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during implementation is rated as Satisfactory. During Project
supervision, the team provided good guidance to ensure smooth implementation of
activities, including maintaining a strong and open policy dialogue in the social sector.
The team provided technical advice in an effective and timely fashion.

Supervision inputs and processes were adequate. Given that the Task Team Leader
(TTL) was based in the Bulgaria country office, his permanent presence provided for
continuity, helped to support ongoing supervision as well as promoted continuous policy
dialogue with main counterparts.

Regular procurement and financial management reviews were carried out. The
procurement specialist, also based in the field office, was able to timely respond to the
Borrower's requests and procurement generally proceeded satisfactorily. There was
adequate support from the Bank's financial management specialists. The implementation
reviews provided detailed assessment of the Project progress and useful recommended
actions.

The Mid-term Review (MTR) was instrumental in taking stock of progress and served as
the basis of the Government's request for Additional Financing and revision of Results
Framework.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The team was effective in ensuring consistency with Government's priorities and the
objectives of the CAS and 2001 Poverty Assessment; assessing risks realistically and
including appropriate mitigating measures in project design; and ensuring
implementation capacity of the institutions involved. The team provided technical advice
in an effective and timely fashion. The turn-around times and responsiveness to client's
request were adequate, and the overall support appreciated by the client. Nevertheless,
the overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory due to the
shortcomings identified during project preparation.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                           21
Overall Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The Government
demonstrated strong ownership during project preparation, including readiness for
implementation, and appropriate implementation arrangements and capacity.

At the same time, there were two key shortcomings in Government's performance which
negatively affected project implementation:         (i) during 2003/2004, early into
implementation, Government changes caused delays in the start-up of activities; and (ii)
in 2004 and 2005 there were budgetary restrictions resulting in counterpart shortages.
The budget ceiling established by the Ministry of Finance for expenditures from the loan
and for co-financing, approved as part of the National Budget framework was
significantly lower than the Project's needs and the projected disbursement plan.
Therefore, for a couple of months, the Project was unable to disburse against
commitments.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the Social Investment Fund (SIF) is assessed as Satisfactory. SIF
was appropriately staffed with qualified and experienced staff. SIF managed the Project
in a satisfactory manner and was able to timely resolve implementation issues.

Procurement activities were done in accordance with agreed procurement methods and
were of satisfactory quality. Although, there were changes of procurement staff, this did
not cause any disruption in the procurement processes and activities, given that the
institutional memory was well maintained. SIF representatives always participated in the
evaluation committees at the municipality level thus assuring permanently good technical
quality. SIF organized regular procurement seminars for the beneficiaries which helped
ensure smooth implementation.

SIF carried out Financial Management responsibilities in a satisfactory manner, as
already discussed in section 2.4.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the performance of the borrower is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The
implementing agency (SIF) managed the Project in a satisfactory manner and was able to
timely resolve implementation issues under its control. But as mentioned, there were
some shortcomings in overall Government's performance which negatively affected
project implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

    The design of successful social investment fund type projects should include: (i)
    substantial beneficiary consultations to ensure full ownership; (ii) a diverse SIF


                                           22
        oversight board to avoid perceptions that political influence is a determinant of
        sub-project prioritization; (iii) communications campaigns to ensure that
        systematical information reaches potential beneficiaries; (v) technical assistance
        to communities to ensure proper implementation; and (vi) dissemination about
        project achievement to the general public to enlist continuous support.

     Well-designed sub-projects can simultaneously create short-term jobs and
     improve infrastructure and facilities that are critical to preserving country's
     human resources. Well-targeted micro-projects can be a particularly useful
     instrument at the time of economic crisis to ensure employment and keep families
     from falling into poverty.

     Sub-projects can contribute to country's broader efforts to decentralize the
     provision of public goods and services to local governments in a way that also
     helps local governments fight poverty. The experience of social funds around the
     world suggests that delegation of sub-project preparation and implementation
     tasks to local governments bodes well for greater benefits in terms of local
     governance, accountability, local capacity building and sustainability of local
     services.
     Indicators for the achievement of project outcomes need to be selected from those
     available sources of data that are periodical enough to enable measuring of
     outcomes by project closing.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Community Infrastructure for Development Initiative (CIDI) ­ (Actual cost  65.22
million, of which  53.90million IBRD)

The primary aim of the CIDI component was to improve the delivery of social and
economic services, and enhance social capital and capacity of poor communities and
local governments by financing small-scale demand-based initiatives primarily in the
social sectors. This included rehabilitation of old and construction of new basic
infrastructure stimulating local development, such as - water and sewerage; roads; market
places, erosion control mechanisms etc.; as well as infrastructure directly linked to the
provision of social services to the population, such as centers for the disabled, social care
centers, schools; health facilities; community centers.

Two sub-components were part of CIDI:

   1) Community Initiative sub-component - promoted a new approach to community
      development in Bulgaria by providing an opportunity for communities to
      participate in the identification, preparation, and implementation of their own
      development in collaboration with government agencies, NGOs and private
      sector.
   2) Municipality Initiative sub-component ­ provided financing to municipalities to
      implement more technically complex, multi-community projects.

The objective of the component was achieved as evidenced by:

        Over achieved outcome indicator: 231 municipalities benefited from improved
        infrastructure services (against the target 200).
As a result of the Project interventions 712,000 people benefited through 468 municipal
(111communities were linked to the tap water or received improvements in the quality of
their water supplies or sewerage systems; 157 schools and kindergartens were refurbished
to provide better learning conditions for children and to gain energy efficiency benefits;
150 municipal social centers, facilities for disabled people, orphanages and elderly homes
were improved for the benefit of their inhabitants; 6 local markets were established; 2
local roads built; and 42 landscapes improved) and 121 community sub-projects in 231
municipalities. The unit cost per beneficiary was US$ 110.

        Achieved outcome indicator: Level of satisfaction of beneficiaries and program
        administrators reached targeted 60%.
The impact evaluation confirmed that the level of satisfaction of beneficiaries and
program administrators reached targeted 60%. The attitudes towards the executed sub-
projects are as a whole positive. It is believed that the sub-projects significantly improved
the environment in which citizens live and children study, and have been in the interest of
disadvantaged people. School, kindergarten and social establishment projects had the
strongest social impact. The largest positive effects were observed in the change of the
health status of the respondents and the change in the conditions for easier movement of
the disabled. The program administrators and beneficiaries unanimously believe that the


                                             25
Project helped solving problems concerning, most of all, the defenseless groups of the
society (children, pupils, retired people, the jobless, disabled, etc).6

        Achieved outcome indicator: Satisfactory technical audit showing that the
        completed sub-projects are being operated and used by the beneficiaries for the
        intended purposes.
Technical audits of all sub-projects were conducted by the SIF and random audits by the
Bank consultants. These technical audits confirmed that 98% of completed sub-projects
are being operated and used by the beneficiaries for the intended purposes.

        Achieved outcome indicator: Level of social capital and civic engagement in
        communities.
In particular, the Impact Evaluation points to: improved conditions for easier movement
of people with disabilities (treatment group 75.5%, compared to 47.3% in comparison
group); improved health status of people in social establishments was 75% versus
42.2% for comparison group; and the effect on a higher level of involvement and
solidarity among the people for the treatment group is 82.4% while for the comparison
group it is 73.7%.
The average labor content in sub-project was 27.25%. 1,805 people were hired from lists
of long-term unemployed. The average wage in micro-projects was 61% of national
average with 30.26% of sub-project wage going to unskilled workers.
In addition, under the community financing sub-component, more than 70 community
partnerships and/or organizations were established and trained to prepare and apply for
project funding.

         Achieved outcome indicator: Number of community level maintenance
         committees in place with capacity to manage operation and maintenance of
         assets. 101 maintenance committees, from completed community sub-projects,
         are operational and are managing maintenance of assets.


Bulgarian Active Labor Market Initiative (BALMI) (Actual cost  13.97 million, of
which  11.50 million IBRD)

The objective of the Active BALMI component was to increase productivity and reduce
poverty by assisting unemployed economically disadvantaged individuals in poor
communities, and to extend and use their human capital in response to changing
economic and labor market conditions.

The BALMI provided a range of services (e.g. employment services, retraining, small
business assistance, and local economic development planning) to the unemployed in
poor communities to assist them in rapidly re-entering the labor market.

The component was technically managed on a day-to-day basis by the Employment
Agency (EA) in cooperation with Local Employment Bureaus (LEB) and selected service
providers, and in cooperation with the SIF.

The objective of the component was partially achieved as evidenced by:

        Achieved outcome indicator: More comprehensive labor market and economic
        information available in three regions.
Administrative framework, including information automated management was put in
place to manage service contractors and provide gross impact evaluation data.

         Mostly achieved outcome indicator: Active labor market services provided to
         about 25,000 unemployed with gross registered employment/job creation data,
         based on the achievement of the following indicators:
(i) Employment Services: Over achieved placement rate of 31.1% (versus 25% target).
(ii) Retraining: Over achieved placement rate of 43% (versus 40% target) for institutional
     training; and 81.7% for on the job training (versus 75% target).
(iii)Small Business Assistance: Not achieved. Only 0.3% business start-up versus 5%
     targeted; 0% of business survival rate after one year for incubators while the target
     was 90% survival rate.
Active Labor market Services (ALMS) was delivered to approximately 25,000
unemployed through 695 ALMS contracts.

       Achieved outcome indicator: Net impact of active labor market services
       significantly positive for the majority of participants.

In addition, the ALMS Program contributed to strengthening the administrative
capacity of the Employment Agency (EA), Regional Employment Services.

The EA administrative capacity in the implementation new services that activate the
labor market has been strengthened as well as its capacity for adopting new ways and
more long-term perspectives for provision of employment and having to try new ideas
and methods, for enlarging and diversifying the range of active services that now
includes the services for local economical development planning and support of
entrepreneurship.

In addition, to the provision of active services, new methods and approached were
applied such as the introduction of the financial discipline of adhering to unit costs,
the system of applying financial penalties as a means of reaching the success rate
required by the SPs, introducing new responsibilities for Service Providers (SP), such
as achievement of employment success rate of beneficiaries serviced within the frame
of the contract, etc. This new requirement for the SP led to an increased
correspondence between delivered services and labor market demands, more efficient
training and improved motivation of unemployed people.




                                            27
There has been an improved quality of the services provided on the labor market,
including as a result of the use of good experts, involved in specific projects and the
creation of qualified local cadre.

The joint work of the EA staff, as part of the state administration, with NGOs was
activated; the relationship with social partners from other areas has improved;
partnerships with new companies and organizations which before were not
interrelated and did not before deliver services at the labor market have been created;
new partnerships exceeding the regional boundaries were created; the NGOs and the
private sector organizations involvement in the fight against the unemployment and
poverty has been increased. The program contributed to the development of specific
skills for working with the social partners, for opening to the external business
environment and acquiring skills for negotiation, building on team work and decision
taking.

The ALMS Program can be seen as a step forward in the decentralization of the
decision making process - delegation of more rights to the regional and local
structures of the EA has been realized in the assessment of project proposals,
contracting, monitoring and evaluation of the contract implementation

Detailed guidelines have been developed, with procedures and instructions enhancing
program implementation at all levels, as well as an instrument for collection of
comprehensive and accurate data on beneficiaries serviced and placement into
employment, sustainable mechanisms and well practiced procedure have been
prepared and are appropriate for management of similar programs in the future.

For the purpose of assisting the transition from the ALMS program to the EU
financed Human Resources Development (HRD) Program training courses were
organized and delivered throughout 2008. As a result, more than 140 managers and
staff from the EA systems:
     were trained on relevant topics with a view to their future work on HRD
         Program,
     systematized their knowledge on the European and national framework for
         utilizing EU Structural Funds,
     gained an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the HRD Program,
     discussed in detail the mechanisms for coordination and subordination among
         the different units of the EA in implementing HRD Program,
     improved their skills and knowledge in evaluating project proposals and
         carrying out monitoring and control of projects funded under the HRD
         Program,
     had the opportunity to discuss common issues and to reach an agreement on
         the solution of specific or similar problems in the implementation of HRD
         Program,
     gained an in-depth understanding of the role of the EA as an intermediate
         body for HRD Program and have enhanced their motivation as civil servants
         working in a new and priority area.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Impact evaluation of the Community Infrastructure for Development Initiative (CIDI)
component was done in November 2009 by MicroStat Analytics Ltd and Alpha Research
Ltd.

The following summary is taken from the Impact Evaluation report.

Targeting
The allocation of the CIDI resources towards the target group of the poor population was
good, although the allocation of the funds could have been more concentrated.

Access to services and basic infrastructure

The impact of the CIDI on the beneficiaries of the schools and the social establishments
was positive, because the net effects concerning almost all the indicators measured were
positive, and in the cases where the net effects were negative, the difference was
statistically insignificant.

The quality research performed confirmed the results from the quantity research.

The attitudes towards the executed sub-projects were as a whole positive. It was believed
that the sub-projects significantly improved the environment in which: 1) citizens live
and 2) children study and have been 3) thoroughly in the interest of disadvantaged people.

The Schools and kindergartens and the Social establishments sub-projects have the
strongest social impact. The initiators and beneficiaries of the sub-projects unanimously
believe that the interventions solved urgently important problems concerning, most of all
the defenseless groups of society (children, pupils, retired people, the jobless, disabled
people etc).

Empowerment

The CIDI component had a positive net effect on empowerment. Such effect was
observed in all aspects of empowerment ­ initiation, participation (inclusion), influence
on the decision-making process, conditions for social and professional realization and
access to social services. The net effect from the CIDI component impact was the
strongest in the target groups ­ the vulnerable groups of the population with low degree
of education, the Roma and the Turkish, the unemployed, the people of poor material
status.

Municipality-Community sub-projects

The comparison between the municipality and the community sub-projects of the CIDI
component showed that the net effect on empowerment (initiation, inclusion, and
influence on the decision-making process) in the case of the municipality sub-projects


                                              32
was higher than in the case of the community sub-projects. This was also confirmed by
the change of the access to social services and basic infrastructure.

While in the case of the community sub-projects the net effects concerning the change in
the conditions for social and professional realization, the education and the health
services were higher, in the case of the municipality sub-projects higher net effects were
observed with respect to the change in the infrastructure and the access to social services.
In the case of the community sub-projects the vulnerable social groups participated more
actively in the processes of initiation and execution of projects, while in the municipal
ones the local authorities had a leading role in the processes.

The evaluations, by the beneficiaries as well as by the representatives of the
municipalities, the schools, the kindergartens, the social establishments and the non-
government organizations, with respect to the necessity and the effectiveness of the CIDI
component sub- projects were equal and close to the maximum for both types of sub-
projects.

On the other hand, the municipal sub-projects were in a more favorable position as far as
the raising of funds for co-funding was concerned, while the community sub-projects
faced quite greater difficulties. In order to execute the community sub-projects, the non-
government organizations sought for the support of mainly two parties: the local
authorities and the territorial directorates of the labor bureaus. The coordination of
activities and securing co-funding turn out to be two most difficult components in the
process of projects' execution.

Although, the representatives of the vulnerable groups were included in the processes of
initiation and execution of the sub-projects, local authorities as well as the representatives
of the nongovernment organizations and institutions towards which the sub-projects were
directed had the leading role.

The evaluation of the necessity and the effectiveness of CIDI sub-projects were much
higher than in the case of other similar sub-projects.

Mr. Florian Fichtl
Country Manager
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development

      Re.: Information on the completion of the Social Investment and
Employment Promotion Project, funded by the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development through state investment loans No. 4681-0 BUL
and No. 4681-1 BUL


       Dear Mr. Fichtl:


During the January 1, 2003 ­ April 30, 2010 period, the Social Investment Fund (SIF) ­ a
second-level budget spending unit under the Minister of Labor and Social Policy, worked
on the implementation of the Social Investment and Employment Promotion Project
(SIEP), funded mainly through loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), amounting to 65.8 Million EUR (namely loans No. 4681-0 BUL
and No. 4681-1 BUL).

       SIEP had two main components:

   Component A ­ Municipal Infrastructure Development Initiative (MIDI), which
   in turn had two sub-components:

        Subcomponent A1 ­ Micro-projects on Social Capital Development in
        Small Communities in Disadvantaged Position ­ Non-Government
        Organizations (NGOs) were intermediaries (beneficiaries) under the
        projects;



                                          35
        Sub-component A2 ­ Micro-projects on Municipal Structure
        Development ­Municipalities were intermediaries (beneficiaries) under the
        projects.

   Component B ­ Bulgarian Active Measures on the Labor Market Initiative
   (BAMLMI) ­ the component was implemented by the Employment Agency and the
   activities under it were completed on December 31, 2008.

Initially, it was agreed that the implementation of SIEP would be funded with IBRD
funds, amounting to EUR 50.8 Million (loan No. 4681-0 BUL). As a result of the
outcomes achieved in implementing the project, in 2007 another EUR 15 Million (loan
No. 4681-1 BUL) was agreed on with IBRD, in the form of an additional loan for the
purpose of continuing the SIEP implementation.

       The following can be said in relation to the absorption of the funds:

       The utilization of the funds from the main loan No. 4681-0 BUL, amounting to
       EUR 50.8 Million was completed by December 31, 2008, when the amount of
       funds, spent reached EUR 50 754 832, or 99.91 %.
       The utilization of the funds under the additional loan 4681-1 BUL, amounting to
       EUR 15 Million, reached EUR 14 846 536 by April 30, 2010, or 99 %, as the
       funds, which were not absorbed equal 1 % of the loan amount.

       The Implementation of SIEP by components is as follows:

   1. Component A ­ Municipal Infrastructure Development Initiative

The total amount of utilized funds under Component A ­ Municipal Infrastructure
Development Initiative reaches BGN 126 527 080, of which BGN 103 758 667 are loan
funds and BGN 22 768 413 come from the state co-funding effort. Within this
Component, 468 micro-projects on Municipal Infrastructure Development have been
implemented (their total value reaches BGN 116 449 987.34, of which BGN 93 559
061.94 are funds from the loan) and 121 micro-projects on Social Capital Development
in Small Communities in Disadvantaged Position (at the amount of BGN 10 199 605 ­
all of it loan funds).

All of the 468 micro-projects on Municipal Infrastructure Development have been
completed within their deadlines. In order to establish the social value and the
sustainability of the financed projects under this substantial for SIEP sub-component, an
Inquiry was made among all 231 Municipalities, which have received SIEP funding in
the 2003 ­ 2009 period. The main conclusions, which can be drawn from the Inquiry, are
as follows:

       Of the total of 468 sites, funded under the Project, only in 2 municipalities, the
       funded sites have not retained their function, as intended according to the projects,
       proposed by the respective municipalities when applying for funding. This was
       an expected outcome of the Inquiry, as SIF used to have in place and implement a


                                            36
       strict system of research and checks before approving a specific micro-project for
       funding, and used to require and receive the respective assurances for the
       sustainability of the funded micro-projects.
       The improvement of living conditions and access to social services for a large
       number of people can be considered an undeniable success of the Project. The
       Inquiry shows that if at completion of the micro-projects, funded under the
       Project, the beneficiaries have been around 380 000 people, then towards the end
       of November, 2009 they numbered around 430 000 people, which shows an
       increase of over 13 %. The explanation of this outcome lies mainly in the drastic
       improvement of living conditions after the procurement of the construction and
       refurbishment works (CRW), as well as in the increased capacity of social
       services.
       A positive conclusion was drawn from the Inquiry, related to the degree of
       satisfaction of the inhabitants of a given municipality with the implementation of
       the respective micro-project (degrees: very high/high/average/low/unsatisfactory).
       In 61.1 % of the interviewed municipalities, the satisfaction of the local
       population is very high, 35.14 % of the interviewees have indicated high degree
       of satisfaction, 2.7 % - average, and only two municipalities have indicated low
       satisfaction and unsatisfied, respectively.

In conclusion, we can say that the responses to the Inquiry have confirmed the
satisfaction with the received funding and the implemented projects under SIEP,
expressed by many of the Mayors in the country.

At present, the officials of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) continue with
their efforts to complete the uncompleted micro-projects on Social Capital Development
in Small Communities in Disadvantaged Position. Their actual number is below 10 %,
which is a good achievement

       2. Component B ­ Bulgarian Active Measures on the Labor Market Initiative

Under Component B ­ Bulgarian Active Measures on the Labor Market Initiative
(AMLM), implemented by the Employment Agency (EA), the absorbed funds amount to
BGN 24 338 286, of which BGN 19 506 613 are loan funds, and BGN 4 831 673 ­
state co-funding. The implementation of the projects under this component was
completed on December 31, 2008.

During the 2005 ­ 2008 period, in which the AMLM Program was implemented, services
were provided, targeted at permanent unemployment (in-depth employment services),
structural unemployment (on-the-job- training, institutional qualification and re-
qualification), as well as the lack of demand for labor (services in support of small
businesses, incubators and Grants on planning local economic activities). The realized
services are as follows:

   1. Employment services
   2. Vocational training services
   3. Support provision to small businesses


                                           37
   4. Virtual business incubator
   5. Leased business incubator
   6. Assisting the planning process at the local economic level

The AMLM Program has implemented a total of three cycles of service delivery. For the
overall implementation and implementation control, the basic reporting and
implementation monitoring rules have been applied. Each project was required to reach
certain levels of efficiency, to cover main achievement indicators, and thus have
permanent impact on the beneficiaries under the project. The number of hired
unemployed persons under all projects was reported, as well as the number of persons,
who have acquired vocational training, the number of persons, for whom jobs have been
arranged, as the final objective was to have a permanent impact on the degrees of
overcoming unemployment.

The AMLM Program started on July 1, 2005. In the course of the implementation of the
Program, a total of 2077 project proposals have been submitted. As a result of the three
cycles of implementation of the Program, contracts have been signed under a total of 695
projects: I cycle ­ 269 contracts signed; II cycle ­ 313 contracts signed and III cycle ­
114 contracts signed. The total amount of funding was BGN 26 411 849, and by cycles,
it is as follows: I cycle ­ BGN 10 147 033,56; II cycle ­ BGN 10 947 458,08; III cycle ­
BGN 5 317 357, 36. Services have been provided to a total of 21 203 unemployed
persons under the Program, which approximately reaches 84.8 % of the target number
(25 000).

During the first cycle, 625 project proposals have been submitted. 269 contracts have
been signed. The approved proposals are as follows:

       18 contracts for employment services (ES);
       141 contracts for vocational training services (VTS);
       110 contracts for local economic development planning (LEDP);

      9 740 unemployed have been included under these programs, which presents
39 % of the target number (25 000 unemployed persons).

Under the second cycle under the AMLM Program, a total of 1 096 proposals have been
submitted in 9 regions, and 313 contracts have been signed, as follows:

       36 contracts for employment services;
       152 contracts for vocational training services;
       3 contracts for on­the-job training;
       122 contracts for provision of services on planning at the local economic level;

The contracts, signed with providers of services during the second cycle under the
AMLM Program were by 16 % more, compared to the contracts, and signed during the
first cycle. During the second cycle, 8 278 unemployed have been included, which
presents 32 % of the total target number. In the course of contract fulfillment under this
cycle, jobs have been arranged for 2 831 persons. The total number of realized

                                           38
employment at the national level was 30.3 % for ES; 46.2 % for VTS and 55.9 % for
LEDP.

The total number of concluded contracts within the first two cycles under the AMLM
Program has been: 296 on vocational training services; 54 on employment services; and
232 on local economic development planning services. A total of 16 320 unemployed
persons, presenting 65 % of the target number of beneficiaries, have been included in the
program. The total number of beneficiaries, to whom services have been provided, is 34
312 persons.

In 2007 and until the end of 2008, the projects from the third cycle of the Program were
implemented. Three new services have been provided: Support provision to small
businesses (SPSB) ­ funding of consulting services and training; Leased business
incubator (LBI) ­ provision of square footage, equipment and services and Virtual
business incubator (VBI) ­ provision of services on starting up or development of small
businesses. A total of 356 project proposals have been submitted, of which: 222 on
SPSB; 27 on LBI and 107 on VBI. 114 contracts have been concluded as follows
        76 contracts on Support provision to small businesses(SPSB);
        32 contracts on Leased business incubator (LBI);
        6 contracts on Virtual business incubator (VBI)

The persons, who have received services within this cycle have been 4 337, as 389
persons have started their own business, and jobs have been arranged for 461 persons.

After reviewing the data on the outcomes of the Program, related to the direct
beneficiaries (number of beneficiaries, who have received services, persons, who have
been arranged jobs, etc.), we can draw the conclusion that the AMLM Program has been
one of the most successful programs, implemented by the Employment Agency, as the
percentage of successful projects is approximately 89 %.

Overall, the implementation of the Social Investment and Employment Promotion Project
is rated high not only because of the high absorption of loan funds, but also because of
the excellent results achieved. Extremely important for these results was the successful
cooperation between the MLSP structures and the beneficiaries under the project.

The cooperation between SIF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development was very intense and fruitful, and without any doubt played a very positive
role in meeting the objectives of the Social Investment and Employment Promotion
Project. In this relation, I would like to express my personal and my team's gratitude for
your huge support, efficient leadership and cooperation throughout the years of
implementation of SIEP. I would also like to express through you my gratitude to your
team, and more specifically to Mr. Peter Pojarski, Mrs. Blaga Djurdjin, Mrs. Albena
Samsonova, Mr. Bogdan Constantinescu, Mrs. Egli Ilich and Mrs. Lidia Vukich for their
professional guidance, efforts and help, which made SIEP successful.

Allow me once again to thank you for the support, which the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development provide to us for the successful conducting of key
social policies.


Respectfully yours,
