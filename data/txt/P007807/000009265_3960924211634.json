The main project objectives were\n            only partially achieved, since only 57 percent of the total\n            was disbursed. It is clear that the satisfactory\n            agricultural performance was coupled with sometimes marginal\n            institutional performances during appraisal and\n            implementation. The local agencies and the Bank did show\n            flexibility in their approach to implementation problems,\n            agreeing to transfers of financing among the project\n            categories, postponements of the closing date, and\n            adjustments in activities affecting the execution of certain\n            components; nevertheless, certain misjudgments are evident\n            in project organization and management, and in the financial\n            appraisal of Banana Corporation of the Pacific (COBAPA) and\n            the efforts of local agencies to identify management\n            formulas for the plantations and the palm oil processing plant."}, "docdt": "1988-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
