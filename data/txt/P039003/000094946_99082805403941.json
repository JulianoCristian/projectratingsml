benefits,\n            including those from increased tourism, has been affected\n            largely by exogenous factors, principally the effects of the\n            breakup of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. Project\n            sustainability is likely given the successful commissioning\n            of key project facilities, the Rizana Water Work's\n            continued strong operational performance, the resumption of\n            growth in the Slovenian economy, improved prospects for the\n            revival of tourism, and Slovenia's progress in\n            accession within the European Union. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory in all stages of the\n            project cycle. The main lessons from the project are: Pay\n            particular attention to forecasting water sales in\n            environments where macroeconomic and structural reforms are\n            being undertaken in view of the impact of the reform on\n            industrial restructuring, and consequently, on industrial\n            and commercial demand for water. Successful programs for\n            reduction of unaccounted-for-water require strong Borrower\n            commitment, and a well-designed and well-supported program\n            of action. Where the Bank deems it fit to include financial\n            performance covenants, it should pay greater attention to\n            ensuring effective financial supervision, including\n            commitment of the necessary staff and budgetary resources."}, "docdt": "1999-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
