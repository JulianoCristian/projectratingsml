Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. The lessons learned included: 1)\n            The key procurement lesson learnt from RT2 is the need to\n            support Vietnam's development and adherence to a modern\n            competitive procurement practice, one that leads to\n            transparency and accountability; 2) Future operations should\n            adopt a more flexible approach, based on improved national\n            standards, to provide greater technical guidance to\n            provinces on standards and surface specification. Further\n            work also needs to be done to monitor the trials and\n            complete the economic analysis to support these decisions\n            and undertake trials in the three remaining geographic areas\n            of Vietnam; 3) Institutional development can only be\n            effective when based on a sound analysis of the\n            institutional mandates, incentives and capacity of the\n            agencies responsible for rural transport in Vietnam; 4) The\n            long term international consultants had limited impact due\n            to their central location and a lack of local knowledge and\n            language skills. Future projects should rely more on local\n            consultants based regionally; 5) Based on RT2 experience a\n            network approach to maintenance should be adopted that\n            provides provinces with clear incentives to increase\n            recurrent financing to ensure sufficient maintenance\n            funding; and 6) The development of the private sector was\n            particularly successful primarily because it focused on\n            providing a market for small-scale contractors. This\n            approach should be continued in future."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
