the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) in\n            Niger. The objectives of the project were aimed at improving\n            economic and financial management by: (i) reinforcing\n            controls on public expenditures;( ii) improving the revenue\n            collection system;( iii) restructuring the public service\n            sector; (iv) inducing economic growth by improving the\n            incentives framework for the private sector; (v) improving\n            the resource allocation process; (vi) improving policies for\n            the management of human and physical resources; and (vii)\n            improving the quality and implementation of the public\n            investment program. Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) the assessment\n            of ERCs in such cases would require that the credit be\n            judged on its own merit, rather than being clouded by the\n            progress of otherwise long term continuing reforms; (b) a\n            better understanding of the need and rational for reforms by\n            the different political, interest and pressure groups and to\n            ensure greater assimilation and ownership within the\n            administration; (c) the setting of reform objectives and the\n            timetable for their implementation must be realistic and\n            take into account the risks inherent in a pluralistic\n            political situation where coalition-building and consensual\n            decision making are the name of the game; and (d) in the\n            final analysis, the success of a reform program and its\n            effective implementation depend to a large extent on the\n            political will and unequivocal commitment of the government\n            to undertake reforms, the existing institutional capacity to\n            implement the reforms, a realistic design of the program\n            taking into account local absorptive capacity, and an\n            adequate awareness of the stakeholders of the need for reforms."}, "docdt": "1996-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
