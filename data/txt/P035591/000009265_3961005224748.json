The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post-devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy, and, more particularly, the measures aimed at\n            minimizing the negative social impact of the devaluation in\n            the short-term; and to provide the necessary financial\n            assistance during the transition period in which follow-up\n            operations are being prepared to support further structural\n            and sectoral reforms. The Nigerian government has already\n            taken a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures\n            to regain and consolidate competitiveness. The credit is\n            designed to support the implementation of these measures in\n            1994. The major measures are: (a) the devaluation of the CFA\n            franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1 FF; (b) tax measures to\n            increase fiscal revenue; (c) a substantial program of social\n            measures to attenuate the effects of the devaluation on\n            vulnerable groups, including increasing significantly in\n            real terms current expenditure for health and education; (d)\n            prudent demand management policies to reduce absorption by\n            the public sector and limit wage increases; and (e)\n            reduction of external tariffs."}, "docdt": "1994-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
