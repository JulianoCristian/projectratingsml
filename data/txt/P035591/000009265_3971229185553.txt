Credit Objectives
The ERC seeks to assist the Government of Niger to deepen its
adjustment strategy, to ensure that the gains in competitiveness are
consolidated, that social sector expenditures for 1994 are protected in
real terms, and the adverse effects of the devaluation on vulnerable
groups is minimized.
Credit Description
The African Members of the Franc zone decided to devalue their
currency the CFA franc, effective January 12, 1994. The Proposed
credit would support the post-devaluation reform program for 1994 as
outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policy
dated February 28, 1994, whose main objectives are private sector led
growth and the alleviation of poverty. The Nigerien Government has
already taken a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures to
regain and consolidate competitiveness. These measures include: (i)the
devaluation of the CFA franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1FF; (ii)a sharp
increase in public investment expenditures in real terms, and the
preparation of a three-year investment program for 1994-96; (iii)a
program of social measures to mitigate the effects of the devaluation on
vulnerable groups; (iv) prudent demand management policies to reduce
public sector absorption and limit public wage increases; (v) the
reduction and simplification of the tariffs and domestic taxation; and
(vi) the protection of social sector expenditures in real terms. The
ERC is designed to support implementation of these measures in 1994.
Implementation arrangements (Procurement and disbursement)
The proposed Credit would be of SDR18.2 million (US$ million
equivalent). Due to the urgent nature of the operation the entire
credit is proposed for disbursement in a single tranche shortly after
effectiveness.   Proceeds of the credit would reimburse 1009 of the



foreign exchange costs of eligible imports, of public or private sector
origin, except for negative list and imported goods already funded under
bilateral or multilateral credits. The proposed date of eligibility
would be set in light of the Government's preparation of a deepened
austerity program in August 1993. In order to permit timely
disbursements in the amounts needed to keep to program targets, the full
amount of the credit would be eligible to retroactive financing. August
2, 1993, is proposed as the cut-off date for retroactive financing.
Environmental Category
In conformity with IDA policies for adjustment operations, no
environmental rating has been assigned. However, the operation would be
consistent with IDA policy and would follow acceptable IDA
procedures.
