The project provides for:  (i)\n            construction of about 1,000 km of rural roads; as well as\n            (ii) rehabilitation and improvement of about 2,000 km of\n            existing rural roads.  It furthermore includes (iii)\n            consulting services and related technical support to carry\n            out detailed engineering and to upgrade the administrative\n            and implementation capabilities of the executing agency."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
