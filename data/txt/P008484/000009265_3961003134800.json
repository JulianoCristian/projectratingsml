by\n            supporting the Government's program of restructuring\n            the health sector to focus on more effective interventions;\n            and (b) to provide more efficient and higher quality care by\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the health\n            sector in policy-making, management and evaluation. The\n            project provides technical assistance, fellowships,\n            training, preparation of studies, development of health\n            programs, computer hardware and software, medical and office\n            furniture, equipment, teaching materials, refurbishment of\n            facilities and incremental recurrent costs. Health sector\n            restructuring will focus on more effective interventions\n            through strategic investments in public health and selected\n            institutional services. It will complement ongoing reforms\n            financed by other international donors that aim to\n            strengthen community services, primary care and the private\n            health care sector. The project supports proven\n            action-oriented approaches to public health, as well as the\n            creation of a \"close the gap\" program launching\n            new initiatives in health promotion and disease prevention.\n            It targets certain institutional services for special\n            attention because of their direct impact on Hungary's\n            most pressing health problems."}, "docdt": "1993-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
