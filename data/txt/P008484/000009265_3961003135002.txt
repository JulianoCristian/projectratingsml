MMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
FOR  HEALTN  SERVICES AND MANAGEMENT PR4JECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the RepubLic of Hungary for the
equivalent of US$91.0 million to help finance stra;egic investments needed to
begin closing the gap in health status between Hungary and Western Europe. The
loan will be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
fifteen years, including a five-year grace period.
*         2.        Country/Sector Bagkground.  Hungary has been experimenting with
economic reform since 1968, but it was not until a democratic Government was
elected in mid-1990 that the country became fully engaged in introducing a
market economy.  As a middle-income country, with an estimated per capita
income of US$2,690 in 1991 and a population of 10.6 million, Hungary has been
a front-runner in the economic transformation presently taking place in
Central and Eastern Europe.
3.      Although the health sector consumes 5.6 percent of GDP, the health
system has been remarkably ineffective in promoting good health and preventing
disease. In fact, the Ministry of Welfare (MOW) and the local governments,
responsible for provision of health and social services, face a major
challenge in closing the gap in health status, mortality rates and life
expectancy between Hungary and its western neighbors. Life expectancy of 73.7
years for women and 65.1 for men is among the lowest in developed countries,
and mortality from cardiovascular disease is nearly the highest in the world
and n=reasing, especially for males in the prime working ages of 35 to 55
years. For comparison, life expectancy at birth in Western Europe is around
71 years for males and 77 years for females. An important issue facing the
health sector is the skewed allocation of resources between curative and
preventive services. Extensive, but poorly targeted, investments during the
early 1970s led to a massive build-up of acute care hospitals and training of
medical specialists at the expense of adequate primary care, basic diagnostic
and therapeutic equipment, long-term care and rehabilitation services.
Training of public health specialists, health service managers, general
practitioners, nurses and many other health care personnel was seriously
neglected. There are virtually no incentives to motivate patients to maintain
good health and to use scarce resources judiciously, or to encourage health
care workers and institutions to provide high quality care. The private
sector was, until recently, excluded from nearly all health activities.   The
recurrent budget required to operate these ineffective and inefficient health
services now outstrips the country's financial resources.
4.       The Government is, therefore, trying to restructure the health sector
in an attempt to improve health status, and in this way, contribute to the
alleviation of the grim social conditions left by decades of low standards of
living, disregard for the environment, unhealthy lifestyles, and misdirected
priorities in the provision of health and social iervices. Two closely linked
projects, this Health Services and Management Project, and a related Pensions



- 2 -
Administration antd Health Insurance Project, will support the strategic health
sector investments needed to facilitate Hungary's drive for integration into
the market economy of Western Europe.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  World Bank involvement in Hungary's
health sector reform is justified for three main reasons. First, expenditure
on health services and income transfers must be contained if the fisca'
balance needed to underpin a return to economic growth is not to be
jeopardized.4/ Although such expenditures now constitute over 22 percent of
GDP, several factors threaten to trigger further explosive growth in
expenditure'on health services and cash benefits: (a) economic liberalization
has led to an increase in prices and wages; (b) unemployment has led to a
growing need for income support programs; and (c) greater freedom and choice
have led to less restraint in demand for health services. Second, health
services and social insurance benefits are financed by an already punishing
levy of 37.5 percent on gross wages (about 16.3 percent for health services
alone). The resulting inflation of labor costs and dampening of the demand
for labor are exactly opposite to what Hungary requires in order to safeguard
its international competitiveness and address its growing problem of
unemployment. Third, illness limits individuals' participation in employment.
Reduced incomes, due to illness, contribute to increased poverty, and poverty
deprives people of exactly those healthy living arrangements, diets, and
lifestyles which are critical to closing the health gap between Hungary and
western countries. The resulting vicious circle of illness and poverty, if
allowed to continue, will weaken even further the country's potential for
economic recovery and growth, while at the same time magnifying the upward
pressure on public expenditure.
6.       Addressing the above issues is an integral part of the Government's
reform program. For these reasons, the Government now proposes: (a) to
reorient the health sector so as to provide more effective interventions; and
(b) to strengthen the NOW, local governments, and related health care
institutions to provide more efficient care. To do so, the many deficiencies
of the health sector must be addressed in a period of economic crisis, at a
time when public sector investments have long been reduced below what is
required even for maintaining the existing capital stock. As demonstrated by
Bank studies of human resources development in Hungary,2/ and elsewhere in
the region, many of the required reform measures will entail substantial
capital investment, a large proportion of which will be imports of equipment
and expertise. With funds not otherwise available to the health sector in the
present economic context, the Project will help finance the most critically
needed investments within the MOW's reform program. These investments will

result in only minimal net increases in recurrent expenditures in the short-
term, and over the medium- to long-term will contein upward pressure on the
state budget.
7.       Pxolect OJblestiUs.  The Project has two main objectives: (a) to
improve health status by beginning to close the gap between Hungary and
Western European countries, and by supporting the Government's program of
restructuring the health sector to focus on more effective interventions; and
(b) to provide more efficient and higher quality care by strengthening the
institutional capacity of the health sector in policy-making, management and
evaluatiorn.
8.       Proleet Descrinto2.  The proposed Project will provide technical
assistance, fellowships, training, preparation of studies, development of
health programs, computer hardware and software, medical and office furniture,
equipment, teaching materials, refurbishment of facilities and incremental
recurrent costs through the following two components:
9.       The Health Services Development Component (US$62.7 million base cost)
will support the Government's program of restructuring the health sector to
focus on more effective interventions through strategic investments in public
health and selected institutional services; it will complement ongoing
reforms financed by other international donors that aim to strengthen
community services, primary care and the private health care sector. The
Project will support proven action-oriented approaches to public health, as
well as the creation of a Close the Gap Program (US$14 million base cost) to
launch new initiatives in health promotion and disease prevention. It will
also strengthen certain institutional services targeted for special attention
because of their direct impact on Hungary's most pressing health problems.
10.      The Policy-Naking and Management Component (US$43.1 million base
cost) will strengthen the institutional capacity of the health sector by:
(a) supporting the establishment of Schools of Public Health and Health
Sarvices Management; (b) strengthening the NOW Computing Center and
introducing management support systems in selected institutions;
(c) developing the project management capacity of HOW staff; and
(d) supporting the preparation of preinvestment studies for restructuring
hospitals and strengthening specialist services.
11.     At the Government's request, retroactive finncing of up to
US$5.0 million will be included to cover the cost of equipment, specialist
services and training necessary for early project start-up. Retroactive
financing will be limited to expenditures incurred prior to loan signing but
after July 10, 1992. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events is shown in
Schedule C. The status of Bank Group operations in Hungary is given in
Schsdu'ie D.
12.      Prolect Implementation.  The Project will be implemented over a
period of seven years by the HOW, public health institutions, local government



- 4 -
health services, medical universities, and the Central Statistical Office.
Coordination of project-related activities of these agencies will be the
responsibility of a Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU will facilitate
resource flows to the implementing units, and to the extent appropriate,
consolidate the procurement of goods and services for greater efficiency and
for economies of scale. It will serve as a clearing house for project-related
iasues requiring the attention of top MOW management, the Social Insurance
Administration and external agencies, including the Bank. A separate Public
Health Program Un.t will be established to ecordinate the large public health
component.
13.      Project Sustainability.  Incremental recurrent costs wiLl arise
mainly from: (a) medical and computer equipment operation and maintenance;
(b) annual licensing and upgrading costs of applications software; and
(c) salaries of new faculty and staff of the two schools. These are expected
to be more than offset by budgetary savings achieved through the efficiency
gains described under project benefits.
14.      Program Objective Categories.  The project supports the Government's
policy of improving health, increasing effectiveness and efficiency in service
delivery, and reducing the role of the state in financing health care. It
includes the following categories: health and nutrition, 80 percent; and
public administration, 20 percent.
15.      Environmental Considerations.  This is a Category C project:  ONJo
appreciable environmental impact".  Provisions have been made in the project
design for the proper disposal of sanitary, medical and laboratory wastes.
16.      Agreed Actions.  The following actions are required to assure
successful implementation of the Project and attainment of the broader project
objectives.
17.      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)      for the purposes of cost-containment, and to protect the financial
viability of the Health Insurance Fund (HIF), the Borrower shall take
all necessary measures through budget caps and other expenditure
controls, to ensure that the aggregate of all expenditures on health
services financed through HIF for a given year, including
performance-related reimbursements for doctors, hospitals and other
health care providers, would not exceed the health services budget of
HIF for that year (total HIF budget net of cash benefits financed
through health insurance);
(b)      not later than June 1, 1993, a new Public Health Program Unit (PHPU)
shall be established in the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and
shall be maintained to manage the Public Health subcomponent of the
Project. The PHPU shall be staffed with a full-time director and
project manager, whose experience and qualifications shall be
acceptable to the Bank and who shall be assisted by competent staff
in adequate numbers. The PHPU shall liaise with the PMU and
collaborate with other implementing agencies;



(c)      the Borrower slhall apply the criteria, guidelines and procedures for
awards of grants, under the Close the Gap Program (CGP) agreed upon
with the Bank, and future changes to, or introduction of, new
criteria, guidelines and procedures shall be subject to Bank approval
prior to their introduction and implementation;
(d)      during execution of the Project, the Borrower shall maintain within
the MOW the Project Kanagement Unit (PMU) to be headed by a full-time
project manager, whose experience and qualifications shall be
acceptable to the Bank, and who shall be assisted by competent staff
in adequate numbers; and
(e)      not later than March 31 of each year during the execution of the
Project, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a techn.cal and
financial report, of such coverage, detail, and format as the bank
may reasonably request, on the status of Project implementation (as
of December 31 of each year) and review, thereafter with the Bank,
issues related to the execution of the Project.
18.      Condition of Loan Effectiveness.  For loan effectiveness, the Bank
will require that the NOW has signed a contract to employ a management
consultant firm to strengthen the PMU's project management capacity.
19.      Condition of Disbursements.  No withdrawal shall be made in respect
of payments made for expenditures under Category (3) (Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement) unless Hungarian and international members for the Close the Gap
Committee for the CGP have bert selected on the basis of criteria satisfactory
to the Bank, and the first committee meeting has been held.
20.      Benefits.  The Project's ultimate benefit will be improved health
achieved within an environment of tight constraints on public expenditures.
Mortality and morbidity will be reduced over the long term, following the
implementation of a national strategy to decrease smoking, alcohol consumptior
and unhealthy diets, and following the improvement of a clinical response
capability to related diseases. The quality and cost effectiveness of health
care will be enhanced through the switch in focus from curative hospital care
to preventive medicine and primary care. A new and more effective balance in
the public/private mix will allow the public sector to focus on specific areas
of clear-cut market failure. Further gains in efficiency and more effective
care will result from the improved professional training and better health
services management techniques introduced through the Project. These measures
will contribute to expenditure control in the health sector and have important
cross-benefits for the companion Pensions Administration and Health Insurance
Project.
21.      Risks.  The Project's major risks include:  (a) the weak
institutional capacity of the MOW to implement major reforms; (b) the need to
create new administrative structures such as the planned new School of Public
Health and School of Health Services Management; and (c) the loss of
expenditure control due to the introduction of performance-related
reimbursements for health care providers which could jeopardize the financial
viability of the HIP. Specific Project interventions have beets designed to



. 6-
contain these risks. The Schools of Public Heiklth and Health Services
Management will audress the weak institutional capacity of the health sector
by providing training and fellowships in policy-making, management and
evaluation. Extensive twinning arrangements with similar institutions in
western countries and technical assistance will reduce the risk of
establishing new administrative struactures. Management consultants will be
hired to strengthen project management and to enhance project implementation.
Finally, policies will be introduced to contait: health care expenditure. The
Bank will conduct a mid-term review of these policies to ensure that they will
have been effective and that they will not have had adverse spill-over effects
on the state budget.
22.      Rommendatio . I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
