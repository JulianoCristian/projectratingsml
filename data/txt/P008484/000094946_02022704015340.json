Overall\n            project sustainability is rated unlikely as none of the\n            activities started under the project are viable toaday\n            without significant government support. World Bank\n            performance is overall rated marginally satisfactory, while\n            Borrower participation is rated unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned concerned the issues of including the main\n            stakeholders and beneficiaries while garnering government\n            commitment; recognizing the political nature of health\n            reform as a political risk; ensuring that the government\n            enacts a long-term strategy for the project subcomponents to\n            feed into; avoiding having too many consultants while\n            increasing the involvement of the health ministry's own\n            staff; allocating sufficient money for the purposes\n            envisaged; making sure that the technical staff of the PMU\n            conducts its business in a transparent way and that this is\n            well communicated to the outside world; communicating with\n            the media and other stakeholders to explain what we do and\n            how we work so that new governments have a more accurate\n            idea as to how we function; and reducing the complexity of\n            the project design to reduce project risk."}, "docdt": "2001-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
