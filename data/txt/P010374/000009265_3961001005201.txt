MEMORANDUH AND RFCOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SRI LANKA
FOR A FOURTH SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Sri Lanka for SDR 33.3 million (US$45 million equivalent) is sub-
mitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with
40 years maturity and help finance a Fourth Small and Medium Industry (SKI)
Project. The credit proceeds vould be onlent to eligible participating credit
institutions at an interest rate of about 13.S2 with a final market-determined
lending rate to productive enterprises in the range of 18S-241 depending upon
term and project risk. The project would be cofinanced by an Asian Development
Bank (ADB) loan for about SDR 21.7 million (US$30 million equivalent).
Additionally, ADB would provide GOSL with a Technical Assistance Grant of
US$350,000 for sectoral policy studies.
2.        Back8round.  Prior to 1977, the Sri Lankan economy was tightly
controlled and dominated by public sector operations in both the real and
service sectors. Since then, however, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and
IDA have worked closely together to develop and implement a phased program of
trade and industrial policy reform focusing ons elimination of all quotas and
bans on imports of non-agricultural commodities; removal of import licensing
requirements; rationalization of tariffs through a gradual reduction of nominal
tariff rates to 502 within a four band tariff structure; reduction of foreign
exchange controls; liberalization of regulatory and fiscal control over indus-
trial investment; commercialization and privatization of public manufacturing
enterprises (PMEs); repeal of nationalization legislation; and reorientation of
export and investment promotion activities. The implementation of these
reforms has had a significant impact on industrial performance and the balance
of public vs. private sector investment in the sector, with both growth and
performance increasingly dominated by the private sector, a change which GOSL
is seeking to maintain and accelerate.
3.        In parallel with the liberalization of trade and industrial policies,
*        GOSL has opened up the financial system to private sector and foreign partici-
pation. From a tightly controlled system of nine financial institutions in
1977, the system has expanded significantly and become quite sophisticated,
with some 140 banking and financing institutions providing a full range of
services, although the sector is still dominated by the two State Commercial
Banks (SCBs), which account for about 800 of the sector's operations.
4.        However, experience with recent GOSL efforts to expand industrial
development and the findings of IDA's 1990 Financial Institutions Study (FIS)
have indicated that there are still a number of significant constraints to
financial sector efficiency, including: (a) distorted interest rate deter-
mination; (b) directed resource allocation; (c) high intermediation costs;
(d) a shortage of long term investment resources; (e) a weak regulatory
environment; (f) inadequate credit discipline; and (g) an undeveloped capital
market. GOSL and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) are aware of these
distortions and are working closely with the International Monetary Fund (INF),
ADB, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), IFC and IDA to



-2-
develop a program of policy, procedural and institutional reforms to address
them. GOSL's primary objective is now to build on earlier actions to address
the constraints and to utilize the findings of the FIS to improve the sector's
efficiency. It plans to accomplish this objective by the implementation of a
phased program of sectoral reform vhich will cover, inter alias (a) the
rationalization of monetary policy; (b) refining refinancing and reserve
requirements; (c) strengthening bank supervision and regulatory requirements;
(d) introducing international standards of financial disclosure; (e) restruc-
turing the SCBs; (f) the privatization of the country's development finAnce
institutions (DFI1); (g) the rationalization of the legislative, regulatory and
institutional structure of the state insurance corporations; (h) strengthening
of the accounting regulatory framework; (i) strengthening the capital market;
(j) monitoring the impact of debt recovery legislation enacted in 1990 as the
basis for introducing further actions, if necessary; and (k) evaluation of the
role of existing and proposed state financial institutions.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Project forms an integral part of
IDA's industrial and financial sector development strategy and builds on the
policy reform and institutional upgrading programs initiated under earlier
Small and Medium Industry (SKI) Projects and ongoing Industrial Development
Projects (IDP). While providing continued support for industrial development,
it focuses on the need to improve financial sector efficiency and, together
with a proposed FY92 Banking Sector Reform Project, is part of a major long-
term effort to rationalize the financial sector to enable it to play its
necessary role in Sri Lanka's economcL development.
6.        Three earlier SMI projects were used as vehicles to initiate major
policy reform and institutional improvement programs by expanding the institu-
tional coverage of lending operations from DI intermediation to the use of
public and private commercial banks as intermediaries for term financing. This
approach was also followed under the IDPs. More recent operations have focused
upon privatizing Public Manufacturing Enterprises (PMEs), improving the opera-
tional efficiency of the two State Commercial Banks (SCBs) which dominate the
banking system, and initiating a major reform of the debt recovery environment.
These projects have also been used as transitional operations to move from
directed credit operations (i.e., for specific subsectors or groupings) to
wider coverage of development support.
7.        Overall, project performance has been very good, with positive policy
impact and a high level (8S5) of subloan recovery. PCRs and PPARs for the pre-
1977 operations (i.e., Ln.520-CE, Ln.634-CE and Cr.565-CE and Cr.742-CE) noted
that the operations had provided valuable insights into the working of a small
DPI and financial intermediary operation in an expanding liberalized financial
system. The PPARs indicated tha-t Bank Group financing was particularly
important in the industrial sector's development, and had helped catalyze the
programs of trade and industrial policy reform that were to come. The most
recently completed industrial development projects (SDI I and II--Cr.942-CZ and
Cr.1182-C0--and IDP. I--Cr.l40l-CE) focuse_. mainly on the initial actions
necessary to develop the tariff reform program, rationalize the industrial and
export incentive structures, improve the overall operational viability of the
country's two DPIs and broadening the number of financial intermediaries. A
1989 Industry Sector Paper (No. 20). 'World Bank Lending for Small and Medium
Enterprisess Fifteen Years of Experience', noted that the SMI projects in



-3-
Sri Lanka ranked among the most successful of the 70 operations reviewed in 36
countries. A more recent (February 1991) OED evaluation of CMI operations in
five countries, including Sri Lanka, concluded that while the performance under
the Sri Lankan SMI projects was mixed (depending upon the area of focus, i.e.,
policy reform, resource mobilization, credit availability), the projects
provided a good foundation for further expansion of operations and fine tuning
of sectoral policies.
8.        Through the past and ongoing projects, IDA's involvement has been
instrumental in focusing GOSL's attention on the development of industrial and
financial sector strategies. The continuation of this involvement through
sector work, operational advice and financial support is important for the
success of the industrial sector strategy and for the development and lmple-
mentation of the evolving financial sector strategy with its related program of
reform. SMI IV is a key link in this process.
Project Objectives
9.        Dnrwing upon recommendations of the two major studies of SKI
operations in Sri Lanka, the proposed Project would continue IDA's support for
GOSL's industrial and financial sector reform programs and have three major
objectives:
(a) to deepen IDA's dialogue with GOSL on issues affecting the financial
sector's efficiency through: (i) continued TA support for the SCBs to
develop the basis for an agenda of restructuring actions5 (i1) the
institutional upgrading of DFIe, commercial banks and other
specialized financial institutions; and (iii) improving the effec-
tiveness of debt recovery policies and procedures;
(b) to provide continued support to GOSL in the implementation of its
trade and industrial policy reform program, particularly in the area
of environmental control; and
(c) to assist GOSL achieve its Industrial Strategy Statement objectives
by providing funding for viable industrial projects, particularly SKI
projects, and providing new and existing entrepreneurs with financial
assistance to use specialized local or foreign TA to mprove the
overall efficiency and productivity of existing operations or develop
business plans for new enterprises.
10.       Project Description.  The project, which is expected to be fully
implemented within five years, would includes (a) a US$40.0 million credit comt
ponent for the partial funding of term loans to productive enterprises through
PCIs with subproject review by the National Development Bank (NDB) as the
Project's Apex Agency; and tb) a US$5.0 million technical assistance component.
The bulk of the TA (US$3.5 million) would be used for institutional development
through the ongoing operational reviews of the SCBs, staff training programs,
and operational support for the recently established Credit Information Bureau
of Sri Lanka. The balance would be used to provide project implementation
support for SMI entrepreneurs and assistance to GOSL for policy development,
particularly environmental management and control. Subprojects eligible for
financing under the credit component would Involve new investment and the



-4-
balancing, modernizing and rehabilitation of private enterprises in most of the
productive sectors covered by the UN Standard International Trade
Classification (exceptions would include wholesale and retail trade and
personal services). All subprojects would need to be financially viable and
have an *environmental clearance' to be eligible for financing. A US$30
million parallel line of credit from the ADB would cofinance the proposed
Project on similar terms and conditions to the IDA project, while in a separate
but related operation ADB would provide GOSL with a TA Grant of US$350,000.
The total costs involved in the project are about US$145 million, with a
foreign exchange component of about 50Z (US$75 million). As funding under
ongoing IDPs and SMI projects has been fully covmitted, US$3.0 million of
retroactive financing is included in this amount. A breakdown of the costs and
financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events is
shown in Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka is
shown in Schedule D. A Map, IBRD No. 23009, is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 9515-CE dated April 26, 1991 is being distributed separately.
11.       Areas of Special Emphasis.  In addition to its industrial and
financial sector objectives, the Project also provides support for several
areas of special emphasis. In the area of environmental management, the impact
of small and medium enterprises is difficult to monitor since they are numerous
and scattered. However, the policy development and institutional support
provided under the Project's TA component would enhance the Central
Environmental Authority's capabilities to assess and monitor their environ-
mental impact. With this safeguard, the overall polluting Impact of SKI
operations is expected to be minimized, while the programs of environmental
training and support for industry generally should increase awareness of the
benefits of environmental protection.
12.       In keeping with the World Bank's policy of fostering open financial
systems, the project does not provide for directed or allocated credit to
assist owmen entrepreneurs. However, access to SKI funds by women entre-
preneurs has been increasing, with some US$8.0 million (or 30Z of subprojects)
approved under SMI III. It is recognized that there are still cultural
barriers to a woman's access to credit, and provision has been made by the PCIs
to provide facil4ties for project discussion with women entrepreneurs.  The
Project is also expected to generate a significant number of job opportunities
for women, particularly in textiles and electronics assembly.
13.       The Project does not target low income groups directly, but sub-
projects sponsored by Non-Government Organizations or cooperatives supporting
low income artisans and entrepreneurs are expected to be funded under the
Project, particularly through the branch network of the 13 Regional Rural
Development Banks. In this regard the proposed Project would be integrated
closely with the Poverty Alleviation Project presented to the Board on
April 25, 1991, which focuses upon micro-enterprises and the unemployed.
14.       Aareed Actions.  In the course of project preparation GOSL, ADB and
IDA reached agreement on the framework of a comprehensive program of sectoral
reform. In line with this framework, specific agreements were reached with
BOSL on (a) GOSL's commitment to an ongoing monitoring and modification, if
necessary, of debt recovery legislation passed in early 1990; (b) TOR and



-5-
Implementation timetables for various studies and on the annual review of the
technical assistance components; (c) the use of the average weighted deposit
rate (AVDR) of Interest-bearing term deposits of the Greater Colombo branches
of domestic comercial banks (excluding the National Savings Bank) as the
onlending reference rate for project operations and to a semi-annual review and
adjustment on January 1 and July 1 of the onlending interest ratess
(d) onlending terms, conditions, margins. subproject eligibility criteria, and
funding arrangements; Ce) plans to privatize NDB and to reduce the SCBs'
shareholding in the DPCC; (f) the Statement of Pollcies and Procedures for the
use by NDB of the SMI repayment reflows; (g) a phased operational and financial
restructuring program for the SCBs as part of the conditions for their parti-
cipation in the Project; (h) conditions of PCI participation (other than the
SCBs), including capitalization, financial viability, financial disclosure,
provisioning, collection ratios, portfolio infection levels, and staffing;
(i) the provisioning policies to be adopted by the PCIs (including NDB) on
their term lending portfolios and by the DYIs on their overall portfolio by
December 31, 1991; and (j) procedures for procurement, disbursement, subproject
review, periodic reporting, accounting and auditing.
15.       As conditions for Credit Effectiveness, IDA would requires
(a) signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between GOSL
and NDB; and (b) signing of Participation Agreements, satisfactory to IDA,
between NDB and at least three eligible PCIs.
16.       Benefits.  The proposed project would further support GOSL's efforts
to fine tune its ongoing program of trade and indust,:ial policy reform through
incremental, but significant, action in the areas of customs and excise reform,
removal of regulations required to establlsO new enterprisei  and in the estab-
lishment of environmental monitoring guide:. Ue for industrial operations. The
Project would also support GOSL's efforts to improve financial sector effi-
ciency addressing key constraints to wider access to long-term financing
resources, thus providing support to a significant number of new and growing
private sector operations. The subprojects financed are expected to result in
about 20,000 new jobs, with incremental fixed investments (including buildings
and equipment but excluding land) per job of about US$6,250. The main demand
for funding is expected from agro-industries, metal products, building
materials, construction contractors and the transport sector.  Promotional and
technical services being provided under the ongoing SMI program and to be
extended under the proposed Project are expected to result in increased
financing of export-oriented SMIs in rubber products, handloom textiles, gem
cutting and polishing, and of engineering subcontractors linked to larger
public and private industries.
17.       Benefits from the technical assistance eomponents are more difficult
to quantify. Rationalization of custom and excise policies 'and procedures
should provide an impetus to the development of both trade and industry by
facilitating imports and exports. Under the TA component, local private sector
know-how would be tapped to address SM1Is technical problems in areas requiring
specialized skills. Also, the use of the TA would further encourage the
establishment of private sector firms specializing in coasultancy to industry
and service enterprises. increase entrepreneurs' appreciation of the benefit of
technical assistance, and enable entrepreneurs to tap needed skills not readily
available within their own operations.



Risks
is.       The lending component's success ould depend upon a climate of
political stability and on  DB' a  continued effective coordination of the use of
the reflows from the Project. Satisfactory policies, procedures and standards
for these operations have been established on the basis of experience; the key
i1l be NDR's ability to retain qualified staff and provide the leveL of
training to support expanding SMW operations, hile increasing attention to
menitorfing and supervising of PCIs' Industrial lending operations. A further
risk is that the two SCBs, with their island-wide network of branches, may be
uwable to maintain the conditions of participation, limiting entrepreneurs'
access to Project funds. To address these concerns, agreement on a compre-
hensive restructuring program for the SC8s and maintenance of minium levels of
trained staff would be a condition of PCX participation in the projects also,
each PCI's Board would be required to reaffirm its commitment to allocate
additional SOI staff as required. With strong senior management commitment,
adequate stafffin can be provided through active deployment and training.
Access to credit funds would be ensured through the involvemeat of both local
and foreign banks in the project. Although SKI IV would build on the organlza-
tional arrangements and capabilities developed under the earlier successful SMI
projects, implementation of the credit and technical assistance components to
further Improve financial sector efficiency would require a strong CBSLIPCI
commitment. a high level of local counterpart resources, and a significaut IDA
involvement through the supervision process.
19.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agvee_nt of the Association and recommnd that the
Ezecutive Directors approve the proposed credit.
