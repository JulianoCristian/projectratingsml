Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, financial viability and internal efficiency\n            of the participating financial institutions is the most\n            important factor in the satisfactory implementation of the\n            intermediation operations and sustainability of the project.\n            Second, an effective and strong Apex institution is\n            important and instrumental for successful project\n            implementation. Third, Government direct involvement in and\n            thorough knowledge of all aspects of the project is crucial\n            for better coordination among stakeholders. Fourth, it would\n            be beneficial to invest in upgrading the database and\n            monitoring system for the SMI sector. Fifth, the TA program\n            and its goals/objectives should be realistic and achievable.\n            Finally, the experience of severe power cuts and its impact\n            on the economy calls for an urgent need to develop the Sri\n            Lanka's infrastructures."}, "docdt": "1998-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
