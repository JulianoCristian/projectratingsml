                         PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

              INDONESIA: BALI TOURISM PROJECT (CREDIT 479-IND)


                                  Preface


          This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Bali Tourism
Project for Indonesia, for which Credit 479-IND was approved in June 1974 in
the amount of US$16.0 million. About US$1.4 million of the Credit was
cancelled in October 1982. Final disbursement for the hotel credit of US$0.4
million was made in July 1984.

          Attached is the PCR prepared by the Urban and Water Supply Division
of the East Asia and Pacific Regional Projects Department (AEPUW). The PCR
is based on the findings of a mission in March 1984 and information provided
by various Bank staff members involved with the project during its execution.

          In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. These comments have been
incorporated into the PCR and are shown as an attachment to the report.

                        PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

           INDONESIA:   BALI TOURISM PROJECT (CREDIT 479-IND)


                               Highlights


          The project, which was the first Bank tourism project in
Indonesia, consisted of infrastructure to promote tourism development in
Bali, including a 310 ha. tourism estate at Nusa Dua (capable of
accommodating hotels with about 2,500 rooms), facilities for hotel
training, an access road from the airport, road improvements outside
Nusa Dua to serve both tourism and other transportation demands, and
technical assistance for implementing the project and the master plan
for tourism in Bali. The project's main goal was to develop
international tourism in Bali, with the multiple objective of increasing
foreign exchange earnings, creating employment, improving income
generation and supporting regional development. The project also placed
a great emphasis on the importance of protecting the unique social and
cultural life as well as the physical evnironment on the island. (Para.
1.01 and 2.02).

         The project was completed in June 1982, about four years later
than anticipated at appraisal. Project start-up was delayed almost two
years by procurement problems, late appointment of consultnats and
delays in completing the final design of project works. Project content
was substantially modified during implementation to minimize overall
cost increases. The combined effect of the changes in project design,
delays in construction, inflation and the devaluation of the Indonesian
Rupiah in 1978 contributed to a 38% overall cost increase as compared
with the appraisal estimate. (Para.3.07).

         The hotel deve.Lopment at Nusa Dua bas been delayed considerably
because of the unfavorable investment climate for hotel construction due
to the world-wide economic recession following the energy crisis in 1973
and 1979, and also, due to substantial delays in construction of
infrastructure for the project. Furthermore, the Government "one-gate"
air access policy ·tor Bali has discouraged private investors' interest
in hotel construction for the project. The first 450-room Nusa Dua
Beach Hotel was constructed and opened for operation in May 1983. The
construction of other two hotels for a total of 900 rooms was started
with completion scheduled for end-1984 and 1985. In addition, the
construction of another hotel with 350 rooms is due to start in mid-
1984. The current prospects for hotel development at Nusa Dua are good,
with the opening of 1,700 rooms by 1986 and about 3,000 rooms by 1989.
To achieve this target, the Government has been making considerable
promotional efforts for the development of international tourism in
Bali, including the improvement of air access by allowing international
air carriers to fly to Bali, with both regular and charter flights.
(Para. 6.01-6.03).
                              - iv -


         Given the historical growth trends in overall foreign visitor
traffic to Indonesia and taking into account the expected improvement of
air access to Bali, the future foreign visitor traffic to the island has
been projected at an average growth rate in the range of 6.5%-11.0% for
the next ten years, 1984-93. The conservative projection indicates that
foreign visitor traffic to Bali would increase by 6.5% on annual average
to about 500,000 visitor arrivals in 1988 and further to 680,000
arrivals in 1993. (Para. 6.05).

         Because of the delays encountered in project implementation as
well as a much slower development of hotels for the project than
expected, and also due to much higher capital costs for hotel investment
than anticipated at appraisal, the reevaluation (based on a 65% growth
rate in foreign visitors) indicates a considerably low economic rate of
return of 6% as compared with the 19% calculated in the appraisal.
(Para. 7.06).

         The economic viability of this type of an integrated tourism
project is very sensitive to changes in the worldwide economic
situation. In this connection, the Bank should have been more cautious
in its demand projections, more conservative in project design and
obtained firmer assurances from private hotel investors before
proceeding with such an ambitious project. (Para.8.03).

         In terms of goals and resource mobilization, the Bali Toursim
Project constitutes an original and ambitious project. Its success will
be measured in the coming five to ten years according to the actual
growth of tourism accommodation capacity and tourist arrivals and
revenues in the project area. Environmental control and integrated
physical and economic planning stand out among the major project
achievements and are instrumental to an optimal growth. To ensure that
these achievements remain a lasting legacy of the project, it is
essential that the institutions built for the project implementation
stay in place and progressively shift from construction to monitoring
and supervision activities. Government is aware of this need and is
taking measures to this effect. (Para. 9.01 (f)).

                                 I.   INTRODUCTION


1.01      The main goal of this project was to develop tourism in Bali, par~
ticularly international tourism, with the multiple objective of increasing
foreign exchange earnings, creating employment, improving income generation
and supporting regional development. The project also placed a great emphasis
on the importance of protecting the unique social and cultural life as well as
the physical environment on the island while maximizing the benefits from the
expansion of the tourism industry in Bali.

1.02      At the time of appraisal in 1973, Bali's population of about 2.2
million was unevenly distributed, reflecting the community's dependence on
agricultural land. While the population grew at a rate of about 2% per annum ,
the scope for additional agricultural production and employment was limited by
the severe pressure of population on the land. In these circumstances,
tourism had (and still has) high development priority for the island a s a
principal means of expanding productive activity and employment in the future.

Tourism in Indonesia

1.03      At appraisal, the development of tourism in Indonesia was still a t
an early stage, although the number of visitor arrivals expanded from only
some 26,400 in 1967 to about 300,000 in 1973. This rapid growth in the number
of visitors (at a rate of 50% per annum during the period), was a result of
the increased business traffic generated by expanded economic activity and a
growing number of vacation visitors. About 22% of foreign visitors were from
Western European countries, 20% from the United States, 11% from Japan, 10%
from Australia and most of the balance from the neighboring countries, mainly
Malaysia, Singapore and Hongkong. In 1973, gross foreign exchange earned f r om
tourism in Indonesia amounted to about US$50 million or about US$37 million
net (5% and 3% respectively of non-oil exports).

1.04      A lack of suitable hotel accommodation was a severe constraint on
the growth of tourism; in 1972 the number of hotel rooms of international
standard was limited to less than 1,300 in Jakarta, 450 in Bali and 100 in
Jogjakarta. As a result of the expansion program in preparation for the
Pacific Area Travel Association (PATA) conference, the number of rooms of
international standard in these cities doubled by 1974 and the hotel industry
prov·ded direct employment to about 8,000 people at this time. While many
entrants to the industry were trained by the National Hotel Institute, suppor-
ted by the Swiss Government and the UNDP/ILO, at Bandung which had suitable
quarters, equipment and full-time staff, the other public and private hotel
training schools in Jakarta and Bali were poorly equipped and were staffed by
inadequately trained, part-time teachers.

Tourism 1n Bali

1.05      With the construction of the Tuban airport near Denpasar in 1967 and
its upgrading in 1971 to handle jet aircraft, Bali had become more accessible
to foreign visitors. The number of arrivals increased at an average rate of
27% per annum over the years 1969-73, reaching a level of nearly 100,000 in
1973; however, several constraints to further growth emerged including a lack
of adequate first class hotel accommodation. At appraisal, it was determined
there was a crucial need for additional hotel rooms to be built in order to
meet potential tourist demand in Bali.

1.06      In the early 1970s major hotels were concentrated along the beach
areas at Sanur and Kuta to the east and south-west of Denpasar, the provincial
capital and main business center. There was no central planning of tourism
development in Bali, however, and the tourism industry had expanded with
little regard for the natural and human environment. In the absence of effec-
tive zoning and building controls, the Sanur and Kuta areas were becoming
over-crowded shabby and unsanitary; individual hotels had varying standards of
construction and service; facilities for water supply and sewerage were par-
ticularly inadequate. Moreover, in the face of such pressures a steady
degradation of these communities, their properties, surroundings and social
values was occuring; a particularly sad irony among a people renowned for
their unique culture - the chief object of most tourists' visits.


                      II.   PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL


2.01      In 1968, the Indonesian Government requested Bank Group assistance
for tourism development. A project identification mission visited Indonesia
in March 1969 and recommended the preparation of a tourism master plan for
Bali and a related feasibility study for a first-phase development. The
Government engaged French consultants (SCETO) to carry out a UNDP-financed
study for which the Bank served as Executing Agency. The consultants prepared
a tourism master plan for Bali which recommended that future tourism accommo-
dation should continue to be developed at Sanur and Kuta but that the main
focus of future development should be concentrated at Nusa Dua, a remote site
on the Bukit Peninsula. After the completion, in June 1971, of the UNDP-
financed Bali tourism master plan and feasibility study for the development of
Nusa Dua, Japanese consultants (PCI), financed under the Third IDA Technical
Assistance Credit (275-IND), conducted additional detailed site development
studies during 1972 and 1973. The project was appraised in June/July 1973 and
negotiations were held in Washington in April 1974.

2.02        The project consisted of supporting infrastructure and facilities
for the largely self-contained Nusa Dua tourism estate (310 ha.) capable of
accommodating about 2,500 hotel rooms and a hotel training school; an access
road to the estate, the improvement of eleven roads in Central Bali and a
Denpasar by-pass road; a 10 ha. demonstration farm; and technical assistance
to the Ba l i Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC}, the Bali Tourism
                                    - 3 -


Development Board (BTDB) and the Provincial Department of Agriculture. The
total cost of the project was estimated at US$36.1 million, of which the Bank
Group proposed to finance US$16 million to cover about 88% of the estimated
foreign exchange component and about 44% of the total project cost.

Executing Agencies

2.03      The following four agencies were responsible for the execution of
the physical components of the project: (i) the Bali Tourism Development
Corporation (BTDC) for the Nusa Dua estate and hotel training components; (ii)
the Ministry of Public Works (Bina Marga) for the construction of roads out-
side the estate; (iii) the National Telecommunications Authority (PERUMTEL)
for the telecommunication component; and (iv) the Bali Office of the Ministry
of Agriculture for the agriculture component. Apart from the above agencies,
a Bali Tourism Development Board (BTDB) was established with the responsibil-
ity for advising the provincial government on the implementation of the tour-
ism master plan and coordinating the tourism activities of other government
agencies, private hotel enterprises and local Balinese community
organizations.

Project Preparation and Appraisal

2.04      Because of uncertainties about the future impact of the energy
cr1s1s of 1973 on international tourism, market demand analysis for the
development of tourism in Bali proved difficult. Nevertheless, several pro-
jections of visitor traffic to Bali were made and it was concluded that full
development of the Nusa Dua estate, with 2,500 hotel rooms to be opened for
operations by 1982, would be an achievable target, which would yield an
acceptable economic rate of return. The prospects for hotel development at
Nusa Dua were very positive at that time due to the level of interest
expressed by potential investors and the corresponding prospects for favorable
financial results for hotel investment at the estate.

2.05      Two key issues related to the project viability were discussed at
appraisal; namely, the Government's air access policy and future hotel devel-
opment outside Nusa Dua. The Government was seeking to negotiate with other
countries reciprocal landing rights favorable to Garuda, the Indonesian
national airline, and had announced a "one gate" policy, which could
theoretically force all foreign scheduled airlines to terminate flights 1n
Jakarta and thus make air travel to Bali much less convenient. Despite the
Bank's concern at the possible effect of the Government's air transportation
policies on the project, the Bank decided not to require a covenant on air
access in the Credit Agreement, which could affect the Government's position
in bilateral negotiations. With respect to the future hotel development
outside Nusa Dua, the Government agreed that the number of hotel rooms in Bali
of international standard outside Nusa Dua would be limited to 1,600 (both
existing and newly built hotel rooms) until the project was fully developed.

2.06      As mentioned above, special consideration was given during the
project preparation to the establishment of a juridical and legistrative
framework for formulating and implementing appropriate policies on the basis
of the tourism master plan. First, the Bali Tourism Development Board (BTDB),
                                     - 4 -


consisting of the Governor of Bali as Chairman and members drawn from the
relevant government agencies, was established in March 1972 with the function
of planning and implementation of zoning plans and building regulations for
the overall development of tourism in Bali. Second, the Bali Tourism Develop-
ment Corporation (BTDC), a state enterprise headed by a Pr~sident Director and
comprising a Technical Operations and a Finance Division, was established with
the function of developing a viable tourism estate at Nusa Dua. It was
considered necessary to build up and strengthen the capacity of BTDB and BTDC
in their operations through the provision of technical assistance under the
project.


                         III.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION


3.01      The Credit Agreement was signed on June 14, 1974 and became effec-
tive on December 4, 1974, 83 days after the original date of September 12,
1974. This delay was due to difficulties in concluding the subsidiary loan
agreements between the Government and subborrowers (BTDC and Perumtel), and
also in appointing project staff. The project was to have been completed by
end-August 1978.

Project Revision

3.02      Works on the infrastructure for the tourism estate were completed
with a number of changes in design of various components. One of the most
significant changes was the adoption of a recycled waste-water supply system
to irrigate the green areas at Nusa Dua. This recycling system caused some
increase in construction costs of the water supply and waste water components;
however, the system was designed to economize on overall operations by
reducing the demand for fresh water thereby minimizing operating costs of the
treated water supply to beneficiaries over the long run.

3.03      Substantial changes from the original plan were also made in the
scope and design of the amenity core. Because of a much slower development of
the tourist market for the project in the first phase, as compared to the
appraisal estimates, the scope of this component was reduced to some extent.
At the same time, the overall design of the amenity core was revised to
include the BTDC's office building and workshops in this component.

3.04      During project implementation, additional infrastructural works for
the tourism estate were made; namely, works for the extension of the utility
systems to the hotel site (N-6), of which development was originally planned
for the second phase of the development, for the Club Mediteranee hotel
project; and for the beach protection works to avoid erosion to the Nusa Dua
beach.

3.05      The scope of the road component implemented by Bina Marga was
reduced substantially through elimination of the multipurpose roads improve-
ment program from the project. Due mainly to a substantial increase in
construction costs of the Denpasar by-pass road and the estate access road,
the multipurpose roads improvement program was deleted from the project and
                                    - 5 -


included in a separate Government road betterment program with completion
~cheduled for mid-1985.


3.06      The telecommunication component for the tourism estate at Nusa Dua
was fully financed by local funds through Government budgetary allocations and
from Perumtel's own resources. Perumtel's reluctance to accept the terms of
the subsidiary loan agreement with the Government on utilizing the proceeds of
the Credit led to a decision to finance this component from its own resources
and not to utilize the Credit funds.

3.07      The hotel training school was completed in March 1979 as scheduled
in the original project plan. In the course of project implementation of this
component, BTDC decided to construct a 50-room practice hotel adjacent to the
hotel training school as an additional component for the Hotel and Tourism
Training Center at Nusa Dua. The practice hotel was financed entirely by
local funds and completed in April 1981, two years after the completion of the
hotel training school.

3.08      As a result of the changes in project design, about US$1.8 million
of the Credit remained uncommitted. However, in view of the difficulties the
Government was encountering in attracting hotel investors (para. 6.01), at
Government's request, the Bank agreed to reallocate the undisbursed funds to
BTDC to participate in the construction of two hotels at Nusa Dua in joint
ventures with private investors. The Credit Agreement was amended to reflect
these changes in November 1978. In October 1982, about US$1.4 million of the
Credit was cancelled and the remaining US$0.4 million is still expected to be
disbursed for the hotel credit before the end of June 1984.

Implementation Schedule

3.09      The physical components were completed in June 1982, about four
years later than anticipated at appraisal. The delay in project implementa-
tion was mostly due to slow preparation of the detailed engineering designs,
starting with a delay in appointment of the consultants, and continuous,
unpredictable delays in awarding contracts. Occasionally, project implementa-
tion was delayed by coordination difficulties between BTDC and the other
executing agencies (Bina Marga and Perumtel). Most major project components
were completed with an average delay of two years, although a few infrastruc-
ture works were not undertaken until the last two years, during a final
project implementation phase. In retrospect, it is clear that the 48-month
implementation schedule formulated at appraisal was overly optimistic, given
the project's technical complexities and the fact that considerable changes in
project scope and design were required throughout the project implementa-
tion. Moreover, perhaps the Bank should not have proceeded with the financing
of the project until the completion of detailed design; the construction
delays, cost overruns and frequent changes in design all attest to this fact.

Procurement

3.10      The executing agencies procured almost all Bank-financed goods and
services through international competitive bidding procedures, in accordance
with Bank guidelines. All large contracts were awarded to foreign firms.
                                                      - 6 -


    Smaller contracts, amounting to about $2.0 million in total which would not
•   have been attractive to foreign firms, were awarded on the basis of local
    competitive bidding and prudent shopping procedures. Some minor work on beach
    erosion protection at Nusa Dua was carried out by force account.

    Costs and Disbursements

    3.11     A detailed comparison of project costs as estimated at appraisal and
    upon completion is presented in Annex 4. These costs are summarized as

· Project costs are not readily comparable because of the significant changes in
  project scope. Overall cost increases were minimized by the changes in pro-
  ject design. Despite suostantial changes made in the design for the amenity
  core and common facilities to minimize the cost increases, the final cost of
  the component was much higher than the appraisal estimates. This is due to
  the fact that the costs were considerably underestimated at appraisal. The
  high cost increase in the hotel training center was due to the additional
  costs for a 50-room training hotel (Hotel Bualu) which was not financed by the
  Bank. The road component by Bina Marga encountered the most significant cost
  increase for the Denpasar by-pass road due to a substantial delay in project
  design and because of the devaluation of the Indonesian Rupiah which came into
  effect in November 1978. Furthermore, additional costs due to the extra works
  claimed by the contractor mainly in dealing with unforeseen poor subsoil
  condi~ions and in meeting the completion deadline (December 1980) for the by-
  pass road also contributed to the high cost increase. A cumulative schedule
  of disbursements is presented in Annex 5. The original closing date was post-
  poned three times from August 31, 1979 to June 30, 1981, June 30, 1982 and
  finally to December 31, 1983, due initially to delays in project implementa-
  tion and subsequently because of delays in reaching agreement on the proposed
  amendments to the Credit Agreement in order to reallocate the undisbursed
  funds for hotel construction purposes.

Performance of Consultants and Contractors

3.12      The performance of consultants employed for the preparation of the
physical planning as well as the final engineering designs was generally
satisfactory. During the later phases of implementation, it is notable that
design and engineering was carried out by BTDC staff in-house competently with
some assistance from local consultants.

3.13      Construction work completed by contractors throughout the project
was of good quality and progress was generally satisfactory. A notable
contribution was made by local contractors especially in the construction of
traditional Balinese-style structures. The exception arose when interpreta-
tion differed between the executing agencies and contractors on the responsi-
bility for construction delays, the effect of price escalation formulas on the
contract prices and the impact on contractors of an unpredictable reduction in
construction quant1t1es. These problems were satisfactorily solved by the
executing agencies without any major dispute.

Reporting

3.14       In general, required reports were submitted 1n a timely fashion
(Annex 3).


                           IV.   INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS


4.01      The Bank Group's main contribution to institutional development
through the project consisted in assisting the Indonesian Government in estab-
lishing the Bali Tourism Development Board (BTDB) and the Bali Tourism
Development Corporation (BTDC).


'   i
                                     - 8 -


. 4.02      The Board was established in March 1972 as a first step toward
  implementing the Bali Tourism Master Plan. With the assistance of an adviser,
  th~ Board played its role satisfactorily in formulating and promoting develop-
  ment policies for tourism in Bali based on the master plan. The appointment
  of an adviser to the Board was particularly effective in training local staff
  for the preparation and execution of zoning regulations and development
  controls for tourist areas. The training also covered the minor tourism proj-
  ect preparation and drafting of legislation for the protection of social and
  ~ultural environments.  A significant function of the Board was in coordinat-
  i~g tourism sector activities between government agencies and private enter-
  prises as well as Balinese community organizations. However, the activities
  of the Board slowed down following the departure of the expert in August 1979
  a~d its function was absorbed by the Regional Tourism Office in 1980.


 4.03      Because the development of an integrated tourism estate was a unique
 operation in the country, a new corporation (BTDC) was created in November
 1973 as a Government-owned state enterprise with the overall responsibility
 for managing the execution of the project. BTDC performed its tasks satisfac-
 torily also with the assistance of an adviser under the project. The early
 appointment of an adviser to BTDC through the project was most effective in
 preparing and implementing its corporate objectives which included formulation
 and implementation of land use policies, promotional programs for hotel
 investment, financial planning and budgeting for BTDC's operations as well as
 construction management.

  4.04      The organizational structure of BTDC is presented in Annex 1. BTDC
  is currently staffed with 240 permanent employees under the four departments
  (Commercial, Finance, Operation and General and Administration). The General
  and Administration Department is the largest with about 100 employees, of
  which almost one half are in the security force. Promotional activities for
  the Nusa Dua tourism complex are undertaken by the Commercial Department
  (Marketing and Public Relations Divisions) under the direction of the Presi-
  dent Director of BTDC and involve negotiations with potential investors on
  land leasing agreements for hotel sites and, also, concessional agreements for
. other commercial establishments such as restaurants and shops in the com-
  ~lex.  The Operation Department is the second largest with 70 employees
  engaged in maintenance and utility operations in the complex. These opera-
  tions are expected to be increased in the future once hotels are fully
  developed at Nusa Dua. The management of BTDC is capable of sustaining and
  expanding its tourism estate operations satisfactorily with the competent
  ~taff who have been trained under Bank financed technical assistance.


 4.05      In retrospect, the institutional issues addressed at appraisal were
 appropriate and the arrangements whereby BTDB and BTDC acted as coordinating
 agencies for the sector and project activities, respectively, worked effec-
 tively. The contributions of the aqvisers to the project were very signifi-
 cant, particularly in the areas of training local staff and assisting the
 respective agencies to cope with the difficulties encountered in project
 implementation.

                            V.   FINANCIAL ASPECTS


5.01      The financial statements of BTDC for the period ending December 31,
1983, are presented in Annex 6. As of December 31, 1983, BTDC's total assets
amounted to Rp 17.2 billion. BTDC's investment in the construction of infra•
structures and other facilities, including the hotel training center, amounted
to Rp 14.5 billion, of which Rp 4.6 billion (US$8.7 million equivalent) was
financed from the Credit, representing about 32% of the investment. The long-
term liabilities on the Credit for the period ending December 1983 amounted to
Rp 6.8 billion (US$13.5 million equivalent), including Rp 2.3 billion for
capitalized interest in that period. The debt service payment is scheduled to
start from mid-1985. The ability of BTDC to meet debt service and to recover
the full capital and operating costs from income through its operation depends
entirely on the development of hotels which are the principal sources of
operating income for the services provided by BTDC.

5.02      The operating projections of BTDC for the period 1984-93 and the
current schedule of hotel development for the project are presented in
Annex 11. The operating assumptions are also attached to Annex 11. To ease
the cash flow situation of potential hotel investors for the project, BTDC
provides three types of rental fees for the ground lease based on the
development periods for hotels, starting from construction to operational
periods. (i.e. US$1,000 per year for each lot during construction, US$200 per
year for each available hotel room for the first year of operation and rental
fees based on a percentage of gross sales of each hotel from the second year
of operation onward. Utilities (water, sewerage and solid waste) are metered
and charged at current commercial rates. Maintenance and other services are
charged on a pro-rata basis in the manner established by BTDC and the Nusa Dua
Community Association. The projected operating costs are based on the budgets
prepared by BTDC for its respective operating units, including payroll and
administrative expenditures.

5.03      The prospects for the future hotel development at Nusa Dua are
encouraging, with the expectation that 1,700 hotel rooms, including the first
hotel with 450 rooms which opened in March 1983, would be in full operation by
the end of 1986 and another additional 1,300 hotel rooms would be built in the
following two-three years. On the basis of these forecasts, BTDC is expected
to break-even in its operation in 1986 and to generate surpluses thereafter.
The financial internal rate of return on BTDC's investment is calculated at 5%
in real terms (Annex 12).


                      VI.   HOTEL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT


6.01      The justification for providing infrastructure at Nusa dua was the
prospect that potential investors and hotel companies would be prepared to
build and operate hotels, which in turn would substantially increase tourism
flows to the area. The appraisal team expected 800 hotel rooms to be in
operation at Nusa Dua in 1978, all to be constructed by the private sector.
This capacity was projected to expand up to 2,500 rooms in 1983. Partly
                                        - 10 -


because of the unfavorable investment climate for hotel development due to the
world-wide economic recession following the energy crises in 1973 and 1979,
private investors were reluctant to commit themselves to hotel investment at
Nusa Dua. The delay in construction of infrastructure at Nusa Dua also con-
tributed to slow development of hotels. Furthermore, the Government "one
gate" air access policy for Bali has discouraged private investors' interest
in hotel construction at Nusa Dua. As a result, the start of hotel develop-
ment for the project has been delayed by five years as compared with the
appraisal estimates.

6.02     The following table shows the appraisal projections of hotel
development, the actual building and current expectations.

Ia     The prospects for hotel development at Nusa Dua given by the BTDC in
       April 1985 are slightly slower than the PCR's projections due to
       rescheduling of investments by indvidual developers. However, this
       current hotel development schedule for the project does not affect the
       rate of return calculation significantly.
/b     Two hotels for a total of 900 rooms are under construction and the
       construction of another hotel (350 rooms) is due to start in mid-1984.



6.03      Following the opening of the 450-room Nusa dua Beach Hotel in
May 1983, the construction of two hotels; namely, Hotel Indonesia Inter-
national (400 rooms) and Hotel Bali Sole (500 rooms), was started with comple-
tion scheduled for end-1984 and end-1985, respectively. In addition, the
construction of Bali Holiday Village (Club Mediteranee) with 350 rooms is
expected to start in mid-1984 for completion in early 1986. Furthermore,
                                    - 11 -


l~ase contracts for four hotel sites at Nusa Dua have been made between BTDC
and potential investors to construct another 1,300 hotel rooms for completion
in the years 1987-89. The current prospects for hotel development at Nusa Dua
are good, with the opening of 1,700 rooms by 1986 and 3,000 rooms by 1989. To
achieve this target, however, considerable promotional efforts for the further
development of international tourism in Bali are required. One of the most
important elements for such promotion would be to improve the current status
of air access by allowing international air carriers to fly to Bali, with both
regular and charter flights.

6.04       The Government agreement on the limitation of 1,600 hotel rooms in
Bali of international standard outside Nusa Dua (both existing and newly built
hotel rooms) has been kept satisfactorily. Average room occupancies of the
existing hotels in Bali outside Nusa Dua declined from 80% in 1981 to 60% in
1983, reflecting the recent slow down in visitor traffic to Bali. Visitor
traffic to the island declined by 7% between 1981 and 82, and remained almost
unchanged in 1983, registering an estimated 434,500 arrivals in 1983. While
overall visitor traffic to Indonesia grew by 6% on annual average in the years
1979-83 to reach 633,000 visitor arrivals in 1983, the proportion of the esti-
mated foreign visitor arrivals in Bali to the total arrivals in the country
also declined from 64% in 1981 to 58% in 1983. For the longer period,
however, visitor traffic to Bali grew by 6% on annual average in the five year
period 1979-83 and by 11% in the last decade 1974-83 (Annex 8). These growth
trends are quite similar to the growth in overall visitor traffic to the
country actually achieved for the correspondent periods, but much lower than
the growth rates projected in the appraisal of 13% for 1979-83 and 19% for
1974-83. The Government is making efforts in taking special measures to
promote international tourism for the country as well as for Bali by
facilitating visa procedures for foreign tourists to the country and by
allowing landing rights for foreign charter carriers to Bali.

6.05      The projections for foreign visitor arrivals in Bali over the next
ten years (1984-93) are presented in Annex 9. The projections are based on
the historical growth trends in overall foreign visitor traffic to the country
which indicate an average annual growth rate of 13% in the years 1972-81, and
of 11% ;in the years 1974-83. Given these growth trends in foreign visitor
traffic to Indonesia and taking into account the expected improvement of air
access to Bali, the future foreign visitor traffic to the island has been pro-
jected at an average annual growth rate in the range of 6.5% - 11.0% for the
next ten years, 1984-93. The most conservative projection indicates that
foreign visitor traffic to Bali would increase by 6.5% on annual average to
about 500,000 foreign visitor arrivals in 1988 and further to 680,000 arrivals
in 1993. On the basis of these projections, it is required that a total of
about 3,000 hotel rooms are built and become operational at Nusa Dua by 1988.

                         VII.   ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION


Cost and Benefit Assumptions

7.01      As in the appraisal, the economic re-evaluation takes into account a
larger program of investments than those specifically financed under the
project itself. Investment costs include not only infrastructure works but
also hotels, other tourist accommodations and other tourist enterprises, such
as restaurants, recreational facilities and tourist shops, all made possible
by the installation of the project's package of infrastructure. The gross
benefits resulting from the tourism estate investment program are taken to be
only the expenditures in Bali of tourists who stay in hotels at Nusa Dua.
Because of the rather limited capacity of acceptable accommodation in the
existing tourist areas in Bali, the benefits derived from the expenditures of
tourists staying at Nusa Dua are incremental to the tourism sector as a whole
and do not represent a diversion of traffic from existing destinations in the
country.

7.02      All costs and benefits in this analysis are given in end-1983
prices. In addition to the investment costs of infrastructures and related
tourism facilities for the Nusa Dua tourism complex (US$31 million in 1983
prices), the average cost of hotel construction is estimated at US$70,000 per
room on the basis of the proposed investment programs for hotel construction
in the project area. Given the current schedule of hotel development for the
project, including the first 450-room hotel mentioned above, the total hotel
investment is estimated to be US$210 million for 3,000 hotel rooms to be built
and in operation by the end of 1989. Investment costs for non-hotel super-
structure facilities are estimated at approximately US$1 million.

7.03      Revenue assumptions are based on an average daily expenditure per
v1s1tor of US$75, including accommodation (US$31); food and beverages (US$25);
shopping (US$7); tours and transportation (US$6); and entertainment and
recreation (US$6). Hotel revenues assume an average length of stay of 3.5
days, a double-occupancy factor of 1.7 persons per room, and an annual room
occupancy rate for each hotel of 50% in the first year, rising to 75% by the
fourth year of operations. These assumptions of hotel room occupancies and
rate of increase in hotel operations are much lower and slower than appraisal
projections. Gross operating profits of the hotels and other superstructure
facilities are estimated on the basis of the experience of similar facilities
currently in operation in Bali. For the economic benefit calculation, gross
operating profits of the hotels have been estimated to be 27% of the gross
hotel revenues for 1984 increasing to 39% for 1993 (Annex 10).

7.04      Economic costs of operating the Nusa Dua tourism complex are derived
from the actual and projected financial accounts of hotels, restaurants,
shopping center and other facilities. The operating and maintenance costs for
the non-revenue earning infrastructure items such as roads, street lighting
and landscape maintenance are included in the calculation of operating and
maintenance costs for the project operating unit (BTDC). Revenue earning
infrastructure such as electricity, water and sewerage is included in the rate
of return calculations for the project since the gross revenues of these
                                    - 13 -


utilities are part of the operating costs of the hotels and other superstruc-
ture facilities.

7.05      Both the appraisal and the reevaluation exclude benefits to the
local population of the investment in infrastructure and to this extent the
economic return is understated. Also, the costs and benefits from inter-
national air travel and tour operations are likewise excluded in both sets of
calculations. However, whereas the appraisal assumed that these benefits
would mostly accrue to foreign airlines and travel agents, in fact domestic
airlines, Garuda and others, and Indonesian-owned tour operators have expanded
their operations considerably. The exclusion of these benefits probably leads
to a further understatement of the economic return.

Economic Rate of Return

7.06      Given the current assumptions on hotel development and market
prospects for the Nusa Dua tourism complex, the reevaluation indicates an
internal economic rate of return of 6% on the investment program, considerably
lower than the 18.7% calculated in the appraisal. The major contributing
factors are; (a) delays in project implementation for the tourism complex; and
(b) slow progress in hotel development at the project area.

7.07      The analysis was tested for sensitivity to a 15% reduction 1n total
gross operating profits from 1984 onwards. Such ~ reduction could result from
lower occupancy rates than assumed, lower hotel prices, an increase in
operating costs as percentage of revenues, or combinations of these factors.
In this case, the rate of return would be 4% as compared with the best
estimate of 6% (Annex 13).

Employment and Balance of Payments Effects

7.08      Approximately 8,000 man-years of employment were created during the
eight years of construction of the infrastructural works. In 1983, there were
about 1,000 employees working in the first hotel and the hotel training center
at Nusa Dua. When in full operation, the program of investments will have
generated about 4,000 additional permanent hotel jobs. The program will,
also, have generated an additional 1,000 jobs in tourism enterprises outside
the hotels in the tourism complex, for a total increase in direct employment
of about 6,000 persons, and further indirect employment of about 3,000 persons
in activities providing goods and services to the tourists and tourism enter-
prises. Finally, substantial employment for hotel construction in the project
area will be generated.

7.09      Gross foreign exchange revenues attributable to the program of
infrastructure and superstructure investments are estimated at about US$65
million (in 1983 prices and rates of exchange) in 1990 when all facilities in
the tourism complex are expected to become fully operational. This is roughly
the same amount in 1983 prices as projected in the appraisal for 1985 (the
year then scheduled for full operations); namely, about US$48 million in 1979
prices and exchange rates. Allowing for operating costs in foreign exchange
and annual debt service and profit repatriation on foreign investments, net
foreign exchange earnings in 1990 are calculated at about US$44 million (in
1983 prices and rates of exchange), or 67% of gross earnings.

                            VIII.     BANK PERFORMANCE


8 . 01    Besides providing financial assistance, the Bank helped the
Indonesian Government to conceive and plan the tourism infrastructure
development within the framework of a comprehensive sectoral approach. The
Bank was also instrumental in the enactment of legislation regulating the
development of tourism ih Bali, particularly for the protection of social and
cultural environments, and in the creation of the Bali Tourism Development
Corporation (BTDC) for promoting hotel investment as well as maintaining and
operating the Nusa Dua tourism complex.

8.02      Because the project included an unusually wide range of infrastruc-
ture facilities, the project coordinating agency (BTDC) benefited from the
assistance of several Bank project divisions in supervising the implementatio
of specific project works such as improvement of the road networks in the
early stage of project implementation and improvement of the agricultural
programs in the final phase. Following from this project, the Bank's
agriculture division has continued to undertake technical assistance to the
Regional Department of Agriculture in Bali to enhance the improvement of
agricultural products and distribution systems.

8.03      This type of an integrated tourism project should have been prepare
more carefully in terms of project concept and design from the economic
aspects of the project. Since the economic viability of the touri~m project
is very sensitive to changes in the world-wide economic situation, the
question remains as to whether the Bank should have been more cautious in its
demand projections, more conservative in project design and obtained firmer
assurances from private hotel investors before proceeding with such an
ambitious project. The project was also financed prematurely in terms of
readiness of designs.


                                IX.    CONCLUSIONS


9.01      The delays encountered in project implementation as well as the
slowdown in the development of international tourism following the 1973-74 an
the 1979/80 energy crises resulted in a much slower development of accommoda-
tion facilities in the project area than expected. Consequently, a comprehen
sive evaluation of the project needs to be postponed to a later stage when a
hotels and other tourist facilities are in place and operational. However, i
1s already possible to formulate a number of observations:

     (a)   The project has achieved its objective by introducing and promoting
           new development policies for tourism in Bali to correct the uncon-
           trolled growth of tourism facilities which took place during the
           early 1970s and threatened the qualities that provide Bali with its
           unique attractions for tourists. In particular, the selection of
           Nusa Dua for future development of tourism facilities was appro-
           priate in the light of the objectives of protecting the unique
           social and cultural life as well as the physical environment on the
                                  - 15 -


        island while maximizing the benefits from the expansion of   th~
      · tourism industry in Bali.

(b)    In terms of physical accomplishment, the project fulfilled its goal
       within a reasonable cost, although it took longer than the original
       schedule for completion. Part of the delay was caused by initial
       delays in project start-up which could have been avoided by advanc-
       ing the preparation of final engineering for the project infrastruc-
       ture before project appraisal. The present Bank policy requiring
       substantial completion of final engineering before Board presenta-
       tion stems from similar problems experienced in many of the Bank's
       infrastructure projects.

(c)    The project has been adversely affected by the worldwide economic
       setbacks in the 1970s and the investment climate for hotel develop-
       ment at Nusa Dua deteriorated substantially because of the relative
       stagnation in the development of international tourism after 1973.

(d)    The development of accommodation facilities is the most important
       element to stimulate the potential market for tourism to a new
       tourist destination. The project was designed to accommodate
       international-standard hotels which require a relatively large
       capital investment, but the economic slow down made it more
       difficult for potential hotel investors to mobilize capital funds.
       It might have been desirable for the project design to have been
       more flexible, in order to include much simpler accommodation
       facilities which could attract both foreign and domestic tourists.

(e)     Project financing was limited to basic infrastructural facilities.
        It would have been desirable to have provided adequate funds in the
        early stage of project implementation as seed capital for the
        initial hotel development under the project.

(f)     In terms of goals and resource mobilization, the Bali Tourism
        Project constitutes an original and ambitious project. Its success
        will be measured in the coming five to ten years according to the
        actual growth of tourism accommodation capacity and tourist arrivals
        and revenues in the project area. Environmental control and inte-
        grated physical and economic planning stand out among the major
        project achievements and are instrumental to an optimal growth. To
        ensure that these achievements remain a lasting legacy of the
        project, it is essential that the institutions built for the project
        implementation stay in place and progressively shift from construc-
        tion to monitoring and supervision activities. Government is aware
        of this need and is taking measures to this effect.

           . COMMENTS ON THE PROJECT COMPLETION :REPORT
             OF niE BALI TOURISM · PROJECT. FOR INDONESIA


INTRODUCTION
As stated in the Appraisal, the main objectives of the Nus a Dua
tourism estate project, are · ·
   to develop international tourism in Bali with the multiple
   objectives of increasing foreign exchange earning,creating
   empl~ymen t, improving the :lncome generating and also supporting
   the .regional development;
   protecting the unique social and cultural life as well as
   the physical environment of the island.

Abovementioned objectives have partly been fulfilled following
the operation of ~ 1,375 hotel rooms mid 1985.
Delays encountered in project implementation, as well as the
slower development hotel construction, for reasons     already
described in the PCR, were deterrents for the achievements of
promising results of the large investment (US$ 37.9 millions
equivalent to Rp. 20.756 millions) for the next 5 years.
This does not imply the inactiveness of BTDC; whereas attempts
have been made to improve the ·balance sheet in the year 1984
and the projections for the year 1985 (enclosed),and together
with the Government to increase the number· of tourist arrivals.

We will limit our comments on the PCR only to the extent concerning
the role and performance of BTDC, and mainly those aspects
closely related to the following :
     - infrastructure
     - hotel investments
     - BTDC operation.

INFRASTRUCTURE
The construction of the infrastructure followed the guidelines
of appraisal but some discrepancies arose during its irnple -
mentation in connection with :
                                          - 40 -                   ATTACHMENT
                                                                   (Page 3 of 6)




            1. Additional project components i.e. : Training Hotel, Recycle
               water system, NS- N6 Utility extension, beach protection.
            2. The revision of the Amenity Core design.
            3. The cancellation of the multi purpose road.

            We believe that the PCR should also describe the considerations
            for among others
            . 1. The practical needs of additional project components as :
                 ~.   The Training Hotel in conjunction with the Hotel Traming
                      Centre.
                 b. · The revision of the Amenity Core de_sign to the development
                      of the idea to have an own BTDC Office and a workshop.
                 c. The beach protection, as was badly required to avoid
                      further disastrous erosion to the beach.
                 d. NS - N-6 Utility Extension as a facility to provide the
                      infrastructure for the Club Mediterranee, who has chosen
                      a hotel lot reserved for the second phase development.
             2. Saving obtained with the adoption of a recycle water system.
            3. The need for future development as the requirement of land
               for the Golf Course, public facilities and housing for Nusa
               Dua employees.

            Since the telecommunication sys~em was financed withlocal funds,
            (Perumtel), hope the present STO system is not performing
            satisfactoryly and a digital system is necessary.

            Meanwhile another project component : The Demonstration Farm
            was not developed in accordance with the plan.
            The Agricultural Dept of The Republic of Indonesia was in charge
            of the project and the field activities were done by the
            Agricultural office of Bali who were the local counterparts in
            cooperation with BTDC who provided the finance from the IDA
            Credit as well as the Rupiah fund.


             STO (Automatic Telephone Station)
~   ;   .

                                                        (Page 4 of 6)




No visibly results were achieved because physically a demonstration
farm was never realized and only experimental planting in various
places were undertaken without any traces left as soon as the
experiment was completed.

In general, the infrastructure was completed and ready for
investments at the end of 1982, four years behind schedule ,
since :
   there was a delay in completing the design ;
   delay in awarding contracts to contractors, because the
   World Bank's and Government's approvals were required for
   tenders using international competitive bidding ;
   technical matters in the field.

The investment cost amounted to Rp. 2 0, 7 56 millions or equivaient
to US$ 37.4 millions.
Total investment in Rupiah was 38% higher than estimated while
the US Dollar equivalent was 3.4% higher than estimated.

The high cost increase in Rupiah equivalent was among others
the result of the Rupiah devaluation in November 1978.
As a result the cost of project components which were bidded
and completed after the year 1978 considerably increased
especially the foreign exchange component.

Moreover, the cost for the experts also increased in concurrence
with the extended project completion.


HOTEL INVESTMENT
With the start of i~frastructure construction, BTDC startedalso
its efforts in attracting hotel investors.
Various methods were utilized but it appeared that the project
was not as attractive for hotel investors, whereas the number of
tourist arrivals closely related to the air policy, was very
important to them.

        As a result the hotel investment and the availability of hotel
        room as estimated in the appraisal· (2,500 rooms) were not met
        in 1983, but most probably to be reached in 1989.
        With reference to latest development, total available rooms
        will be as follows
                 1985/1986     1,375     rooms
                 1987          1,790     rooms
                 1988          2,140     rooms
                 1989          2,415     rooms
                 1991          2,740     rooms
                 1992          3,075     rooms
                                          :
        Any improvement in the air policy, where international . lines
        are allowed to land directly in Bali, would increase the foreign
        investors arrivals, and based hereon would assure the requiranent
        and construction of the above ·estimated total of rooms.


        BTDC'S OPERATION
        a.   BTDC income entirely depends on the total of hotel rooms in
             operation in Nusa Dua.
             In order to attract hotel investors, in particular at the
             beginning (up to 1983), a revision to the land rent was
             introduced. This has caused a decrease in income.

        b.   An extensive construction period together with the extension
             of the grace period resulied in an increase at the total
             cost of investment.
             On the other hand, delay in hotel construction has brought
             financial consequences to the company's income at the start
             of its operations (1983) and this will maintain during the
             next 8 years.

        c.   BTDC will reach the break-even point position when 1,700
             rooms will be in operation. This will be achieved in 1987
             if there is no delay in the completion of the Club
             Mediterranee Village.

                                                                     (Page 6 of 6)




              d.   The financial internal rate of return on BTDC's investment
                   is estimated at 5%, provided that all hotels are in operation
                   according to schedule.
                   Above mentioned figure will become even smaller when ever
                   an economical depression occurs influencing investors
                   intention to participate in Nusa Dua.
              e.   Increase of the internal rate of return appears difficult
                   due to our commitment to the present land rent system.
                   Should an adjustment, as stipulated in the appraisal to
                   accept payment for a certain period in advance be adopted,
                   this measure will however not help to increase the IRR.
                   It will only improve the cash flow since the accounting
                   treatment on advance payments . will not consider that
                   income as the total income.
              f.   The solution to overcome the low IRR and at concurrently
                   also the continuining loss in the short-run, is to defer
                   the present rent system to one or two hotel lots, and
                   apply instead the acceptance of payments for the usage and
                   utilization of that particular hotel lot for the period of
                   30 or SO year ("restricted sale").
