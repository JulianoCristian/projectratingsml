The project also placed\n            a great emphasis on the importance of protecting the unique\n            social and cultural life as well as the physical environment\n            on the island while maximizing the benefits from the\n            expansion of the tourism industry in Bali. At the time of\n            appraisal in 1973, Bali's population of about 2.2\n            million was unevenly distributed, reflecting the\n            community's dependence on agricultural land. While the\n            population grew at a rate of about 2 percent per annum, the\n            scope for additional agricultural production and employment\n            was limited by the severe pressure of population on the\n            land. In these circumstances, tourism had (and still has)\n            high development priority for the island as a principal\n            means of expanding productive activity and employment in the future."}, "docdt": "1985-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
