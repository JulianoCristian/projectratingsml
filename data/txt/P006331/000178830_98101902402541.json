alternative technologies,\n            institutional arrangements, and an integrated approach in\n            urban development. The components were chosen in sectors of\n            activity where large-scale investment projects will be\n            selected: upgrading and providing urban services (water\n            supply, sanitation, garbage collection); urban\n            infrastructure (industrial sites, transport); income and\n            employment generation programs; and institutional\n            development. In addition, the pilot civil works are an\n            integral part of the preparation of the feasibility studies.\n            Test methods, technologies, and institutional arrangements\n            will be used to execute more important civil works investments."}, "docdt": "1982-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
