In particular the project will:\n            help improve the road network; continue the Bank's\n            support started in the first transport project for the\n            development of modern management tools in GDDP; introduce\n            competitve bidding for road works; improve the road safety\n            situation; and initiate the development of modern combined\n            transport systems.  The project comprises two components:\n            (a) policy and institutions, including the development and\n            implementation of policies covering adequate maintenance and\n            strengthening of high-priority roads and bridges, planning\n            and project evaluation techniques and competitive bidding\n            procedures for carrying out work, and road safety; and (b)\n            investments in rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment and/or\n            resurfacing of priority roads sections, emergency bridge\n            reconstruction and repair, road safety measures, technical\n            assistance, studies and training of highway staff, and a\n            pilot project for the development of combined transports."}, "docdt": "1993-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
