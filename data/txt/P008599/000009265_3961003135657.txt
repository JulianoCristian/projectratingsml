REIOT AND RECOMMENDATIO  OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INI RNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTU(;ICON AND DEVELOPMEN
TO TH EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EOUIVALENT TO US$150 MILLI
TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A ROADS PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Poland for th_ equivalent of US$150 million, in support of a Roads
Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including a grace period of 5 years at the
standard variable interest rate.
2.    &agkg=rDjd: Poland's transport sector is in the midst of a complete restructuring
which aims at the breakup of the old monopolistic organizations and the implementation of a
new tansport policy aimed at more efficient transport based on increased competition. To
this end many of the former monopolistic enterprises have been broken up into smaller part,
restrictions on access to the markets have been removed, tariffs have been freed from
Government controls and subsidies have been reduced. Substantial progress has been
achieved; operating subsidies to transport enterprises have been reduced to a thfid of their
1989 level, tariffs have been raised to better reflect costs and private trucking companies
have developed rapidly. Half of all trucks are now privately owned, which provides real
competition both within the trucking industry and also to the railways.
3.    Road traffic has shown a spectacular increase during the past 20 years. Since 1970
the number of cars has increased more than 10 times, although car ownership, now at a level
of 124 cars/1O00 inhabitants, is still only one third of Western European levels. During the
past 5 years the annual growth rate has been 7-8% and the average growth in traffic on the
national road network was 4% per year. On the main network, traffic increased at a rate of
7% per year. Due to Poland's difficult budget situation, funding for roads has decreased
steeply over the last few years, with the total GDDP budget of 1991 being a thrd of what it
was in 1987. This has created a significant backlog of maintenance and rehabilitadon. With
the continuing increases in traffic, road accidents have increased and Poland now has one of
the highest per capita rates of highway fatalities in Europe. There is also an urgent need to
plan for the future construction of urban by-passes and motorways. The present project
addresses priority needs of the national road network and its administration.
4.    Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector: The Bank has been involved in the sector
since the late 80's. The ongoing First Transport Project (Loans 3193-PO and 3194-PO,
US$4.8 and US$145.0 millions respectively, Staff Appraisal Report 8431-POL of April 5,
1990) aims to support the restructuring of the sector through developing more efficient



-2 -
internal management systems and maintenance procedures, together with the financing
necessary to support this. The project has concentrated heavily on the Polish Railways, with
a smaller component going to the Highway Administration for the establishment of a
Pavement Management System which includes the supply of field measurement equipment
and computers as well as the supply of laboratory equipment for better on-site quality control
of works. The project is progressing well, with policy reform and restructuring being
implemented faster than foreseen and with disbursements well ahead of schedule. The steady
progress of the ongoing project has demonstrated that it is possible to achieve meaningful and
reasonable results in the sector, based on a clear understanding between the parties on the
necessity of the measures proposed.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement: Poland's economic reform program both raquires
and drives the restructuring and modernization of the transport sector. As the necessary
public and private actions are complex and time-consuming, they need to be viewed as a
long-term process, which will be constantly modified and needs to be supported over the long
run. The Bank'_. strategy of assistance to Poland focusses on the redefinition of the role of
the state in the economy, including establishment of a Government role and capacities
appropriate to a more i-arket-oriented economy, and privatization. Through this proposed
project, the Bank will help put this stategy into practical operaion in the roads sector.
Through sector and project work, the Bank is also helping to mobilize additional sources of
finance for the sector, in the context of sound sectoral and fiscal policies.
6.    :Mect gbiwdves: The main objective of the project is to support and speed up the
modernization and transformation of the sector along the lines described above, with sp xial
emphasis on the national road network and the administration responsible for it, GDDP. In
particular the project would: (i) help impro,ve the road network; (ii) continue the Bank's
support started in the first Tmn'port Proje3t for the development of modern management
tools in GDDP; (i help develop a privaze construction industry and introduce competitive
bidding for road works; (iv) improve the road safety situation; (v) and initiate e
development of modern combined transport systems. In order to achieve these objectives,
the project wil address questions like GDDP's budget, evaluation and selection of
investments, and road safety.
7.    PoEact Description: (a) Poicy. The Government will develop and implement
policies covering: adequate maintenance and strengthening of high-priority roads, including
bridges; road safety; planning, project evaluation and investment selection techniques and
competitive bidding procedures for carrying out of works. (b) Investments and Institutions.
A portion of GDDP's 1993-95 investment program in the following areas would be financed
from the loan: rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment or resurfacing of priority road
sections, emergency bridge reconstruction and repair, road safety measures; TA, studies and
training of GDDP and contractors' staff; TA and equipment for a road safety program; and a
pilot project for the development of combined transports through the estabLishment of a



- 3 -
company, comprised of existing transport enterprises, which would operate a number of
terminals and assume responsibility for door to door transport.
S.   Aoject Smplemenatim: The project would be implemented through MTME and
GDDP. The Bank's first transport project has already developed some implementation and
procurement capacity in GDDP. Further development of this capacity is part of the project.
Sample bidding documents for works are being prepared, and it is intended to prequalify
contractors for bidding before loan negotiations. The Road Safety and the Combined
Transport Pilot Projects will be administered through MTME.
9.   Prect Sustanability
The project is considered to be sustainable. The institutional development is wel
underway, in part through the ongoing project and in part through actions started during the
preparation of the proposed project. The risks associated with institutional development are
terefore small. With respect to financial constraints, see para. 13, Risks, below.
10.  ABions Agneed; During loan negotiations, confirmation/agreement were reached on
the following:
(I)        Government to have prepared a restructuring/privatization plan for
former GDDP road and bridge construction enterprises and for the
former PKS road transport enterprises to be discussed with the Bank
not later than December 31, 1993;
i)         MTME to prepare a policy statement on axle load policy by June 30,
1994;
(iii)      all major GDDP investments (US$5 million or more) regardless of
financing source, to show an ERR of not less than 12%;
(iv)       first year's road/bridge works program;
(v)        methodology for bridge reconstruction/rehabilitation economic
evaluation;
(vi)       Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance and Training;
(vii)       Road Safety Action Plan and administrative arrangements for road
safety;
(viii)     cost estimates;
(ix)       financing arrangements and availability of sufficient and timely
*                          counterpart funds and that Government will:
(a)   make best efforts to gradually incrase, in accordance with
budgetary capabilities, expenditures for national road
maintenance in a manner and to levels that are technically and
economically justified; and



(b)  ensure that budgetary expenditures for national road
maintenance in 1993 and thereafter, will be given the highest
priority within GDDP's budget, and that investments, except in
emergencies and other specially justified circumstances, will be
undertaken after the above mentioned priority is satisfied;
(x)         Road Sector Development Statement and Annual Consultations;
(xi)        arrangements and format of quarterly and audit reports;
(xii)      fMrmat of contracts and ICB documentation; and
(Xiii)      Special Account and disbursement conditions.
11.   Environmental Consideradons: The project has been classified as a "B" under OD
4.00, Annex A, for the road modernization component, meaning that limited environmental
review will be required. The civil works are generally improvements to existing roads on
their existing alignments; in most cases they will bring improvements to drainage, less dust
and noise, and increased traffic safety. The Polish Ministry of the Environment has
stablished strict procdures for reviewing the environmental impact of highway projects
which are administred by the environmental departments of the voivodships. The legislation
esta0lishes levels of review appropriate to the class of works proposed, ranging from a
review of the design report and drawings through to a full EA, which is required in the case,
for example, of bypasses on new alignments. The appraisal mission has determined that
these procedures are similar to the Bank's and that EAs will be (and in some cases already
have been) prepared in aU the circumstances in which the Bank would require one. Thus the
Bank can have confidence that compliance with these procedures will also bring compliance
with the Bank's. There is already considerable environmental awareness in Poland, and the
power of the voivodship (provincial) administrations to exercise control over central
government agencies is used. For this reason it has been agreed that an environmental
clearance with a copy of the EA, if so required, will be a condition of the Bank's No
Objection to invitations for bids.
12. pEWtk Benefits: The project will: (i) reduce vehicle operating costs; (ii) reduce
future costly reconstruction by timely and adequate maintenance; (iii) reduce road accidents;
(iv) contribute to reduced road construction costs by exposing the local construction industry
to competitive bidding procedures; and (v) make a start to developing combined transports
in Poland. Based on experience from similar projects elsewhere, an ERR of about 20% can
be expected for the type of works included in the project.
13.  Riakj: The main risk is the availability of adequate local funds, which are presently
insufficient. The fiscal pressures in Poland are likely to remain such that careful evaluation
of priorities and ongoing discussions on inter and intrasectoral budgetary trade-offs will
continue to be an essential element of Poland's cooperation with the World Bank. More
specifically in the transport sector it is recommended that GDDP's budget be annually



reviewed and agreed with the Bank. This sanme agreement would also address another
potential risk, viz. the sometimes expressed opinion that Poland should initiate a crash
program of motorway construction, even at the expense of maintaining the existing network.
14.   Recommendations: I am satisfied that this loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
operation.
