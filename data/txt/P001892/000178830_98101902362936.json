  Government expenditure on housing, and redirection from\n            building rental units at subsidized rates to provision of\n            housing credit for lower income groups. The project will\n            also strengthen institutions responsible for urban planning,\n            development and maintenance. The project has the following\n            main components. (a) Land development for housing and\n            community facilities at La Tour Koenig; (b) Housing credit\n            for home improvement and construction including housing at\n            La Tour Koenig; (c) Rehabilitation of housing and urban\n            services in poor areas damaged by cyclones; (d) Upgrading of\n            urban services particularly solid waste collection and\n            disposal; (e) Improvement of public transport and traffic management."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
