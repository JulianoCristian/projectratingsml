     Electrification (Eleventh Power) is to support NEB's\n            program to extend electricity supply outside the urban\n            areas, in the less developed states of Kedah, Kelantan,\n            Trengganu, Pahang, Johor and Perak. The project includes the\n            extension of distribution facilities for supply to about\n            82,000 residential consumers, and to commercial and\n            industrial consumers. It also includes construction of the\n            275 kV Malacca-Yong Peng-Scudai line and the 132 kV\n            Kluang-Mersing and Kota Tinggi-Tg Ramunia lines. The project\n            aims to strengthen the institutional capability of NEB by\n            providing assistance for strengthening the corporate\n            planning function, improving the accounting system and\n            augmenting the training facilities. Consulting services to\n            improve the efficiency of the existing structure of\n            NEB's tariffs and to carry out feasibility studies for\n            a hydro project are also included."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
