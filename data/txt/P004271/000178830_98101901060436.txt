ELEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          The National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB)
Guarantor:         Malaysia
Loan
Amount:            US$70.0 million equivalent [including the capitalized front
end fee]
Terms:             Repayable in 15 years including three years' grace Pt the
standard variable interest rate-
Pro ject
Description:       The objective of the project is to support NEB's program to
extend electricity supply outside the urban areas, in the
less developed states of Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang,
Johor and Perak. It includes proposals for the extension of
distribution facilities resulting in supply to about 82,000
residential consumers in addition to commercial and
industrial consumers. The project includes the construction
of the 275 kV Malacca-Yong Peng-Scudai line and the 132 kV
Kluang-Mersing and Kota Tinggi-Tg. Ramunia lines. The
project aims to strengthen the institutional capability of
NEB by providing assistance for strengthening the corporate
planning function, improving the accounting system and
augmenting the training facilities. Consulting services to
improve the efficiency of the existing structure of NEB's
tariffs and carrying out feasibility studies for a hydro
project are also included.
Risks:             There is a risk of delay in the implementation of the
project due to delay that can be caused in the acquisition
of land for substations and wayleave for transmission
lines.  However, land for four out of seven substations is
already available and existing wayleave will be used for a
part of the 275 kV line. For the balance, NEB has
established a satisfactory action plan to complete the
acquisition to suit the project implementation schedule.

I. ENERGY AND THE POWER SECTOR
Overview
1.01      With a per capita income of about US$1,840 in 1982, Malaysia is one
of the most prosperous developing countries in Asia. The real GDP grew at a
compound growth rate of 7.8% during the period 1970-80; the total energy con-
sumption grew at 8.6%. About 92% of the total energy consumption was met by
petroleum products, amounting to about 52.0 million barrels of oil equivalent
In 1980 (about 150,000 barrels per day). Of this 43% was used for the trans-
port sector, 29% for electric power generation, 21% for industry and 7% for
residential and commercial uses. However, Malaysia is a net exporter of
oil. Substantial reserves of natural gas have also been discovered (para.
1.03).
Energy Resources
Oil
1.02      Oil production in Malaysia increased from about 100,000 barrels per
day (bpd) in 1975 to about 400,000 bpd in 1983. Official estimates of remain-
ing recoverable reserves were 1.74 billion barrels, which are considered
conservative. Industry sources put ultimate recoverable reserves at about 3-
3.6 billion barrels. Notwithstanding the higher reserves, with consumption
growing at 8 to 9% p.a., the country could be a net importer of oil in the
next decade if no substitution takes place.
Gas
1.03      Recoverable reserves of non-associated gas have been estimated at
over 38 trillion standard cubic feet (scf), which is equivalent to about
6 billion barrels of oil. There are about twenty offshore gas fields, the
majority being near Trengganu. Two fields offshore in Sarawak are under
development by Shell to supply gas to the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in
Bintulu, recently completed, which at peak production will yield 6 million
tons of LNG per year for export to Japan. Industrial developments including
ammonia/urea plants are also planned in the Bintulu area. A gas gathering
system and a pipeline under construction from gas fields offshore Trengganu to
transport the gas to a 900 MW combined cycle power generating plant at Paka
will be completed in 1984-86. A 50 MW gas-fired generating plant is under
construction at Labuan island in Sabah.
1.04      A study to evolve a master plan for the long term development and
utilization of gas commissioned by the Petroleum Agency in Malaysia (Petronas),
has been completed./l Long term development strategy indicates a need for gas
pipeline extension from the East Coast to the more populous West Coast and to
/1   Master Plan study for Gas Utilization:  Chem System Inc. and Davy

Singapore, for use of gas as a fuel in power plants. Consultants are appoin-
ted for a detailed feasibility study of the gas pipelines. Use of gas for
development of variouis petrochemical industries is also proposed.
Coal
1.05      Malaysia does not have significant reserves of coal.  Estimates of
recoverable coal resources, located primarily in Sarawak, are 400-500 million
tons, which are mainly of lignite type with high moisture content, Development
activities in the domestic coal industry are at present only at the preli-
minary exploration stage. However, imported coal is proposed to be used for
power generation (para 3.05).
Hydropower
1.06      Hydro potential in Malaysia is considerable, estimated at
120,000 Glh per year (more than 10 times the total electricity production in
1982).  However, nearly 71% of it is located in Sarawak and 16% in Sabah where
demand is low. Present hydro capacity in Peninsular Malaysia of about 800 MW
(2,700 GWh) will reach 1,200 MW by 1986 with the addition Kenyir, now under
construction. Projects totalling over 1,000 MW are under different stages of
study.
1.07      In view of Peninsular Malaysia's limited hydro resources, studies
are being carried out for the exploitation of Sarawak's hydro potential for
possible transmission of bulk power to Peninsular Malaysia (para. 3.07)
The Power Sector
1.08      Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous Government
entities. The National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) serves
Peninsular Malaysia, while the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and Sarawak
Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) serve the two states on the island of
Borneo. Total capacity installed by these entities at end-FY83 was 2,892 MW,
of which the NEB accounted for 2,610 MW. Annex-1, tables A to D give the
statistical data about electricity generation and sales in Malaysia.
1.09      Nearly 75% of the NEB's generating capacity is oil based, which
produces about 86% of the total electrical energy. The composition of the
NEB's generating capacity based on oil would be reduced from 75% at present to
below 50% in the next 5 years due to the commissioning of hydro, gas and coal
fired stations. (Annex-8). If a gas pipeline to the West Coast materializes,
most of the oil-fired plants would also be converted to gas firing in the next
decade, reducing dependence on oil for power generation to only 10% of the
total.
Access to Electricity
1.10      The population of Peninsular Malaysia in 1982 was estimated to be
11.7 million; the per capita electricity consumption was about 760 kWh and
production of 855 k1lh. About 62% of 2.4 million households in the Peninsula
are electrified. The total number of rural households in Malaysia in 1980 was



-3-
about 1.5 million. Progress in rural electrification has resulted in an
increase in rural households electrified by the NEB from 100,000 in 1970 to
about 450,000 in 1980. The degree of electrification in different states
varies from a high of about 92% to a low of about 45%. Pahang, Kedah,
Kalantan, Johor, Trengganu and Perak are the least electrified states with 45
to 62% electrification (Annex-2). The degree of electrification in rural
areas in these states is considerably lower.
Sector Organization
1.11      A cabinet committee on energy formed in 1980 is responsible for
evolving the energy policy. It consists of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime
Minister, and Ministers of Energy, Trade and Industry, and Science and Tech-
nology. This committee is supported by a "Committee of Officials" chaired by
the Chief Secretary to the Government and having representatives from
Petronas, the Treasury, the Ministries of Energy, Science and Technology,
Trade and Industry, NEB and the Economic Planning Unit (EPU).
1.12      The Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts (ETP), created
in 1979, has the responsibility for coordinating the activities of diverse
government agencies dealing with energy. However, in practice, the Ministry's
responsibility for energy policy so far has been limited and consists primar-
ily of jurisdiction over NEB. In 1980, an Energy Unit was created in the
Ministry to act as a secretariat for the cabinet committee on Energy. This
unit is expected to have a wider role in the energy sector in future.
1.13      Petronas, established in 1974, as a Government company, has opera-
ting responsibilities in the oil and gas sector. Malaysia's Petroleum
Development Act gives it exclusive rights over exploration and production of
petroleum. It supervises work programs for exploration and production of con-
tracting oil companies and has authority to negotiate future production
sharing agreements. Petronas' own exploration activities are undertaken
through a subsidiary company, Petronas Carigali Berhad, formed in 1978.
Sector Issues and Bank Role
1.14      The principal task in the energy sector is to reduce the heavy
dependence on oil, thereby extending the life of oil reserves and protecting
foreign exchange earnings. In the power sector this objective is being
pursued by constructing all future generating capacity based on hydro, gas or
coal (para. 1.09). During the appraisal of the tenth power project (Loan
2146-MA) it was agreed to finance two studies to help NEB in future planning;
one dealing with the implications of using coal for power generation and
another for long-range planning of the power system. The coal utilization
study, which is completed, has identified suitable sites for coal fired
thermal generating plants and arrangements for coal handling; terms of refer-
ence for the system planning study have been finalized, and NEB has strength-
ened its system planning group to undertake the study with the help of expert
assistance from outside.
1.15      Rapid development of gas resources, with a clear understanding of
how best to use the gas, is an important task. A Gas Utilization Study has



-4-
been recently completed (para. 1.04), in which the Bank assisted the Govern-
ment (Petronas) in drafting terms of reference and advising on consultants'
contract. The Bank is also financing an Energy Planning Study through the
ninth power project (1808-MA) which commenced in November 1983. It will
analyze available information on the supply side, prepare detailed demand
analysis, and help in long-term policy decisions in the energy sector.
1.16      Efficient pricing of energy resources to promote rational use and
conservation is important. While the fuel oil for electricity generation was
charged at the international price, subsidies existed in the domestic price of
kerosene and diesel. The Government has recently eliminated these subsi-
dies. The project provides funds for a detailed study of electricity tariffs
(para. 5.07).
1.17      The level of electrification in rural areas in Malaysia has been low
and the rural electrification program has been accelerated since 1976
(para. 3.13). A detailed study of the rural electrification program financed
by a Bank Loan (1178-MA) was completed in 1978 (para. 3.14). In the tenth
power loan (Loan 2146-MA) (para. 3.17) agreements were reached and various
measures for improving the efficiency of the rural electrification program
were initiated.
Experience with Past Loans
1.18      The Bank has made ten loans to NEB, aggregating US$369.5 million
(net of cancellations). The projects under the first eight loans have been
completed and are operating satisfactorily. Project performance audit reports
(PMARs) were made for the fifth and sixth loans in 1979 and 1981 respec-
tively. The fifth power project was completed about three months behind sche-
dule with a cost overrun of 15% whereas the sixth project was delayed by
eleven months and the cost overrun was 31%. Both these projects were executed
as planned and achieved their major objectives. The PPAR for the sixth power
project (Report no. 3506 of June 22, 1981) notes that NEB is a well managed
utility and has some effective staff training programs. It concludes that,
apart from the utility's unsatisfactory financial performance (in 1980 and 81)
due to factors beyond the control of its management, the project was a
success. NEB's financial position has since improved (para. 5.03).
1.19      The seventh and eighth power projects have been completed
satisfactorily. The implementation of the ninth power project is also on
schedule. All units at Bersia hydro electric station were commissioned in
1983; the first two units at Kenering were commissioned in 1983 and the third
unit was commissioned in March 1984. All these were in accordance with the
SAR schedule. The implementation of the tenth power project (Rural
Electrification) has been slowed down because of the Government's decision to
reduce investments on rural electrification and minihydro program due to
current constraints on its domestic resources. Currently, discussions are in
progress to define the reduced scope of the project.

II. THE BORROWER
2.01      The borrower will be the National Electricity Board (NEB) of the
States of Malaya (Peninsular Malaysia). The proposed loan will be the Bank's
eleventh loan to the power sector in Malaysia.
Organization, Management and Operation
2.02      NEB is an autonomous Government-owned corporation, established under
the Electricity Act of 1949, and is responsible to the Ministry of Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts. NEB is a well-established entity and has the
capability to implement major projects.
2.03      NEB is both a regulatory and an operating agency responsible for the
generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in the Peninsula.
NEB has the legal power to set tariffs (para 5.08) and to grant licenses to
independent electricity works.
2.04      NEB's operational and policy decisions are made by the Board of
Directors. All members of the Board are appointed by the Minister of Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts, who establishes their terms. The Chairman of
the Board is the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet and the Deputy Chairman is the
General Manager of NEB. NEB's management is competent.
2.05      NEB's operation is divided into four departments: Development
Planning, Major Projects, Operations and Administration; each department is
headed by a Deputy General Manager. The Development Planning Department,
which combines the functions of technical and financial planning, acts as a
catalyst to improve coordination between different departments. It is cur-
rently in the process of reviewing its functions and redefining the responsi-
bilities within the organization. There is a need to strengthen NEB's inte-
grated corporate planning capabilities, particularly in the areas of financial
planning. Consulting services are envisaged to assist in this task and other
related areas. Under the proposed loan, funds have been provided for this
purpose. NEB has finalized the terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and
has agreed to appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank by December 31,
1984.
2.06      In addition to the four major departments at the headquarters, NEB
has a Corporate Audit Department and three other departments: Rural Electri-
fication, Materials Management, and Accounting; each reports directly to the
General Manager. Subsequent to its re-organization review after the comple-
tion of the management study by the consultants (para. 2.08), NEB has shifted
the Materials Management Department directly under the General Manager. NEB's
headquarters organization chart is given in Annex-3.
2.07      NEB's field operations are organized into five regional areas
including district offices and stations; the regional areas are Northern,
Central, Southern, Eastern and Federal Territory. Some of the responsib-
ilities of the district offices include billing and collections, erection and
maintenance of distribution lines, and the operation and maintenance of diesel



- 6 -
and mini-hydro plants in the districts. The remaining functions are
centralized at the headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.
2.06      In 1982 the Government financed a study by Gilbert/Commonwealth
International (USA) to review NEB's organization, management and operation.
The study was completed by the end of 1982 which concluded that NEB was an
efficient organization but identified areas of improvement. NEB has formed a
senior management committee to supervise various subcommittees which are
assigned to review and implement the consultants' recommendations.
Manpower and Training
2.09      NEB's staff increased from 13,757 employees in 1977 to 24,561 in
1983, averaging about 10% per year since FY77. The number of customers per
employee is about 74. Because of NEB's expanded operation in districts and
growing involvement in rural electrification, the number of its semi-skilled
and unskilled employees has been substantially larger than the number of staff
at the management and technical levels, and was growing at a faster rate until
around 1981 after which NEB took steps restricting hiring of unskilled
employees. Evolution of NEB's manpower from 1977 through 1983 is given in
Annex-4.
2.10      During the past few years NEB has experienced a shortage of trained
staff at the middle management and working levels and mainly in the financial
and accounting areas. NEB has been trying to correct this situation through
various training programs, which comprise scholarships for degrees and
advanced courses in engineering, accounting, computers and management at local
and overseas universities and professional schools. NEB operates its own
training center which provides training and refresher courses for technical
and administrative staff. The project includes funds for augmenting the
training facilities (para. 4.09).
Accounting and Budgeting
2.11      NEB's accounting systems are satisfactory and conform to modern
power utility practices. Accounting applications such as general ledgers,
payroll, stores and accounts payable and receivable at the Board level in
Kuala Lumpur have been computerized. The computer center is well-staffed and
equipped. In the past, there have been some delays in the preparation of
financial reports due to delays in preparing and transmitting accounting
records and summaries from the districts and to the large number of error
rejects encountered in the reports manually prepared by the districts. NEB
plans to computerize the processing at these districts, and the project pro-
vides funds for this work (para. 4.10). This will enable NEB to expedite
accounts closing and to provide timely reports on items such as income
returns, fuel issues, etc; currently, these reports are about two months
behind schedule.
2.12      NEB prepares annual budgets for its capital and operating expendi-
tures. Periodical reports comparing actuals and budget estimates are
regularly prepared and submitted to management for review and monitoring
purposes.



-7-
Billing and Collection
2.13      Bills are prepared monthly by district offices.  In all districts
the meter readers themselves prepare bills on-the-spot and hand them to cus-
tomers. Collections can be made through district offices, post offices and
collection agents under a uniform payment system for all utility bills.
Customers are required to maintain a guarantee deposit equivalent to 60 days
of consumption. These procedures account for the comparatively low level of
customers accounts receivable outstanding (about 50 days billing at the end of
FY83).
Audit and Internal Control
2.14      The accounts of all government-owned corporations including NEB are
required to be closed within six months after the end of the fiscal year and
submitted for audit by the Auditor General under the law. Due to a staff
shortage, the Auditor General has decided to continue to retain external audi-
tors to audit NEB's accounts, subject to Government's final approval. Exter-
nal auditors have been Price Waterhouse and Co. and a local firm (Hanafiah,
Raslan, Mohamad and Partners); both firms have been accepted by the Bank in
the previous loans to NEB.
2.15      During negotiations assurances were obtained that NEB will continue
to employ independent auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit NEB's
accounts. In the past, NEB has been unable to comply with the Bank's existing
covenant requiring submission of annual audited financial statements to the
Bank within six months of the close of NEB's fiscal year. The delay is mainly
due to delays in closing and auditing the accounts and their approval by the
Auditor General's Office. However, NEB has been able to provide the Bank with
unaudited accounts for review within the stipulated time. It was agreed dur-
ing negotiations that NEB will continue to submit unaudited financial state-
ments to the Bank within six months after the end of NEB's fiscal year and
submit audited financial statements together with the Auditor's long-form
reports within nine months after the end of the relevent fiscal year.
2.16      As required under Loan 1808-MA, NEB established in October 1982 a
Corporate Audit Department which is directly responsible to the General
Manager.  Its senior staff include qualified management experts, engineers and
accountants and its responsibilities cover audits of management and technical
as well as accounting operations. To strengthen the department, additional
staff are being employed and various training programs are also being conduc-
ted with assistance from external auditors.
Taxation
2.17      NEB has been exempted since January 1980 for a period of five years
of payment of corporate taxes, development tax and custom duties. The
Government will review the situation at the end of the period.



-8-
Dividends
2.18      NEB pays dividends to the Government on the equity invested.  The
amount paid is decided every year by the Board of Directors. The Electricity
Act sets a limit of 6% as the maximum dividend payout on equity. No dividends
were paid during FYs 80, 81 and 82. With the improved financial position NEB
deciared 5% dividend in FY83.
Insurance
2.19      Since 1964 NEB has retained a firm responsible for providing advice
on risk management. As a result NEB has a mixture of self-insurance for minor
risks and insurance policies for major ones. Every year a detailed review is
undertaken to ensure proper coverage.
III. THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Historical Trend
3.01      NEB's sales of electricity grew at an annual average rate of 12.8%
in the ten year period 1970-80 but have declined to about 7.6% p.a. in the
period 1981-83 (Annex-5).
Load Forecast
3.02      NEB regularly conducts load forecast studies to estimate short term
(5 years) as well as long term (20 years) demand. The short term forecasts
are based on the analysis of past trends and also includes estimation of the
extension of service areas as well as the provision for step input load. It
segregates regional distribution of demand to permit transmission planning.
The long term demand forecast is based on regression analysis utilizing eco-
nomic and demographic parameters. Relationship is derived by analysing his-
torical data. A combination of the short term and the long term forecasts
provides the basis for 10 year projections used for generation planning.
3.03      NEB's official load forecast prepared in 1933 projects the growth in
the period 1982-91 at an average annual rate of about 7.6% (Annex-6). This is
considered reasonable.
Present Generating Capacity
3.04      NEB's generating capacity at the end 1983 was 2,582 MW (Annex-7)
consisting of 790 MW of hydro and the balance thermal using liquid petroleum
fuels.
Generation Expansion Program
3.05      Generating plants totalling to a capacity of 2,630 MW are under
different stages of construction. These consist of 440 MW hydro, 90 MW gas
turbines, 900 MW combined cycle gas fired plant, 600 MW of oil/gas fired
thermal and 600 MW of coal/oil/gas fired thermal (Annex-8). The total



-9-
installed capacity of over 5,000 MW by the end of 1988 would be considerably
in excess of the 1989 requirements demand and would be adequate to meet
currently projected system requirements up to 1991. Therefore, commitment of
new generating capacity will not be necessary till 1986/87.
3.06      The decisions to commit the large generating capacity additions were
taken in the period before 1981 when (a) the system demand growth was high;
(b) gas find near the east coast provided the logic for building a 900 MW com-
bined cycle gas fired plant ahead of the power needs; and (c) desire for oil
substitution prompted earlier initiation of the 600 MW second phase of the
Port Kelang power station as a coal/gas fired station. The investment pro-
gram, however, is well formulated and balanced. NEB has inhouse capability to
formulate the investment plan and reviews it annually.
Long Range Plan
3.07      Formulation of a long-range power development program for the 1990s
is a complex task dependant on the evaluation of several important factors,
both on supply and demand sides. The supply options consist of offshore gas,
imported coal, hydro potential in Sarawak and the nuclear option. Major
policy decisions on the pattern of gas utilization are to be taken on the
basis of the recently completed study (para 1.15). Prefeasibility studies on
the utilization of imported coal for power generation have been recently com-
pleted (para 1.14) and provide a basis for further detailed anlaysis. Feas-
ibility studies for the development of about 1,500 MW of hydro capacity in
Sarawak and transmission of electricity to Peninsular Malaysia, over 1,400 km
away including 600 km of submarine transmission, are being conducted.
3.08      NEB is proposing to initiate a study to prepare the power develop-
ment strategy for the next 15-20 years (para 1.14) which will use the results
of the studies on supply options as well as derive electricity demand fore-
casts using results of the Energy Planning Study (para 1.15).
Transmission
3.09      Transmission development studies were carried out by Preece Cardew
and Rider, (Consultants, U.K.) in 1976 and 1977 and these were reviewed and
updated by NEB. The major transmission program up to 1985-86 consists of
constructing a 275 kV transmission backbone system to integrate all generating
facilities on Peninsular Malaysia and also to facilitate regional development
and accelerate supply of electricity to the east coast. Also transmission
augmentation of the southern grid is proposed (para. 4.04).
Distribution
3.10      For administrative convenience, NEB has divided Peninsular Malaysia
into 25 districts, each headed by a District Manager with complete responsi-
bility for subtransmission, distribution, sales and consumer liaison. Each
district is responsible for planning and implementing expansion of distri-
bution extension schemes. Normally such planning is formalized only one year
ahead, for inclusion in NEB's capital expenditure budget. However, conceptual
planning for the next three to four years is carried out at the district
level. Recently, NEB has taken two steps to provide a longer time frame for



- 10 -
distribution planning. One, the distribution division at headquarters has
been made responsible for coordination of distribution planning. Two, it
appointed a firm of local consulting engineers, Tenaga Ewbank Perunding, who
have prepared a ten-year perspective development plan for distribution
facilities in each state.
Rural Electrification
3.11      In Malaysia, an urban area is defined as a gazetted controlled area
that has a population of 10,000 or more. In 1980, there were 73 urban areas
in Peninsular Malaysia, having about 34% of the total population. Rural elec-
trification (RE) projects are defined as projects which supply electricity to
areas outside the urban areas.
3.12      Rural electrification in Malaysia began in the 1950s when during the
emergency, a large number of villages were electrified from diesel generators
to provide perimeter lighting for security reasons. Originally, the installa-
tions were operated by NEB's predecessor organization (the Central Electricity
Board) on the basis of cost reimbursement from the Government. After the
emergency, the majority of the small systems were sold to private licensees as
they were uneconomic on a full NEB service basis; about 60 licensees still
exist.
3.13      Rural electrification with social objectives, however, commenced on
a small scale with the first five year development plan (1956-60), and
slightly accelerated during the second five year plan (1961-65). During that
decade about 600 villages with about 62,000 consumers were electrified.
Thereafter, greater importance to rural electrification has been given in each
successive five year development plan as illustrated below:
Number of            Number of
villages            residential         Investment
Plan period         electrified            consumers          million M$
1966-70                 635                 52,418                25
1971-75               1,380                 96,727                74
1976-80               3,160                230,000               277
1981-85               3,007               218,821                457
3.14      Under the seventh power project (Loan 1178-MA), financing of a rural
electrification study was included in order to formulate a comprehensive rural
electrification plan and to review its technical, economic and financial
implications (para. 1.17). The study was completed in August 1978 by the
Middle West Service Company of Chicago in association with the Perunding
Bersatu Sdn. Bhd. of Kuala Lumpur.



- 11 -
3.i5      The implementation of the growing rural electrification program was
constrained by several factors, viz. organization, staff, materials procure-
ment, way leaves, etc. In 1978, NEB set up a Rural Electrification Depart-
ment, headed by a Chief Engineer, reporting directly to the General Manager,
and having implementing units in each state. Special steps were also taken to
coordinate materials procurement, wayleave and other activities which were
causing delays. As a result the implementation performance of NEB for rural
electrification improved from about 60% of the planned program in the earlier
years to about 96% towards the end of the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80).
IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The proposed project supports NEB's program of strengthening the
transmission network and extension of the electricity supply outside the urban
areas in the less electrified states of Trengganu, Kelantan, Pahang, Kedah,
Johor and Perak, extending electricity supply to some 82,000 households in
addition to commercial and industrial consumers. Bank's involvement in this
project will ensure that this necessary expansion program is not jeopardized
due to the resource constraints faced by Malaysia and would also strengthen
NEB's capability to attract other sources of financing to meet its large
investment program.
4.02      The project also addresses important aspects of institutional
development of NEB by providing funds for improving its accounting function
and consulting services for the corporate planning function. Also the
proposed tariff study would help in ensuring that the electricity pricing
structure is economically efficient.
Project Description
4.03      The project comprises the following:
(a) 275 kV transmission line from Malacca to Yong Peng and extension up
to Scudai along with associated substation equipment at Malacca and
new substations at Yong Peng and Scudai.
(b) 132 kV transmission lines and substations as follows:
(i) Kluang-Mersing with a new substation at Mersing;
(ii) Kota Tinggi-Tg. Ramunia with a new substation at Tg. Ramunia.
(c) expansion of the distribution network in the States of Johor, Perak,
Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Pahang.
(d) a simulator for the training of the operating staff.



- 12 -
(e) computer equipment and software at various districts of the NEB for
improving the speed and efficacy of the compilation of accounts.
(f) consulting services for the transmission component of the project,
for strengthening corporate planning, for the study of tariff
structure and for feasibility studies of Pergau hydroelectric
project.
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.04      The 275 kV transmission line from Malacca to Scudai via Yong Peng
(route length 233 km) will be a double circuit line with twin ACSR conductors
(300 sq. mm) (map 16192R). A fully switched substation with double busbar
configuration will be established at Malacca with seven 275 kV switching
bays. A new 275 kV/132 kV substation will be established at Yong Peng with
2 x 180 MVA, 275/132 kV autotransformers. The lines from Yong Peng to Scudai
will be initially operated at 132 kV, postponing the construction of the
275/132 kV substation at Scudai, by a few years.
4.05      Both the 132 kV lines are radial lines needed to extend the grid
supply to new areas in eastern Johor. They will be double circuit lines; the
first will have 300 sq.mm and the second 150 sq mm ACSR conductors. Existing
132 kV substations at Kluang and Kota Tinggi will be expanded and new 132/11
kV substations will be set up at Mersing and Tg. Ramunia, each having 2 x 15
MVA transformer capacity.
Distribution
4.06      The project covers a time slice of the program for the extension of
distribution network outside the urban areas in the states of Johor, Perak,
Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Pahang. Annex 9 presents a summary of the
program. The implementation of various elements of the program will be
carried out after a detailed scrutiny of the need and timing. Also NEB has
established procedures for evaluating the financial viability of each
proposal. Only those schemes which meet the technical and economic criteria,
will be implemented. Industrial and commercial consumers are required to pay
connection charges based on the cost of supply and anticipated revenue.
4.07      The following is a summary of the scope of the program in terms of
the physical facilities proposed:

4.09      A multifuel fired (coal/oil/gas) station with 2x300 MW units is
proposed at Port Kelang (para. 3.05) for which NEB proposes to provide
specialized training facilities for the operating staff at their training
school at Kajang. After detailed study, it was concluded that a full scope
facsimile simulator should be utilized for training because of its ability to
fully recreate the prevailing conditions in the control room and fully train
the operating staff off-line.  The decision is justified.  NEB has competant
staff to operate, maintain and effectively utilize such a facility.

Computer System for Accounts
4.10      The project includes distributed   source data generation network
and computerization at various district offices and stations (para. 2.11).
Currently, NEB's computer center at the headquarters processes about one mil-
lion records per month and this volume is increasing at about 10% per year.
Except in Kuala Lumpur, all accounting records are kept and processed manually
at the districts. NEB plans to computerize the accounting applications at
about 90 districts and stations. The computing equipment and software
required would include multi-terminal clusters with disks, printers and word
processors.
Cost Estimate
4.11      Annex-11, tables 1, 2 and 3 give the detailed cost estimates for the
275 kV transmission line, 132 kV transmission lines and substations and the
distribution component respectively. All costs are based on the end 1983
prices; physical contingencies are at 10%. The price contingencies which
amount to 24.4% of the base cost plus physical contingencies, are worked out
on the basis of the following inflation factors:
Year                            1984      1985     1986        1987 and after

Foreign Inflation                     7.5       7.0       6.0             6.0
4.12      Table 4.1 summarizes the project cost estimate.  The costs are net
of taxes and duties since the NEB is exempt from them.
Engineering and Construction
4.13      NEB's Transmission Department will carry out the design, procurement
and construction management of the transmission lines and substations. They
are experienced in carrying out such work and are adequately staffed. The
engineering for the distribution will be carried out by the Distribution
Department and the District Managers' organizations in the states who will
also manage the construction. Procurement of the distribution materials will
be handled by NEB's Materials Management group. These departments are compe-
tent and adequately staffed for the implementation of this Project.
Consulting Services
4.14      The feasibility studies for the 100 MW Pergau hydroelectric project
are estimated to cost US$1.8 million, with a foreign component of US$0.9 mil-
lion which will include remuneration and international travel by expatriate
consultants. The local costs will include subsurface exploration and

December 31, 1984. A provision for 10 man-months of expert assistance for the
tariff study and 25 man-months of expert assistance for corporate planning is
made.
Procurement
4.15      Equipment and services financed under the proposed Bank loan shall
be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Under ICB, local manufacturers will be per-
mitted to participate where appropriate and be eligible for a preference of
15% of the CIF cost of the imported goods or the prevailing custom duties and
other import taxes, whichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids. The Bank-
financed items will include 275 kV and 132 kV lines and substations, some

distribution materials, simulator and computer system. Consulting services
financed under the Bank loan would be engaged in accordance with the Bank
guidelines.
4.16      For the procurement of equipment and related civil works not
financed by the Bank loan, NEB follows ICB procedures for foreign items and
LCB procedures for local items, which are acceptable to the Bank.

procurement documents, which cover all the foreseen contracts.
Implementation Schedule
4.19      Annex-12 gives the implementation schedules for the various elements
of the project. The 132 kV lines and substations will be completed by June
1987 and the 275 kV lines are expected to be completed by January 1988. The
distribution component will be implemented by mid 1988.
Financing Plan
4.20      The financing plan prepared by NEB and agreed with the Bank during
the negotiations is shown below. In the event a B loan does not materialize,
NEB will borrow from commercial banks with the guarantee of the Government.

Disbursement
4.21      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100% of the foreign
expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials; (b) 100% of local
expenditures ex-factory of locally manufactured items (c) 70% of the cost of
items procured locally and (d) 100% of expenditures for consulting services.
4.22      Annex-13 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan
as well as the Bankwide profile of disbursements for distribution and trans-
mission projects, which are very close for the first two years. The disburse-
ment in the third and the fourth year is estimated to be more rapid due to the
nature of the distribution component of the project for which all procurement
financed by the Bank loan will be completed by the end of 1986.
Monitoring and Reporting
4.23      Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project
in terms of physical execution and consumer connections, have been agreed with
NEB who will furnish quarterly progress reports.
Ecology
4.24      Transmission and distribution projects will be designed and carried
out in accordance with the current technological practices and will cause
minimum disturbance to the environment. No safety hazards are foreseen.
V. THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Operating Results
5.01      NEB's past operating results were generally satisfactory.  During
the period FY76 througii FY79, the rate of growth in NEB's operating expenses
exceeded the increase in the operating revenues, primarily because of
increases in operating and fuel costs resulting from the rise in the inter-
national oil prices. However, NEB was able to generate a profit each year and



- 18 -
maintain a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets ranging between 5.0%
and 7.5% until FY79. These results were due partly to an increase in electri-
city sales of about 10% per year and partly to the automatic increases in the
Fuel Cost Variation Charges (FCVC) (para. 5.08).
5.02       In October 1979, the Government approved a 13% increase in NEB's
tariffs, but did not permit the application of FCVC. This increase was,
however, not sufficient to absorb the impact of the steep increase in fuel oil
prices and NEB reported an operating loss of about M$20 million (a net loss of
M$82 mil'lion) in FY80.
5.03      To restore NEB's financial viability the Government permitted
another tariff increase of about 52% in December 1980 to cover the oil price
increases; the Government also abolished the FCVC, but approved a restructur-
ing of the tariff to a progressive block rate (para. 5.07). In addition, the
Government approved the following measures: (a) exempt NEB from taxes and
duties until FY85; (b) temporarily postpone NEB's dividend payment to the
Government; and (c) provide equity contribution to NEB. As a result of these
measures, coupled with subsequent reduction in the world oil prices, NEB's
finances improved significantly with the rate of return on revalued net fixed
assets increasing to about 7% in FY81 and 9% in FY82. For FY83 the rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets is estimated at about 12% and the self
financing ratio including consumers' contribution is estimated over 50%. A
summary of NEB's historical statements for FY76 through FY83 is given in
Table 5.1 below. Detailed financial statements with NEB's performance indica-
tors are presented in Annex-14.

5.05      From FY76 to FY83, NEB's total net fixed assets increased by about
three times and its equity including Government contributions and surplus from
operations increased by nearly four times. Net long term borrowings increased
from M$604 million to about M$2,000 million, with debt/equity ratio (excluding
surplus from asset revaluation) maintained at a comfortable margin around
40/60 and a debt service coverage ratio estimated at about 3.8 times at the
end of FY83.



- 20 -
5.06      NEB's working capital is adequate.  As of August 31, 1983, its
current ratio was 1.1 and has been maintained at this level as required under
the existing Bank loans. The customers' accounts receivable of about one and
a half month's of electricity billing and the inventory level at about four
percent of average gross fixed assets in operation are reasonable. Currently,
the Materials Management Department is working together with the Accounting
Department and the Computer Center to further improve procedures for inventory
control and material management.
Tariffs
5.07      Effective December 1980, the Government approved a new NEB tariff
schedule with eight consumer classes and progressive block rates; the new
tariff replaced NEB's earlier tariff structure with eighteen categories. Five
primary classifications are included in the new tariff - Domestic, Commercial,
Industrial, Mining and Public lighting. Commercial, Industrial and Mining
groups are each divided into two sub-groups for smaller and larger consumers
corresponding to low voltage and high voltage services. NEB uses two basic
forms of tariffs. The first applies to small consumers and is based on elec-
tricity consumption only. The second applies to large consumers and is based
on consumption and maximum demand. However, no detailed tariff study has been
done since 1975. There is a need for NEB to examine, inter alia, its tariff
structure on the basis of the cost of supplying electricity to various
consumer categories and at different times of the day. Consulting services
will be needed for this task. During negotiations, an agreement was reached
that NEB will appoint consultants under terms of reference agreed with the
Bank, by December 31, 1984. The consultants will also train NEB's staff so to
enable them to carry out similar studies in the future.
5.08      Although NEB has the legal power to adjust its tariffs when
required, the Government in practice approves the amount and the timing of
each tariff adjustment. An automatic rate adjustment mechanism of Fuel Cost
Variation Charge (FCVC) was introduced in 1975, but was abolished at the time
of the last tariff increase in December 1980 to avoid cost uncertainties for
industrial consumers and to help control inflationary pressures.
5.09      NEB's current tariff schedule is given in Annex-15.  Projected
tariffs for the period FY84-91 are presented in Table 5.4.
Financing of Development Program
5.10      During the six year period, FY78-FY83, NEB's capital investment
program increased by over three times from M$372 million in FY78 to about
M$1,290 million in FY83. Its net working capital requirement increased by
about M$120 million during the same period (Table 5.3).
5.11      NEB's projected financing plan for the next six year period (FY84-
FY89) is presented in Table 5.3 below. According to this projection, NEB will
finance about 30% of its financial requirements from its own internal sources
(excluding consumers' contribution), notwithstanding the much larger debt
service payments, and working capital and investment requirements during this
period, as against an 18% over the FY78-FY83 period.

5.12      In 1983 the Government granted NEB a blanket guarantee limit for
additional borrowing not exceeding M$2.5 billion up to FY85. Within this
limit and under the standard applicable terms and conditions, NEB can
negotiate without the Government's prior approval, to obtain financing from
sources including commercial banks and bilateral institutions. It is
considered that NEB will have no difficulty in raising the funds required to
finance its development program. In addition, during negotiations assurances
were obtained that the Government will provide adequate funds to help finance
NEB's development program if the need arises.
Future Financial Performance
5.13      Detailed financial projections for the period FY84-91 are presented
in Annex-16 and the assumptions for these projections are given in Annex-17.
A summary of the projected financial performance for FY84-91 is presented in
Table 5.4. Under the assumptions used, NEB's rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets is projected to be maintained above 8%; this is adequate consid-
ering that (a) NEB's average rate base will increase nearly five times; and
(b) its internal sources plus consumers' contribution (after deducting the
working capital increase) will be around 40% during this period. The operat-
ing ratio is also expected to improve from over 80% in earlier years to an
average of about 73% during this period.

Self Financing Ratios
5.14      In the Loan Agreement for the Rural Electrification Project (Loan
2146-MA) it was agreed that NEB will generate the following minimum self-
financing ratios: 15% in FY82 and 83, 20% in FY84, 25% in FY85 and 86 and 30%
thereafter. NEB's actual performance during the two years FY82 and 83 was
substantially higher than the agreed minimum targets mainly because of larger
consumers' contribution, lower fuel cost and decrease in working capital. The
financial projections for FY84-91 also show that NEB will be able to achieve
the agreed ratios in those years.
5.15      To assist NEB in complying with the covenanted minimum self-
financing ratios the Government has agreed to take the following measures:
(a)  The electricity tariffs will be normally reviewed with NEB and
revised annually at least three months before the end of its fiscal
year taking into account (i) the increases in operating costs
including increases in fuel prices in the previous 12 months which
are not reflected in its electricity tariffs; (ii) the best
estimates of such increases in the following 12 months; and (iii)
the need to generate revenues to meet the agreed self-financing
percentages;



- 23 -
(b) Should the actual increases in fuel prices during any year be
substantially greater than the best estimates assumed in (ii) of (a)
above for that year, the Government will take appropriate interim
measures as are necessary; and
(c) If NEB's financial results for a year indicate that it will not
achieve the agreed self-financing percentages in that year (Year A),
then the tariffs for the immediately succeeding year (Year B) will
be set at a level which will permit NEB to recover in Year B the
shortfall in the agreed self-financing percentages for Year A.
5.16      Following the recommendation by the management consultants, NEB has
established a senior management tariff committee with working groups coordin-
ated under the responsibility of the commercial manager to review NEB's tariff
periodically as required.
5.17      NEB's operating results are sensitive to changes in the oil prices;
this is because fuel costs continue to be NEB's largest operating expense and
these costs are largely beyond NEB's own control. While the Bank has
recommended that the Government and NEB consider the possibility and the
timing to reinstitute the FCVC at its future tariff reviews, the agreed
measures (para. 5.15) are adequate to ensure NEB's financial viability based
on an effective mechanism for tariff review and revision, taking into account
any significant changes in fuel prices. The self-financing ratios agreed
under the previous loan (i.e. 20% in FY84, 25% in FY85 and 86 and 30% there-
after) will be continued under the proposed loan.
Other Financial Covenants
5.18      Under previous Bank loans to NEB, the following agreements were
reached with respect to NEB's financial performance: (a) a current ratio
covenant of 1.1 times; (b) a debt limitation covenant based on a debt/equity
ratio of 60/40; and (c) an investment limitation covenant of a maximum of 1%
of NEB's revalued gross fixed assets in other industrial activities. NEB has
complied with these covenants. The financial forecasts indicate that NEB will
continue to meet these requirements (Table 5.4). All three covenants will be
repeated under the proposed loan.
6. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The transmission and distribution proposals included in the project
are a part of NEB's expansion program (paras. 3.05 to 3.10). The program is
designed to satisfy the projected demands and is fully justified. The
internal economic rate of return for the investment program for the period
1983-91 is 25% at the prevailing tariff, indicating that the cost of supply in
real terms would decline in the coming years; mainly due to the substitution
of oil for power generation by hydro, coal and gas (para. 1.09).
6.02      The transmission line between Malacca - Yong Peng - Scudai is
justified by technical studies of the system transmission requirements. The



- 24 -
justification rests on (a) anticipated power flows, (b) system stability
requirements, and (c) merit order generation scheduling between power plants
on the West Coast and South. The proposed alternative is the least-cost way
of achieving these objectives, compared to other alternatives of 132 kV lines
or shifting to a higher voltage of 400 or 500 kV.
6.03      The 132 kV lines and substations included in the project are neces-
sary for extending the grid supply to areas with existing and potential
demand. Each proposal has been studied in comparison with two other alter-
natives, viz. (a) establishing or augmenting diesel generating stations to
meet the demand and (b) carrying out the extension by 33 kV or 11 kV lines.
In all cases the proposed alternative has been demonstrated to be the least
cost solution.
6.04      The distribution proposals have been formulated to meet the
anticipated demand of electricity outside the urban areas. In all cases, the
extension of supply will be carried out after ascertaining the need and the
financial viability of the proposed extension (para 4.06). Basically,
therefore, the distribution expansion proposals form a part of NEB's normal
program of the extension of supply dictated by the demand.
Economic Rate of Return
6.05      For the distribution component of the project, rate of return has
been worked out by using the revenue at the prevailing tariff, as benefit, as
detailed in Annex-18. On this basis, the IERR works out to 17%. It would
reduce to 15% if the costs increase by 10% or if the sales reduce by 10%. The
IERR does not fully reflect the economic benefits of the project since the
consumer surplus is ignored.
Risks
6.06      The risk in the implementation of transmission lines is primarily
one of delay that can be caused in the acquisition of land for the substations
and right of way for the line construction. Land for four out of seven
substations is already available and existing wayleave will be used for a part
of the 275 kV line. For the balance, NEB has established a satisfactory
action plan to complete the acquisition to suit the project implementation
schedule. The only risk in the implementation of the distribution program is
that if demand does not materialize, the program proposed for the three years
period may extend over a longer period.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached
7.01      During the negotiations, the following agreements have been reached
with NEB and the Government:



- 25 -
(a)  With NEB
(i)  NEB will appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank by
December 31, 1984 for improving corporate planning capabilities
(para. 2.05) and for the feasibility study for hydro (para.
4.14) under terms of reference agreed with the Bank;
(ii) NEB will employ auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit NEB's
accounts and to send unaudited financial statements to the Bank
within six months and audited financial statements with audi-
tor's reports within nine months of the end of NEB's fiscal
year (para. 2.15);
(iii) NEB will appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank by
December 31, 1984, to carry out a detailed tariff study under
terms of reference agreed with the Bank (para. 5.07);
(iv) NEB will achieve the following minimum self-financing ratios:
20% in FY84, 25% in FY85 and FY86, and 30% thereafter
(para. 5.17);
(v)  NEB will maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.1
(para. 5.18);
(vi) NEB will consult the Bank for incurring debt if its long-term
debt exceeds 60% of the sum of its equity and debt
(para. 5.18); and
(vii)  NEB will limit its industrial investment (para. 5.18).
(b)  With Government
(i)  Government will provide or arrange for adequate funds to
finance NEB's development program, if necessary (para. 5.12).
(c)  With NEB and Government
(i)  NEB and Government will review the electricity tariff at least
once every year and adjust it to enable NEB to achieve self-
financing ratios agreed with the Bank (para. 5.15).
Recommendations
7.02      With the above agreements, the Project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$70.0 million (including the capitalized front end fee)
to NEB for a period of 15 years including a grace period of three years, at
the standard variable interest rates, with the guarantee of Malaysia.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
Price Contingencies
1.        The following escalation rates are used:  for foreign costs - FY84:
7.5%; FY85: 7.0%; FY86 and thereafter: 6.0%; for local costs - FY84: 10.0%;
FY85: 9.0%; FY86: 8.0%; FY87 and thereafter: 6.0%.
Revenues
2.        The sales forecast has been arrived at by discussions with NEB
(Annex 6).
3.        The last tariff increase in December 1980 set the average rate at
Mr22.0/kWh (US99.5), higher than the long-run average incremental cost of su-
pply estimated at about Mr19.0 for 1981. Since this tariff level is adequate,
it is considered that additional adjustments are not necessary except in cases
of future large increases in fuel cost. Accordingly, it is assumed that dur-
ing the forecast period (FY83-91), no tariff increase is projected until FY87
when NEB's tariff would be adjusted only to absorb the impact of inflation in
order to maintain reasonable rates of return, at satisfactory SFR levels.
Fuel Cost
4.        It is assumed that the oil prices are going to approach from the
spot market price (about US$26.0 per barrel) to the OPEC price of about
US$29.5 per barrel by FY85 and remain at the OPEC level thereafter. Addition-
ally changes in fuel mix were assumed as Bersia, Kenering, Kenyir hydroelec-
tric projects and gas turbines at Connaught Bridge Power Station and Paka Com-
bined Cycle stations in Trengganu are commissioned. The following fuel costs
are assumed; diesel: 130% of oil price; gas: M$6/MBtu for east coast and M$8
for west coast; coal: M$150/tons. Fuel costs are escalated at the following
rates:  FY84/85 = 5.6% p.a.; FY86-90 = 9.1% p.a.; and FY91 = 8.2% p.a., which
reflects an increase in real terms of about 3.0% p.a. in the period 1986-90.
Capital Expenditure
5.        Investment figures include IDC and are based on NEB's latest devel-
opment program, April 1984, which included investment for major power
stations, 1992-1994. Escalation is based on the indices given in para. 1.



ANNEX 17
54 -                         Page 2
Equity
6.        It is assumed that after FY83, the Government will not make any
equity contribution. But the Government will continue to provide construction
grants for the reimbursement of a part of capital expenditure for rural elec-
trification projects until FY87.
Taxes and Dividends
7.        NEB declared dividends in FY83.  In the financial projections, an
annual dividend of M$28.4 is assumed. No tax payment is assumed pending the
Government's review of NEB's taxation status in 1985 (paras. 2.17 and 2.18).
Borrowings
8.        Given NEB's previous experience and current opportunities, the rela-
tive participation of different sources in future borrowing is assumed to be
distributed as follows: bilateral and export credits 38%; multilateral 29%;
commercial banks (foreign and domestic) 21% and suppliers' credits 12%. In
the past NEB has received bilateral and export credits on very soft terms
(3-1/2 to 4-1/2% p.a.); it is assumed that these credits will be contracted at
5% p.a. in the future. NEB's average borrowing cost is about 8%. To be on
the conservative side, it is assumed that annual interest rates would be 10%.
9.        By FY83, NEB has borrowed about M$200 million under the blanket
guarantee limit of M$2.5 million by the Government. NEB can request for the
extension of this facility if necessary.
Notes on Financial Ratios
10.       Self-financing ratio, which measures NEB's contribution from inter-
nally generated funds to its capital investment, is calculated on a 3-year
average investment which includes the previous year, the test and the next
following year.
11.       For the computation of the rate of return on average net fixed
assets; fixed assets, accumulated depreciation and consumers' contribution are
revalued using the fixed capital formation deflator published by the Central
Bank of Malaysia. For the forecast period, the revaluation factors are based
on the weighted average of the escalation rates presented in para. I above.
12.       Bank overdrafts in the case of NEB are actually revolving loans con-
tracted at very favorable interest rates (8.5% to 9.25% p.a.). The customary
yearly repayment is not required and commercial banks advise NEB well in
advance whenever they are considering that the loan or part of it should be
repaid. Because of these special characteristics, these loans were not
included in the computation of net working capital and current ratio. Never-
theless, if in the future they become repayable within the following twelve
months, these loans, or part of them, should be treated as current liabili-
ties.
