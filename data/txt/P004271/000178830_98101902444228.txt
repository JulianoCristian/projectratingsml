ELEVENTH POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:        The National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB)
Guarantor:       Malaysia
Loan Amount:    US$70.0 million (including the capitalized front-end fee)
Terms:           15 years, including three years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project
Description:    The objective of the project is to support NEB's program to
extend electricity supply outside the urban areas, in the less
developed states of Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang, Johor
and Perak. The project includes the extension of distribution
facilities for supply to about 82,000 residential consumers,
and to commercial and industrial consumers. It also includes
construction of the 275 kV Malacca-Yong Peng-Scudai line and
the 132 kV Kluang-Mersing 'and Kota Tinggi-Tg. Ramunia lines.
The project aims to strengthen the institutional capability of
NEB by providing assistance for strengthening the corporate
planning function, improving the accounting system and augmen-
ting the training facilities. Consulting services to improve
the efficiency of the existing structure of NEB's tariffs and
to carry out feasibility studies for a hydro project are also
included.
Risks:           There is a risk of delay in the implementation of the project
due to delay that can be caused in the acquisition of land for
substations and wayleave for transmission lines. However,
land for four out of seven substations is already available
and existing wayleave will be used for a part of the 275 kV
line. For the balance, NEB has established a satisfactory
action plan to complete the acquisition to suit the project
implementation schedule.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MALAYSIA FOR AN ELEVENTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB), with the
guarantee of Malaysia for the equivalent of US$70.0 million, including the
capitalized front-end fee, to help finance the Eleventh Power Project. The
loan would have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate. Cofinancing by commercial banks is
expected.  Cofinancing requirements are estimated at about US$62.5 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report "Malaysia: Structural Change and
Stabilization" (No. 4829-MA) was issued on November 15th, 1983.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia's economic performance was
outstanding in the 1970s. The per capita income of US$1,840 in 1982 is among
the highest in Southeast Asia. In the last decade, per capita GDP growth has
averaged about 5.5% p.a., somewhat higher than the 4% p.a. per capita growth
achieved in the 1960s. This sustained good performance was a reflection of
several factors including the country's wealth in natural resources, especi-
ally ample reserves of cultivable land; an outward-oriented growth strategy;
good economic and financial management; and, not least, stable social and
political institutions. Three specific elements have been important: first,
substantial attention and priority has been given to agriculture resulting in
high productivity gains in the sector, which have cushioned against occasional
steep price declines; second, manufacturing growth has been rapid, at about
12% p.a. in the last two decades, following first an import substituting
pattern, but later increasingly oriented towards exports; third, in a very
open economy with exports and imports recently averaging more than 50% of GDP,
exports have diversified from an initial large dependence on rubber and tin to
include palm oil, petroleum and manufactured goods.
4.        Malaysia is a multiracial society with approximately 55% of the
population indigenous Malays, 35% Chinese and the remainder largely Indian.
The country has inherited deep divisions in the distribution of income between
ethnic communities and has also been struggling with a serious poverty prob-
t        lem.  This poverty has been concentrated among agricultural families, which
are predominantly Malay. In 1971, the Government declared a New Economic
Policy (NEP) and accorded the highest priority to eradicating poverty and
reducing the racial imbalances in income, employment and ownership of
assets. Specific quantitative targets, to be achieved by 1990, were estab-
lished for these objectives. In the mid-term of this program, substantial
progress has been made. By 1980, the incidence of poverty had declined to



-2-
about 29% of all households, the Bumiputera-  share of corporate assets had
increased substantially and there have been significant clhanges in the ethnic
distribution of employment.
5.        The Malaysian economy has been undergoing some important structural
changes.  Industry has replaced agriculture as the major contributor to GDP
and exporting manufactured goods has replaced import substitution as the
cutting edge of industrial growth. In particular, there has been a remarkable
and dominating increase in exports of electronic goods over the last fifteen
years. Export diversification has proved important as some of Malaysia's
traditional major foreign exchange earners show signs of flagging vitality.
Tin production has steadily declined in the face of weak prices, the
exhaustion of many mines and increasing costs of extraction. Although timber
production has recently been buoyant, exploitation of the resource has led to
detrimental environmental consequences and the Government has plans for
restricting logging in the future. Finally, rubber production has been
fluctuating across a declining trend for several years. Whilst factors
specific to the cultivation of rubber have been at work, an important reason
has been the migration of the young and educated from the farms to the
towns. This has fostered a major structural change in the Mlalaysian economy,
as it appears that the agricultural labor force may now be peaking in absolute
numbers. In turn this suggests rather different strategies to be followed in
the agricultural sector in years to come, both to maintain agricultural
prduction as well as to tackle the large extant problem of rural poverty. In
recognition of this, the Government has recently published a policy document
to guide future agricultural development which takes into account the emerging
trends in the sector.
6.        While, in general, the economy has performed well in the last few
years, this progress has been punctuated by periods of occasional diffi-
culty. This has been particularly true in the most recent international
commodity price cycle. Between 1977 and 1980, prices for palm oil, rubber,
timber and petroleum increased rapidly and export receipts nearly doubled.
The terms of trade improved by about 25% in the same period and real national
income grew by more than 11% p.a.  In 1980, however, the prices of virtually
all of 21alaysia's export commodities began to fall and, over the next two
years, the terms of trade declined by more than 15%, representing a loss of
national income of about 8%. Anticipating, in 1980, a short international
recession, the Government introduced a countercyclical fiscal policy,
comprising large expenditure increases and tax cuts, in an attempt to maintain
domestic income levels. This combination of falling commodity prices and an
expansionary fiscal stance led in 1981 and 1982 to very large fiscal and
balance of payments deficits; thus in 1981-82, the current account deficit on
the balance of payments averaged 12% of GNP, while the overall public sector
deficit averaged 20% of GNP. Overall GDP growth averaged 6% p.a. and
inflation initially accelerated before falling to 6% in 1982.
1/   "Bumiputera" literally means "son of the soil".  The word is used to
refer to Malays and other indigenous groups.



-3-
7.        To finance these large deficits, the Government had to borrow
heavily, both domestically and abroad. Domestic borrowing was largely non-
inflationary, from the Employees Provident Fund, from the national oil company
and from the commercial banks. Even so the ratio of domestic debt to GNP grew
from about 37% to nearly 50% between 1980 and 1982. Increasing proportions of
the deficits had to be financed from abroad and the level of disbursed public
external debt doubled between 1980 and 1982 (from 16% to 31% of GNP); there
was, in addition, an important shift in the sources of borrowing, away from
project financing towards market borrowings. Because of the low levels of
external borrowing of the previous decade, this surge in the 1980-82 period
did not give rise to a high burden of debt service. As a proportion of
exports, debt service on public and publicly guaranteed debt was 5% in 1982
and 5.9% at the end of 1983.
8.        The unsustainability of deficits of the magnitude experienced in
1981 and 1982 has been clearly recognized by the Government and a policy of
expenditure restraint was implemented through 1983 and strongly affirmed in
the 1984 budget. In the course of 1983, public investment fell by nearly 11%
in real terms, and the overall public sector deficit was reduced by 4% of
GNP. GDP growth continued higher than the average of developing countries at
5.6% in 1983. The deflationary stance of the Government combined with a
recovery in commodity prices, the initiation of gas exports to Japan,
increased volumes of petroleum exports and continued reductions in import
prices, all acted to reduce the balance of payments deficit in 1983. For the
first time since 1980, the economy registered a small trade surplus. The
service deficit continued to mount in response to higher dividend and interest
payments. Even so, the current account deficit was reduced to less than 10% -
of GNP. The 1984 budget proposes further reductions in federal government
development expenditures (by 23%) in an attempt to reduce further the public
sector deficit to about 13% of GNP. (The Government recently abolished
kerosene and diesel subsidies - equivalent to about 1% of GNP.) Expected
improvements in commodity prices, combined with expected growth in export
volume, should in 1984 result in a lower balance of payments deficit.
9.        Assuming a sustained international economic recovery and continued
expenditure restraint by the Government, the fiscal and external deficits of
Malaysia should reach sustainable levels over the medium term. With the heavy
borrowing recently undertaken and with anticipation of future, albeit lower,
external deficits, the debt service ratio will increase later in the decade.
It is, however, expected to stabilize at acceptable levels (between 15-20% of
exports). At the same time, the present and ongoing expenditure retrenchment,
albeit starting from a high level, has placed the public investment budget
under strain and is likely to affect future growth prospects. In this regard
it is becoming increasingly important for the Government to ensure the effi-
ciency of the public sector investment program. Recognition has also been
given by the Government of the need to tackle some of the economy's structural
difficulties. As noted above, a National Agricultural Policy has been
announced. A comprehensive review of development strategy is expected to be
pul'Iished in the next few months; among the initiatives already announced is
proposed "privatization" of many public sector activities. Industrial studies
(on export and production incentives) are being undertaken, in conjunction
with the Bank, to ensure the continued contribution of this important sector



t;o the economy. A series of initiatives are thus underway to sustain
development, albeit in more difficult financial circumstances than were
foreseen before the onset of the recession.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
10.       The Bank has to date made 57 loans to Malaysia, totalling US$1,541.5
million for projects in agriculture, education, population, power, water
supply, sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads, and urban trans-
port. As of March 31, 1984, the effective loans to Malaysia held by the Bank
amounted to US$1,260.4 million, of which US$188.3 million were loans in the
power sector (comprising three projects). In addition, there are seven
projects in the power sector which have been fully disbursed. A total of
t:hirty-four loans to Malaysia have been fully disbursed. Annex II contains a
summary of Bank loans and IFC investments.
:11.      In recent years, the Bank's lending strategy towards Malaysia has
aimed at assisting the Government to alleviate poverty in the country. The
Government thrust in this area has been twofold: first, to maintain a high
overall rate of growth for the economy and thus facilitate and encourage a
labor shift from low to higher wage occupations; second, as most poverty is
concentrated in the rural areas, to raise the productivity and incomes of
farmers directly through a variety of agricultural projects and programs. The
Bank has been associated with both aspects of this strategy - by assisting the
Government to overcome impediments to growth (for example by lending for
vocational education and for power) and also by lending for a long sequence of
agricultural projects. These have indeed enjoyed major success in raising the
incomes of beneficiaries, substantially increasing the foreign exchange
earnings of the country, and contributing to a high economy-wide growth.
12.       Malaysia's commitment to assist its low-income groups has not
diminished in the wake of the recent economic difficulties. As noted, these
difficulties are in part structural, fostered by very rapid and successful
development, and in part financial, resulting from the recession and internal
colintercyclical policies. Tackling these problems, which entail tight fiscal
and foreign exchange constraints likely to persist for some time, has become
the dominant objective of economic management. The Government is presently
reviewing development programs with a view to both improving the allocation of
public investable resources, as well as raising the overall efficiency of the
investment program. The Bank is supporting this effort of redesigning the
public investment program, so as to meet the twin and related objectives of
raising overall growth, as well as alleviating poverty.
13.       In its lending strategy the Bank intends to continue lending to
agriculture and thus tackle poverty directly. At the same time, recognizing
the changed economic situation and prospects, and responding to a Government
request, a dialogue is being engaged with the Government as to increasing the
Bank's role in sectors where serious structural problems or institutional
deficiencies exist. Thus the Bank will continue to lend to education, trans-
port, and power, including the proposed Eleventh Power Project. A project is



also being prepared for small scale enterprises in order to enable the Govern-
ment to realize its employment and restructuring objectives; as manufacturing
growth remains vital to the country's medium and long term prospects, other
initiatives are being considered in this sector.
14.       Overall implementation of Bank-financed projects in Malaysia has
been satisfactory. Disbursement performance, measured in terms of the ratio
of actual disbursements to cumulative undisbursed amounts, was 0.14 in FY81,
0.18 in FY82 and 0.22 in FY83, displaying a pattern of continuous improvement
over the three-year period. Overall disbursements of US$136.6 million in FY83
represented a 23% improvement over the FY82 figure of US$110.9 million.
15.       Malaysia's disbursement rate for FY83 of 22%, was slightly lower
than the Bank-wide average of 23.4% and the Regional average of 23.2%. Dis-
bursement rates for two comparator countries, Brazil and Mexico, were 23.5%
and 21.4%, respectively. The major problems causing disbursement delays in
Malaysia are: delays in project start-up due to manpower shortages and time
consuming land acquisition procedures, and the limited capacity of the Public
Works Department and the local contracting industry. To improve the situa-
tion, the Bank carried out its first project implementation review in colla-
boration with the implementing agencies in November 1981. Further reviews are
being undertaken periodically with a view to improving the overall implemen-
tation of projects, which should have a positive impact on disbursements. It
is also proposed to reinforce the implementation reviews with occasional
seminars on disbursements and procurement (a disbursement seminar was arranged
in June 1982 and a procurement seminar was conducted in March 1983, both in
Kuala Lumpur) for the benefit of the implementing agencies.
16.       IFC has made four investments in Malaysia totalling US$8.7 million.
The total investments held by IFC, as of March 31, 1984, amounted to US$0.9
million (Annex II).
17.       As noted earlier, at end 1983, Malaysia's debt service ratio on
public and publicly guaranteed debt was 5.9%. In the same year, debt service
on IBRD obligations constituted about 6% of total debt service. With the
rapid increase in market borrowings in the last three years, the proportion of
IBRD disbursed debt in total disbursed debt has fallen from about 15% in 1979-
80 to less than 9% at end 1983. Various projections, on a variety of
assumptions, suggest that the IBRD share in debt service and total disbursed
*        debt of Malaysia is likely to remain below 10% through the rest of the decade.
PART III - ENERGY AND THE POWER SECTOR
Overview
18.       With a per capita income of about US$1,840 in 1982, Malaysia is one
of the most prosperous developing countries in Asia. The real GDP grew at a
compound growth rate of 7.8% p.a. during the period 1970-80; the total energy
consumption grew at 8.6% p.a. About 92% of the total energy consumption was
met by petroleum products, amounting to about 52.0 million barrels of oil



-6-
equivalent in 1980 (about 150,000 barrels per day). Of this, 43% was used for
the transport sector, 29% for electric power generation, 21% for industry and
7% for residential and commercial uses. However, Malaysia is a net exporter
of oil. Substantial reserves of natural gas have also been discovered.
Energy Resources
19.       Oil.  Oil production in Malaysia increased from about 100,000
barrels per day (bpd) in 1975 to about 400,000 bpd in 1983. Official
estimates of remaining recoverable reserves in January 1981 were 1.74 billion
barrels, which are considered conservative. Industry sources put ultimate
recoverable reserves at about 3-3.6 billion barrels. Notwithstanding the
higher reserves, with consumption growing at 8 to 9% p.a., the country could
be a net importer of oil in the next decade if no substitution takes place.
20.       Gas.  Recoverable reserves of non-associated gas have been estimated
at over 38 trillion standard cubic feet (scf), which is equivalent to about
6 billion barrels of oil. There are about twenty offshore gas fields, the
majority being near Trengganu. Two fields offshore in Sarawak are under
development by Slhell to supply gas to the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in
Bintulu, recently completed, which at peak production will yield 6 million
tons of LNG per year for export to Japan. Industrial developments including
ammonia/urea plants are also planned in the Bintulu area. A gas gathering
system and a pipeline under construction from gas fields offshore Trengganu to
transport the gas to a 900 MW combined cycle power generating plant at Paka
will be completed in the period 1984-86. A 50 MW gas-fired generating plant
is under construction at Labuan Island in Sabah.
21.       A study to evolve a master plan for the long-term development and
utilization of gas commissioned by the Petroleum Agency in Malaysia (PETRONAS),
has been completed. The long-term development strategy indicates a need for
gas pipeline extension from the East Coast to the more populous West Coast and
to Singapore, for use of gas as a fuel in power plants. Consultants are being
appointed for a detailed feasibility study of the gas pipelines. Use of gas
for development of various petrochemical industries is also proposed.
22.       Coal.  Malaysia does not have significant reserves of coal.
Estimates of recoverable coal resources, located primarily in Sarawak, are
400-500 million tons, which are mainly of lignite type with high moisture
content. Development activities in the domestic coal industry are at present
only at the preliminary exploration stage. However, imported coal is proposed
to be used for power generation.
23.       Hydropower.  Hydro potential in Malaysia is considerable, estimated
at 120,000 GWh per year (more than 10 times the total electricity production
in 1982). However, nearly 71% of it is located in Sarawak and 16% in Sabah
where demand is low. Present hydro capacity in Peninsular Malaysia of about
800 MW (2700 GWh) will reach 1,200 MW by 1986 with the addition of Kenyir, now
under construction. Projects totalling over 1,000 MW are under different
stages of study.



- 7 -
24.       In view of Peninsular Malaysia's limited hydro resources, studies
are being carried out for the exploitation of Sarawak's hydro potential for
possible transmission of bulk power to Peninsular Malaysia.
The Power Sector
25.       Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous Government
entities. The National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) serves
Peninsular Malaysia, while the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and Sarawak
Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) serve the two states on the Island of
Borneo.  Total capacity installed by these entities at end-FY83 was 2,892 MW,
of which the NEB accounted for 2,610 M4W.
26.       Nearly 75% of the NEB's generating capacity is oil based, which
produces about 86% of the total electrical energy. The composition of the
NEB's generating capacity based on oil would be reduced from 75% at present to
below 50% in the next five years due to the commissioning of hydro, gas and
coal-fired stations. If a gas pipeline to the West Coast materializes, most
of the oil-fired plants would also be converted to gas firing in the next
decade, reducing dependence on oil for power generation to only 10% of the
total.
Access to Electricity
27.       The population of Peninsular Malaysia in 1982 was estimated to be
11.7 million; the per capita electricity consumption was about 760 kWh and
production 855 kWh. About 62% of 2.4 million households in the Peninsula are
electrified. The total number of rural households in Malaysia in 1980 was
about 1.5 million. Progress in rural electrification has resulted in an
increase in rural households electrified by the NEB from 100,000 in 1970 to
about 450,000 in 1980. The degree of electrification in different states
varies from a high of about 92% to a low of about 45%. Pahang, Kedah,
Kelantan, Johor, Trengganu and Perak are the least electrified states, with
45% to 62% electrification, and would benefit from this project. The degree
of electrification in the rural areas of these states is considerably lower.
Sector Organization
28.       A cabinet committee on energy formed in 1980 is responsible for
evolving the energy policy. It consists of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime
S        Minister, and Ministers of Energy, Trade and Industry, and Science and Tech-
nology. This committee is supported by a "Committee of Officials", chaired by
the Chief Secretary to the Government and having representatives from
PETRONAS, the Treasury, the Ministries of Energy, Science and Technology,
Trade and Industry, NEB and the Economic Planning Unit (EPU).
29.       The Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts (ETP), created
in 1979, has the responsibility for coordinating the activities of diverse
government agencies dealing with energy. However, in practice, the Ministry's
responsibility for energy policy so far has been limited and consists
primarily of jurisdiction over NEB. In 1980, an Energy Unit was created in the
Ministry to act as a secretariat for the cabinet committee on energy. This
unit is expected to have a wider role in the energy sector in future.



- 8 -
30.       PETRONAS, established in 1974, as a Government corporation, has
operating responsibilities in the oil and gas sector. Malaysia's Petroleum
Development Act gives it exclusive rights over exploration and production of
petroleum. It supervises work programs for exploration and production of
contracting oil companies and has authority to negotiate future production
sharing agreements. PETRONAS' own exploration activities are undertaken
through a subsidiary company, Petronas Carigali Berhad, formed in 1978.
Sector Issues and Bank Role
31.       The principal task in the energy sector is to reduce the heavy
dependence on oil, thereby extending the life of oil reserves and protecting
foreign exchange earnings.  In the power sector, this objective is being
pursued by constructing all future generating capacity based on hydro, gas or
coal. During the appraisal of the tenth power project (Loan 2146-MA), it was
agreed to finance two studies to help NEB in future planning; one dealing with
the implications of using coal for power generation and another for long-range
planning of the power system. The coal utilization study, which is completed,
has identified suitable sites for coal-fired thermal generating plants and
arrangements for coal handling; terms of reference for the system planning
study have been finalized; NEB has strengthened its system planning group to
undertake the study with the help of expert assistance from outside.
32.       Rapid development of gas resources, with a clear understanding of
how best to use the gas, is an important task. A Gas Utilization Study has
been recently completed, in which the Bank assisted the Government (PETRONAS)
in drafting terms of reference and advising on consultants' contract. The
Bank is also financing an Energy Planning Study through the ninth power
project (Loan 1808-MA) which commenced in November 1983. The Study will
analyze available information on the supply side, prepare detailed demand
analysis, and help in long-term policy decisions in the energy sector.
33.       Efficient pricing of energy resources to promote rational use and
conservation is important. While the fuel oil for electricity generation was
charged at the international price, subsidies existed in the domestic price of
kerosene and diesel. The Government has recently eliminated these subsi-
dies. The project provides funds for a detailed study of electricity tariffs
(para. 61).
34.       The level of electrification in rural areas in Malaysia has been low
and the rural electrification program has been accelerated since 1976. A
detailed study of the rural electrification program financed by a Bank loan
(1178-MA) was completed in 1978.  In the tenth power loan (Loan 2146-MA),
agreements were reached and various measures for improving the efficiency of
the rural electrification program were initiated.
Experience with Past Loans
35.       The Bank has made ten loans to NEB, aggregating US$369.5 million.
The projects under the first eight loans have been completed and are operating
satisfactorily. Project performance audit reports (PPARs) were made for the
fifth and sixth loans in 1979 and 1981, respectively. The fifth power project



- 9 -
was completed about three months behind schedule with a cost overrun of 15%
whereas the sixtlh project was delayed by eleven months and the cost overrun
was 31%. Both these projects were executed as planned and achieved their
major objectives.  The PPAR for the sixth power project (Report No. 35(6 of
June 22, 1981) nozes that NEB is a well managed utility and has some effective
staff training programs. It concludes that, apart from the utility's
unsatisfactory financial performance (in 1980 and 1981) due to factors beyond
the control of its management, the project was a success. NEB's financial
position has since improved (para. 62).
36.       The seventh and eighth power projects have been completed satisfac-
torily. The implementation of the ninth power project is also on schedule.
All units at Bersia hydroelectric station were commissioned in 1983; the first
two units at Kenering were commissioned in 1983 and the third unit was commis-
sioned in March 1984. All these were in accordance with the SAR schedule.
Thie implementation of the tenth power project (Rural Electrification) has been
slowed down because of the Government's decision to reduce investments on the
rural electrification and minihydro program due to current constraints on its
domestic resources. Currently, discussions are in progress to define the
reduced scope of the project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.       The project supports a part of the development program formulated by
NEB for the augmentation of transmission and distribution facilities. The
feasibility studies for the transmission components were carried out by the
Planning Department of NEB. The distribution expansion proposals were formu-
lated by the Distribution Planning Department of NEB in collaboration with the
concerned District Managers who are primarily responsible for their implemen-
tation. A Bank mission appraised the project in June 1983, and a post
appraisal mission visited Malaysia in April 1984. Negotiations were held in
Washington, D.C. from May 1-3, 1984; the Malaysian delegation was led by
Mr. Yahya Yaacob, Deputy Secretary, Treasury. Supplementary data are in Annex
III. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 4700-MA) dated May 17, 1984 is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Objectives
*        38.       The proposed project supports NEB's program of strengthening the
transmission network and extension of the electricity supply outside the urban
areas in the less electrified states of Trengganu, Kelantan, Pahang, Kedah,
Johor and Perak, extending electricity supply to some 82,000 houselholds, in
addition to commercial and industrial consumers. Bank involvement in this
project will ensure that this necessary expansion program is not jeopardized
due to the resource constraints faced by Malaysia at present and will also
strengthen NEB's capability to attract other sources of financing to meet its
large investment program.



- 10 -
39.       The project also addresses important aspects of the institutional
development of NEB by providing funds for improving its accounting system and
consulting services for the corporate planning function. Also, the proposed
tariff study would help in ensuring that the electricity pricing structure is
economically efficient.
Project Description
40.       The project comprises the following:
(a)  275 kV transmission line from Malacca to Yong Peng and an extension
up to Scudai, along with associated substation equipment at Malacca
and new substations at Yong Peng and Scudai;
(b)  132 kV transmission lines and substations as follows:
(i) Kluang-Mersing with a new substation at Mersing;
(ii) Kota Tinggi-Tg. Ramunia with a new substation at Tg. Ramunia;
(c)  expansion of the distribution network in the States of Johor, Perak,
Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Pahang;
(d)  a simulator for the training of the operating staff;
(e)  computer equipment and software at various districts of the NEB for
improving the speed and efficacy of the compilation of accounts; and
(f)  consulting services for strengthening corporate planning, for the
study of the tariff structure and for feasibility studies of the
Pergau hydro project.
41.       The 275 kV transmission line from Malacca to Scudai via Yong Peng
(route length 233 km) will be a double circuit line with twin ACSR conduc-
tors. Both the 132 kV lines are radial lines needed to extend the grid supply
to new areas in eastern Johor. They will be double circuit lines. The
extension of the distribution network outside the urban areas will involve
construction of 200 km of 33 kV lines, 770 km of 11 kV lines, 1,330 km of
400 kV lines and over 600 substations.
42.       The proposed training simulator will be installed at NEB's training
school at Kajang to provide specialized training for the operation of the
multifuel fired (coal/oil/gas) power plant at Port Kelang, currently under
implementation.  Also the project includes computer equipment and software for
various district offices and stations of NEB to improve and expedite the
preparation and submission of accounts (para. 58).
Engineering and Construction
43.       NEB's transmission department will carry out the design, procurement
and construction management of the transmission lines and substations. They
are experienced in carrying out such work and are adequately staffed. The



- 11 -
distribution expansion program of NEB will be implemented by the Distribution
Department of NEB througlh District Managers. These departments are competent
and adequately staffed for the implementation of this project.
44.       The feasibility studies for Pergau hydroelectric project are
estimated to be US$1.8 million with foreign cost of US$0.9 million. NEB has
prepared terms of reference satisfactory to thie Bank and agreed to appoint
consultants satisfactory to the Bank by December 31, 1984 (Section 3.02 of the
draft Loan Agreement). The local costs include subsurface exploration and
topological surveys. A provision for 10 man-months of expert assistance for
the tariff study and 25 man-months for the corporate planning study is also
made.
Project Cost and Financing
45.       The total project cost is estimated to be US$192.9 million with
foreign cost of US$105.2 million (55.8%) and local cost of US$87.7 million
(44.2%). Base costs are as of the end of 1983; physical contingencies are at
10%. The price contingencies amount to about 24% of the base cost plus
physical contingencies and are calculated with local inflation rate of 10% in
1984, 9% in 1985, 8% in 1986 and 6% thereafter; and with foreign inflation
rate of 7.5% in 1984, 7.0% in 1985 and 6% thereafter.
46.       The proposed loan of US$70.0 million would cover 36% of the project
cost and 32% of the total financing required. The loan would be made to NEB
with the guarantee of Malaysia. The remainder of the financing required
(US$149.2 million) is expected to be met by (a) US$62.5 million cofinancing
with the possibility of a B loan, (b) US$30.0 million from local commercial
banks, and (c) US$56.7 million from NEB's resources. In the event a B loan
does not materialize, NEB will borrow from commercial banks with the guarantee
of the Government.
Procurement
47.       Equipment and services financed under the Bank loan shall be
procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Under ICB, local manufacturers will be
permitted to participate and will be eligible for a preference of 15% of the
c.i.f. costs of imported goods or the prevailing custom duties and other
r         import taxes, whichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids.  The Bank
financed items will include 275 kV and 132 kV lines and substations, some
distribution materials, computer system for accounts and training simulator.
Consulting services financed under the Bank loan shall be engaged in
accordance with Bank guidelines.
48.       All bidding packages for goods financed by the Bank and estimated to
cost over $500,000 equivalent will be subject to the Bank's prior review of
the procurement documents, which cover all the foreign contracts.

Disbursement
50.        The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100% of the foreign
expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials; (b) 100% of ex-
factory costs of locally manufactured items; (c) 70% of the cost of items
procured locally; and (d) 100% of expenditures for consulting services.
51.        The disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is close to the
Bank-wide profile of disbursements for distribution and transmission projects
for the first two years. The disbursement in the third and fourth year is
estimated to be more rapid due to the nature of the distribution project for
which all procurement financed by the Bank loan will be completed by the end
of 1986.
Implementation Schedule
52.        The 132 kV lines and substations are expected to be completed by
June 1987, and the 275 kV lines are expected to be completed by January
1988.  The distribution program is expected to extend up to mid-1988.

Monitoring and Reporting
53.       Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project
in terms of physical execution and consumer connections have been agreed with
NEB which will furnish quarterly progress reports.
Executing Agency
54.       NEB, the borrower of the proposed loan, is an autonomous government-
owned corporation, established under the Electricity Act of 1949 and
responsible to ETP. NEB is a financially sound, well organized and well
operated utility; it is both a regulatory and an operating agency responsible
for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Peninsular
Malaysia.
55.       NEB's operational and policy decisions are made by a Board of
Directors. All members of the Board are appointed by the Minister of ETP.
The Chairman of the Board is the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet and the Deputy
Chairman is the General Manager of NEB.
56.       NEB's organization has been evolving to cope with the increase in
workload and responsibilities. The Development Planning Department, which
combines the functions of technical and financial planning, acts as a catalyst
to improve coordination between various departments. There is a need to
strengthen NEB's integrated corporate planning capabilities, particularly in
the areas of financial planning. Consulting services are envisaged to assist
in this task and other related areas; funds have been provided under the
proposed loan. Terms of reference for the work have been agreed and NEB has
agreed to appoint consultants satisfactory to the Baiik for this assignment by
December 31, 1984 (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
57.       NEB's billing and collection systems are efficient.  The corporation
has been exempted since January 1980 from payment of corporate taxes and
custom duties; this will be reviewed by the Government in 1985. With the
improved financial position, NEB declared dividends in FY83.
58.       NEB's accounting systems are satisfactory and conform to modern
power utility practices. Its internal audit and controls are adequate. The
audits by independent external auditors are also satisfactory and have been
accepted by the Bank in the previous loans.  As required under Loan 1808-MA,
NEB established a Corporate Audit Department in October 1982, which is
directly responsible to the General Manager. In the past, NEB has been unable
to submit its annual audited financial statements to the Bank within six
months of the close of NEB's fiscal year. The delay is mainly due to delays
in closing and auditing the accounts and their approval by the Auditor
General's Office. However, NEB has been able to provide the Bank with
unaudited accounts within the stipulated time for review, followed by audited
accounts thereafter. It is agreed that NEB will submit unaudited financial
statements to the Bank within six months after the end of NEB's fiscal year
and submit audited financial statements together with the Auditor's long-form
reports within nine months after the end of the fiscal year (Section 5.02 of
the draft Loan Agreement). To expedite the processing of accounts, NEB plans



- 14 -
to computerize the manual processing at the districts; funds have been
provided for this purpose under the proposed loan (para. 42).
NEB's Financial Position
59.       NEB's past operating results have generally been satisfactory.  It
generated profits in each year except in FY80 when following sharp increases
in fuel prices, NEB incurred a net loss of about M$82 million for the first
time in its history. This was a consequence of the withdrawal of the Fuel
Cost Variation Charge (FCVC) from the NEB's tariff under the instruction of
the Government. To correct NEB's deteriorating financial position, the
Government approved two tariff increases: 13% in FY80 and 52% in FY81, and
provided NEB with equity injections amounting to about M$531 million during
FY80 and FY81. As a result of these measures and the subsequent decline in
world oil prices, NEB's finances have improved significantly since FY81. As
of the end of FY83, NEB has a sound capital structure and satisfactory
liquidity position; its debt/equity ratio is estimated at 39/61, current ratio
at 1.1 and the rate of return on revalued net fixed assets at about 12%. For
FY83, NEB's self-financing ratio (SFR) including consumers' contribution is
estimated over 50%.
60.       Although NEB has embarked on a fuel diversification program, fuel
costs will continue to be its largest single operating expense. To enable NEB
to achieve the self-financing ratios as agreed with the Bank (para. 62), NEB
and the Government are required under Loan 2146-MA (October 1982) to carry out
a yearly review and revision of NEB's tariffs as necessary to take into
account the impact of future increases in fuel costs and other operating
expenses. Any proposed future changes in NEB's tariff structure would also be
made in consultation with the Bank. These agreements will be continued in the
proposed loan (Section 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement and Section 3.02 of
the draft Guarantee Agreement).
61.       Under the Electricity Act, NEB has the power to fix tariffs; how-
ever, in practice, tariff issues are reviewed and decided by the Government.
The latest tariff increase of about 52% implemented in December 1980 resulted
in NEB having tariffs higher than most of the neighboring countries. However,
no detailed tariff study has been done by NEB since 1975. It is, therefore,
agreed that NEB will appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank by December
31, 1984, to carry out a detailed study which will examine, inter alia, the
tariff structure on the basis of the cost of supplying electricity to various
customer groups and at different times of the day. The consultants will also
be required to train NEB's staff to enable them to carry out similar studies
in the future (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).  Terms of reference
for the study have been finalized and agreed with the Bank.
62.       NEB's forecast future financial performance is satisfactory at the
projected tariff levels; the assumptions used for fuel costs and other
operating expenses are considered reasonable. The current ratio and the
debt/equity ratio are projected to be within the minimum covenanted level.
The SFR is projected to also remain above the covenanted levels (20% for FY84,
25% for FY85 and FY86, and 30% for FY87 onwards); these SFR levels will be
continued under the proposed loan (Section 5.05 of the Draft Loan



- 15 -
Agreement). The rates of return on revalued net fixed assets are projected to
remain in excess of 8% each year during the forecast period (FY84-FY91).
63.       Under previous loan agreements, NEB is required to maintain a cur-
rent ratio of not less than 1.1 at any given time. NEB is also required to
consult the Bank for incurring debt if its long-term debt exceeds 60% of the
sum of debt and equity, excluding surplus from asset revaluation. To avoid
over-stretching of NEB's cash resources, previous loans to NEB also include a
covenant that limits NEB's investment in industrial activities, other than for
the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, to a maxi-
mum of 1% of its gross fixed assets as revalued each year. These covenants
will be repeated in the proposed loan (Sections 5.06, 5.07 and 5.08 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
Benefits and Risk
64.       The transmission and distribution proposals included in the project
are a part of NEB's expansion program which is designed to satisfy the
projected demand and is fully justified. The internal economic rate of return
for the investment program for the period 1983-91 is 25% at the prevailing
tariff, indicating that the cost of supply in real terms would decline in the
coming years, due to substitution of oil for power generation by hydro, coal
and gas (para. 26).
65.       The project will provide access to electricity to some 82,000
residential consumers in addition to commercial and industrial consumers
outside the urban areas in the states of Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Johor,
Trengganu and Perak which are the least electrified states in Peninsular
Malaysia. The transmission lines are justified as least cost alternatives for
meeting the demand.
66.       The economic rate of return on the distribution component of the
project, ignoring all surplus benefits but taking only the revenue to NEB,
would be 17% which indicates that the present tariff is adequate to recover
the cost of supply from the consumers. The rate of return will drop to 15% if
the project cost goes up by 10% or if the sales are reduced by 10%.
67.       The risk in the implementation of the transmission lines is
primarily that of delay that can be caused in the acquisition of land for the
substations and right-of-way for the line construction. Land for four out of
seven substations is already available and existing wayleave will be used for
part of the 275 kV line. For the balance, NEB has established a satisfactory
action plan to complete the acquisition to suit the project implementation
schedule. The risk in the implementation of the distribution program is that
if demand does not materialize, the program proposed for the three year period
may extend over a longer period.
Ecology
68.       Transmission and distribution projects will be designed and carried
out in accordance with the current technological practices and will cause
minimum disturbance to the environment. No safety hazards are foreseen.
