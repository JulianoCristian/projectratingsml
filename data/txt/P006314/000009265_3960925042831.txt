ELETROSUL SECOND TRANSMISSION PROJECT 1L. -N 1895-BR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MBACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the ELEITROSUL Second Power
Transmission Project, for which Loan 1895-BR (US$125 million) was approved oan
July 22, 1980.   The Borrower Was Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil, SA
(ELETROS'UL), a Government-owned generation and transmission electric utility
serving the Southern region of Brazil.   With its objectives substantially
achieved, the Project, albeit somewhat reduced in size, Was completed in 1987,
about three years late. Some works were not energized until early 1988. There
were substantial savings on the cost of the Project with the result that the Bank
agreed to reduce the Loan amount by about US$39.55 million to US$85.45 million.
The last disbursement was on July 27, 1987.
The ZEnegy and IAdustry Division, Country Department I (Brazil), Latin
America and the Caribbean Region prepared the PCR, which includes the comments
of the Borrower oan an earlier draft (Parts I and III). These coments pertain
to the performance of the Bank and factual matters (such as construction periods,
completion dates, and changes to the Project). Coments with respect to fact
have been Incorporated into Parts I and SII. Comments with respect to the per-
formanc, of the Bank constitute Part IS of the PCR.
Preparation of the PCI was started in February 1990 It is based on, Lute
alia, the final project report prepared by ELETROSUL, the Staff Appraisal and
President's Reports, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memorada.

ELETROSUL SECOND TRANSMISSION PROJECT (LOAN 1895-BR1
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
The Project, in furtherance of the Government's sector objectives of
maximizing the utilization of domestic energy, alaed at providing required
service by reinforcing the reliability and flexibility of the interconnected
systems of the Southern and Southeastern regions throagh the construction,
expansion, and energization of various transmission works (lines and sub-
stations). After a delay of about three years, the completion and energization
of these works in 1987-88 marked the achievement of the objective of the Project.
During the course of implementation (1980-1987), to take account of lower-
than-expected regional load growth and a new generation expansion scheme mandated
by the Goverment, the Bank and ELETROSUL agreed ons (i) reroutings, relocations,
andlor cancellations of certain works (mostly substations) which reduced the
size of the Project; and (ii) a rescheduling of works which led to a completion
delay of three years. Also contributing to the completion delay were financial
and investment constraints which had their origin in sector-wide actions taken
by the Government. The reduction in the size of the Project led, together with
lower-than-expected equipment costs and favorable rate-of-exchange developments,
to savings on. the cost of the Project and an agreed reduction (US$39.55 million)
of the loan amount. In the light of reduced market and other conditions, these
changes (works, timetable, and loan size) were reasonable.
Th  implementation of the Project occurred within tk   4der context of
the Bank-Brazilian dialogue on the finances of the electric pn ar sector. After
1978, the Government allowed tariff levels to decline ivL real terms. This led
to a corresponding deterioration in the finances of the sector. TI 1981, 1983,
and 1986, the Bank and the Government agreed on plans for the financial
rehabilitation of the power sector through tariff increases and other measures.
Due to political considerations, plus defects inherent to the plans, delays in
their implementation, bigh levels of inflation, and the preference on the part
of the Government for other strategic objectives, the plans did not lead to the
financial rehabilitaion of the sector. Through 1968, the Bank conzinued to
support the sector with investment loans and. one sector adjustment loan; but
during the following three years, despite strenuous efforts, the Bank and the
Government. were- unable to negotiate as additional sector adjustment loan.
Nevertheless, the plans and subsequent negotiation. efforts were useful. vehicles
for continuing the dialogue with the Government. Without such dialogue, the
financial performnce of the sector would probably haveL been worse (although
there is no way to. demonstrate this assertion). In 1990, after the Government
implemented substantial tariff increases, the Executive Directors of the Bank
approved a new investment loan, to support a transmission and conservation
project.
It seems clear that. lending in. circumstances of continuing financial
deterioration sends the borrower the wrong message. and leads to a significant



U'1
risk that agreements for financial rehabilitation will not be observed. It also
.fpears that the right way to lead is to conditLon Board presentation,
effectiveness, etc., to the implementation and maintenance of major tariff
increases and of other measures required for financial rehabilitation and to
defer lending when those conditions are not met.

2. Backaround
(a) Bank Lendina to the Sector and ELETROSUL:
2.01 Since 1949, the Bank has made 41 loans totalling about US$3.6 billion to
benefit the electric power sector, including three loans to ELETROSUL (Part III,
Schedule 1). Through the mid 1970s, the bulk of Bank lending helped to finance
'hydroelectric stations and transmission works constructed in the Southern and
Southeaster  regions.  From the mid 1970. to 1985, the emphasis shifted to
financing the expansion of transmlssion and distribution systems nationwide.
T-. 1986, a sector adjustment loan aimed at encouraging financial rehabilitation,
conservation. and. eavironmental/social. safeguards. During the next three years
(1987-9), the Bank and the Government, due to macroeconomic, tariff, and other
factors, failed to agree on the terms of a second sector adjectment loan. In
June 1990, after- the Government implemented major tariff increases, the Board
of Executive Directors of the Bank approved a new loan to the power sector in
c onnection with a transmission and conservation project.
(b) Sector Organization:
2.02 The sector consists primarily of a relatively compact group of state- and
federally-owned utilities with primary responsonsibilies for, respectively,
distribution  and generation/transmission.    The  authority  of the  Federal
Government to supervise sector decision-making,. especially with respect to levels
for tariffs, borrowing, and investment expenditure, is paramount.
2.,03 In 1979, when the Project was appraised, the Government supervised the
sector through two agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and
Energys Departamento Nacional de- Aquas e Energia Eletrica. (DNAEZ), a regulatory
body which approved, inter alia, tariff levels and expansion plans; and Centrais
Eletricas Brasilerias, SA (ELETROBRAS), a holding company for federally-owned
power companies with sector-wide planning and financial functions. In 1981, in
connection with its larger macro-economic strategy, the. Government required the
finaL approvaL of the planning agency, the Secretaria de Controle de Empresas
Estatais/Secretaria de Planejamento (SEST/SEPLAN) for tariff increases and. levels



2
of investment expenditures by state and Government-owned enterprises, including
power utilties. These three agencies -- DNAEE, ELET.OBRAS, and SESTISEPLAN --
established the regulatory environment In which the project was carried out
during the years 1980-1987.
(c) Sector Development Obiectivess
2.04 In order to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and to improve the
national balance-of-payments situation, the Government, following the oil crisis
(1974), adopted a national energy policy which emphasized maximum exploitation
of local primary energy sources, especially hydro. As some 92,000 MW of hydro-
pc'vr potential had been identified, this policy accorded well with the resources
c' the country; but as the implementation of this policy required the raising
of massive amounts of capital -- an increasingly difficult task -- it became even
more important to maximize the efficiency of power use by interconnecting and
coordinating the operation of generation and transmission facilties in the
Southern and Southeastern regions. On a practical basis, this step involved:
(i) constructi g and reinforcing interregional transmission links; and (ii) co-
ordinating the interregional operation and use of generation plants and
transmission facilities.
2.05 Therefore, Bank lending, beginning in the mid '70s, began to emphasize the
financing of transmission and distribution works. Through Loan 1343-BR (1977;
US$82 million), the Bank helped ELETROSUL to finance the first-stage expansion
of its high-voltage (RV) transmission system which provided a reliable inter-
connection of the Southeastern and Southern systems.   In 1978, the Inter-
American Development Bank provided financing for the second-stage- expansion; and
in 1980, through Loan 1895-BR (US$125.0 million), the Bank provided financial
support for the third-stage expansion.
3. Project Obectives:
3.01    The Project, which was to be carried out in 1980-84, consisted of
transmission works to expand ELETROSUL's 500 kV transmission system which would
provide required and reliable electricity services for the Southern and
Southeastern regions.
4. DesiaM and Descriution:
4.01 The cent:al concept of the Project was to reinforce the reliability of
the interregional transmission network by providing flexibility in the transfer
of electric energy with expanded. transmission and substation capacity. The
Project was part of. the least-cost expansion program of both ELETROSUL and the
secto-, based on expected load growth; and relied on traditional design criteria.
The Project coacept was sound. Besides transmission lines (TLs) and substations
(SSs). the Project also included training for ELETROSUL staff. in HV transmission
system planning- and operation. It was expected that Bank participation would
also facilitate foreign comercial financing through co-financing arrangements.
5. Preparation and ImRlementation: Changes. Timing. and Cost
5.01 Project preparation was executed efficiently; but thereafter- implemen-



3
tation lagged. As compared to what was expected at appraisal, the Project
ex?erienced changes (reductions) in its size due to market developments and other
causes, delays, and lower cost. These findings are based on Part II1, Schedules
2, 3, 4, and 5, which compare, respectively, actual and forecasts (i) time-
tables of Project preparation and implementation; (ii) completed works and sub-
project construction periods and energization dates; (iii) energy consumption
in the Southern and Sourtheastern regions; and (iv) costs of the Project and
sources of financing.
5.02 Preparation, Loan Effectiveness and Start-ups After missions of identi-
fication (November 1978), preparation (July 1979), and appraisal (December 1979),
Bank and Brazilian authorities successfully negotiated (April-May 1980) a draft
loan agreement, which the the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank approved
on July 22, 1980. Effectivenes of the Loan Agreement occurred on December 16,
1980, two months after loan signing (October 10, 1980) (Part III, Schedule 2).
5.03 Timing: Energization of the expanded SS8 at Curitiba, Areia, and Campos
Novos, plus the 500 kV Areia-Curitiba TXI, occurred in 1984, about as scheduled;
but most of the other SSs and TLs were not completed until 1987 as compared to
the appraisal forecast of 1983-84.  Some works were not energized until early
1988 (Part III, Schedule 3).
5.04 Changes: Ths and SSs. With respect to size, as a result of rerouting,
relocation and cancellations to which the Bank did not object, the TL component
was modestly increased in length while there was a significant reduction of SS
capacity (Part III, Schedule 3). The Bank did not agree to an ELETROSUL proposal
-to redefine tha Project to include. a proposed transmission system to Mato Grosso
do Sul, as such system was outside the scope of the Project.
5.05  A total of 903 km. of TI (at 500 kY) was constructed as eompared to the
appraisal forecast of 836 km.; and a total of 53 km. of T. (at 230 kV) was
constructed as compared with the appraisal forecast of 90 k1m. Only half of the
expected transformer capacity (1,600 MVA at 500/230 kV) was istalled -- that
is, 800 MVA (500/230 kv) of transformer capacity was installed at the new Lon-
drma SS, but due to cancellation, the transformer capacity (800 MVA at 500/230
kV) expected at the Venancino Aires SS was not installed. At she Canoinhas SS,
75 MVA (230/138 kV) of transformer capacitywas installed. This equipment, which
was not contemplated at appraisal, was not funded with the proceeds of Loan
1895-BR.  With respect to reactive capacity, only 650 MVAr (at 500 kY) in
reactors and other substation apparatus was installed at three SSs (Ita, 350
MVAr; Curitiba, 200 MVAr and Campos Novos, 100 MVAr) as compared with the
apprasial estimates of 1,000 NVAr (at 500 kV). Reactive capacity expected at
two SSs (Venacino Aires, 4x50 MVAr and Campo Largo, 7x50 MVAr) was cancelled or
postponed; capacity at Curitiba (4x50 MVAr) was added. The other parts of the
Project (telecommunication/data processing equipment, training, and consultant
services) reflected modest changes (Part III, Schedule 3).
5.06    Causes for Delay and Change. In the early stages of. implementation,
procurement moved at a slow pace; but beginning in about 1981, other factors
became more important as causes of delay -- namely, lower-than-expected load
growth in the Southern region and the construction of two coal-fired generation
plants mandated by the Government. These changes led to delays which were further



4
compounded by revenue and investment constraints imposed by the Government with
the result that the Project was completed in 1987, three years late.
5.07  With respect to load growth, the Southern region, like Brazil as a who'
experienced a recession in 1981; and the subsequent recovery was slow, reflectiub
the postpone'uent and cancellation of planned industrial projects. As a result
of these adverse ecoromic conditions, the actual annual rate of load growth for
.he Southern region for the decade of the '80s was about 7.3Z rather than 11.1Z,
as expected. (During the years 1974-1979, the annual regional growth rate was
about 15Z).   Based on estimated data for 1990,  the cumulative total of
electricity consumed in the Southern region for the period 1980-1990 was about
242 less than expected (Part I1!, Schedule 4). The geographical distribution
of growth also changed. For example, beususe PETROBRAS, the Government petrolesm
company, postponed &n industrial undertaking in the vicinity of Sao Mateo azd
because the state power company decided to build an SS in the area, ELETROSUL
cancelled the SS it had planned for Sao Mateus.
5.08 The shortfall in load growth was also accompanied by a major revision of
the generation investment program. In 1981, ELETROSUL informed the Bank that,
based on instructions from ELETROBRAS and the Governuent, it would begin to
construct coal-fired plants in 1983s Jorge Lacerda IV (350 M)f  in southeastern
Santa Catarina and Jacui (350 MW) in Rio Grande do Sul. In. due course, the Bank
received and accepted the economic justification for these plants.
5.09 Throughout the period of project implementation, sector-wide financial
constraints affected adversely the finmcial performance of ELETROSLL, thereby
also contributing to the completion delay. There were also investment
constraints. In 1981, SEST/SEPLAN, the Government planning agency, emerged as
the final arbiter of tariff increases and investment expenditure for the sector.
As part of a larger anti-inflationary strategy, it placed limits on the levels
of investment expenditure by the sector and approved tariff increases vhich
failed to keep pace with the rate of inflation.  The tariff policy of the
Government led to a confrontation with the Bank and the formulation.of the first
(September 1981) of a series of agreements with the Government to raise tariffs
and implement other measures to restore the financial condition of the sector
(see para. 7.03-7). These agreements failed to reach the objective of restoring
the financial condition of the sector.
5.10 The above factors -- market and Govermeat -- were the primary causes of
change; and led ELETROSUL's management to reconsider the design of its high-
voltage (RV) transmission expansion program and to reprogrsa its expansion
program, thereby delaying completion of the Project to 1987.  Financial and
investment constraints also contributed to delay.   Details on the factors
accounting for these changes and delays are set forth in Part IT, Schedule 3.
5.11 Cost: Stated in current prices, the actual total cost of the completed
Project was US$188.8 million (foreign cost: US$85.5 million) as compared with
the forecast cost of US$265.3 million (foreign cost: US$128.9 million), a
difference of - 28.8X (Part 1II, Schedule 5).  The cost of. US$188.8 million
includes expenditures (US$10.4 million) for equipment to expand the existing SS
at Gravatai and the future SS at Campo Largo.  These expenditures were not
anticipated at appraisal.



5
5.12 A more meaningful com'arison, given the cancellations of TLs and $Ss, is
that of the actual cost of comple.d works (including communications equipment,
consultant services, and training) with the forecast cost of the corresponding
works: US$178.4 million vs. US$215.3 million, a difference of -67.1 Z.  The
actual and forecast foreign and local costs were, respectivelys foreigns US$76.8
million vs. U8103.4 million; and locals US$101.6 million and US$111.9 million.
The difference between actual and forecast foreign costs was primarily due to
lower-than-expected equipment prices compouuded by the devaluation of the
cruzeiro against the JS dollar -- that is, the *real, devaluation of the cruzeiro
against the dollar proceedt^ at a rate faster than domestic inflation. This last
factor accounts for the drop in the US dollar equivalent of bids by Brazilian
contractors, and therefore affected the difference between actual and forecast
local costs, as stated in US dollars. The table below sumzarizes the comparison
between actual and forecast Project costs shown in greater detail in Part III,
Schedule 5.

5.13 Performance of Suogliers. Contractors. and Auditors. ELETROSUL expressed
satisfaction with the performance of its suppliers and contractors in connection
with this Project and with its auditors. The Bank expressed no dissatisfaction
with the performance of suppliers, contractors, and auditors.
6. Loan Amount, Disbursement, and Allocation
6.01  Part I1I, Schedules 6 and 7 compare actual and forecast disbursement
schedules and allocations of loan proceeds.
6.02 Given the reductions to the size and cost of the Project (paras. 5.04-
.05 and 5.10-.11), ELETROSUL obtained the agreement of the Bank tot
(i) cancel US$39.55 million from the Bank loan;
(ii) extend the closing date of the Loan twice, from December 31,
1984 to December 31, 1985 and then to December 31, 1986; and
(iii) reallocate the proceeds of the Loan to: reduce financing
for consultant services; increase financing for communi-
cations equipment and training; and provide financing
for the civil works of certain TLs and SS8 -- namely, the
TLs Salto Santiago-Ita-Encantado-Gravatai, and Ivaipora-
Londrina, and the SSs at Ita and Londrina. Financing
for civil works was not anticipated at appraisal; but
thay were within the scope of the Project.
7. Financial Perforance:
7.01  The present legal structure of the sector is such that it is fundamental
to analyze sector finances (paras. 7.03-.08) in order to interpret adequately
the finances of the individual power company (7.09-.10); and sector finances
reflect the paramount regulatory authority of the Government.
7.02   The Sector.   After 1978, sector finances deteriorated because the
Government, mainly due to political considerations, allowed tariff levels to
decline in real terms (Part ITI, Schedule 8). The financial difficulties of tk.e
power sector were exacerbated by greater reliance 6n borrowings and a heavy debt-
aervice burden (Part III, Schedule 9). By late 1981, due to low tariff levels,
the sector rate of return had declined below the legal mimun4m of 10 established
by law, and most of the Bank's power borrowers were unable to comply with their
respective revenue covenants which, were based. on Brazilian power-tariff
legislation.
7.03 In their initial effort (September 1q81) to address the financial problems
of the power sector, the Governmeat and the Bank agreed on % tariff recovery plan
featuring "real" tariff increases of 3Z in 1"12 and of 5S annually thereafter
until the sector earned a return of 10  on remunerable asbuts.   The Bank
confirmed this agreement by its letter to the Government of December 23, 1981.
The letter also providec, that the Bank would not enforce the covenants of
previous loans relating to rate of remuneration as long as the Government and
the power companies complied with the plan for sector financial recovery.



l~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
7.04 In 1982, because the Government implemented tariff increases at a slower
rate than needed to raise the *real* level as called for under the plan, the
level of the average tariff in "real' torms was about IOZ below the level of
1981; and the sector did not cover its debt service (Part SIS, Schedules 8 and
9). The plan failed to achieve its objective because political considerations
dominated the thinking of the Government. Also contributing to this result were
defects inherent in the plan. implementation delays, and high levels of
inflation.
7.05 In 1983, the Government and the 9wAk amended the 1981 plan to reflect new
financial targets and a new timetable for financial recovery; and when the sector
again did not meet the new targets, the Government and the Bank agreed in 1986
on a third plan of financial recovery (Power Sactor Recovery Plan -- PSRP) which
the Bank supported with Loan 2720-BR (US$500 million). The PSRP was part of a
larger plan for macreconomic stabilization, the Cruzado' Plan, which featured
price controls, including a freeze on electricity prices. In August 1987, the
Bank and the Government discontinued their efforts to negotiate a second sector
adjustment loan due to the re-introduction of price controls, including a freeze
on electricity tariffs. The Bank and the Government renewed their efforts to
negotiate a second sector adjustment loan in 1988 and in 1989 but these efforts
failed due to the Government's choosing other strategic objectives and
deteriorating economic conditions. A full discussion of the expectations and
results for Loan 2720-BR appears in its PCR (prepared by the Brazil Department,
LAC Region I and dated December 6, 1989).
7.07 During the years 1981-1989, the Bank, noting the difficulty and complexity
of the macroeconomic and political problems of Brazil, felt that it would be more
useful to help the Brazilians to formulate and implement a credible plan of
tariff and financial recovery than to terminate the dialogue by suspending dis-
bursements or- by stopping the processing and approval of new loans. Accordingly.
the Bank, relying on the recovery plans agreed with the Government in 1981, 1983,
and 1986 continued to make investment loans (2138-BR, 2364-5-BR, etc.) and a
sector adjustment loan (2720-BR); and subsequently tried to process additional
sector loans in 1987-89. Notwithstanding their disappointing results, the plans
and the subsequent loan-processing efforts provided a useful vehicle for dialogue
with the Government. It is likely that they helped to prevent worse financial
deterioration, although this cannot be proven.
7.08 ELETROSUL. Between 1979 and 1986, due to adverse market developments (para.
5.07), Government-mandated decisions on generation expansion (para. 5.08) and
low tariff levels (paras. 7.03 -.07) -- factors outside the control of the
borrower -- the financial performance of ELZTROSL. was below forecast levels.
Further, the returns on remunerable assets were below covenanted levels (10X).
However, since the revenue covenants of loan agreements for power projects in
Brazil had been succeeded by a series of sector financial recovery plans, the
Bank considered these low returns to be acceptable, as long as the financial
performance of the sector conformed to the targets and timetables of gradual
recovery set forth in the different pl&ns (para. 7.03).  ELETROSUL's annual
ratios of debt-service coverage and self-financing were better than expected due,
respectively, to the refinancing or conversion into equity of debt service and
the reduced investment expenditure (Part III, Schedule 10).

7.10  Below is the sumax-y table of combined income statements and sources and
applications of funds of ELETROSUL. Actual ummary levels of sales, revenues,
net internal cash generation, borrowing, and investment expenditure were below
forecast levels. The shortfall in the applications of funds (- Cr043,387 million)
was matched by a shortfall in borrowing (-CrS44,745 million), a shortfall in net
internal cash generation (-6,604 million), and an offsetting modest surplus from
equity contributions (Cr$7,962 million). The actual and forecast summary ratios
for debt and equity coverage were l.5Xg the actual and forecast summary r4. ios
for self financing were, respectively 15.9Z and 13.3S. The ratios for borrowing
as a percent of investment expenditure were 106.51 and 89.62.

ment of the fundamental objective of the Project: reinforcing the reliability
and flexibility of the interconaected system serving the Southerm and South-
eastern regions.

8.02 Return on Regional Exoansion Plan. At appraisal, the rate of return on
the regional investment program for 1980-1984 was estimated at 10. The actual
rate of return was 3.81, which is low -- reflecting the impact of the Govern-
ment's tariff policy.   The actual rate of return is based on: (i) actual
regional investment costs for the period 1980-1987, actual operating costs for
the period 1980-1989, and expected operating costs which are based on operating
costs in 1989; and (ii) actual and expected benefits. Actual benefits are based
on actual retail revenues for 1987-89 times (x) actual sales for 1987-89 asso-
ciated with the regional expansion program. Benefits for 1990 and later years
are based actual sales as of 1989 times expected retail tariff levels which are
in line with recent Bank-Government agreements (Part III, Schedule 11).
9. Performance of the ELETROSUL. the Bank. and the Government.
9.01 ELETROSUL responded rationally and flexibly to its changing circumstances,
market and financial. The changes to the Project were appropriate. Its financial
performance reflected the impact of decisions taken by the Government. It com-
plied with the major covenants of the Loan Agreement (Part III, Schedule 12).
9.02  The level and extent of Bank supervision was appropriate (Part III,
Schedule 13), as the Borrower was technically competent.
9.03 The Bank's involvement with ELETROSUL took place in the wider context of
its continuing dialogue with the Government on restoring sector finances (paras.
7.03-.09). Between 1981 and 1986, the Bank, taking account of the complex
economic, financial, and political problems of Brazil, made a series of invest-
ment loans and one sector adjustment loan basedc on. the understanding that the
Government would implement three credible plans negotiated in 1981, 1983, and
1986 for rehabilitating the finances of the sector. The plans failed to achieve
their objective because the Government, due to political considerations plus
other factors, did not support the sector with adequate tariff levels. Between
1987 and 1989, despite strenuous efforts, the Bank and the Government were
unable to agree on terms for new lending due to tariff, macroeconomic, and other
conditions. In such circumstances, there was very little that the Bank could do
to influence policy.
10. Lessons to be Learned. Except for evaluating market projections with a wary
eye, the implementation of the Project constitutes no cautionary tale. On the
larger issue of the i7inancial deterioration ef the sector and the role of the
Bank, it seems. clear that lending in circumstances of continuing financial
deterioration, sends. the borrower the wrong message and leads to a significant
risk that agreements for financial. rehabilitation wilL not be observed. Between
1987-89, due to marcoeconomic, tariff, and other issues, the Barnk and the
Government did not agree on the terms for new loans to the power sector. In June
1990, after the Government implemented major tariff increases, the Executive
Directors of the Bank approved a new loan Lo support a power transmission and
conservation project. Effectiveness and. continued disbursement will be con-
ditioned on achieving and maintaining an even higher tariff. This appears to be
the right way to maintain the dialogue.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW nROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.     The comuents of ELETROSUL  on Parts I and III of the PCR consisted of s
(i) factual corrections as to changes to the Project; and (ii) comnets on the
performance of the Bank and lessons to be learned. The corrections, which were
minor, have been incorporated directly into Parts I and U1?. The coaments, which
were co=unicated in English, are set forth belows
'Performance of ELETROSUL. of the Bank. sad of the Government
"Because of its high degree of flexibility and efficiency, the Bank was able to
understand all the problems involving the Project and to adapt itself to the
changes introduced as a result of all political, financial, and economic
alternations occurring in the country in the course of Project implementation
without violation of its rules or guidelines.
"Whenever necessary, and through exhaustive discussions both with ELETDOSUL and
with the Brasilian government, the Bank attempted to find suitable solutions to
problems whether of technical, financial or political origin and succeeded in
settling them with skill and efficiency.
TIn. spite of its relatively low degree of autonomy to manage its own business
and in view of the close dependence of the power sector on the Governmeat policy,
ELETROSUL's performance was consistent with all challenges resulting from the
new 'status quo' which followed Project implementation and to which the Company
had to adapt itself.
'Lessons to be Learned
*The Loan under consideration has ratified provisions of other loans under
international competitive bidding, namelys
- better cost/benefit relationship
- access to newest technologies
- larger number of bidders'

Imposed by SESTISEPLAN on investment expenditures by Federal companies as part
of larger macroeconomic strategy; (ii) changes in the configuration of trans-
mission system to take account of lower-than-expected market growth, new demand
patterns, and revised generation construction  schadules; (ii) continuing
financial constraints due to low-tariff levels, slow payments by state power
companies, and restricted access to other sources of financing; and (Lv) pro-.

Schedule 3. Actual and Forecast Completed Works
1. Set forth below is a description of the changes to the transmAssison works
(see attached Table) and other elements of the Project.
2. Chantess Transmission Lines (TMs? and Substations (SS8). With respect to TLs,
the a&jor changs weres rerouting the 500 kV Salto Santiago-Ita-Venacino Aires
TL (446 k.) to Salto Santiago-Ita-Encantado (529 km.) with termination at the
existing SS at Gravatai; extending the 500 kV Arela-Curitiba TL (252 km. vs.
240 km.) to terminate at the exlsting Curltiba SS (rather than terminating at
th- proposed 8S at Curitlba N., which wa relocated to Campo Largo); extending
the Ivaipora-Londrina 500 kV line (122 km. vs. 120 km.); and cancelling the 230
kV Sao Mateus tie line (2 x 25 km.). The proposed 500 kV Curitiba N.- Curitiba
S. TL (30 km.) was incorporated into the Areia-Curitiba TL. The 230 kV Canoinhas
branch (53 km.) Is an extension of the 230 kV Areia-Curitiba TL.
With respect to SSs, the major changes were: cancellation and postponement
at, respectively, Venacino Aires and Sao Zateus; and relocation of the SS at
Curitiba N. to Campo Largo. Actual installat4on of transformer equipment (800
MVA at 500/230 kV) wsm only half of what was ixpected at appraisal (1,600 WVA
at 5001230 kV) due to cancellation of the SS at Venacino Aires. Actual installa-
tion of reactive capacity (650 WVAr at 500 kV) was less than expected (1,000
WVAr at 500 kV); and reflected the Impact of cancellation and postponement of
the SSs at Venacino Aires and Campo Largo (respectively, 4x50 MVAr at 500 kY
and- 7x50 W Ar at 500 kV), plus the addition of capaeity (4x50 MWAr at 500 kV)
at Curitiba. The installation of actual and expected reactive capacity coincLded
at tha 88S at Ita. aid Camos Novos (respectively, 7x50 MVAr at 500 kV and 3x33.3
MVAr at. 500 kY)* A modest amount of equipment ws purchased for a SS to be
located at Campo Largo, the construction of which was deferred to 1998. At the
Canoinhas 88, 75 MVA (2301138 kV) of transformr capacity was Installed; but the
proceeds of Loan 1895-SR were not used to purchase this equipment.
3* Changs: Esuiimeat. Consultant Services * and Training. The Project provided
for equipment (telecommunication and data processing), consultant services and
training. After further iavestigation, ELETROSUL found that its needs for data
processing equipment were greater than forecast. The Bank agreed (10123185) to
increase the allocation for this category of loan proceeds to accomodate these
greater needs. Installation of the co^^rnications equipment was only partially
completed by June 1987.
4. Hsving found that its personnel and local consultants were adequate to the
tasks of planning and designing the RV transmsission system and the Ilha Grande
hydroelectric- plant, ELETROBRAS drastically reduced its use of foreign consul-
tints from the forec*.t levels of 35 staff-months to about 6.5 staff months.
The Bank agreed to reduce the allocation for this category.
S. The final component of the Project consisted of on-the-job training in equip-
ment fabrication supervision outside of Brazil. and training for V system plann-
ing and operation.  The actual. anA forecast staff months for equipment fabri-
cation were, respectively, 94 vs. 105. The actual and forecast staff months for-
training in BV system planning and operation were 301 vs. 200. The Bank agreed
to inerease allocations for these categories.

1/ Because the premse for planning the Project changed, the composition and timing of tho Project changed
that Is, due to lower-than-expected regional load growth ch nge in the geographical distribution of
growth, Government-mandated Investments In coal-flred generating plant to be located In Santa Catarina and
Rio Grande do Sul, and financial/investmnt conatraintt which *ef l ated the meareconomic polley of the Co-
vernmnt, tho managemont of ELETROSL, with the agreemnt of the Bank, re-routed and/or eacel led  trans-
mission Ilnesi and  relocat d, cancel led, or postponed sub-stations. Th    facttor ale.o account for the
reprogramaing of investmant and the later completon and energization dates.
2/ Actual and forecast constrution dateo are fully comparable.
8/ Cancellation of eubstation at Venancto Alres and rerouting of associated tranamiesion Ilae (Ita-Venancio
Al res) to It&-Gravatal were due. to variations in load growth (lower-than-expected rate of Increase and

changed geographical distributlon In Rio Grande do Sul) plus the Governnent-mandated conotruction of a
thermal plant In the Charqueadas region at Jecul (asM MW). These factnr  also account for the eprogsraing
investmnt and    later dates for energisaton. Expenditure oan the sub-statlon at Gravatal were for equip-
ment only (see Sch. 0, footnote 8).
4/ See Mateus sub-station and Its ineoming foeder wore cancelled due to tho tndeflntte deferrsl of construc-
tion of the Xingo plant by PETROSRAS for the extraction of oil from a regional bituminous schlot. Another
fastor affecting this change ws the deciiotn of COPEL to Install a stop-down sub-station In the Seo Mateus
even If PETRO3RAS did not construct its plant.
S/ The sub-station to be built at Curitiba N. was rolocaetd nearby at Campo La p. Completion of tho civil
works for this sub-station was postponed to 1998 because the    load growth in  this ar  was below the
appraisal foroest. Expenditure  at Campo Largo sub-etation were for equipmont which to In sorage.
8/ Transmission line linking substations at Curitiba N. (relocated at Campo Largo) and Curttibe S. wa
Incorporated Into Arota-Curitiba transmission line.
7/ Due to cancellation of the Sao Mateu* substation (see note 8 above), the route of supply to Canoinhas was
modifled by a tap to the Arela-Curitiba transmalsslon line.
8/ The forocest length  of the transmission Itnes are takes from Annex 4.2 of the SAR, which length are con-
*sItent with those shown on the map Included In the SAR. These distanes are not consistent with the defi-
ntilon of the Project reflected In the text of the SAR (para. 4.11) or In the Loan Agreeomnt for LoAn
10i589- (Schadule 2). It appears that thero was typing mistake - that Is, 90 km. was typed whre 860 km.
