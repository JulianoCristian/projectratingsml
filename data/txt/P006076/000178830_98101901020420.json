         support the development of industrial and tourism sectors by\n            making credit available through eligible financial\n            intermediaries.The objectives will be to: (i) accelerate\n            investment to expand industrial output and exports; (ii)\n            generate increased employment to absorb part of the\n            expanding labor force and help alleviate unemployment; (iii)\n            establish a new mechanism for expanding the supply of term\n            credit by using all the banking institutions; and (iv)\n            contribute the Government's energy conservation program\n            by financing energy-saving devices and processes. An\n            Industrial Credit Fund (ICF) will be established in the CBB\n            with separate funds, accounts and staff to provide term\n            financing to industrial and tourism enterprises through\n            financial intermediaries. The project includes technical\n            assistance to the CBB, and possibly, the Barbados National\n            Bank and the Barbados Development Bank. About 100 subloans\n            averaging US$150,000 are expected to be made. Investments\n            partly financed by these subloans are expected to create\n            about 1,000 new jobs, at an estimated average cost of\n            US$15,000 per job."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
