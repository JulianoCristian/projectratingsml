Research Project is rated marginally unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned follow: Legal advisers should be included in the\n            project design when success depends on legal texts or\n            statutes. A special procurement commission can help speed up\n            procurement and disbursement, provided that it has an\n            efficient administrative and financial management system.\n            Conditions for effectiveness, if not fulfilled before\n            project implementation, are unlikely to occur. Farmers\n            participation in research projects improve the work's\n            relevance, as well as the quantity and quality of results.\n            Adequate bylaws for autonomous management of research staff\n            by research institutions and sustainable financing\n            mechanisms are necessary to provide minimum incentives and\n            an enabling research environment. Collaboration with\n            research institutions and networks should be built into or\n            facilitated by research projects. The project design needs a\n            mechanism to ensure the continuity of a common understanding\n            of project objectives and performance indicators across time\n            and project managers. Project management needs recruitment\n            systems, results agreements, and incentive systems.\n            Providing research with more autonomy and allowing separate\n            governance and funding bodies, is likely to be more\n            effective than the establishment of national governance\n            bodies. To insure consistency, the SAR (or PAD) must be\n            emphasized as a major supervision instrument."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
