The project will be comprised of eight\n            components : a) support to ongoing priority applied research\n            programs with an emphasis on improving research quality; b)\n            development of an applied research program on natural\n            resources management; c) development of adaptive research\n            involving the testing within farming communities, of\n            existing technologies; d) strengthen linkages between\n            research, extension, and the farming community; e)\n            strengthen administrative and financial management of INRAN;\n            f) human resources development, education and training for\n            research staff; g) program of construction, rehabilitation,\n            and equipment for the agricultural research network; and h)\n            coordination of external assistance amongst all donors\n            funding agricultural research."}, "docdt": "1990-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
