Two important lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the Bank should carefully assess\n            the Government's commitment to the operation. If it is\n            found to be lacking, the Bank should take the time and\n            provide the resources to help strengthen the commitment,\n            even if it means delaying the operation. Second, the Bank\n            should improve its supervision capacity and strictly apply\n            the standardized performance criteria. Procedures should be\n            in place to ensure consistency of project supervision from\n            one task manager to another and a smooth transition between\n            task managers before reassignment."}, "docdt": "1996-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
