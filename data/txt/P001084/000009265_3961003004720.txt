MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRFSID
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUlTVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A PUMLIC                SECTOR
RATIONALIZATION AND PRIVATIZATION
TECHNICAL ASSISIANCE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 5.4 million, the equivalent of
US$7.3 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finnce a project for
Public Enterprise Sector Rationalization and Privatzation Technical Assistance.
2.          IAdgrM=d: Since the end of 1985, the Government has been implemenfing an
ambitious program of economic and financial reforms (the "PREF") supported by SAL I and SAL II.
The PREF aimed at the introduction of a market economy in Guinea. Under SAL I, the Government
made quick progress towards this aim by removing the most important pnce distortions, improvmg
the incentive framework, privatizing or liquidating a large number of public enterprises, and reducing
the size of the civil service. Under SAL H, the Government achieved a substantial increase in non-
mining revenues. Uneconomic projects were removed from the public investment program and
expenditure on education increased substantialy. The Government has been malang efforts to effect a
complete overhaul of its personnel administration and has succeeded in further downsizing the civil
service. Fuel prices and utility tariffs were increased to cost recovering levels and interest rates
became positive in real tenns. Substantial progress was achieved in the privatization and
rehabilitation of the power and oil distribution sectors. The Government also issued new commercial
legislation and is preparing a program of judicial reform to adapt the system to the needs of a market
economy. However, with delays in obtaining political consensus around new economic measures, the
pace of the reforms has slowed down. Second tranche release of SAL II has been postponed pending
the results of the on-going civil service reform and the implementation of sound budget policies in the
face of faulling tax and customs revenues, including from the key mining sector. The clean-up of the
personnel rolls and wage bill is required to meet the last specific condition for tranche release.
3.           Before the start of the PREF, the public enterprise (PE) sector had a dominant role in
Guinea. Ihere were over 200 PEs, accounting for about 75% of modern sector employment, 92% of
total domestic credit and 38% of GDP. Most of those PEs, except those operating in the enclave
mining sector, were performing poorly, imposing a financial burden on the national economy. For
this reason, the proposed PE sector reform program, which is the subject of this report, is one of the
most important components of the PREF. Under SALs I and U, the Government undertook the first
divestiture program covering 86 PEs operating in commercial and productive sectors. On the positive
side, the program has resulted in a reduction of the size of the sector, the burden it represents for the
national budget and its share in the economy: reduction of the PE work force by 50% and a decline
of GDP share from 38% in 1985 to 20% in 1990. Although the results of the first divestiture
program are impressive in terms of the number of PEs privatized or liquidated, the quality of the
program has been questioned in terms of its transparency and the efficiency gains realized. A
retrospective study on the privadzation conducted by the Government and funded under the Industrial
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1234-GUI) has revealed various problems and shortcomings. The
Government did not have a clear privatization strategy which was consistent with the macroeconomic
policy adopted under the SALs. In the absence of an appropriate legal and institutional framework,
the Government implemented the privatization program on an ad hoc basis without adequate
procedures and safeguards. In spite of the progress made in the legal reform under the Privaftzation



-2-
Se;.or Promotion Program (Cr. 2148-GUI) and the Second Economic Management Project
(Cr. 1963-GUI), the legal and institutional system, particularly the judicial system, is not well
developed to allow the privatized enterprises to pursue their objectives. The Government owns a part
of the shares of many of the privatized enterprises and still retains in its portfolio many PEs in
commercial and productive sectors which should be privatized. Some privatized enterprises were
granted monopoly rights and other privileges and the public utilities and so-called strategic PEs are
still performing poorly.
4.           Further reform is urgent because the PE sector not only continues to drain scarce
resources but also impedes private sector developmcat. In 1990, operating and equipment subsidies
granted by the Govermnent to the principal public utilities were GNF 7.6 billion (US$9.4 million
equivalent) and GNF 5.9 billion (US$7.3 million equivalent) respectively. The amount of operating
subsidies has increased recently due to fiurther deterioration of performance of PEs such as
SOGETRAG (the urban transport company). In addition, indirect subsidies to the PE sector,
excluding the mining sector, were estimated at about GNF 11.8 billion (US$14.5 million equivalent)
in the same year. The Government and IDA agreed in March 1991 that a further PE operation was
necessary to address these problems. Preparation activities were financed under a Japanese Technical
Assistance Grant and included studies of PE sector strategic issues. Preparation was completed in
March 1992. During appraisal, the Government reiterated its commitment to withdrawing from the
PE sector and a statement of the objectives and scope of the second divestiture program was approved
by the Cabinet.
5.           Prect heiv    The proposed project's objectives are to help the Government
formulate and implement the next stage of the Public Enterprise Sector Rationalization and
Privatization Program which gives special emphasis to PE privatization and to strengthening key
institutions involved in program implementation . The program aims at achieving a leaner, more
effective and better managed PE sector and reducing the financial burden of the sector on the nation's
resources. The program has four elements: (a) reduction of the sector's size; (b) improved sector
management through legal and institutional reform; (c) financial restructuring of the principal PEs;
and (d) accompanying measures to mitigate the social impact of the reform. Accordingly, the
proposed project is designed to prepare these components, initiate selective implementation of the
program and strengthen the Government's capacity to manage the PE sector.
6.           Project Descintio: The project would consist of two components: (a) support to
the second divestiture program (42 % of base costs); and (O) support to the Government's PE sector
management (58 % of base costs). Activities under the first component would be designed to help the
Government formulate and implement the second divestiture program covering some 46 PEs. They
would include: (i) the services of a privatization expert to help the Privatization Committee (PC) and
the privatization technical unit of the Direction Nationale des Marches Publics et du Portefeuille de
l'Etat (DNMPPE) of the Ministry of Plan and Finance (MPF) elaborate and implement the second
divestiture program; (ii) short-term consulting services for the privatization or liquidation of specific
PEs; (iii) consulting services on the corporatization and the privatization of the Office des Bauxites de
Kindia (OBK); (iv) consulting services for the restructuring of the Office des Postes de Guinde (OPG)
and the restrucuring and privatzation of Societe des T6lecommunications de Guin6e (SOTELGUI);
(v) consulting services on the privatization of Entreprise Nationale d'Electricite de Guinde
(ENELGUI); (vi) advisory services on the legal reform program with a view to fostering private
sector development; and (vii) the services of two experts, one internationally and one nationally
recruited, to help the Government and the targeted PEs develop the reorientation programs for
redundant PE employees. The second component aims at reinforcing the Government's capacity to
manage a strearmlined PE sector, in particular, to apply more rigorous financial control and discipline.



-3
Activities under this component would adso help the Government develop a sound reguatory
famework for the privatized public utilities. They would include the services of: (I) a PE reform
expert to help DNMPPE launch and coordinat project activities; (i) a legal advisor to assist with PE
sector legal refbrm; Oii) a financial expert to help the Government restore fincial discipline in the
sector; (iv) a management information expert to assist DNMPPB with the development of the PE
sector management information system; (v) an expert to help develop a regulatory framework for the
public utiLties adapted to their new private status; as well as (vi) studies leading to fte eaboraon of
the additional reform measures; (vii) training for the staff of the key Government agencies in charge
of PE sector ruionalization and privatizaton and (viii) logitic support to DNMPPE including the
purchase of equipment and vehicles, costs related to prvatizaon, audits and operating costs.
7.           The Project, to be caried out over three years, is estimated to cost US$8.13 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.94 million (73%). IDA would finance 96%
of foreigp costs and 73 % of local costs. Breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
SCHEDULE A. Amounts and methods of procrement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedue are shown in SCIIEDUL B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Guinea are given in SCEEDULIS C and D respectvely. More detailed
information on the proposed project is provided in ANNEX 1.
S.          lPrieet Imglementafton: Ihe Privatzation Comnittee (PC), an agency independent
from the Governmet, whose majority members represent the private sector will execute the
divestiture component with the assistance of DNMPPE of MPF. IThe PC will implement the
divestiture program according to the strategy and modalities of the divesdture for specific PEs,
proposed by the PC and approved by the Cabinet Council. The PC will execute the divestiture
program on the basis of clearly defied guidelines to be stipulated in the legislation on the divestiture
program which will be acceptable by IDA. DNNPPE will be responsible for the implementation of
the PE sector management improvement component. Inter-ministera coordination in project
implementaion wll be assured by the Comite de Coordination Economique et Financiere (CCEF) and
its technical unit.
9.            .oect Swtainait: Ihe Government selected DNMPPE, a regular structure of
MWPF, as a privadzation technical unit supporting the PC and the executing agency for the PE sector
management improvement component to avoid the creation of a special project unit in order to assure
project susainability. Ihe institutional and absorptive capacity of DNMPPE and the need to
strengthen it so as to ensure ta it can perform its mandate, were taken into account in the design of
project components. Strong emphasis will be put on on-thejob training as well as on formal training
of national countetpart staff to emsure timely ransfe of knowledge/skills.
it).        IAWOnS Lned fm   us  IDA Involemt: In preparing the project, IDA
was guided by lessons learned from the previous Technical Assistance Project, PAGEN I (Cr. 1559-
GUI). The August 1990 Project Completion Report concluded that the Project's objective of
insittional strengthening, parc y technical tasfer, encountered numero  obstacles in spite of
its success in the delivery of specific Inputs needed for preparation of the structural adjustent
program and in its training program component. In order to avoid such shortcomings, the terms of
reference of each long-term consultat would include specific monitorable and measurable
performan  indicators focussing on local insttutional and capacity buid-up. The Goverment has
agreed to assign, during the project imple on, local counterpart staff acceptable to IDA with
adequate skills and a high degree of com ent so as to =mine the risk of turnover and ensure a
reasonable degree of stability. Purthermore, the design of the divestiture component has built on the
lessons and recommendations derived from the retrospectve stdy on the preious divestre



-4-
program, undertaken as a part of project prepation. The problems encountered in the previous
divtiture program include:(i) absence of an appropriate legal and instutional framework; (ii)
excessive proton given to the privatized entaprises; (ii) inconsistency between the specific
privatization and overall macreconomic policy ad the sector ste; (iv) shortage of expetise and
technical skills; (iv) lack of transparecy and competion; and (vi) selection of non-qualified
investors. Taking account of these experiences, the Government and IDA have jointly elaborated the
specific measures to provide the framework for a more systematic and strategic appriach as well as
an appropriate legal and institutional framework.
11.            QMIImolvment: IDA country strategy in Guinea is to improve the
well-being of the population by consolidatig a sustinable macro-economic program, encouraging
private sector activities, increasing the efficiency of public sector management and extending the
coverage and quality of basic social services. The objectives of the proposed project - withdrawal of
the state from the productive sector and improvement of PE sector management - are in line with his
strateg. IDA has been closely involved with Guinea's PE reform program and the private sector
development since the change of Government in 1984. PE reform was a key component of SALs I
and II. Sector specific projects have emphasized reforms in key PEs operating in the power,
telecommunications, water, ports and petroleum distrbution sctors. The private sector development
including the development of the legal system bas been supported -der the Private Sector Promotion
Progrm and the Second Economic Management Project. The importance of the PE sector and the
priae sector davelopment have been recurret themes of the Bank's country dialogue and econmic
reports and have fgured prominendy in SAL operations. In addition, the retrospective study provides
an analysis of the divesure program and usefil operational lessons for the future. IDA has
kmowledge of, and experience In, the sector and is well placed to contme its involvement in PE
sector reform through the proposed project.
12.           :Ued Agd=ns  Durig negotiations, agreement was reached on the institutional
framework and the key pinciples and conditions which will govern the process of the second
divestiture program in order to ensure transparent, competitive and efficient implementaion of the
program. As conditfons of credit effectiveness, the Government will: (a) enact legislaion acceptable
to IDA, that will enable the preparation and execution of the second divestiture program including its
initutional framework; (b) establish the PC with terms of reference accptable to 1DA; (c)
reorganize the portfolio division of DNNMPPE, in a manner acceptable to IDA and appoint the
Director of DNMPPE and the chief of Its portfolio division both acceptable to IDA; (d) appoint local
counterpart staff, acceptable to IDA, assigned to work with each resident consultant; (e) recruit an
independent accountant, acceptable to IDA, in charge of the Project account; and (f) open the Project
account and deposit in it $200,000, corresponding to its annual contribution to the project financing.
These and other mnajor conditions agreed are detailed in paragraph 36 of ANNEX 1.
13.          Epvironm-t Asals: Of the project beneficiaries, ENELGUI and OBK's
activities raise potetial envirommental issues. In the case of ENELGUI, these wil be addressed in
the Power I project which is scheduled for presentaon to the Executive Directors in the near fiutre;
in the case of OBK, they will be addressed in the framework of a National Environment Action Plan,
currenty under prepartion.
14.         ftam    Obh    iv Catbqorie: Within the Structural Adjustment Program as
updated in an October 1991 PFP, the project is a ke component of the Government's strategy of
efficiency and resource utilizaion. It emphasizes public sector managment, including public
enterprise sector rationalization and privatizaton.



15.            P.: If succesafol, the project can be expected to lead to improved
mnagemenit of the PE sector by the Govenmen, reduction of the burden of PEs on the nationl
budget, improved delivery and quality of public services, and encouragement of private sector
developme  The divestiure prom would cover 46 PEs whose total assets are estimated at GNP
360 billion (US$444 million equivalent).
16.          Bhka: Risks assoad wih the project arise from the uncertainty of condtued
political support for difficult reform which will include price increases and reductions in employment
in some PEs and reducos In the influence of some line ministries. In order to mitigate the social
impact of the divest   program, Project activities will help the Government and the PEs concerned
develop reorientation programs for public employees made redundant under the program. The
capacity and wilingess of Guinea insdtitons to adapt to neceary reftoms may also be fiactors
limiting success. In view of the increasing need for insdtutional development, the project contains
targeted assistance for buiding capacity in the key selected agencies. Although the Government's
contributions for the fmancing of the proposed project are relatively small, the unavailability of
counterart fuinds is also a risk to project implementtion. To addres this risk, the Government will
deposit up-front in the project account US$200,000 equivalent corresponding to its annual
contributon before the credit effectiveness and subsequently deposit the same amount at annual
intervals.
17.                  _d     : I am sasfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Eiecutive Directors approve it.

1.           A new PE law promlgated in Mardh 1991 within the framework of the
scond Struct    Adjustment Progrm demes the insdtiona and legal framework of the PE
sector in Guinea. Te law aims at simplifying the u cariy complicated and confusing
lega stats of PEs. The number of differen legal fm  of PE has been reduced from 14 to
twoL/: *BEtreprise Publique I Caractr Industriel at Commecial (EPIC)"; and "Soie
Anonyme (SA) wih State participation. EPICs are scly limited to the public udlities
which ae statutoy monopolies, In general. Both EPICs and SAs are subject to the lega
regime applicable to prIvate frms with limited exceptions arisig from the public nature of
eir acdvities or the State participation  The new law provides the managemnt of the PEs
with broader autonomy in exchae for more accntabiity for their pefornmace. The State
invention wil be limited to the overall sector plaig and strategic Issues. The State will
not intvene directly in he managemen0t of PEs, except when to exercise shareholder rights
tough its representatives on the boards. The Government will replace the cunt system of
control a ried wft that of control a     while reinrLbclog supervision and monioring
of PE pedmmnm. The principle on which this PE law is founded is the Govenme's
policy and strate  to withdraw itsef as much as posible from the Public Enteqrises and to
lmit is Itevention to the m gment of its reduced PE portfolio as one of the
aeholders.
2.           Althugh the new PE law i a breakthrugh in the PE sector refrm, the
actua ns8tional setting i far from the goals anticipated in this law. A fundmental
recaing of the existing i  onal framework is required for the Govermnt to implement
effcienty the PE Divestitur Program and to improve the PE Sector mangement. Until
Feru    1992, thwe had been no foca point of the Divetue Prom and the PB sector

(CCEF) and its technical unit have coordinated the PE reform program. However, being
overwhelmed by other burning macroeconomic issues, they have not been able to concentrate
on the divestiture program and the PE sector reform requiring specialized knowledge and
complicated institutional changes. As a result, PE sector reform has been often delayed and,
in the absence of any coherent policy or strategy, implemented in an ad hoc manner.
3.           Following the ministerial reshuffle in February 1992, recognizing this
findamental instiuonal weakness in the PE divestiture program and the PE secor
management, the Government selected DNMPPE in the newly created MPF, which combines
the former MPCI and the former MEF, as the focal point of the divestiture program and PE
sector management. During project appraisal In March 1992, the Cabinet reaffirmed its
commitment to the continuation of the PE divestiture program and decided to reinforce
DNMPPE as focal point of the PE sector rationalization. The Government also decided to
establish a Privatization Committee (PC), whose majority members represent the private
sector, as an agency independent from the Government, to implement the divestiture
component of the project with the technical and admina ve assistance of DNMPPE. In
order to assure consistency between the specific PE reform measures and the overall
macroeconomic policy and sectoral strategies, the Government intends also to reinforce the
inter-ministerial coordination acivities of CCEF and its technical unit.
Se:tion B: PE Sector and Its Consants
4.           SecrSze Following Independence in 1958, Guinea embarked on a
campaig to eliminate all vestiges of the colonial era by taking control of key sectors of the
economy. Conversion to a socialist state in which PEs were to be the cornerstone of the
State's intervention in the economy was swift and precipiated not only by political motives
but by the need to fill the vacuum left by the abrupt departure of foreign advisors and
businessmen when official and commercial tes were broken with France shortly after
Independence. Before the start of the economic and financial reform program (PREE) in
1985, the PE sector had a dominant role in Guinea. There were over 200 PEs existng in
various sectors, ranging from State fams to retail outlets for consumer goods, accounting for
about 75% of modern sector employment, 92% of total domestic credit and 38% of GDP.
The mining sector combined with the public udlities represented nearly two third of total PE
sector assets. The transport sector and commercial sector accounted for the same share, i.e.,
between 11 % to 12%, each.  heshare of the industry sector was small, a reflection of the
low level of industrialization in Guinea. Although the Govenment has divested 86 PEs mainly
in the industrial and commercial sectors under the PREF, more than 100 PEs, accounting for
20% of GDP, are still mainined in the State's portfolio. As a result of the first divestiture
program, the shares in the total PE assets of the mining sector combined with the public
utilities in the total PE sector assets increased from 66 % in 1985 to 77 % in 1990. On the
other hand, the commerce and industry sectors had reduced their shares from 11 per cent to
6.9 % and from 8% to 1%, respecdvely during the same period. The Divestiture Program
conributed to a 50% PE employee reduction.
S.                        Except for the public utilities and mining enterprises, the
decion to create most of the PEs or invest in their extension/ rehabititation were based on



Page 3 d 25
non-economic or social considerations and not on efficiency or least cost considerations.
Therefore, most of them have very litle or no chance of becoming viable and financially
autonomous entities in a market-oriened economic system. Except for the enclave min
entprises, whose majority equities were owned by foreign interests, overall PE sector
performance has been poor and characterized by low productivity, high losses, mounting
arrears, rising debt burden, illiquidity and reliance on monopoly privileges. Most of the
public utilities are nealy bankrupt and cannot operate without the Govremmen's direct and
indirect subsidies. Generally, their services are unreliable and of low quality. Viruly none
possesses reliable accounting and fmancial control systems. The absence of an efficient
billing and collection system also leads to the substantial amount of leakage of PE revenues.
6.           The study on the financial flows between the Goverment and the PEs,
financed by the Japanese Technied Assistant Grant, revealed the sizable amount of the
Government's direct and indirect subsidies to the PE sector. In 1990, the Govermnent granted
the PE sector GNF 7.6 billion (US$9.4 million) of operating subsidies and GNP 5.9 billion
(EUS$7.3 million) of equipment subsidies. The amount of operating subsidies has recently
increased due to the financial problem of SOGETRAG (bus company) resulting from
intensified competition from small private operators. Furthermore, in the same year, the
Govermment transferred GNF 53.2 billion (US$65.6 million) of indirect subsidies to the PE
sector, ncluding the mining sector. Indirect subsidies to the PE sector (excluding mining)
were estimated at GNF 11.8 billion (US$14.5 mfllion). The following table presents the
indicators of estimated profitability of about 50 principal PEs, excluding rining companies,
whose finncia statements are available. Ihese figures show extremely poor fmancial
peformance by the PEs and their heavy reliance on direct and indirect subsidies.

7.           Pt PR fSctor Reform. Under the PREF, supported by SALs I and II, the
Goverment has undertaken a series of PE sector rationaizaion and privatiaon measures
which include: (a) divestiure progm; (b) lepl reform; and (c) ret  i  of
princpal PEs. The results are mixed. Although the Government has made substial
progress In PE reform, it is far from achieving its objectives, a leaner, more effectve and
better managed PE sector and reducing the financial burden which the sector places on the
budget.

(1)   Divestiture Program  and Private Secor Development
8.          In 1985, the Government pronounced, tbrough the Statement of Development
Policy prepared for the first SAL, its intention to reduce its intervention in the PEs in order to
create a private sector orented economy, and to substanay reduce the heavy burden of
these enterpris on the public finances. In order to implement this policy, the Government
adopted Xt first divestiture program which comprised the liquidation of 58 non-viable PEs
in the industrial, commercial and banking sectors and the privatization of 30 viable but non-
strategic PEs in the industrial sector.
9.           As of December 31, 1991, the Government had liquidated 58 PEs in the
industrial, commercial and banking sectors and privatized 28 PEs in the industrial sector. Ihe
revenues generated from thi sales of PE assets amounted to about GNF 21 billion (US$25.9
million). While quntitative objectives, in terms of the number of liquidated and privatized
PEs, were clearly met, the financial and economic objectives of the divestre program were
at times lost in the process. On the positive side, the divestiture program has contributed to
reduction of the PE sector's heavy burden on public finances. On the negative side, out of
the 28 privatized enterprises, only four are operating with profits and two close to the break-
even point. Most of them seem to be highly protected by generous fiscal exemptions and to
operate in a monopoly or a quasi-monopoly situation. In these cases, not only have
significant potential tax revenues been foregone but economic efficiency objectives have also
been sacrificed. Ihe remaining 22 enterprises have stopped or suspended operations for
various fiancial, managerial and technical reasons. As a result, the privatization program
could not achieve other objectives such as the private sector development, performance
improvement of the privatized enterprises, mobilization of savings and employment creation.
10.          As part of project preparation, the Government conducted a retsgocie
study on the first direstiture prog m. This study concludes that the unsadsfaory
outcome of the program is mainly the result of the combined effects of the lack of a sound
divestiture strategy consistent with the overall macroeconomic policy adopted under the
PREF, the absence of an appropriate legal and institutional famework for the divestiture
program, ad the Government's weak technical capacity. The study also revealed other
constraints applicable to the entire private sector in Guinea such as high energ costs and
unreliable electricity supply, difficulty in procurement, shortage of qualif A work force,
ineffective Customs control, limited export opportunities and market, lack of working capital
and limited access to the bank credits.
11.          Further to the above mentioned constraints, an underdeveloped legal system
constitutes a major bottleneck for private investment and private sector development in
Guinea. Soon after gaining independence in 1958, Guinea adopted socialism as its political
ideology. Throughout the former regime, this ideology peameated and dominated all aspects
of Guinea's political, economic and social life. As a direct resutt of this ideologic stance, the
entire legal system inherited from the colonial period was set aside. The court system was
tuoally restructured with the judiciwy being fully subjugated to the will of the executive
power. Legal education was replaced with a system bases. on ideological teaching and the
right to legal counsel and defense was wiped out as an independent legal profession was
abolished. This situation prevailed until 1984 when the current regime took over.

12.          Since 1984, the policy of the new rgime has been ow of openns and
librlism To give credence to this policy, the Govenmat Is fully awae dt Guinea needs
to establish a credible and performig lgal system. From ib eauly days in power, the
Government requested IDA to help in ti area. IDA rWded namely by prvidn
assistance to elaborate the new minin code in 1985. In addidon, a subtatl legal
componen was included in the Second Economic Manage_m  Project; it consisted in the
provision of three long-term resident legal advisers required to provide legal advice to the
Government on a dsay basis to support the mpl  on of the PREP. Two full time
advisers were assind each to the CCEF and the Mistry of Economy and Finnce while the
third was assigned on a part-time basis to the Government's Geneal Secretaria and the
Mnistry of Justice.
13.          The timely avilability of the services provided by these lega ewprts has been
a remarkable asset in the Implementaion of the PREF. Some of the achievements attuabe
to their performance include the resuwmption of the publicatio of the official gazette and the
adequat drafing of a number of now laws and reglatio  namely in the area of economic
management (e.g. PEs legal/instiutond fraework, land teure code, a new contuon and
acompanying organic laws etc...). However, many deficies and dsroming remain
such as the inadequate ting and the tota mafunction of th judiciary that have been
idetfied under the ongoing Private Sector Promotion Credit and the proposed Nationa
Agriculral Export Promotion Project as some of the major bottlenek to an acceptable
pmance of the private sector.
14.          To remedy this siuaion, the Government, relying on the satsfactry
exeience of the limt  egal assistanc provided so far under the above mentioned IDA
financed projects, has requested the Bank to consider the possibility of a sectoral support to
overhaul the entire Gunean legal system. While IDA intends to pursue thi matter under other
tecni assistace operations, it has however been deemed necesary to provide under this
project the ineiate assistane now required to otiu esseta task already under way
namely at the level of the Govenment's Genera Sectri  and the Mnistry of Justice.
15.          Based on the recmmendatons derived from the tropective study, the
Government with the assistance of IMA has elaboratd the seond dedture gram
coveng 46 PEs. Daring project appraisal in March 1992, the cabinet approved tis program
including the list of 46 PEs. Out of 46 PEs, 18 PEs were parly privatied under the first
divestiture progam. The second program alms at selling off all of the Gov e's
remaning shares in these enterprises. These PEs also include some privazed PEs r
by the Government because of a deault by investors in the fulfilment of the obligations
stipulated in the privatization concts. The rmining 28 PEs inlude key public utiLies such
as ENELG1U and TeleccatioDs whose diestture programs are being supported by
IDA sector oerain. Some pivate investors have already manfested their hinerest In the
purchae of cein PEs such as ENELGUI, Telecommunications, OHI Qwtel), OFAB
(infrastructure supporting CBG), SOGUIPECHE (fishig company) and SALGUIDIA
(plantaton).

17.         TIe seownd divesture program includes public uities which are considered
as natural or quasi-natal monopolies such as ENELGUI and Telecommnications. The
privatzatlon of the public utilities requires an appropriat regulatory framework and the
sit nal capacity to implemen the reglations. !h.stud-s an the nugat fuJm work
ofl uWft     esflinaned by the lape Technical Assistance Grant recommended as the
best solution the creation of a national regulatory agency independet of the Government. The
regulatory framework should meet the following criteda:
(a)   optimization of exisng compee  in the field of regulation in Guinea;
(b)   consistncy among the sec    regula ry frmeworks;
(C)      sparency of the decision-making proes and criteria;
(d) assurance of indqepndent judgement;
(e)   reflection of the Govrmen's strategy and policy;
(f)   protection of consumers' interests; and
(g0    assurace of reasonable rate of reurn;
18.          As the creatio of an independent national regulatory agency requires a
political co_ensus and a long prepation, the Goverment and IDA agreed to use CCEF as
the cental reguatoy body by reinorcing Its tecical unit with technical assistance in order
to respond to the imediat needs  ising from athe pvaizaon of ENELGUI and
Tdecommunications. The proposed credit wil finmce a reglatory expert of the public
utities. Wih assistance of the regulatory ee  the technical unit of CCEF wil coodinate
wih te sectr miniies the eaboration of the sector regultoy fraework. Based on the
experiences of the sectorial eglas, the technical unit will propose the ari  legal
status and structure for the establishment of a national reguatoy agency.
(2)   PE Sector    Rerm
19.          In March 1991, the Government promulgated a new PE law defining relations
between the State and the PE. Tnis law aims at simplifying the unnecessarily complicated
and conhfg legal sta  of PE. Under the new law, all PEs are subject to the legiation
applicable to private fims with lmited except    arising from the public nature of their
actvities or the Steparticipadou. The new law provies the management of the PEs with
grater autonmy in exchange for more a   ity  for their performance. Stae
Intvention is limited t overall sector planning and srategic Issues. Ihe application decr3e
Of this law was adopted in April 1992 and fiuther measures such as the classificadon of al the
PE& according to the nw leal stas an the modification of their stue in conformity wh
their new leg status would be undetk  under the proposed project.

20.          In addition to ovea"l PE sector reform, the Government has been
restrucring the princial public utilides and a State mining complex with assistance from
IDA and other donors. Under the IDA-fnanced Second Watr Project (Credit 1985 GUI),
the Govenmet liquiad the non-perfoming Societ Nadonale des Eamx (SNE) and replaced
it with a State enterpris, SociWtE Natonale des Eaux de Guinde (SONEG), and a water
management company with majority pivate participaton, SociEtE dExploitation des Eaux de
Guide (SEEG). SONEG ownS the urban water facilities and is responsible for investment
and sector development. SEEG is responsible for operation and maintenance of the facilities
leased from SONEG as well as billing and collecion of revenues. Sector perfmance has
subst_tly improved as a result. BiSling and revenues collection performance are
signficanly up. Although the Government continues to subsidize opeaing cot and bear
the cost of sectora debt service, it wiUl gradually achieve ful cost recovery tbrough staged
incease of water tar;ffs agreed with IDA.
21.          In the petroleum sertor, after a process lasting over four years, the
Govenment has nearly completed the liquidation and privaization of thi Office Nationd des
Hydrocarbur  (ONAR). Under the terms of the privatization, the new Societe Guin6enne
des PEtroles (SPG), established with majority private participation on December 20, 1990,
would own the poleum products dos both in Cokry and the provinces. The service
stations, 58 in all, would be divided between the shareholders proportionate to their share in
the joint vetur  Each of the private companies (SHELL, AGIP, and TOTAL) would
operate under its own flag, whfle the Government would have the right to sell its stations to
other companies. The comies would procure the petroleum quantity to supply their own
stations. These arrangements are being finaized between the Goverment and the companies.
In the meanme, the tnusport fleet was sold to private entrepreneurs and service stations
francised to private e. In summary, free market conditions will be established
for the spply as wel as the distibtdon of petroleum products, the unloading and storage
cilitis being used as a common cader.
22.          Ihe Govermment has been less successfMl in PE reform in other sectors. In
1990, afer lengthy, fruiless measures to rehabilite the inefficient nationa poww company,
ENELGUI, the Governmnt took the radical step of giving full line responsibility for
operatial and managerial control to an eatiate management consultant team. To assure
transparec and to provide needed political support to implement the reforms, the team
reports directly to a commitee of the CoUnCil of Miisters. The responsibilities of the
management constnt team center on the implementtion of a restrucg program at
ENELGLU, the objectives of which are to alter the corporate culture, transforming the fum
Into a viable operating utility. The management team has implemented urgent restucturig
meassues which include tariff ice    by 200%, improvement of billing and colleion of
revenues by Itallai   of computer and meters, and application of rigorous discipline.
Although the rests over the past years he been encouraging, this approach should be
considered only as an urget tasitona operation and a more sustainable institutional
solution shoud be sought. In consultation with IDA, the Goverment is cuny developing,
with the astance of the consultat team financed under the project's PPF, an appropriato
pdvatzton strategy for ENELGUI. Ihe issuance of tenders for the selection of a private
operator for the utility is one of the conditions for the credit effectiveness of the Second
Power Project, scheduled for presentatlon to the Executive Directors in the near fture.

23.          In 1989, the Government decided to reorganize the Minis ry of Posts and
Telecommunications into a postal bureau and a Telecommunications company. Within the
framework of preparing a proposed Telecommunicadons Technical Assistance Project which
is tentatively scheduled for Board presentation in FY 93, the Government adopted a sector
policy which aims at the creation of a majority private sector owned telecommunications
company (SOTELGUI) and the creation of an autonomous postal bureau (OPG) as well as the
establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework in the telecommunications sector. A
consultant team, financed under the PPF of the Telecommunications TA Project, is assisting
the Government in developing a legal and institutional framework. At a donors' meeting on
the telecommunications sector held in Paris in March 1992, the Government reaffirmed its
commitment to progressive withdrawal from the telecommunications sector and to restructure
OPG. The Government is currently preparing, with assistance of IDA, a Telecommunications
Technical Assistance Project in support of the restructuring of OPG and the restructuring and
privadzation for SOTELGUI. The project, which is the subject of this report, will finance a
privatization study on SOTELGUI and the management consultant services for OPG and
SOTELGUI during the transitional period before the eventual restructuring of OPG and the
privatization of SOTELGUI. The fiancing of these components, to be implemented prior to
end December 1992, are urgently needed to meet the timetable of the restrucuring and
priatization of OPG and SOTELGUI.
24.          Office des Bauxites de Kindia (OBK) is the second largest bauxite mining
complex in Guinea established with financial assistance of the former Soviet Union (USSR).
OBK is the only modem industry in the Kindia region and employs about 1,400 workers. It
produces annually about 3 million tons of bauxite and contributes about US$80 million to
export earnings. Its production is entirely exported to the Ukraine under the terms of the
bilateral agreement with the former USSR. 56% of the revenues from this sale are assigned to
service Guinea's debts to the former USSR and 44% to the import of goods and services from
the former USSR. Since OBK is a part of the Ministy of Natural Resource and Enviroment
and not an autonomous entity, it has no revenues of its own and its costs are covered by
transfers from the Central Bank (BCRG) and the accumulation of arrears to local suppliers,
notably ENELGUI. This institutional framework and commercial arrangement not only fai to
motvate the management of OBK to ensure efficient operation, but also constitute the major
obstacle ibr securing transparency in its financial and commercial transactions. OBK is now
facing two major problems. First, it will need to undertake a sizeable expansion project as
the deposits it is currently working are expected to be depleted in several years. Second, the
commercial or financial arrangements with the partners in the former USSR are stll unclear
and some payment arrears for exported bauxite have been accmulating. With the assistance
of IDA, the Government conducted a marketing study of OBK's bauxite and a review of the
feasibility study on the expansion project prepared by Russian consultants. These studies
confirm OBK's financial viability on the following two conditions: (a) OBK can secure a
stable marketing arrangement based on the competitive terms generally applicable in the
interntional marketZ/; and (b) OBK should be transformed into a "soci&e anonyme",
aI     For techmical reasons, both OBK and Ukae would benefit from contiung their
comm_rcial tmnsactions on condition that internationally acceptable commercial conditions
i.e., intemational madcet price and payment in convertble currences, were applied to the



AN 1
Page 11 of 25
endowed with fil autonomy. Accordingly, the Government has decided to transform OBK
Into an autonomous entity with a view to prvatzing it eventually. The Govermnt has also
decided tO renegotiate the commercial conditions as well as the debt issues with the former
USSR. The proposed project will assist the Govermen with the negotiations and the
corporatizaion of OBK as well as its eventual privadzation. As the curent legal status of
OBK is a major cause of its problems, the creadon of a new Sociat Anonyme replacing OBK
is a condidon for the disbursement of the technical assisce component for OBK.
25.          Sector Consti .ts Apart from mediocre performance of the principal PEs,
the difficulties facing Guinea's PE sector include: (a) an oversized PE sector; (b) instutio
weaknes ; (c) incomplete application of the new legislation; and (d) a lack of financial
discipline.
(1)   Overazd E-Secr
26.          In spite of the sizeable divestiture program undertaken under SALs I and II,
there remain sdll more than 100 PEs in the StaWe's portfolio. These enterprises include many
non-viable PEs and those opeating in productive sectors from which the Government should
withdraw. Most of them are operating inefficiendy and accumulating deficits. The
Government has neitier the necessary financial nor human resources to manage these PEs
efectively.
(-z) ibuddonal Weakness
27.          In spite of the PE sector legal reform undetaken so far, most of the PEs are
still subject to excessive control of the supervsing ministries. Moreover, the responsibilities
of the PE sector management had been split among the former ME, the former MPIC and
the Technical Ministies; this resulted in the absence of a coordinated approach. There are no
clear rules and regulatk%ns and little common undersndi  of the lines of authority,
responsibility and accountability between various Goverment agencies. Being overloaded
with critical burning macroeconmc reform issues, CCEF does not have enough time or
resources to concentrate on PE sector reform, which is complicated and requires substantal
institonal changes. The selection of the DNMPE as the focal point of the PE sector
management, ftoUowing the ministeri reshuffle in February 1992, demonstrats the
Govrmers iention to adopt a more coordinated approach to PE sector refbom and
management. However, DNMIPP requires an intensive technical assistance to develop its
iitutional capacity.

28.          Although the Goverament has laid down the foundation of the PE sector legal
reform by the promulgation of the PE law, the Government has not yet effectively applied this
law to the PEs. Most of them continue to work in the old instituonal framework and are not
given fiacial and mangerial autonomy from the Government. The absence of clear
defition of the reciprocal responsibilities and obligations favor the intervention of various
Government bodies in the management og the PEs in a subjective, sometimes arbitrary,
manner and discourages PE management from assuming responsibility for their performance.
A rigorous pursuit of the lega reform initiated under SAL 11 would be required for an
effective application of the PE law. In addition to the development of the legal framework for
the divestiture progrm and the pursuit of the PE sector, the general legal reform, particularly
the reinforceme of the judiciary system, with a view to developing the private sector is
required.
(4) Lack of Financial Discipline in the PE Sector
29.           One of the main objectives of the PE sector management is to reduce the
secr's financial burden on public finances. The study on the linancial flows been the
oement A the PEs financed by the Japanese Technical Assistance Grant revealed that
most of the PEs continue to receive equipment subsidies and indirect subsidies in various
fotms such as fiscal exemptions and relief from debt service, although the Government has
reduced direct subsidies to PEs to compensate for operatng deficits. The Government grants
custom-duty and tax exemptions on an ad hoc basis without any coherent policy. Indirect
subsidies to the PE sector, excluding the mining sector were esmated at about GNF 11.8
billion (US$14.5 million) in 1990. The study also found that these exemptions not only
represent for the Government foregone potental revenues but also constitute the major source
for the price distortion of imported goods, particuarly petroleum products as these enterprises
ae selling tax exempted products on the black market. Except for a few PEs, there is no
reliable accouning system or effective financial control system. Cross-debts between the
Government and PEs and among PEs themselves are accumatng. The total credit and debt
of the princWi  12 PEs as of December 1990 reported in the PE eor cros--debt study
were respecdvely GNF 143 billion and GNF 47 bilion. The following are the main causes for
the accumulation of the cross-debts:
(a)   inadequ  admeinistration of the Governmet's external debts;
(b) insufficient budget allocation;
(c)   non-respect of the budgetary procedures;
(d)   Government as the largest client of the PEs; and
(e)   mediocre peformance of the PEs.
Ihese are deep-rooted financial management problems in the public sector. The Government
and IDA wUl together be addressing these in the forthcoming Public Investment Program
sceded for September 1992 and the Public Expendiure Reviews scheduled for FY 93.
Furthermore, the Government intends to use the PE Sector Management Information System
to be Instaled under the Project to better monitor financial flows between the Government and
the PEs and to apply more rigorous finacial discipline in sector management.

IDA paid special attention to sustainable institution building. First, regarding the executing
agency, the Government, with iA's concurrence, selected DNPPE, a department within
MPF, rather than a special project implementation unit. Ihe Govemment and IDA carefully
designed the project components so that DNMPPE would develop its organization and
capacity through the implementation of the Project. Second, the Govemment, in consultation
with IDA, prepared guidelines for technical transfer which define the respective roles of the
expatriate experts, national counterpart staff and the Government. Under these guidels, the
resident consultants will prepare the technical transfer program with monitorable indicators at

PE sector reform program and private sector development since the chang of te Goverment
in 1984 within the fiamework of SALs I and 11, the Private Sector Promotion Program,
Economic Sector Magement Projects I and 11 (PAGEN I and U) and various sector
operations such as power, transport and water. Through the project impi   the
Government int-lds to prepare a PE sector program which could be financed by a possible
Atre Public Enterprie Sector Adjustment operation which would aim at deenig and

would play a critical role in coodating the donors' asstce in the legal relform  Donors'
contrIbutons and coordination are mosdy required for measures to mitigate the negave social
Impact of the divestture program. Ihe expert of the reorientation program for the redundant
PE employees to be financed under the Project would play the role of catalyst of the donors'
actvities in this field. The IDA-financed Social-Economic Development Support Project
(PADSE) would finance the reorientation program of the redundat PE employees to be
Idenfied under the Project on condition tht these programs meet the criteria set for the sub-
projects of PADSE. USAID is prparng a Public Works Program with a view of creatng the

ANNEX I
Page 21 of 25
Sedion D: PrJet Administration and lInemp ation
38.          Qniaf          an «d M  tUn1: The PC, an entity independent from the
Government, whose members represent in the majority the private sector, will execute the
divestiure component with the assistance of DNMPPE of MPF. DNMPPE will be responsible
for the implementation of the PE sector management improvement component. DNMPPE will
be reinforced by a consultant team composed of vaious experts on the divestiture progm
and the PE sector management. Inter-ministerial coordination in project implementation will
be assured by the Comit6 de Coordination Economique et Financiere (CCEF and its technical
unit.
39.          The PC will be established according to the legislation of the divestiture
program. The PC will consist of the 4 representatives of the private sector and the 3
representative of the Government. Subject to the approved legislation, the members of the PC
will include (i) one representative of the commercial banks, (ii) ihree representatives of non-
banking private sectors, (iii) one representative of MPF, (iv) one representative of the
Ministry of Industry and Small and Medium Entprises and, (v) one represeaive of the
Technical Ministry supervising the PE to be divested.
40.          DNMPPE was created in November 1990 following the ministal
reorganization of the former Ministy of Economy and Finance. DNMPPE is composed of
two divisions: the Division des Marches Publics and the Division du Portefeuille d'Etat. The
Division du Portefeuile d'Etat is in charge of the management of the endre State portfolio,
partculary in the PEs. The portfolio management includes: (a) preparation of all the financial
agreements with the PEs such as loans and grants and their implementation; (b) decision
regarding participation in the PEs, cession or sales of the State shares in the PEs and
liquidation of the PEs; (c) development and application of the legislation related to the PEs;
and (d) collection of the financial data on the PE activities and its analysis. The Government
created DNMPPE to implement the new PE sector policy and strategy emerging from the new
PE law which was promulgated in March 1991. Under this new law, the Government intends
to withdraw itself as much as possible from the PEs and to limit its intervention to the
management of Its reduced portfolio as one of the share holders. Following the minsterial
reshuffle in February 1992, the Govement decided to reinforce the Division du Portefeuflle
d'Etat to accelerate the implementation of the new PE sector policy and strategy, particularly
the divestiture program. This division has currently 20 staff whose qualifications are high on
average. DNMPPE is currendy reorganizing the Direction du Portefeuille de l'Etat in line
with the project components: (a) divestiture progra; and (b) PE sector management.
41.           M:Thn and Proeurs of tivestiture Prom:Te institutional
framework, the key principles and conditions which will govern the divestture program, as
agreed at negotations, are stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement. The Government
will enact the legislon acceptable to IDA, which will reflect the agreed principles and the



AXIXI
Page 22 of 25
Institutional framework. The PC will be created according to this legislation. The PC with
assistne of DNMPPE will formulate a detailed draft divesiture program specifying the
stategy and modaWities of the divetture for the targeted PEs, specific steps for public offers,
as well as timetables of their i l  .  he proposed diveatiture program wil be
submitted hrough the CCEP to the Cabinet for its approval. The divestiure program is also
subject to IDA's approval. Once the program is adopted by the Cabinet Council and approved
by IDA, the PC will execute the divestiture progrm within the fiamework approved by the
Govemen regarig the strategy and the modality of the divestiture. PC will execute the
divestiture program with full autonomy subject to clearly defined guidelines and the
procedures defined in the legslation on the divestiture program. In the execution of the
divestitre progm, the privatization technical unit of DNMPPE, reinforced by a consultant
team finaced by the project, will extend technical and administrative support to the PC. The
principal consutants recruited under the Project, i.e. a PE expert, a privatzation expert and a
legal advisor wil atend the meetings of the PC. The PC will also invite other interested
paies such as the representatives of donors for providing support. According to the
Instruction of the PC and under its supervision, DNMPPE will prepare the technical
documens related to the divestiture such as the tender documents and evaluation reports. In
principle, open tender procedures including public reading of bid amounts at the PC will be
applied. In the implementation of the divestiture program, the attribution of DNMPPE is
limited to technical and administrive support to the PC and does not include power of
decision maki  for divesiture.
42.                        Ma. Implementation of the main activities under the project
is anicipated to take about three years. The project is thus expected to be fully completed by
June 30, 1995. A summary of the key project activities is presented in Schedule 2.
43.           emene. The goods and services to be financed under the project would
be procured in accordance with procedures summarized in Schedule B. The modalities of
procurement of the consulting services are presented in Schedule 3. Consultants and
technical asistace personnel to be financed by IDA would be appointed in accordance with
the Bank Group Guidelines dated August 1981 and would be employed on terms and
conditons satisfictory to IDA. Items will be grouped to the extent possible to encourage
competitie biddiag. Packages of equipment and vehicles valued at US$100,000 equivalent or
more wil be procured through Iternational competitive bidding (ICB) according to Bank
guideines. Contacts for purchase of goods of less than US$100,000 equivalent but more
than US$25,000. equivalent in a total amount not exceeding US$220,000 equivalent will be
awarded following local competitve bidding (LCB) procedures. Minor items cosfting
US$25,000 equivalent or less, in a total amount not exceeding US$190,000 equivalent, will be
purchsed through quotations from not less than three reputable suppliers. All conts
esmated to cost more than US$25,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review of
promn d            t

44.          The last country implementation review identified lengthy delays In processikg
due to cumbersome and time-consuming procurement procedures as a major project
implementation issue in Guinea. The Government and IDA, recognizing this problem, have
taken steps to offset it and facilitate accelerated procurement under the proposed Project. The
terms of reference for the key consulting assignments were prepared during appraisal and in
May, 1992 the Government invited offers for the key resident consultancies. The Government
also prepared the tender documents for other consultants. Given that the public procurement
division in charge of procurement under IDA-financed contracts is a part of DNMPPE, the
Project implementing agency, and that DNMPPE staff will have the assistance of the resident
legal advisor in preparing the necessary documentation, it is reasonable to expect more
expediious procurement under the proposed Project than has generally been the case with
other IDA-financed operations in Guinea. The PE expert (principal consultant) will also assist
DNWPE staff in selecting firms and individual consultants.
45.         F1nandAf Plan. The total costs of the proposed project over the 1992-96
period are estimated at US$8.13 million equivalent, of which US$5.94 million equivalent or
73% in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA credit of US$7.3 million equivalent would
fmaice about 90% of total project costs, including US$1.59 million equivalent of local costs.
It would contribute the following proportions of project funding: (a) 100% of vehicles and
equipment; (b) 100% of the training expenditures; (c) 96% of the technical assistance costs;
and (d) 100% of the foreign expenditure and 35% of the local expenditures of the incremental
operating costs. The Government's contribution, estimated at US$0.83 million equivalent,
will finance operating costs including rehabilitation and rental costs of office, the salaries of
secretaries, the services of local experts associated with the surveys, mission costs, office
supplies, consumable, costs related to the liquidation and a part of the preparation work. To
ensure that the Government's contribution is available when needed, the Government will
establish a special Project account to finance expenditures incurred under the Project Prior to
the credit effectiveness, the Government will deposit up-front into the Project Account
US$200,000 equivalent corresponding to its annua contribution to the project financing and
deposit the same amount at anmnal interval. Setting up of such an accountant with an init
Goverment deposit of US$200,000 equivalent is a condition of credit effectiveness .
46.          Disbursement. Project activities are scheduled to be implemented over three
years and the Credit is expected to be disbursed over the same period. This is considerably
quicker than has historically been the case: the ratio of outstanding undisbursed IDA funds to
total commitments in Guinea is approximately 45 percent. Nevertheless, WDA staff believe that
the operation proposed here can meet these ambitious disbursement targets. The country
implementation review identified two reasons for the generally slow disbrement under WA-
financed projects in Guinea: (a) slow procurement procedures; and (b) the suspension of
disbuemen  bease of unavailability of the local counterpart funds. As detailed in the
parraph 43, the Government has already taken concrete actions to accelerate the
procurement of the key consultants. The problem of non-availability of the local counterpart
funds will be addressed by the up-front deposit of the Government's anmual contributions as



ANNE 
Page 24 of 25
mentioned in the paragraph 45. All disbursements will be fully documented except for
paymens under contract of less than US$20,000 equivalent; Waining and operting
expenditus which will be made again staments of expditure (SOE). The Director of
DNMPPE will be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications for all components.
47.         Revol*in Fund. In order to expedite project implementation, the
Govenment would establish a Special Account in U.S. dollars in an offshore commercial
bank as a revolving fund for IDA's contribution. An iniW  deposit of US$500,000 equivalent
would be made from the proceeds of the proposed credit upon effectiveness. The Special
Account will be replenished monthly. Budgetary provision for local costs will be inscribed in
the anmnal opeatng budgets for the MPF.
48.           proj  Preparation FasilLx. A PPF of US$350,000 was approved on
February 25, 1992 to finance the advisory services on the privatization of ENELGUI as well
as the urgent key consulting assignments such as a privatization expert, PE expert, legal
advisor and technical assistance for OBK
49.         Aconmts and Audits. DNMPPE would establish a separate account kept by
an independent accountant acceptable to IDA in accordance with accepted accouting
principles, to record all project ecpenditures and to maintain records on all commitments,
reimbursemen  and the stats of project fimds. Agreement has been obtained that an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA would audit the project account amnually in acordance
with appropriate auditing principles and in such detal as IDA may request Audit reports will
be due four months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit reports will include a separate
opinion from the auditor as to whether the disbursements made on the basis of SOEs and from
the Special Account pern    expenditures incurred for the purposes of the project.
50.           epotijng and Monitoring. DNMPPE would be required to submit
semi-annual reports on the progress of project implemeion. DNMPE will provide the
following detailed information on the pefwormance indicator of the divestiture program in the
progress report:
(a)   names of the enterprises liquidated and the situation of the liquidation
accounts;
(b)   names of the enuprises put in the tender for the privadzation and their
estimated values;
(c)   names of the enterprises privated and the realized revenues;
(d)   names of the enteprises under preparation for their privatization and their
time table;



Page 25 of 25
(e)   impact of the divestiture program on the public finances; and
(t)   numbers of employees affected by the divesdture program and the
accompanying measures taken.
51.          The Govenment and IDA would jointly carry out a mid-term review of the
project not later thm Decmber 31, 1993, to assess: (a) the progress in implemeg
development and performance objectives; (b) verify ine continued validity of the project
conception; design in the light of implementation experience and the evolving enabling
environment; and (c) commit to necessary adjustments In project objectives, design or
peformace. The review will cover inter alia: (i) achievement of the divestiture program
from the point of view of both quantity and quality; (ii) progress in the restoration of financi
discipline in the PE sector in terms of the reduction of the direct and indirect subsidies and
settlement of cross-debts; (Hi) efficiency of the coordination among CP, DNMPPE, CCEF
and the tedhical Misties; and (iv) performance of the consuiltats including technical
transfer to local staff according to the perfornce indicators. The Government (DNMPPE of
the MPF) will be responsible for the preparation of inputs required for the mid-term review.
On completion of the project, the MPF would prepare a project completion report
