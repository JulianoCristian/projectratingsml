They include: 1)\n            the services of a privatization expert; 2) consulting\n            services for the privatization or liquidation of specific\n            PEs; 3) advisory services on the legal reform program with a\n            view to fostering private sector development; and (4) the\n            services of two experts, one internationally and one\n            nationally recruited, to help the Government and the\n            targeted PEs develop the reorientation programs for\n            redundant PE employees. The second component aims at\n            reinforcing the Government's capacity to manage a\n            streamlined PE sector, in particular, to apply more rigorous\n            financial control and discipline.  Activities under this\n            component include the services of: 1) a PE reform expert; 2)\n            a legal advisor to assist with legal reform; 3) a financial\n            expert to restore financial discipline in the sector; 4) a\n            management information expert to help with the development\n            of a management information system; 5) an expert to help\n            develop a regulatory framework to the public utilities; 6)\n            studies of additional reform measures; 7) Government agency\n            staff training; and 8) logistic support."}, "docdt": "1992-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
