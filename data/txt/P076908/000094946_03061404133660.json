Operation (PRSC-3) for Burkina Faso provides an analysis of\n            the potential environmental and social impacts. The\n            government's objective is to maintain a sound\n            macroeconomic environment, and accelerate growth by\n            providing external resources for the execution of the\n            government's 2003 budget. There will be anticipated\n            impacts, and mitigating measures. The potential\n            environmental and social impacts are those resulting from\n            its sectoral coverage. The potential environmental and\n            social impacts can only be descried in generic terms. The\n            rural development operations envisaged fall under two\n            categories. The first category concerns the development of\n            actions susceptible to encourage agricultural\n            diversification. The second category of activities includes\n            those associated with the liberalization of the cotton\n            sub-sector. Diversification may improve soil fertility\n            management and reduce the need for insecticide use. The\n            activities supported under the basic health sector\n            development evolve around strategic policy reforms aimed at\n            more effective targeting of the poor for the delivery of\n            basic services, institutional strengthening and\n            decentralization of service provision, and human resource\n            strengthening. The potential environmental aspects\n            associated with the intensification of agricultural\n            production will promote conservation practices that will\n            help maintain the productive capacity of the resource base.\n            Control of pesticide related pollution, and hazards. The\n            government will support the promotion of alternative and\n            complementary ways of pest management."}, "docdt": "2003-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
