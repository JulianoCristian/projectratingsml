3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

Background

1.       Burkina Faso - a poor landlocked country of about 12 million inhabitants with a very narrow
natural resource base - had built a solid track record of reforms in the economic, and structural fronts by
early 2001 when the Bank began the preparation of a first series of PRSCs. However, the reforms had
failed to make a decisive dent on widespread poverty as Burkina remained vulnerable to exogenous shocks
such as climatic conditions and changes in world market prices for cotton, Burkina's main export goods. In
2001, GDP was about $230 per capita and Burkina Faso was ranked 159 out of 162 countries in the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index. There was little doubt that
additional focus on poverty roots and more effective public policies were needed to address the social gap.
The adoption of a full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in June 2000 provided the basis for the
Bank to step in with the PRSCs.

2.       On the macroeconomic front, Burkina Faso had been implementing since 1991 a wide range of
economic reforms under a series of stabilization and structural reform programs supported by the Bank, the
IMF and other donors. Since 1994, three programs supported by arrangements under the IMF's Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were
successfully implemented. Real GDP growth averaged 5.5 percent annually between 1994 and 2000.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, declined by -0.2 percent on average, on an annual
basis, between 1997 and 2000. After assessing Burkina Faso's debt burden and the implementation of
policy implementation since inception of the HIPC Initiative, the Executive Board's of the IMF and the
World Bank approved the completion points for the original HIPC framework in June 2000. Despite the
reduction in debt service, it was expected that Burkina Faso will depend on significant levels of foreign
financing in the medium term to implement its poverty reduction strategy and create the conditions for a
broader domestic resource base that is necessary to generate faster growth. In 2001, financial assistance
by way of grants, loans and HIPC relief represented 124 percent of government tax revenue or more than
14 percent of GDP.

3.       On the structural front,     Burkina Faso had made significant headway in its transition to a
market-oriented economy, in the areas of trade, fiscal, and public enterprise reforms as well as in civil
service reform. With regards to trade, the adoption of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) common external tariff (CET) took place in a number of stages from 1998 to January 2000.
The process involved a reduction of the maximum rate from 37 percent to 21 percent. Regarding public
finance management, the Burkinabè authorities adopted in 2000 a full medium-term expenditure framework
for 2001-2003, and they introduced program budgets in six key ministries (health, economy and finance,
territorial administration, defense, basic education, and post-basic education). By 2000, the implementation
of the first two phases of the privatization program was completed, and 41 companies were either
privatized or liquidated. A new regulatory framework was adopted for the telecommunications sector with
the creation of ARTEL (the regulatory authority) and the cellular segment of the sector was liberalized with
the issuance of two private licences. Civil service reform began in 1999 with the introduction of a
merit-based promotion mechanism.

4.       Poverty and Social Indicator Baseline (before PRSC series). Despite Burkina Faso's good
macroeconomic performance in the 1990s, two households surveys conducted in 1994 and 1998 indicated
that poverty incidence increased slightly, from 44.5 percent in 1994 to 45.3 percent in 1998, with rural
poverty accounting for 94.5 percent of national poverty. In addition, despite substantial increase in
government resources allocated for social services, commensurate progress in social and human
development had not been forthcoming and key social indicators remained substantially below the
sub-Saharan African (SSA) average. In basic education, while primary enrollment rose from 30 percent to
41 percent (35 percent for girls) between 1990 and 2000, it fell well below the SSA average of 78 percent
(71 percent for girls). As regards the health sector, little progress, if any, had been made in the 1990s for
infant and maternal mortality rates. In 2000, infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) was 105 compared
to 92 in SSA. Moreover, health outcomes in Burkina Faso remained below those in comparable
sub-Saharan African countries despite similar allocations of resources, which pointed at inefficiencies in
the use of funds, including skewed allocation of health personnel in favor of urban areas.

5.       In June 2000, Burkina Faso was the second country in SSA to prepare a full PRSP. The PRSP
identifies ineffective public sector institutions and weak governance as major constraints to growth and
equitable development in Burkina Faso, thus refocusing the role of the State and promoting good
governance were two of the main guiding principles of the PRSP. It sets the priorities and outlines the
elements of Government's approach to poverty reduction goals along four pillars: (i) accelerating
equity-based growth; (ii) ensuring that the poor have access to basic social services; (iii) expanding
opportunities for employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and (iv) promoting good
governance.

Original Objective

6.       The series of three annual programmatic credits (PRSC-1, PRSC-2, PRSC-3) was designed in
2001-2003 to support the implementation of Burkina Faso's poverty reduction strategy as set out in the
June 2000 PRSP. The PRSCs support PRSP implementation in two broad areas: public sector reform and
governance, and pro-poor sectoral policies.

l PRSC-1 focused on: (i) strengthening the link between budget allocations and sector objectives,
    strategies, and action plans; (ii) improving service delivery by the ministries of education, health and
    rural development; (iii) strengthening the fiduciary framework to promote accountability and
    transparency in the use of public funds, including external assistance; and (iv) strengthening the
    Government's capacity to track and manage public expenditure efficiently.

l PRSC-2 focused on: (i) improving the quality of the budget process in all its stages (formulation,
    execution, reporting); (ii) promoting greater stakeholder participation; (iii) improving the quality of
    PRSP monitoring and evaluation; (iv) increasing the efficiency of public interventions in the health and
    education sectors; and (v) liberalizing the cotton sector and promoting agricultural diversification.

l PRSC-3 supported the same objectives as PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, moving increasingly to more
    output-related actions and focussing on: (i) improving the management of public resources; (ii)
    strengthening basic services delivery in the social sectors; and (iii) raising rural income.

3.2 Revised Objective:

7.       The objectives of providing support to the implementation of Burkina Faso's PRSP remained the
same throughout the three annual PRSCs.

3.3 Original Components:

8.      The PRSCs have two major components: (i) public sector reform and governance, which was
considered to be a prerequisite for the effective implementation of the PRSP; and (ii) a set of pro-poor
sectoral policies and institutional changes focusing on basic education, health and rural development.

First Component: Public Sector Reform and Governance

9.      This component dealt with enhancing economic management and poverty reduction objectives by
focusing on: (i) public financial management rules (budget formulation, budget execution, budget reporting,
and establishing a satisfactory fiduciary framework covering procurement, financial management and
auditing); and (ii) reforms to improve sectoral strategies in key PRSP areas (education, health, rural
development), and improve public service delivery, monitoring and evaluation. Yearly performance
indicators, at both overall budget management and sector program execution, were to be used as milestones
for continuing dialogue between the Burkinabe authorities and its development partners.

Second Component: Pro-Poor Sectoral Policies

10.     Under this component, the PRSCs supported some of the key-reforms and the public expenditure
program necessary to implement the first phase of long-term development plans in the education, health and
rural development sectors. These sectors were identified as priority areas covered by the action plan of the
PRSP. The design of the long-term development plans benefited from high quality background analytical
work, and large consultations in the context of PRSP preparation.

11.     In the education sector, the reform program associated with the PRSCs supported the
Government's expenditure programs in education, and helped implement the following key measures:

l increase access to education in rural areas by expanding the number of schools - equipped with running
    water and separate sanitary facilities for girls - in the 20 rural provinces with the lowest coverage, by
    ensuring that schools utilize multigrade teaching where population density is too low to provide for
    separate grades, and by expanding double-shift teaching in urban areas where there is excess demand;

l lower the cost of education to poor families by continuing to provide books free of charge, ensuring
    sufficient allocations to rural schools to cover basic materials and operating costs, and making the
    payment of parent-teacher association (PTA) fees voluntary in the 20 provinces with enrollment rates
    below the national average, while increasing government allocations to those schools to compensate for
    the loss of school income;

l decentralize the hiring of teachers to the district level starting September 2001, with a starting salary
    similar to those of the community schools;

l introduce innovating teaching schemes to reduce repetition rates; and


l maintain primary education's share of total education expenditure at 60 percent in the medium term,
    while increasing education's share of total government expenditure from 21.6 percent to 23 percent in
    2003.




                                                      - 4 -

12.     In the health sector, the PRSCs supported the following measures:

l provide adequate funding in the 2001 budget to allow a continuation of quarterly disbursements to
    health districts and regional health directorates to "top off" financing from other sources (public
    budget, donors, cost recovery, etc.) to carry out their plans, maintain quarterly financial management
    and performance reports, and carry out random financial audit;

l define a strategy and elaborate a plan for institutionalizing this process, by channelling public and
    donor financing directly to health districts, building on the experience and lessons of the health and
    nutrition project;

l provide technical and financial assistance for supporting institutional reforms, including (a) securing a
    new legal status for the "Comité Directeur", that would render it a permanent structure of the Ministry
    of Health; and (b) institutionalizing a "secretariat" to the Comité Directeur, which animates the whole
    performance-based management process (a role previously undertaken by the project management unit
    of the Health and Nutrition Project;

l introduce additional performance indicators to encourage health districts to give a greater priority to
    communicable diseases control (e.g. AIDS, TB, malaria) and to better track progress in improving
    client satisfaction with the quality and cost of health care. To measure client satisfaction, support
    would be provided by incorporating health related questions into household surveys, introducing exit
    interviews at health facilities, and organizing focus group discussions and beneficiary assessments; and

l provide technical and financial support for the execution of public expenditure reviews (PERs) that
    would assess the efficiency and equity of spending in the health sector. These PERs would include
    public and private spending, at both the central and decentralized levels. Routine PERs would be
    complimented by incidence analysis to track the impact of public spending on poverty. Data from
    household surveys and expenditure reviews would provide the analytic underpinning for reassessing the
    financial burden on households, and determining the need for revising user fees and exemption policies.

13.     In the rural development sector, the PRSCs focused on the institutional reforms needed to
implement the agricultural sector's ten-year strategy aimed at creating employment and generating incomes
for the poor. In that respect, the PRSC-supported policies were articulated in four phases:

l rationalization: the first step in the reform process would be to decide which functions to retain within
    the Government, which ones to transfer to the private sector, which ones to transfer to civil society, and
    which ones to co-produce with the private sector and/or civil society;

l reorganization: the next step would be to determine the best organizational structure in order to perform
    the remaining functions more efficiently;

l retrenchment: the third step would be to work out the appropriate manpower levels consistent with the
    new mission, goals, functions and organizational structure of the Ministry; and

l revitalization: finally, it would be necessary to implement reforms and training programs in order to
    strengthen the institutional capacity of Ministry to perform its remaining functions.

3.4 Revised Components:

14.     The PRSCs series were designed and implemented as a three-year program. This enabled learning
from experience while allowing continuity. Therefore, the fine-tuning done in the PRSC components do not
constitute either substantial revisions or deviations from the original objective.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

15.     The overall quality at entry of the PRSCs is rated satisfactory based on the level of borrower
ownership and commitment to the strategic approach contained in the PRSCs, appropriateness of the
instrument, consistency with Government development objectives and the CAS, and strong donor
coordination. These elements are discussed below, and the outcomes of two favorable QAG assessment are
also presented.

Ownership

16.     The Government took the leadership of the analytical work underlying the PRSCs including
primary authorship of the PRSP and specialized technical reports. This is especially noteworthy in a
capacity-constrained environment such as in Burkina Faso.

Design

17.     As the preparation of PRSC-1 was initiated in early FY2001, the country team met to consider
operationalization of the CAS and choice of lending instruments. The advantages and possible downside
risks of an enhanced programmatic approach were carefully weighed in regard to the public sector
management agenda. The team opted for a programmatic approach, through a series of three PRSCs
geared to the annual budget cycle, on the ground that the proposed operations were well synchronized with
a government-led PRSP; and that policy actions focussing on public expenditure management enjoyed
broad consensus and were very likely to help improve the effectiveness of other Bank and donor-assisted
operations.   In addition, the strong implementation record of the Burkinabè authorities provided the
rationale for electing a series of one-tranche operation. The PRSCs were prepared annually within a rolling
three-year horizon, with the aim to support the Government's poverty reduction program. The design of the
PRSCs represented the beginning of a definite shift in the way IDA will support growth and poverty
reduction in Burkina Faso, progressively moving from specific IDA projects to broader support of
Government programs and institutional capacity to help the Burkinabè authorities manage all public
resources more efficiently.

Consistency with the CAS

18.     The PRSCs are a key element of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in
November 2000 (Report 21285-BUR). The CAS aims at assisting Burkina Faso in implementing its
Poverty Reduction Strategy adopted in June 2000. The overriding objective is to support the Government's
efforts to achieve sustained high growth rates, reduce the high incidence of poverty, and improve the
nutrition, health, and education outcomes of the rural population - the poorest segment of the population.
To refocus Bank's assistance program with a consistent emphasis on poverty reduction, the 2000 CAS
includes lending in the form of result-driven programmatic credits (PRSCs) and self-standing projects for
capacity building and infrastructure. The large place of PRSCs in the lending program marks a shift to
broader resource transfer mechanisms that are more closely integrated with the Government's own



                                                       - 6 -

budgetary allocation and execution processes. Programmatic lending represents almost 30 percent of the
Bank portfolio proposed in the 2000 CAS, up from 18 percent in the 1997 CAS. PRSCs were conceived as
primary instrument for: (i) addressing budget management and public finance management issues; (ii)
ensuring the dialogue on programs and budgetary allocations to reach the PRSP targets in the social
sectors; and (iii) covering cross-cutting growth issues involving several sectors and ministries.

Donors Coordination

19.      The PRSCs were designed in very close cooperation with development partners, fully
complementing the activities of the IMF, EU and the bilateral donors.

20.      Coordination with IMF - The effectiveness of the policy changes under the PRSCs presumes that
the macroeconomic situation remains consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic articulated in the
PRSP. Some parts of this program, especially those with significant macroeconomic implications are
incorporated in a parallel Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program supported by the IMF.
Macroeconomic stability is being addressed through a complementary PRGF from the Fund. In Public
finance management and good governance, Bank and Fund staff supported the government's reform in
the area of public finance management and good governance, including the main recommendations of the
HIPC Assessment and Action Plan prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staff. Both Bank and Fund staffs
have followed jointly the government's anti-corruption policies, including the creation of the High
Authority for the Fight against Corruption. In the cotton sector, Fund staff focused monitored the
macroeconomic impact of the secor, including on government finances and the banking sector, while Bank
staff assisted the government's structural reform agenda in the sector under a series of PRSCs with the aim
at creating a more competitive environment. The reform agenda included efforts to introduc additional
operators over time while safeguarding the historical achievements of a prudent financial management and
involvement of producer organizations in decision-making processes, including the setting of producer
prices.

21.      Coordination with other donors - The PRSCs have been part of a concerted effort from donors to
provide a larger part of assistance through programmatic support with a view to enhance ownership and
reinforce the country's capacity. In 2001, under the leadership of the EU, which committed Euro 125
million of budgetary assistance for 2002-2004, several other bilateral donors (Belgium, Denmark,
Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden) signed a memorandum of understanding to create the group for
harmonization of budget support (soutien budgétaire conjoint-SBC). The Bank and AfDB - the third
largest donor - could not formally sign this memorandum in light of the definition of disbursement
conditions: while the disbursement criteria used by the Bank and the SBC group are both fully consistent
with the PRSP approach, differences arise largely as a result of different approaches for measuring
progress in policy implementation. The Bank and the AfDB link their disbursement to measurable policy
inputs whereas the SBC group focuses on progress in PRSP outcome indicators. Initially, the dialogue
with the SBC group was difficult.

22.      Nevertheless, the Bank has put considerable efforts in reaching out to the EU and other donors. It
worked in close association to the SBC, participating in almost all meetings of this group, and coordinating
the PRSC with SBC members, and other donors present in Burkina Faso, including a cofinancing with
Belgium under PRSC-2. In particular, the PRSC team regularly exchanged views on the PRSP and
program implementation, sharing its written conclusions with the donor community. The coordination
ensured consistency of supported measures and avoided duplication of government reporting efforts. Bank
staff has sought ways to broaden the specifications of the memorandum of understanding, and the Bank is
now a full member of the SBC group since the revision of the MOU in 2004.

QAG Assessment of Quality at Entry

23.      The overall quality at entry of PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 was rated satisfactory by QAG. The thrust of
QAG assessment of the two credits is presented below. There is no QAG assessment of quality at entry for
the PRSC-3. However, the findings of previous QAG assessments were taken into account in designing the
PRSC-3 as evidenced by the inclusion of a growth agenda (issue raised during both QAG reviews of
PRSC-1 and PRSC-2) and civil service reform (to address the capacity constraints raised during the QAG
review of PRSC-2).

Quality at Entry Assessment by QAG of PRSC-1

24.      The QAG panel assessed the overall quality at entry as satisfactory. Bank processes were also
judged satisfactory. Strong aspects identified were the level of borrower ownership, the effective
arrangements with the Fund and other development partners, prior and associated assessment and diagnosis
of poverty, quality of the financial management assessment -expertly performed and documented-,
arrangements spelled out to initiate M&E, effectiveness of quality assurance and review process. Areas
needing improvement were the following: (i) the assessment of risks to sustained higher growth necessary to
make significant inroad on poverty reduction needed to be more thoughtful, candid, and realistic; (ii) more
aggressive actions up-front on public procurement were needed; and (iii) more explicit weighing on the
specific choice of program instrument was necessary.

25.      The achievement of the four highest priority development objectives (poverty alleviation; structural
and sector policy reform; human development; and macroeconomic management) were viewed as likely,
albeit in a somewhat restricted way. For the QAG panel, the contributions of PRSC-1 to poverty reduction
and, to a lesser degree, human development, were limited to enabling actions - though even in the first year,
the Government of Burkina Faso program encompassed expanded coverage of HD services. The panel
viewed the matrix of actions (in the areas of budget formulation, execution and reporting; and improved
management of public funds for basic education, health and rural development) as important and necessary
measures that represent essential steps by the Government of Burkina Faso on a reasonable path to
progress in those areas. Judged as enabling measures, these were both significant and likely to be achieved.
Notwithstanding the risks presented, the panel agreed that on balance the operation's results were likely to
be sustained. The panel noted that the reform program underpinning the credit benefited from a quite solid
body of Bank AAA and related work by other agencies conducted over a period of several years.

Quality at Entry Assessment by QAG of PRSC-2

26.      The QAG panel rated the overall quality at entry satisfactory. The strategic relevance and
approach dimension were rated highly satisfactory. The risk assessment dimension was rated marginally
satisfactory and all other dimensions were rated satisfactory. Bank processes were also rated satisfactory.
The strong features of PRSC-2 identified by the QAG panel included the alignment with the PRSP and the
CAS, the inclusion in its design of lessons drawn from the satisfactory implementation of the PRSC-1
program, strong participation by the client in all aspects of PRSC-2 preparation, reflecting good ownership,
and good collaboration with IMF and other donors. Areas needing improvement included the justification
for basing PRSC-2 only on improved efficiency of public expenditures (improving the public financial
management systems and improved pro-poor expenditure allocations within key sectors, to achieve better
public services delivery), largely excluding other issues which may be significant for poverty reduction,
such as general growth and competitiveness. The panel would also have liked greater elaboration of issues
which may constitute a major risk to overall growth and poverty reduction, such as regional differences


                                                     - 8 -

within the country. The panel felt the risk assessment was rather general in nature and did not discuss
specific risks or risks mitigation measures related to PRSC-2. The operation also appeared somewhat weak
on capacity building issues in line ministries given that improved service delivery is a key objective of the
operation. Lastly, the QAG panel felt there were too many triggers, which is inconsistent with the concept
of moving to "fewer and better" conditions or benchmarks in Bank operations.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

27.      The overall outcome of the PRSCs program is assessed as satisfactory because most of the
targeted outcomes under the program were reached, reflecting an outstanding record of policy
implementation.      In addition, findings of a Poverty Assessment prepared by the Bank (report no
29743-BUR) point to a decline in poverty incidence between 1998 and 2003. Outcomes under the PRSCs,
including poverty trend, are discussed below.

Key outcomes achieved under the PRSCs

28.      Table 1 below provides a comprehensive view of outcomes expected under the first series of
PRSCs, and the results achieved at the end of PRSC-3 in 2003. Results are significant as all outcome
indicators but farm mechanization rate were achieved. Nevertheless, some of the impact of the reforms
under the PRSCs were smaller than the results framework had originally envisaged, reflecting the lag in
translating certain policy outcomes into impact. A summary of results in table 1 is as follows:

   l Burkina Faso has maintained a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation and strong
         growth. With the exception of 2001 (when the 2000 drought drove up the prices of cereals)
         inflation stayed below 3 percent. Growth reached a commendable 6.0 percent on average in
         2001-2003 despite different challenges such as the political crisis in Côte d'Ivoire which has been
         unabated since late 2002.

   l Budget management and procurement regulations have been strengthened significantly in
         2000-2003. The share of budget to the most decentralized departments has continuously increased
         although execution rate by the Ministry of education has been poor and needs improvement. The
         gap between unit prices of products obtained by public bidding and those obtained by the private
         sector has been reduced.

   l Gross primary enrollment rates increased from 41.7 percent in 1999-2000 to 52.3 percent in
         2003-2004 overall, and from 36.2 percent to 46.0 percent for girls. In the 20 most disadvantaged
         provinces, enrollment increased from 27.8 percent to 36.2 percent.

   l Vaccination rates and health center frequentation increased in line with targets, reflecting the
         success of the vaccination campaign and the price reductions for medication and care.

   l Following favorable climatic conditions, cereal production increased by more than 15 percent in
         2000. However, mechanization rates remain low, and improvement on agricultural productivity
         (except for corn output), diversification and rural incomes has been limited thus far, reflecting the
         considerable lag between policy actions, changes to economic incentives, and measurable changes
         in agricultural production and output.

Poverty Trend between 1998 and 2003

29.      Measuring changes in poverty is subject to data quality issues. Over time, the National Institute of
Statistics and Demography (INSD) has improved the data collection process, but also made changes to
survey design that have reduced the comparability of different surveys, thus the need to construct a
comparable measure for household welfare to best assess changes in poverty. In the context of the Poverty
Assessment, such comparable welfare indicator was constructed for 1998 and 2003 since the effects of
changes in survey design can be clearly identified and largely eliminated. The resulting consumption
measure for households contains equally measured items from the 1998 and 2003 surveys by excluding a
limited number of items measured differently in both surveys. A consistent set of monthly price data is
applied to household consumption items to eliminate the effect of prices changes over time and space.

30.      On the basis of the comparable welfare indicator, Burkina Faso experienced substantial reduction
in poverty, without significant changes in inequality, between 1998 and 2003 (Table 2). The poverty
headcount went down from an estimated 54.6 percent in 1998 to 46.4 percent in 2003, and both the poverty
gap and its severity declined. The findings as regards the variation in poverty hold for a broad range of
plausible poverty lines as indicated by the outcomes of first order stochastic dominance tests. The reduction
in poverty was more pronounced in rural areas, where the headcount fell from 61.1 percent in 1998 to 52.4
percent in 2003. The reduction of poverty in urban areas was substantially smaller, and not statistically

significant. Rural poverty declined more rapidly than urban poverty given the large increase in cereal and
cotton production since 1998, which was a year of a severe drought. Inequality remained unchanged
between the two surveys (Gini Index of 0.444), and was systematically higher in urban (0.484) than in
rural areas (0.376).

percentage distance of the expenditure of the poor from the poverty line. The square poverty
gap or poverty severity measures the average squared percentage distance of the poor from the poverty line.


4.2 Outputs by components:

31.      As stated above, the policy implementation record under the PRSCs has been excellent as reported
in table 3 below. All prior actions for PRSC-1 had been taken. All but one of the triggers for PRSC-2 were
fulfilled at the time of Board presentation. The completion of the participatory poverty assessment - the
trigger that was not met - was delayed by lack of funding. The survey was later undertaken with funding
from the national budget and from UNDP. All but one of the triggers for PRSC-3 were met fully or in large
part at the time of Board presentation. The single trigger that was not met had to be postponed to a later
date to allow a close alignment with other donors supporting the government in designing personnel
incentives in the health sector, and to assess the budget implications of the measure. A detailed account of
specific measures undertaken under PRSC-3 is presented in Annex 1. A summary of the key measures
implemented under the series of PRSCs is presented in table 3 below, followed by a discussion on the
relative performance of the health and education within the PRSC framework.

Public Sector Reform and Governance

32.      Under this component, a variety of important policy reforms have been undertaken, which resulted
in improvements in budget formulation, execution, and control, and laid the groundwork for the
deconcentration and decentralization of public services. In addition to public expenditure reforms, the
government reinforced governance aspects by establishing a High Authority for the Coordination of the
Fight against Corruption in 2002 that became operational in 2003. The main accomplishments, inter-alia,
have been the following:



                                                       - 12 -

l Budget formulation, to ensure a close link between the budget and PRSP objectives. Significant
  progress was made in mastering the preparation of global MTEFs. Their full integration into the
  budget preparation cycle in 2002-03 led to increasing realism of revenue targets and improved the
  budget arbitration. Moreover, program budgets linking PRSP objectives with budget allocations
  were established in all key ministries. Budget formulation in several sectors (education, health,
  infrastructure, rural development) also benefited from public expenditure reviews, which have been
  piloted since 2003 by a PER supervision committee.

l Budget execution, to make service delivery more effective. Burkina Faso fully operationalized a
  computerized expenditure management system in 1999-2000. The system captures all domestically
  financed expenditure at the different stages of the expenditure process (engagement, liquidation,
  mandatement, paiement) and allows to closely monitor the execution of the budget and the level of
  payment obligations. Moreover, the legal framework was created to delegate credits to regions and
  provinces and to deconcentrate the issuance of payment orders in order to accelerate delivery of
  basic services. Since 2003, a pilot extension of the expenditure system to the second-largest city,
  Bobo-Dioulasso, has been effective. Execution rates for social sector budget stayed high.
  Nonetheless, the size of deconcentrated budgets in health and the execution rates in the education
  sector could be improved further.

l Procurement, to improve efficiency of public expenditure. Roles for the different ministerial
  departments were clarified by the government. A new procurement code was adopted in May 2003,
  new procurement manuals and forms were drafted, and a capacity building plan was drawn up.
  Nonetheless, additional reductions in the time needed to issue payment orders and of the unit prices
  of publicly procured goods are desirable.

l Budget reporting and good governance, to ensure efficiency of spending and fight corruption.
  The government caught up with its legal obligation to submit budget execution reports to the audit
  court for the years 1996-2001. To strengthen external controls, an independent Supreme Audit
  Court was created and made fully operational in 2002. The National Assembly also adopted a new
  law regulating budget laws in 2003, aligning national law with the WAEMU directive. Moreover,
  the CFAA was finalized and its recommendations were integrated into the new budget management
  reform plan (Plan d'action pour le renforcement de la gestion budgétaire or PRGB) adopted in
  July 2002. A good governance plan was prepared and a High Authority for the Fight Against
  Corruption was created in 2002 and staffed in 2003.

l Civil service reform and decentralization, to improve service delivery. The development of the
  computerized civil service payroll and salary management system (SIGASPE) was finalized. The
  government instituted a new personnel management system based on mission letters and
  performance reviews. The framework for the role and attribution of governors was adopted to
  implement the decentralization laws.

l Policy monitoring and evaluation, to ensure that policies are well targeted. A new list of PRSP
  monitoring indicators was prepared in 2002 to expand the list of indicators in the second annual
  PRSP progress report. A participatory poverty assessment and a new household survey were
  conducted in 2003.

 33.     In preparing for the roll-out of the PDDEB - the ten-year plan for the education sector - a number
of measures laid the groundwork to achieve a significant increase in supply of education services at
sustainable expenditure levels. These measures include the end of automatic hiring of graduates of teacher
training colleges (ENEP) into the civil service and the preparation of delegation of human resource
management decisions to the regional level. The government continued the preferences in terms of school
supplies for the 20 provinces with the lowest enrollment rates, increased the number of schools with
sanitary facilities, and provided sufficient financing for the expansion of the education sector through the
national budget. According to the latest available tracking survey, the estimated average cost of education
per child increased 5.4 percent in 2002 but remains below the level in 2000. Admission rates in 2003
exceeded 60 percent. According to the household survey, literacy rates increased from 18.4 to 21.8
percent between 1998 and 2003.

34.      However, according to the recent Bank public expenditure review challenges remain in increasing
quality and retention. Firstly, resource allocation in favor of the education sector can be increased even
further in line with other African countries. Secondly, as a result of high repetition rates (exceeding 15
percent), unit costs in primary education remain high: 0.24 times per capita GDP compared with 0.15 times
on average for French-speaking African countries. Thirdly, in rural areas, the proportion of families not
registering their children for school increases from the least poor deciles to the poorest. Fourthly, the
retention rate is low (60 percent compared with 67 percent on average for the French-speaking African
countries); the rate is only 49 percent in rural areas and 41 percent for girls in those areas.

Health

    l A new national health development strategy was adopted in 2001 guiding the health sector
          policies. A vaccination campaign was successfully implemented. Prices of essential generic drugs
          were reduced through a reduction of the profit margins of the National Drug Procurement and
          Distribution Company (CAMEG) in 2002, and tracking surveys conducted as part of the PRSP
          process indicate that the measure resulted in a 15-30 percent decline of the cost of standard
          medical interventions. A list of prices for key medical services and 3 pediatric drugs was
          published in 2003. The government also hired additional health staff to increase staffing levels in
          health centers. Moreover, to increase funds on the health district level, 66 petty cash accounts (
          régies d'avance) were created in 2003.

    l Infant mortality rates declined from 105 to 83 of 1000 live births, in line with PRSP objectives,
          and is now in line with SSA averages. However juvenile mortality (a small decline from 127 to
          111 per 1000 live births) remains high, as does child malnutrition, which affects more than
          one-third of all children suffer from malnutrition. HIV-AIDS is another area of concern, with
          Burkina Faso showing among the highest sero-prevalence in West Africa. However recent surveys
          (which are not necessarily fully comparable to previous surveys) show a decline in the
          sero-prevalence rate estimated for the population as a whole.

Rural development and Environment

35.      A strategy for the opening of the cotton sector was prepared. As a first step, the legal monopoly of
SOFITEX was removed and an action plan for the opening of the sector for private investors was

established. Bidding documents for two zones representing about 15 percent of total production were
prepared and technical pre-qualification procedures were launched in 2003. Several studies for the
diversification of crops were also undertaken and numerous measures to increase agricultural productivity
and access to financing have been taken (rural roads were built, selected financing was made available). A
national plan for training in environmental issues was adopted and the different role of actors in this area
was clarified. Environmental safeguard procedures were disseminated and joint ministerial instructions
were issued on the application of environmental assessments. Cereal production increased substantially
following abundant rainfalls in 2003. Rainfall patterns remain the predominant determinant of agricultural
output. Raising effectiveness of rural development spending to increase the benefits of growth for the rural
population remain one of the key challenges for attaining the income-poverty MDG.

  A Tale of two Sectors: PRSCs sectoral linkages and relative performance in the health and
  education sectors

36.      In 2001, the Bank closed its two health projects and elected the PRSC as the main vehicle for
policy dialogue and financial support in the health sector. In the education sector, the Bank elected to
continue its financial support and policy dialogue through a Sectoral Investment Program in coordination
with several other donors while selecting few critical policy measures, such as lowering education costs for
girls and for disadvantaged areas, to be supported under the PRSCs.

Health sector

37.      Health sector performance under the PRSC is satisfactory, although uneven by components. Credit
should be given to the PRSCs for free vaccination, free prenatal care and increased accessibility to drugs.
However, in the area of Human Resources, the Bank waived a trigger (PRSC-3) on personal management
and incentives reform that could have helped to entice health personnel to work in rural and poor areas. The


                                                                - 16 -

measure was delayed because of lack of financing, but some progress has been noted in that area more
recently. As noted above, progress under budget reform was slow and the MTEF is one year behind
schedule.

38.      There was also an initial drop in resources allocated to the health districts following the closing of
the Bank project that was transferring resources directly to the health districts. Under the PRSC
framework, the Government established crédits délégués to be transferred to the health districts, but
initially they were timely delivered, and resources available to health districts declined in normal terms
through 2001 from their pick in 1999. A first reason for that unfortunate development is that budget
support, including the first series of PRSCs, was not well aligned with the budget cycle. A second reason is
linked to the introduction of the régie d'avance, a special budget procedure that allows the release of
limited resources in advance of certain specific categories of expenditures, and obeying to restrictive
replenishment rules. In the normal budget procedure, resources are released only after goods are delivered
and services are rendered. For health districts managers, the procedure was a convenient way to get the
credits délégués faster than under the normal procedures. Not surprisingly, a backlog of irregular régie
d'avance (mostly because of ineligible expenditures) quickly prompted the Ministry of Finances to suspend
this facility. However, recent developments are positive: crédits délégués now arrive earlier, and grow
faster than the general budget. Health districts financing doubled between 2001 and 2003 due to the
addition of PPTE funds

39.      Overall, there is a strong sense that the health sector went through a J-curve in the transition from
project financing to budgetary financing. Although some would have preferred that the transition be
delayed until a MTEF is available (it is only under PRSC-5 that such budget framework is being finalized
for the health sector), there is a view that these changes could only have occured under the impetus of the
PRSCs. As evidenced in section 4.1 and table 1 above, health outputs and outcomes are improving,
although the credit may not go entirely to the PRSCs. The lessons section of the ICR includes valuable
recommendations on improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue.

Education

40.      In the education sector, the Bank did not phase out its project financing with the introduction of
PRSC. Instead, the latter was a complementary instrument to an existing Sectoral Investment Program
(SIP), promoting a selective set of reforms aiming at reducing education costs and increasing enrollment in
provinces with lowest schooling levels and for girls. As indicated earlier, the policy implementation record
under the PRSC was strong in the education sector, with significant outcomes detailed in table 1.

41.      However, there are concerns with the implementation of the SIP, notably the low disbursement
rate, high transaction costs, and donors coordination issues. These concerns have led to recent attempts to
restructure the operation, and introduce a common pool of resources with national disbursement
procedures. Transitions to full budgetary support have been also considered. At the time of this ICR, the
changes to be introduced by the Government and its donors are still unclear. However, the basic education
sector could build on a relatively successful decentralization reform: the level of resources allocated to local
districts is 70 percent against 40 percent for the health sector. This is mainly due to the high rate of
execution of the domestically-financed share of the budget, as a result of the delegation to decentralized
units of a portion of operating credits.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

42.      The PRSCs have had a substantial institutional development impact. The government notes in
particular the impact of the PRSC dialogue on prioritizing PRSP-related activities and improving the
overall monitoring of PRSP implementation. There were a number of measures implemented that have a
direct institutional impact on budget management and governance: (i) to strengthen external controls, an
independent Supreme Audit Court was created and made fully operational in 2002; (ii) a good governance
plan was prepared and a High Authority for the Fight Against Corruption was created in 2002 and staffed
in 2003; (iii) the development of the computerized civil service payroll and salary management system
(SIGASPE) was finalized and personnel records brought up to date; (iv) the government instituted a new
personnel management system based on mission letters and performance reviews; and (v) the framework
for the role and attribution of governors was adopted to implement the decentralization laws. In the rural
sector, the legal monopoly of SOFITEX was removed and an action plan for the opening of the sector for
private investors was established and implemented.

43.      Although the implementation of the PRSP has increased the overall result focus of the
government's activities, the weakest aspect of Burkina's institutional framework is the capacity of the
administration to formulate, execute, and monitor programs. The split of the Ministry of Finance and
Economy in a financial (Finance) and planning (Economy) part, has also weakened the coordination of the
PRSP with the budget. The Bank is preparing capacity building operation that will make available
additional resources specifically for deepening the reforms in five key ministries (Health, Decentralization,
Finances and Budget, Civil service, Economy and Development) with the objective to provide more
targeted support for capacity building on the basis of demand expressed by these ministries.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

44.      The implementation of the program supported by the PRSCs was adversely affected by external
shocks, notably deteriorating terms of trade and regional instability. In 2001, the Government was still
coping with the legacy of severe external shocks which hit Burkina Faso in 2000. Real GDP growth for
2000 was 2.2 percent, compared with 5.7 percent on average during 1995-99. Economic growth
decelerated in 2000 because of adverse weather conditions (which resulted in a smaller cotton crop);
exogenous shocks (including the increase in oil prices and the appreciation of the US dollar); and the
deterioration of the political situation in Cote d'Ivoire (where 3 million Burkinabè reside), a factor that
significantly reduced worker's remittances. The latter two adverse external shocks were estimated at around
2.5 percent of GDP. In addition, the implementation of the CET in 2000 cost Burkina Faso revenue
roughly equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2000. The 2001 budget was designed to regularize the
Government's balance sheet - reducing domestic arrears and improving its position with the banking
system, in conformity with PRGF program targets.

45.      In executing the 2002 budget, the Government also faced unexpected spending needs related to
rising oil prices and higher subsidies for electricity fuels and butane gas. Moreover, with the onset of the
Ivoirian crisis, substantial unplanned expenditure for security purposes and humanitarian aid, estimated at



                                                     - 18 -

more than 0.5 percent of GDP, used up budgetary allocations for materials and services and forced the
government to postpone the payment of the second and third quarter utility bills. These bills were settled in
2003.

46.      PRSC-3 was also subject to major external events as a new crisis broke out again on September
19, 2002 in Cote d'Ivoire. As a result, more than 300,000 people of Burkinabè origin returned to Burkina
Faso and the main trade corridor through the Abidjan harbor was closed. Due to determined government
actions -- including: (i) the removal of the (implicit) monopoly for Burkinabè truckers to transport
Burkinabè cotton; (ii) maintaining of cotton fertilizer prices by subsidizing the higher transport costs; (iii)
the repair and construction of roads facilitating the use of Ghanaian and Beninese harbors and opening of
new trade corridors and customs posts; and (iv) identification and support to refugees at the borders
[operation bayiri] -- the government mitigated a major impact on the economy.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

47.      The government was generally in control of the speed of implementation of reforms, notably in the
cotton sector, health, education, and public finance management. Although delays in completing studies or
technical assistance work at times slowed down implementation of these reforms, they often reflected weak
capacity and/or the fact that government agencies were overloaded with a multitude of donor programs. In
some areas, delays in implementing reforms reflected resistance by vested interests and the need for a
longer time to build consensus within the government. In these cases, PRSCs generally were flexible
enough to readjust the process to a speed in line with the government's implementation and
consensus-building capacity.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

48.      Several ministries and Government agencies were responsible for implementing the reform program
under the PRSCs. The Permanent Secretariat for the Supervision of Financial Policies and Programs
(SP-PPF) at the Ministry of Finance and Budget coordinated the contributions of all ministries and public
agencies. SP-PPF did generally very well in mobilizing those contributions, although a deeper and earlier
exchange of line ministries with SP-PPF would have helped at time to avoid delays in coordinating sectoral
activities under the PRSCs.

5.4 Costs and financing:

49.      The first series of three PRSCs were financed by a total of US$130 million against US$120
envisaged under the CAS. Financing under PRSC-3 was increased by $10 million to US$50 million to
accommodate the additional financing needs following the Ivorian crisis laid out under 5.1. The increase
was necessary to protect the attainment of key PRSP and PRSCs objectives. PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 were
financed by IDA credits of US$45 million and US$35 million, respectively. PRSC-3 was financed by an
IDA grant for debt vulnerable countries because of its poverty focus, the close monitoring of outcomes
under the PRSP process, and the positive impact on Burkina's debt profile.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

50.      The sustainability of the PRSCs is rated as likely. The Government has strongly endorsed the
PRSCs as an effective instrument for direct budget support for PRSP implementation, as evidenced by a
remarkable policy implementation record. Within the PRSC framework several institutional changes,



                                                    - 19 -

including the introduction of a PRSP and results-focused dialogue between Bank, Ministry of Finance, and
sectoral ministries, have occurred. These represent strong ingredients for sustaining the results achieved
under the first PRSC series, notably stable growth and improvements in key social indicators. The Bank
and the Government are in agreement to continue the PRSC program with a new series of three operations,
building on the achievements and lessons learnt so far. In particular, the new series will be realigned with
the revised PRSP and focus to a larger attempt on growth bottlenecks than the first three operations to start
making progress on domestic resource constraints. Moreover, to effectively build on the achievements in
the social sectors, future operations will draw on sectoral planning tools (MTEFs) developed under
[PRSC-2 and PRSC-3] to further improve the alignment of spending with objectives. Fiscal reforms will
seek to accelerate and deconcentrate spending further, and to make additional headway on transparency.
Furthermore, the government will focus additional attention on administrative capacity to design,
implement and monitor programs. It has also taken the leadership for further harmonization of budget
support among donors to reduce transaction costs and free up administrative resources. The Bank is
making an effort to maintain the regular disbursement cycle to make funds available in a predictable
manner at the beginning of the budget year. The Bank is also preparing a capacity building project - for
appraisal in FY05 - to improve the delivery of public services.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

51.     PRSC as direct budget financing are fully integrated with regular budgetary operations, that is the
country's budgetary planning and execution systems. All the actions taken under the PRSC are part of the
government's regular program of PRSP activities. The issue of transition to "regular" operations therefore
does not arise.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

52.     Bank lending performance is rated highly satisfactory. The identification and design of the PRSCs
built on the CAS as well as the overall program outlined in Burkina Faso's poverty reduction strategy. The
reform program underpinning the PRSCs is based on a solid body analytical work and related work by
Government and other aid agencies. Lessons learned from previous PRSCs were factored in the design of
subsequent PRSCs. The Bank team worked closely with the government and with other donors, as
documented in the program documents, during preparation and appraisal of the operations and exchanged
regularly with the IMF team, including through joint mission work. PRSC-3 appropriately included a
specification of future program measures (PRSC-4 triggers) to lay out future Bank collaboration under
PRSCs but did not specify a new three-year program to align the new series fully with the revised PRSP
and give sufficient space for donor harmonization..

53.     The concept reviews for each PRSCs gave guidance on contents and focused the operations on key
measures to be achieved before appraisal. The focus that was reaffirmed and tightened further on key
measures crucial for the success of the operations during the regional operations committee meetings. The
planned Operations Committee meeting on PRSC-3 was cancelled after a decision of the Managing
Director that no major issues arose from the comments provided prior to the meeting and the operations
committee's decision note authorized appraisal and negotiation. Appraisals appropriately assessed and
confirmed the implementation of key reform measures and recognized the most likely risks. The findings of
two QAG panel for quality at entry were also instrumental in enhancing the impact of the PRSCs.

54.     The changes in PRSCs leadership were adequately addressed and did not disrupt team continuity.


                                                   - 20 -

The team leader for PRSC-2 was part of the appraisal and negotiation team of PRSC-1. The preparation of
PRSC-3 also benefited from the fact that the country economist taking over the operation had been part of
the negotiating team for PRSC-2, and thus was familiar with the contents of the previous operation as well
as the triggers set for PRSC-3. Team continuity also benefited from a strong and stable Bank office in
Ouagadougou, including a locally based economist who played an active role in the three operations.The
placement of a health expert in Ouagadougou in January 2003 helped the preparation of PRSC-3.

55.      In May 2002, members of the PRSC team met for two and a half days for a Mulitsectoral Team
Learning Retreat in Tenkodogo (Burkina Faso). The retreat was to develop a common vision and
understanding of the PRSC for Burkina Faso, discuss ways in which to work and learn together and
develop a work plan for the medium term. Participants in the retreat developed jointly a draft team charter
with team roles and responsibilities as well as behavioral norms.

Environmental Assessment and Safeguard Policy

56.      The Bank and the Borrower worked closely to review the Borrower readiness for addressing
potential environmental impacts of the PRSCs programs, and devise ways to strengthen the Borrower's
capacity to address environmental safeguard issues. PRSC-1 was classified as a structural adjustment
credit and, accordingly, the appraisal mission reviewed Burkina Faso's environmental policies and practices
to confirm that there were no negative linkages between the reforms proposed under PRSC-1 and
environmental outcomes as well as identifying priority measures that can be supported by future PRSCs.
As for PRSC-2, PRSC-3 was classified as a sectoral adjustment credit (SECAC) at a meeting convened by
the Bank-wide PRSC Working Group, based on its sectoral coverage (including rural development and
health) and the Interim Guidelines for PRSCs of May, 2001. In accordance with OP 4.01 `Environmental
Assessment', both operations were categorized as a B without a separate Environmental Assessment. An
environmental analysis consistent with the requirements of OD 8.60 and OP 4.01 was undertaken for the
two operations and annexed to the Program Documents. In accordance with the Bank's revised disclosure
policy, the environmental analyses were disclosed through the World Bank InfoShop, and in Burkina Faso
prior to the appraisal of the two credits.

7.2 Supervision:

57.      Bank supervision performance is rated satisfactory. Supervision of progress under a given PRSC
took place jointly with the preparation of the follow-on operation, and the monitoring of PRSP
implementation in general. As an illustration, progress under PRSC-3 was supervised through the
monitoring of implementation of PRSC-4 measures through several supervision missions in July 2003,
November 2003, and March 2004. The supervision of the PRSCs drew on the M&E mechanisms put in
place by the authorities for the broader PRSP, including annual progress report on the implementation of
the PRSP (PRSP-PR) and related IMF-Bank Joint Staff Assessment (JSA). During supervision activities,
Bank staff coordinated closely with IMF mission and other donors. The Bank joined the IMF in carrying
out biannual reviews of the macroeconomic framework and structural reform program. The preparation of
selected analytical work, including a Public Expenditure Review (completed in June 2004) and a Poverty
Assessment (completed in July 2004) was also an integral part of measuring progress in the implementation
of the PRSP and the effectiveness of PRSC support.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

58.      Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

59.      Government's contribution to the preparation of the PRSCs starts with the finalization of the June
2000 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). In reviewing the PRSP (IDA/SecM2000-313), IMF and
Bank staffs concluded it presents clear objectives, which are set within a coherent program of poverty
reduction, and is grounded in a sound assessment of poverty characteristics and trends in Burkina Faso.
The preparation of the PRSP involved numerous participatory events and processes. Stakeholders such as
Ministers, civil servants, parliamentarians, civil society groups, representatives of the media, and donors
have had opportunities to contribute to the analytical building blocks of the PRSP, including discussions
and decisions on sectoral strategies, the study of growth and competitiveness and public expenditure
reviews. The strategy set out in the June PRSP is consistent with Burkina Faso's macroeconomic,
structural, and social policies. The Government is also committed to regular monitoring and updating of its
poverty strategy, as evidenced by the annual preparation of PRSP progress report. The high quality of the
PRSP provided a solid basis for the preparation of the PRSCs.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

60.      The borrower was fully committed to the PRSC-supported program measures, as evidenced by a
solid track record of policy implementation. The government response to the exogenous shock arising from
the Ivorian crisis was exemplary. Despite severe disruptions of trade and reflow of population to Burkina
Faso, key macroeconomic targets were observed, and the program was implemented smoothly.

61.      All prior actions for PRSC-1 had been taken. All but one of the triggers for PRSC-2 were fulfilled
at the time of Board presentation. The completion of the participatory poverty assessment - delayed by lack
of funding - was undertaken in 2003 with funding from the national budget and from UNDP. All PRSC-3
triggers except for one were implemented fully or in substantial parts. The trigger that could not be
implemented at all was related to the definition of an incentive scheme for government health personnel and
could not be implemented owing to the late completion of two studies looking at that issue. To date, despite
the completion of the studies, this measure is still under discussion because the government is concerned
about the overall impact on civil service remuneration and is looking for a more comprehensive way of
improving incentives for civil service staff in remote areas.

62.      Some small delays were also encountered in the sale of two cotton zones to private investors. These
were partially related to the need for consultations on the appropriate price setting mechanisms for cotton
after the sale and the need to conduct environmental audits before launching financial bids. By the time
PRSC-3 was negotiated in June 2003, the government launched the technical bidding process. By
mid-2004, the financial bidding process had been concluded and the two zones were transferred to private
investors in August 2004.

63.      The overall implementation of the procurement reforms was slower than anticipated. As a result of
late communication of Bank comments on a new procurement decree under PRSC-2, a decree
unsatisfactory to the Bank was adopted in 2002. During the preparation of PRSC-3 an intense dialogue
between the government and the Bank resulted in revisions to the decree, and a new decree was adopted in
May 2003. As a result, the implementation of the new decree, including the adoption of standard texts and
manuals, only took place in late 2003 and early 2004, after PRSC-3 was already approved. The planned
verification of procurement contracts through and external audit was dropped from PRSC-3 since the EU



                                                    - 22 -

offer to finance the audit and contracting procedures outside the control of the government delayed the
launching of the audit process. The audit was eventually conducted in the beginning of 2004.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

64.     The permanent secretary of the permanent secretariat for the supervision of financial programs and
policies (SP-PPF) at the Ministry of Finances and Budget was closely involved with all relevant
government agencies and departments in the definition of the timebound action plan to implement the
triggers agreed before PRSC negotiations. The SP-PPF gradually developed into an effective coordinating
and monitoring agency of PRSCs implementation progress. Implementing agencies in different ministries
were generally effective.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

65.     Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned


66.     The PRSC series has greatly reinforced the importance of the budget and the country's own
capacity for the success of government policies. The PRSCs have steadily strengthened the focus on the
budget as the main instrument for PRSP implementation and have clarified the government's own role in
defining a programmatic agenda to achieve its objectives. The importance of the MTEF in formulating the
government's budget has grown substantially. Moreover, expenditure systems were expanded and controls
were reinforced. In the social sectors, the PRSCs have resulted in a process of reorientation to program
budgets as tools to translate priorities expressed in long-term sectoral programs into budgetary allocations.
However, a further reinforcement of capacity is necessary to underpin this process and ensure that program
budgets are closely aligned with the executed administrative budget and fully integrated in the evaluation
and monitoring mechanism of each ministry's planning department.

67.     PRSCs also successfully supported a number of cross-cutting reforms. These reforms included the
application of deconcentration policies in budget and personnel management, which are part of the policies
to improve social service delivery. In the cotton sector, the opening of two zones for private investors
involved several ministerial departments in setting up the new regulatory framework and defining the roles
of the new and old stakeholders. Despite these achievements, a number of challenges remain for the
PRSCs.

68.     Stimulating growth. The PRSC series has addressed issues regarding service delivery and public
sector performance. However, Burkina Faso faces difficulties in attracting private investment as a result of
low skill levels and high costs of production factors. The growth agenda of the PRSP should therefore be
an additional important area for support under future PRSCs as well as for the Country Assistance
Strategy.

69.     Improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue. There is currently no specific sectoral
investment operation in the health sector (except for the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS disaster response project)
and initially the ownership of the PRSC-supported reform program by the Ministry of Health was weak.
The transition from project to programmatic support was difficult because of the required changes in
instruments and the new focus on the budget. The Bank's PRSC team, with the health experts taking the
lead, should attempt to advance the dialogue through greater involvement in health sector budget



                                                     - 23 -

discussions, in particular the design of program budgets.

70.      Aligning budget support with the budget cycle. The time necessary for policy implementation
and complicated government credit approval procedures have thus far hampered the alignment of PRSCs
with the budget cycle. The implementation of reform measures under the first PRSCs took about 12 months
and all PRSCs have been approved in the months of July-August. As a result of onerous approval
procedures on the side of the government, PRSCs were often not disbursed until October-November,
toward the end of the government's budget year. Bank resources have hence not been able to alleviate the
beginning-of-year cash shortages that are constraining investment spending. In order to align PRSCs more
closely with the budget cycle, it is proposed that subsequent PRSCs follow a timetable close to the budget
cycle so as to align PRSCs with the budget cycle and PRSP implementation, which both follow the
calendar year. Consequently, PRSC-4 was approved in May 2004 and disbursed in July 2004.

71.      Reinforcing capacity. The capacity of the administration to formulate and execute programs
remains weak. The preparation and implementation of program budgets can only advance further if the
capacity of the civil service is improved. In this respect, the Bank has prepared a PER in fiscal year 2004
to give guidance for further improvements in the budget process, especially as regards integrating the
budget and PRSP processes and objectives. In the area of public sector management, the Bank is currently
preparing a capacity building project for presentation in fiscal year 2004 to accompany and complement
future PRSCs, with preparatory work already being financed under a Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) grant. Over time, the project aims at giving technical assistance for capacity
assessment, establishing a work program, streamlining public administration, modernizing personnel
management, strengthening of poverty focus of expenditure, and strengthening policy formulation. In the
statistical area, the Bank finances a statistical capacity building credit (STATCAP).

72.      Improving the link between policy actions and the monitoring and evaluation framework. The
link between PRSC measures and the PRSP impact indicators is at times tenuous as a result of certain
weaknesses of the 2000 PRSP, which did not include a matrix of policy actions and only contained a
narrow set of indicators. The government has already undertaken a substantial body of work as part of the
UNDP-financed Poverty Observatory (ONAPAD) to improve its set of PRSP indicators. ONAPAD's
enhanced indicator list was discussed with the donor community and was a first step for establishing the
monitoring framework of the revised PRSP. In developing the revised PRSP, the government has closer
integrated objectives with government policies by preparing a matrix of costed policy actions and
intermediate outputs that are linked with PRSP outcome and impact indicators. Future PRSCs will draw on
this work. The forthcoming capacity building project will give the means to reinforce the capacity of
planning directorates (DEP) to evaluate policy outcomes and make more effective use of available poverty
statistics and result indicators under the PRSP process.

73.      Staying the course. The move from project-aid to budgetary support is a major transition. It is
important to recognize the magnitude of these changes and time should be given to Government and donors
to reach the top of the learning curve. Budget support undoubtedly constitutes a desirable mode of external
assistance, but patience is required as the necessary adjustments are being made for greater effectiveness.
Government should increase accountability and transparency in public resources management. Donors
must also accept that the Government in the driver seat, which implies a necessary loss of "power".

74.      Improving inter-ministerial coordination. The quality of program coordination at the central
level was adversely affected by the split of the previous Ministry of Finances, Budget, Economy and
Development, into two separate ministries. As a first step to improve coordination, PRSCs implementation
should be monitored by a committee including high level representatives of the Ministry of Finances and


                                                      - 24 -

Budget, the Ministry of Economy and Development, and Ministries and public institutions under the
sectoral coverage of the PRSCs.

75.      Beware of possible pitfalls of greater harmonization. PRSCs have lowered transaction costs
compared to project financing, but success in that area should also be judged against the impact
on the volatility and predictability of budget resources. A cautious note is warranted about the
possibility that harmonization could end up in an "all or nothing" scenario, resulting in more
volatility of budget resources.

INTRODUCTION

76.    The Government of Burkina Faso prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2000 to
better coordinate and step up the fight against poverty. The preparation of the PRSP involved all
stakeholders. The PRSP - which received the support of all donors - aims at fostering greater effectiveness
of economic and social public policies with a view to provide the underprivileged populations with a
favorable social environment.

77.    Since its adoption, the PRSP is the single assistance framework for the government and its partners
as regards poverty reduction. It is articulated around four axes: (i) accelerating equity-based growth; (ii)
ensuring access of the poor to basic social services; (iii) increasing employment and income-generating
activities for the poor; and (iv) promoting good governance.

78.    The budget is the main instrument for PRSP implementation. In that context, some donors agreed to
accompany the government in the implementation of its action program, through budget supports. The shift
towards untied budget supports has developed steadily since 2000. Following the approval by the IMF of
the first Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for the period 1999-2002, the European Union
(EU) and several other bilateral donors started in 2000 to provide budgetary assistance in the framework of
a Memorandum of Understanding (Soutien Budgétaire Commun au CSLP, SBC/CSLP). In 2001, the
World Bank Poverty initiated a first series of three annual Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC), and
the African Development Bank (AfDB) introduced its Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Program
(PASRP).

79.    This Implementation Completion Report of the first three PRSCs will be articulated around four
main points: after a presentation of the PRSC instrument, there will be an assessment of the instrument
followed by an analysis of the implementation of the measures under the PRSCs and, finally, suggestions
will be made for a better management of future PRSCs.

I ­ PRESENTATION OF THE PRSC

80.      The PRSC builds on the execution of a set of policy measures with a view to achieve poverty
reduction goals. The set of policy measures is drawn from the PRSP, and is agreed upon in a consensual



                                                    - 25 -

way between the World Bank and the government. The implementation of PRSC measures is reviewed
periodically (at least four times a year) by the Bank and the government. These reviews are important,
because they allow a regular monitoring by the two parties of the progress achieved in the execution of
measures.

81.      The PRSC is generally appraised and negotiated at the beginning of the second quarter, which
makes possible an approval by the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank, its implementation and the
mobilization of the resources within the budgetary cycle. Since the adoption of the PRSP, Burkina has
received four PRSCs. Under the first three PRSCs, subject of this report, Burkina Faso has mobilized a
total assistance of one hundred and thirty million (130,000,000) US dollars.

II ­ ASSESSMENT OF THE PRSC INSTRUMENT

82.      Overall, the implementation of the first series of three PRSCs was positive. The PRSCs provide an
excellent framework for dialogue between the Bank, the government, and other development partners, as
well as linkages between macroeconomic programs and sectoral policies. It is also reasonably flexible
insofar as it allows:

      - a continuous support in the long term on the basis of "triggers" implementation;
      - the government to modulate the pace of reforms according to sectors' readiness;
      - to adjust the disbursement of the credit by the Bank when some "triggers" could not be carried out
         within the agreed time frame.

83.      This funding instrument presents other qualities which make its attractiveness: (i) it is a
concessional support in line with our commitments with the IMF as regards debt sustainability
management; (ii) it is a untied budget support which supports the overall government budget; (iii) it is a
fast-disbursing, single tranche credit, and it is increasingly aligned with the budgetary cycle; (iv) the
multi-annual and sectoral reform program underpinning the PRSCs is drawn from the government's
program and from PRSP directions; (v) its appraisal is carried out within a framework and a time-table
agreed upon in advance.

84.      The different PRSCs supported the implementation of the PRSP by supporting reforms aiming at a
continuous poverty reduction. This implied a significant effectiveness in the use of public funds, and
increased transparency and accountability in public service management, especially in the areas of health,
education and rural development. An Action Plan for the Strengthening of Budgetary Management
(PRGB), based on the recommendations of a national study on budgetary management, a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) report and an IMF Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) provided supporting measures to the PRSC with regard to public finance management reforms.

85.      The PRSCs make it possible to support capacity building activities through the budgetary process.
By this way, capacity building is integrated into the existing institutions and is managed as a government
activity and not as a donor one. There is a better ownership of policies and programs by the government,
with an effective participation of the line ministries. The different ministries understand better the stakes of
PRSCs and get involved further in the process leading to the identification of benchmarks for the
monitoring of the reform program in the various sectors, therefore ensuring consistency between sectoral
policies and the macroeconomic framework.

86.      In spite of all these positive points, the PRSC as a new instrument is confronted with difficulties
during its implementation. The factors that limit the effectiveness can be found within the government as
well as within the Bank.

87.      The main difficulty lies in the fact that the instrument is not well understood by all the actors


                                                     - 26 -

involved in its implementation. This is true of the Bank (macro economists and sectorals), as well as the
government (Ministry of Finance and Budget and other ministries). The PRSC is viewed by line ministries
as a project and as a result they don't include the cost of implementing PRSC-related measures in their
budget, instead requesting additional resources to implement these measures. Inconsistencies have often
been noted between measures recommended by Bank project managers and line ministries and those
included in the PRSCs, because of different time-frames in the course of implementation. The weak
capacity (human and material) and the poor command of budget programs in line ministries are also
constraints to the good implementation of the PRSC.

88.      Another difficulty is the weakness of the national statistical apparatus which limits the access to
statistics and indicators needed to assess the impact of programs. The National Institute of Statistics and
Demography (INSD), the Directorates of Studies and Planning (DEP) and the Directorates of Financial
Affairs (DAF) in line ministries are not up to their responsibilities of producing data and information, a
serious issue for PRSC implementation.

89.      The PRSC 1, 2 and 3 were approved respectively in August 2001, July 2002 and July 2003 for 45
million US dollars, 35 million US dollars and 50 million US dollars. These resources allowed significant
progress in several areas. The major achievements are outlined in the following section.

III - ACHIEVEMENTS UNDER THE FIRST THREE PRSCs

90.      The PRSCs are untied budget supports. Because they are fungible, their impact cannot be
disentangled from the overall impact of the national budget. Because of their predictability, PRSC
resources are taken into account in the determination of the sectoral budgets of the MTEF and, as such, the
PRSCs contributed to all that was carried out by the budget. The PRSCs were implemented in accordance
with the clauses provided for by their legal agreements.

91.      In addition to a sound budgetary management, all the PRSCs support improvement in basic service
delivery, particularly in the areas of education and health, the stimulation of economic growth through
structural reforms and increased investments in the rural development sector. The main focus is on public
sector reform and pro-poor sectoral policies.

92.      Overall, the implementation of the first three PRSC was satisfactory and the progress made amply
justified the launching of a new series of PRSC. Most of the measures that were programmed have been
implemented and that made it possible to obtain significant results in all PRSP areas.

AXIS 1: ACCELERATING EQUITY-BASED GROWTH

93.      The PRSC contribution consisted of measures aiming at the strengthening of the macroeconomic
framework by the maintenance of satisfactory programs with the IMF, the improvement of budget
formulation and implementation process, in particular with the use of the Medium-term Expenditure
Frameworks (MTEF) and of Public Expenditure Reviews (PER) for a greater consistency between the
budget and the PRSP priorities. It is during the preparation of the PRSC-2 that the idea to set up a
computerized circuit of the revenues to supplement the public finance information system was evoked. This
project has been under development since 2003.

94.      The PRSC supported the government in the liberalization of the national economy, evidenced by
the implementation of a vast program of disengagement of the State from the productive sectors, as part of
the Government's will to make the private sector the main engine of growth. Significant reforms were thus
undertaken in many sectors, including in the telecommunications sector which led in a first phase to the
creation of a telecommunications regulatory agency, and in a second phase to the opening of the mobile



                                                    - 27 -

segment to two private operators. It is also under the first three PRSCs that the process of reorganization of
the cotton sector was intensified, notably with the adoption, in December 2001, of two decrees suppressing
the monopoly of SOFITEX (the cotton parastatal) and authorizing the creation of two new cotton
companies in the Eastern and Central regions. A steering committee was set up in December 2002 to
supervise the process and, in May 2003, the Government launched an international invitation to tender for
the transfer of these two zones.

AXIS 2: PROMOTING ACCESS TO BASIC SOCIAL SERVICES FOR THE POOR

95.     The PRSC focused on education and health, the policies of which are built around the ten-year
Plan of Basic Education Development (PDDEB) and the National Health Development Plan (PNDS), two
key elements of the PRSP.

96.     In the area of basic education, among the key issues addressed by the PRSC are: low and unequal
access, high costs, inefficiency in the use of resources, low quality and inadequate funding, and a weak
management capacity.

97.     The government adopted in May 2001 the letter of educational policy. This document confirms that
education remains a national priority and that the efforts in that area will be continued and intensified in
order to reach, by 2011, an enrollment rate of 70% and an adult literacy rate of 40% and to improve the
cost effectiveness of education programs. The PRSC supported this orientation while retaining standpoint
measures aiming at achieving the objectives thus stated.

98.     The government's program of improving basic education indicators, defined in the ten-year Plan of
Basic Education Development (PDDEB), is in line with the PRSP. The program is supported by an
investment project funded by IDA and the PRSCs and also benefits from the support of the fast-track
Education For All (EFA) initiative, thanks to the government's strong commitment and the soundness of its
long term strategy.

99.     The first three PRSCs supported the efforts aiming at improving access to basic education and
lower costs through the continuous increase in resource allocation to the sector:

      - reinforcement of school infrastructures in rural areas, in particular in the twenty (20) provinces
        with the lowest schooling rates;
      - hiring of basic education teachers to make these new classrooms more functional;
      - free textbooks and supplies in the twenty (20) provinces with the lowest schooling rates, no school
        fees for girls in their first year;
      - reinforcement of the ministry of basic education (MEBA) capacities as regards programming and
        monitoring the implementation of PDDEB.
      - reinforcement of the quality and the effectiveness of formal and non-formal basic education, in
        particular through the adoption of legal texts reorganizing basic education in sub-cycles, regulating
        the conditions of promotion, repetition and the reduction from two (2) years to one (1) year of the
        training duration in the National Training Center for basic education Teachers (ENEP), with an
        elimination of the automatic hiring of ENEP graduates into the civil service.

100.    These measures contributed to increase gross enrollment rate (TBS) by 5.1 points between 2000
and 2001.

101.    In the area of basic health, the combination of the relatively high level of fertility and poor health
and nutritional status worsens the phenomenon of poverty in Burkina Faso of which it constitutes a cause
as well as a consequence. As a result, there is a reduction in households' productivity and incomes. Among
the other factors associated with poverty and contributing to a poor health status of the population are



                                                    - 28 -

women's illiteracy and the limited access to basic social services such as potable water and sanitation.

102.    To improve populations' health status and well-being, the government prepared a ten-year National
Health Development Plan. This plan that is supported by a medium-term reform program, comprises three
axes of pro-poor policies: the improvement of poor people's health indicators, the reduction of the financial
burden resulting from health services user fees on the poor families and the wider involvement of most
deprived communities in the decision-making of the health sector.

103.    In addition to the adoption of a new set of policies targeting the reduction of the financial burden
represented by the user fees on the households, the government was committed to continuing the following
measures:

      - improving the functionality of peripheral health centers;
      - reducing the financial burden of essential drugs on the poor;
      - eliminating the fees for preventive cares;
      - improving the management of cost recovery proceeds;
      - consulting beneficiaries on their view on user fees;
      - maintaining an adequate funding of basic health services targeting the poor;
      - considering incentives to attract health personnel in under-served rural areas, and transfer the
        responsibilities for personnel management to the regional and provincial levels.

104.    Under the PRSC-1, the stress was on the standardization of health centers and their staffing to a
level required for their functionality. With the PRSC-2, there was a reduction in the profit margins of the
national supply center for generic drugs, and therefore a reduction in drug prices and increased access to
these drugs. With the PRSC-3, a single list of the cost of basic medical services in hospitals and health
centers was published, with the indication of prenatal care and vaccination services. All the PRSCs have
encouraged preventive care through vaccination programs and the distribution of vitamin A to children
from 0 to 5 years.

105.    To improve the execution of the credits granted to the decentralized health districts, 66 petty cash
accounts (régies d'avance) were created in the regions and districts in 2002, which resulted in a 10 percent
increase in resources allocated to the decentralized structures. In addition, the government reinforced the
Health Centers Management Committees (COGES) by the training of their personnel in planning, and took
measures for the development of a sectoral MTEF in order to support the implementation of the PNDS.

AXIS 3: INCREASING EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POOR

106.    The first three PRSCs integrated measures aiming at the development of a real rural development
strategy. The priority actions related to the development of a market economy in rural areas, the continuous
increase in rural income through the diversification of the sectors and the reform of the cotton sector by its
opening up to new investors. This opening favored the introduction of competition in the sector, the
increase in producers' incomes and the reinforcement of food and nutritional security thanks to counter
season cropping which arouse a growing interest with the development of small scale irrigation.

107.    The PRSC allowed the reorganization in June 2001 of the services of agricultural extension with
the support of the second national program for agricultural services development (PNDSA-II) financed by
IDA. That resulted in the development of a manual of procedures, the funding of the projects initiated by
grass-root farmers organizations, the adoption of a new approach of extension based on the demand for
agricultural services and the launching of a program of public sector /private sector partnership in
December 2001. In addition, in order to promote the diversification of the agriculture and pastorale
production, four (4) action plans were prepared for the development of cowpea (July 2002), oil seeds



                                                     - 29 -

(September 2003), porcine (October 2003) and fruit and vegetables (starting in November 2003).

108.    In the area of rural hydraulics and potable water supply, the government adopted in February 2001
a new law outlining guiding principles for water management. A policy has also been initiated to open up
rural areas through the building of feeder roads in order to create development centers capable of
stimulating the diversification of opportunities for economic activities.

109.    The PRSC-3 integrated the environmental issue through an environmental assessment covering
the sectors it supported. This assessment built upon the national regulations which require an
environmental impact assessment for qualified investments, on-going sectoral investment projects supported
by the Bank, and capacity building activities in the field of environmental assessment.

AXIS 4: PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE

110.    The PRSC provided support to the government's effort to maintain a stable macroeconomic
framework and align the MTEF with PRSP priorities through:
      - the use of pro-PRSP rules in budget formulation, execution and control, notably for health,
        education and rural development based on high-quality reviews of public expenditures;
      - compliance with the basic procedures in procurement and financial management;
      - the reform of civil service and decentralization reform by supporting the implementation of the
        decentralization and the deconcentration process of the civil service as a mean to improve the
        effectiveness of social service provision and the quality of such services, and to enhance the
        mechanism of delegating budget resources and payment authority to the regions and provinces.

111.    More specifically, the measures supported by the PRSCs under that axis include:

      - the adoption by decree n°2002-110/PRES/PM/MEF of March 20, 2002, of new regulations for
        public procurement. These regulations instituted more transparency in public procurement and
        clarified the roles of the various sectors in the process;
      - the undertaking of a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), whose
        recommendations fed in the action plan for the reinforcement of budget management adopted by the
        government on July 31, 2002;
      - the operationalization of the audit court in the framework of a tree-year action plan developed in
        relation with the audit chamber of the supreme court; the court which was set up in 2002 issued in
        December 2002 the compliance statements of budget execution bills (lois de règlements) for the
        period 1975-2002;
      - the creation in December 2001 of the High Authority for the Coordination of Corruption Control
        (HACLC) whose responsibilities include the investigation of corruption cases, the carrying out of
        surveys and submission of corruption cases before the court;
      - the reduction of delays as regards the production of draft budget execution bills which has become
        a common practice of financial administration since 2002; the 2001 budget execution bill was
        voted in 2003 and the 2002 one was submitted to the Audit Court in May 2004;
      - the regular production of the general balances of the treasury accounts, thanks to the setting up of
        the integrated accounting software of the government which has been operational since 2000;
      - the adoption of an instruction related to the procedure of delegation of credit to enable the issuance
        of payment orders at the regional level, the extension of the CID to Bobo-Dioulasso city, chosen as
        a pilot site for the deployment of budget expenditure payment orders at the deconcentrated level as
        of April 2003. At the end of December 2003, the experience was extended to Ouahigouya city;
      - the adoption by the council of ministers and approbation in March 2003 of four decrees on the



                                                      - 30 -

         organization of regions; this allowed the Parliament to adopt the amendments of the law for the
         definition of the attributions of regions, provinces and local communities in August 2003, and the
         creation of 13 administrative regions to supplement the decentralization organizational system.

IV - SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE PRSCs

112.     The first three PRSCs established a medium-term poverty reduction program which provides a
starting point for next PRSCs. The latter will have to take into account the insufficiencies noted during the
various evaluations and to resolutely conform to ongoing reflections in the international arena with a view
to improve the effectiveness of budget supports. Without being exhaustive, we think that the actions
hereafter could be privileged:

      - firstly, it is necessary to improve the command of the instrument by all the stakeholders within the
         government as well as within the Bank, in order to ensure the necessary consistency of measures
         supported by the PRSCs with those programmed at the sectoral levels.
      - secondly, it is necessary to re-examine the review mechanisms to reduce their frequency, for
         instance making an effort to carry them out as much as possible with sectoral supervision; in
         parallel, the government will need to improve the monitoring of the execution, in particular by
         assigning responsabilities to a directorate within the ministries involved in the PRSC, which will
         regularly report to the Secretary General; this will likely allow a greater national ownership. The
         reviews and evaluations of the PRSC should gradually fit in the new framework of organization of
         budget supports (CGAB), the project of which is subject of ongoing discussions with donors for
         implementation in 2005;
      - thirdly, it is necessary to provide practical support, through a suitable technical assistance, to the
         reinforcement of the ownership by the government of the programming and budgetary management
         instruments (MTEF, program-based budgets, software), key elements of the PRSCs. This
         assistance could be considered in the framework of the capacity building program            for five
         ministries currently in preparation;
      - fourthly, it is also advisable to support an adequate PRSP monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
         system, not only by providing additional human and material resources to INSD and to statistical
         departments in line ministries, but also by developing capacities for analysis.

PRSC Stocktaking Workshop

113.     A stocktaking workshop to discuss experiences with the PRSC in 2001-03 took place in
Ouagadougou on March 22-23, 2004. The workshop included participants from a variety of government
institutions, private sector and civil society. The Minister of Finance and Budget introduced the main
themes in his opening speech--the government's interest in receiving predictable budget support for PRSP
implementation within a medium-term programmatic framework; the importance of predictability of budget
support; the integration of sectoral ministries into the PRSC; and the importance to harmonize donor
interventions. Participants in four plenary sessions underlined the overall good experience thus far with the
PRSC instrument in offering reliable support for PRSP implementation through the budget and welcomed
the efforts to align PRSCs more closely with the budget cycle. They noted the risks linked to a variation of



                                                      - 31 -

PRSC amounts in case of unsatisfactory progress.

114.     Participants from line ministries, in particular the Ministry of Health, described the difficulties
encountered in switching from a project approach to budget support. The health ministry was finalizing a
long-term health-sector development program when the first PRSC was approved and sectoral policy
making and monitoring tools still needed to be developed. Moreover, health ministry staff underscored the
practical problems arising from insufficient budget allocations for implementing measures included in the
PRSC matrix.

115.     Donor participants presented the complex issues in harmonizing budget aid and timing and the
efforts undertaken in the joint budget support group (SBC-CSLP), noting that the main approaches using
either policy actions or indicators as disbursement criteria were complementary. Several participants from
the government and civil society wondered whether disbursement criteria should not be fully harmonized,
and government representatives explained how the government intends to lead the process of further
harmonization. Participants in general believed that under the second PRSP and a new PRSC series the
government should focus on improving capacity and analytical tools to better program and evaluate
budgetary spending; and to process the information generated by the collection of statistics and indicators
more regularly.

PRSC Stocktaking Paper

116.     A review of PRSCs in 2001-2003 indicates a positive contribution to the implementation of the
PRSP though the promotion of institutional reforms and financing of government annual programs. Main
contributions include support to public sector reform that resulted in increased government ownership and
significant achievements in economic growth and poverty outcomes, and gains in priority sectors (health,
education, and rural development). Nevertheless, several challenges remain and addressing them improve
the effectiveness of PRSCs and budget support more broadly.

Achievements under the PRSCs

117.     The PRSCs contributed to improve the effectiveness of the public sector: (i) budgetary process
(programming, execution and control) has noticeably improved as the government implemented measures to
simplify procedures, raise accountability, modernize management tools, integrate the management of
budget data, and upgrade computer systems and equipment; (ii) the introduction of MTEF has increased
allocative efficiency an the overall effectiveness of public expenditure. MTEFs have also proved to be a
powerful coordination tool of government actions; (iii) aid coordination has improved as a result of the
larger share of budgetary assistance and the use of national procedures; (iv) a results-based approach has
been gradually enforced in the priority sectors of health, education and rural development.

118.     As a result of reforms in the public sector, the Government was able to maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework, with low inflation and strong growth (5% per annum on average since 1998).
Poverty incidence was reduced between 1998 and 2003 based on comparable measures of household
expenditures. Nevertheless, poverty remains high at above 40% of the total population. Health outcomes
are satisfactory with substantial gains in preventive care though increased vaccine coverage, and improved
supply of generic drugs. Performance is good for primary education although actual gross enrollment rate
of 53% in 2003 (compared to a projected 52.2 percent) is far from the MDGs. Cereal and cotton
production also increased significantly in 2003.

Challenges and Recommendations for future PRSCs

119.   In spite of the overall satisfactory performance, there are few challenges that should be addressed
to improve the effectiveness of PRSCs and overall budget support.

    l weak capacity in the public sector has been a constraint to a larger ownership of policies and
       programs. While training programs in economic management have played a role in the success of
       reforms implementation, key areas like statistics and computer skills remain underdeveloped;
    l sectoral ministries have been slow to adjust to the new approach. Ownership of program-based
       budgeting and MTEF must be increased within these ministries, particularly health and education.
       This can be achieved by well-targeted training and capacity building programs;
    l weak M&E system has constrained the effectiveness of government program, and resulted in
       reduced aid flows. Statistical services should be strengthened at the central level (INSD) and in
       key ministries. The recent approval of the statistical capacity building project (STATCAP) is a
       step in the right direction;
    l the quality of program coordination at the central level was adversely affected by the split of the
       previous Ministry of Finances, Budget, Economy and Development, into two separate ministries.
       As a first step to improve coordination, PRSCs implementation should be monitored by a
       committee including high level representatives of the Ministry of Finances and Budget, the
       Ministry of Economy and Development, and Ministries and public institutions under the sectoral
       coverage of the PRSCs;
    l the alignment of the PRSCs with the budget cycle has been generally poor although the adoption of
       PRSC-4 in May 2004 indicates this is no longer an issue;
    l the predictability of financial flows can be further improved by an effort of the government to
       improve M&E systems and donors coordination.
    l the move from project-aid to budget support is a major transition. It is important to recognize the
       magnitude of these changes and time should be given to Government and donors to reach the top of
       the learning curve.      Government experts have deplored too many changes in approaches to

     RAPPORT NATIONAL D'ACHEVEMENT DES TROIS PREMIERS CREDITS D'APPUI
     A LA STRATEGIE DE REDUCTION DE LA PAUVRETE DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE




    INTRODUCTION

    En vue de coordonner et d'intensifier la lutte contre la pauvreté, le gouvernement burkinabé a élaboré
    un Cadre Stratégique de Lutte contre la Pauvreté (CSLP) en 2000, selon une approche participative
    ayant associé l'ensemble des acteurs au développement. Le CSLP, qui a été approuvé par l'ensemble
    des partenaires techniques et financiers (PTF) du Burkina Faso, a pour principale ambition de centrer
    la stratégie de développement économique et social sur un meilleur impact des politiques publiques
    en vue d'offrir aux populations défavorisées un cadre propice d'épanouissement social.

    Depuis son adoption le CSLP constitue l'unique cadre de référence pour le gouvernement et ses
    partenaires, en matière de lutte contre la pauvreté. Il s'articule autour de quatre axes majeurs : 1/
    Accélérer la croissance et la fonder sur l'équité ; 2/ Garantir l'accès des pauvres aux services
    sociaux de base ; 3/ Elargir les opportunités d'emplois et de revenus pour les pauvres ; 4/
    Promouvoir la bonne gouvernance.

    Le budget de l'Etat est le cadre d'opérationnalisation de cette stratégie. Certains partenaires
    techniques et financiers ont accepté d'accompagner le gouvernement dans la mise en oeuvre de son
    programme d'action, à travers des appuis budgétaires. C'est ainsi que le mouvement vers les appuis
    budgétaires non ciblés s'est amplifié depuis 2000. Après la première Facilité pour la Réduction de la
    Pauvreté et la Croissance (FRPC) conclue avec le FMI pour la période 1999-2002, l'Union
    européenne et certains bilatéraux ont mis en place des aides budgétaires organisés dans le cadre d'un
    protocole d'entente (Soutien budgétaire commun au CSLP (SBC/CSLP) dès 2000, la Banque
    Mondiale les Crédits d'appui à la stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté (CASRP) à partir de 2001, de
    même que la Banque Africaine de Développement avec le programme d'appui à la stratégie de
    réduction de la pauvreté (PASRP).

    Ce rapport d'achèvement des trois premiers CASRP va s'articuler autour de quatre principaux
    points. Après une présentation de l'instrument CASRP, il s'agira dans un premier temps de donner
    notre appréciation sur cet instrument, ensuite de faire une analyse de l'exécution des mesures des
    trois premiers CASRP et enfin de faire des propositions pour une meilleure gestion des CASRP
    futurs.

    I ­ PRESENTATION DU CASRP

    Le CASRP repose sur l'exécution d'un ensemble de mesures de politiques en vue d'atteindre les
    objectifs de réduction de la pauvreté. L'ensemble de ces mesures de politiques est tiré du programme
    du Gouvernement, contenu dans le CSLP, et arrêté de manière consensuelle entre la Banque
    Mondiale et la partie nationale. Les mesures du CASRP font ensuite l'objet de revues périodiques (au
    minimum quatre chaque année) par la Banque et le gouvernement. Ces revues sont fondamentales,



                                                  - 46 -

car elles permettent un suivi régulier par les deux parties de l'état d'avancement et d'exécution des
mesures.

Le CASRP est généralement évalué au cours du premier trimestre et négocié au début du second
trimestre, ce qui permet d'organiser le processus de son approbation par les instances de la banque,
sa mise en oeuvre et la mobilisation des ressources dans le cycle budgétaire. Depuis l'adoption du
CSLP, le Burkina a bénéficié de quatre crédits dont les trois premiers, objet de ce rapport ont permis
de mobiliser au total cent trente millions (130.000.000) de dollars EU.

II ­ APPRECIATION DE L'INSTRUMENT CASRP

Dans l'ensemble, l'expérience de la mise en oeuvre de la série des trois premiers CASRP a été
positive. Le CASRP représente un cadre excellent pour le dialogue entre la Banque et le
gouvernement, les partenaires du développement ; mais aussi d'assurer un programme macro
économique entre les sectoriels. Il comporte un niveau de flexibilité satisfaisant dans la mesure où il
permet :

  -    sur la base d'actions « déclencheurs » un soutien continu sur le long terme ;
  -    au gouvernement de faire avancer les réformes à des rythmes variables selon les secteurs ;
  -    le décaissement modulable du crédit par la Banque lorsque certaines mesures « déclencheurs »
       n'ont pu être exécutées à échéance.

Cet instrument de financement présente d'autres qualités qui en font son intérêt : (i) c'est un appui
concessionnel en ligne avec nos engagements en matière d'endettement dans le cadre des programmes
avec le FMI ; (ii) c'est un appui budgétaire non ciblé qui supporte globalement le budget de l'Etat ;
(iii) son décaissement est rapide, en tranche unique et on note une évolution positive concernant son
alignement avec le cycle budgétaire; (iv) le programme de réformes pluriannuel et sectoriel sur lequel
il s'adosse est issu des programmes et des mesures agréées par le gouvernement et est en ligne avec
les orientations du CSLP ; (v) son évaluation se fait selon un cadre et un calendrier convenus à
l'avance.

Les différents CASRP ont appuyé la mise en oeuvre du CSLP en soutenant les réformes visant une
réduction continue de la pauvreté. Ceci a impliqué une grande efficacité dans l'utilisation des fonds
publics, une transparence et une responsabilité accrues dans la gestion du service public surtout dans
les domaines de la santé, de l'éducation et du développement rural. L'existence d'un Plan d'actions
pour le Renforcement de la Gestion Budgétaire (PRGB) du gouvernement, issu des recommandations
d'une étude nationale sur la gestion budgétaire, de l'exercice du CFAA et du Rapport sur
l'Observation des Normes et des Codes (RONC) du FMI a fourni des mesures d'appui au CASRP en
ce qui concerne le volet finances publiques.

Les CASRP permettent de soutenir le renforcement des capacités à travers le processus budgétaire.
De cette manière, on s'assure que le renforcement de capacité est intégré aux institutions existantes et
géré comme une activité du gouvernement et non des bailleurs de fonds. Il y a une meilleure
appropriation des politiques et programmes par le gouvernement, avec une participation effective des
sectoriels. Les différents ministères comprennent de mieux en mieux les enjeux des CASRP et
s'impliquent davantage dans le processus qui fourni des repères précieux pour la mise en oeuvre des
mesures et des réformes dans les différents secteurs. De ce fait, la cohérence entre les politiques
sectorielles et le cadre macro économique est établie.

En dépit de tous ces points forts, le CASRP en tant que nouvel instrument est confronté à des
difficultés au cours de sa mise en oeuvre. Les facteurs limitants de la portée du CASRP se retrouvent



                                              - 47 -

tant au niveau du gouvernement que de la banque.

La difficulté majeure réside dans le fait que l'instrument n'est pas bien compris par l'ensemble des
acteurs impliqués dans sa mise en oeuvre. Ceci est aussi bien perceptible au niveau de la banque
(macro économistes et sectoriels) qu'au niveau du gouvernement (Ministère des Finances et du
Budget et autres ministères). Le CASRP est perçu au niveau des ministères comme un projet ce qui
traduit la non intégration des coûts de mise en oeuvre des mesures par les sectoriels au niveau de leur
budget. Pour les ministères, le gouvernement doit mettre à leur disposition des ressources
additionnelles au moment de l'exécution des mesures. Il a souvent été noté des discordances entre les
mesures recommandées par les staffs managers avec les ministères sectoriels et celles retenues dans
le CASRP, du fait du changement de chronogramme des mesures en cours d'exécution. La faiblesse
des capacités (humaines et matérielles), la non maîtrise des budgets programmes au niveau des
ministères sectoriels constituent également des contraintes à la bonne mise en oeuvre du CASRP.

Une autre difficulté est la faiblesse de l'appareil statistique national. Ce qui rend difficile l'accès aux
statistiques et indicateurs requis pour l'appréciation des résultats. L'Institut National de la
Statistique et de la Démographie (INSD), mais aussi les Directions des Etudes et de la Planification
(DEP) et les Directions des Affaires Financières (DAF) ne sont pas à même de faire face à leurs
obligations en matière de production d'informations statistiques. Ce qui constitue un sérieux
problème.

Les CASRP 1, 2 et 3 ont été approuvés respectivement en août 2001, juillet 2002 et juillet 2003 pour
45 millions de dollars EU, 35 millions de dollars EU et 50 millions de dollars EU. Ces ressources ont
permis des avancées significatives dans de nombreux domaines. Les principales réalisations sont
retracées dans la partie suivante.

III - REALISATIONS DES TROIS PREMIERS CREDITS

Les crédits d'appui à la stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté étant des appuis budgétaires non ciblés,
sont fongibles et ne peuvent être dissociés des ressources propres du budget dans leur utilisation. En
raison de leur prévisibilité, ils sont pris en compte dans la détermination des enveloppes sectorielles
du CDMT et contribuent à tout ce qui a été réalisé par le budget. Les CASRP ont été exécutés
conformément aux clauses prévues par les accords.

Outre une gestion budgétaire saine, toutes les opérations appuient l'amélioration dans la fourniture
de services de base, notamment en matière d'éducation et de santé, la stimulation des sources de
croissance à travers des réformes structurelles et des investissements accrus dans le développement
rural. L'accent est mis sur la réforme du secteur public et les politiques sectorielles en faveur des
pauvres, qui en sont les deux composantes principales.

Dans l'ensemble, l'exécution des trois premiers CASRP a été satisfaisante et les progrès réalisés ont
justifié amplement la mise en oeuvre d'une nouvelle série de CASRP. La plupart des mesures
programmées ont été mis en oeuvre et cela a permis d'obtenir des résultats significatifs dans tous les
domaines du CSLP.

AXE I : ACCELERER LA CROISSANCE ET LA FONDER SUR L'EQUITE

La contribution du CASRP à la réalisation des objectifs visés par cet axe du CSLP a consisté en
mesures visant le renforcement du cadre macroéconomique par le maintien de programmes
satisfaisants avec le FMI, l'amélioration du processus de formulation et d'exécution du budget avec
notamment l'utilisation des Cades de Dépenses à Moyen Terme (CDMT) et des Revues des



                                                - 48 -

Dépenses Publiques (RDP) pour une plus grande cohérence entre le budget et les priorités du CSLP.
C'est au cours de la préparation du CASRP 2 que l'idée de mettre en place un circuit informatisé de
la recette pour compléter le système d'informations des finances publiques a été évoquée. Ce projet
est aujourd'hui en cours de réalisation depuis 2003.

Le CASRP a soutenu le gouvernement dans le processus de libéralisation de l'économie nationale,
concrétisé par la mise en oeuvre d'un vaste programme de désengagement de l'Etat des secteurs de
production, traduction de sa volonté de faire du secteur privé le moteur de la croissance. Des
réformes importantes ont été ainsi entreprises dans de nombreux secteurs, dont celui des
télécommunications qui a abouti dans une première phase à la mise en place d'un organe de
régulation du secteur et dans une seconde phase à l'ouverture du segment de la téléphonie mobile à
deux opérateurs privés. C'est également sous les trois premiers CASRP qu'a été intensifié le
processus de restructuration de la filière coton, avec notamment l'adoption en décembre 2001 de
deux décrets portant respectivement suppression du monopole de la SOFITEX depuis 1979 et
autorisation d'installation de deux nouvelles sociétés cotonnières dans les zones de l'Est et du Centre.
Cette décision du gouvernement a été concrétisée par le lancement de l'appel d'offre international en
mai 2003 pour la cession de ces deux zones. Un comité de suivi a été mis en place en décembre 2002
pour superviser le processus ainsi engagé.

AXE 2 : PROMOUVOIR L'ACCES DES PAUVRES AUX SERVICES SOCIAUX DE BASE

L'apport du CASRP concernant cet axe, a été focalisé sur l'éducation et la santé dont les politiques
sont bâties autour du Plan décennal de développement de l'éducation de base (PDDEB) et du Plan
national de développement sanitaire (PNDS) qui sont deux éléments clés du CSLP.

Dans le domaine de l'éducation de base, au nombre des questions clefs adressées par les CASRP
figurent le niveau d'accès bas et inégal à l'éducation de base, le coût élevé de la scolarisation, la
mauvaise utilisation des ressources (gaspillage) et la faible qualité de l'enseignement de base, le
financement inadéquat de l'éducation de base ; et la faible capacité de gestion et de contrôle du
système éducatif.

Le gouvernement a adopté en mai 2001, la lettre de politique éducative. Ce document confirme que
l'éducation demeure une priorité nationale et les efforts déployés dans le domaine de la scolarisation
seront poursuivis et intensifiés afin d'atteindre, d'ici à l'an 2011, un taux de scolarisation de 70% et
un taux d'alphabétisation des adultes de 40%, et d'améliorer le rapport coût efficacité du système. Le
CASRP a soutenu cette orientation en retenant comme point d'appui des mesures visant à concrétiser
la réalisation des objectifs ainsi affichés.

Le programme gouvernemental d'amélioration des indicateurs de l'éducation de base, défini dans le
Plan décennal de développement de l'éducation de base (PDDEB), est tout à fait conforme au CSLP.
Ce plan est appuyé par un projet d'investissement financé par l'IDA et par les CASRP et bénéficie
en outre, au regard du fort engagement du gouvernement et de la solidité de la stratégie de long
terme, du soutien de l'initiative EFA rapide qui fournira des ressources substantielle pour accélérer
sa mise en oeuvre.

Les trois premiers CASRP ont soutenu les efforts visant l'amélioration de l'accès à l'éducation de
base et la baisse des coûts, en aidant à, travers l'accroissement continu des allocations en faveur du
secteur :

  -   le renforcement des infrastructures scolaires dans les zones rurales en particulier les vingt (20)
      provinces les moins scolarisées ;




                                              - 49 -

  -   le recrutement d'enseignants dans les régions pour l'enseignement de base afin de rendre plus
      fonctionnelle les nouvelles salles de classes ;

  -   la distribution gratuite des manuels et fournitures dans les vingt (20) provinces les moins
      scolarisées et la dispense des frais de scolarité en première année pour les filles. ;

  -   le renforcement des capacités du ministère de l'enseignement de base (MEBA) en matière de
      programmation et de suivi de la mise en oeuvre du PDDEB.

  -   le renforcement de la qualité et de l'efficacité de l'enseignement de base formel et non formel
      par notamment la prise de textes réorganisant l'enseignement de base en sous cycles,
      réglementant les conditions de promotion, de redoublement et la réduction de deux (2) ans à un
      (1) an de la durée de formation dans les Ecoles Nationales de l'Enseignement Primaire
      (ENEP), avec une déconnexion de l'accès automatique des sortants de ces écoles à la fonction
      publique.

Ces mesures ont contribué au relèvement du taux brut de scolarisation (TBS) qui a augmenté de 5,1
point entre 2000 et 2001 en passant de 27,8 point à 32,9 point.

Dans le domaine de la santé de base, la conjugaison du niveau relativement élevé de fertilité et du
mauvais état sanitaire et nutritionnel accentue le phénomène de la pauvreté au Burkina Faso dont elle
constitue à la fois une cause et une conséquence. Il en résulte une diminution de la productivité et des
revenus des ménages. Parmi les autres facteurs associés à la pauvreté et contribuant à un mauvais
état de santé des populations figurent l'analphabétisme des femmes et l'accès limité aux services
sociaux de bases tels que l'eau potable et l'assainissement.

Pour améliorer l'état sanitaire et le bien-être des populations, le gouvernement a élaboré un Plan
National de Développement Sanitaire sur une base décennale. Ce plan qui est soutenu par un
programme de réforme à moyen terme comporte trois axes de politiques en faveur des pauvres qui
sont l'amélioration des indicateurs sanitaires chez les pauvres, la réduction de la charge financière
des frais d'utilisation des services de santé sur les familles pauvres et l'élargissement de l'implication
des communautés les plus démunies dans les prises de décisions sur la santé.

Outre l'adoption d'un nouvel ensemble de politiques ciblant la réduction du poids financier des
charges d'utilisation sur les ménages, le gouvernement s'est engagé à poursuivre les mesures
suivantes :

  -   amélioration de la fonctionnalité des structures sanitaires périphériques ;

  -   réduction du poids financier des médicaments essentiels sur les pauvres ;

  -   élimination des frais sur les services préventifs ;

  -   renforcement de la gestion des recettes de recouvrement des coûts ;

  -   vérification de la vision des bénéficiaires par rapport aux frais d'utilisation ;

  -   maintien d'un financement adéquat des services de santé de base ciblant les pauvres ;

  -   exploration des options d'élaboration de motivations pour maintenir le personnel dans les zones
      rurales sous - desservies, et transfert des responsabilités de l'attribution et de la gestion du
      personnel aux niveaux régional et provincial.

Sous le CASRP I, il a été mis l'accent sur la normalisation des structures sanitaires et la dotation de
celles-ci en personnel minimum pour assurer leur fonctionnalité. Le CASRP-2 a vu la réduction des
marges bénéficiaires du centre national d'approvisionnement en médicaments génériques, ce qui a



                                               - 50 -

permis de réduire les prix et d'accroître l'accès à ces médicaments. Dans le cadre du CASRP-3, il a
publié une liste unifiée du coût des services médicaux de base dans les hôpitaux et centres de santé,
qui mentionne la gratuité des soins prénataux et les services de vaccination. Toutes les opérations
encouragent les actions de prévention continue à travers les programmes de vaccination et la
distribution concomitante de vitamine A aux enfants de 0 à 5 ans.

Pour améliorer l'exécution des crédits accordés aux districts sanitaires dans le cadre de la
déconcentration budgétaire, des régies d'avances (66) ont été créées dans les régions et les districts en
2002, ce qui s'est traduit par l'accroissement des moyens alloués aux structures déconcentrées du
secteur (augmentation de 10% des crédits délégués), pour un meilleur fonctionnement des districts
sanitaires. Le gouvernement a par ailleurs renforcé les Comités de Gestion des Centres de Santé
(COGES) par la formation de leur personnel en micro planification, et pris des mesures pour
l'élaboration d'un CDMT sectoriel en vue de favoriser le pilotage du PNDS.

AXE 3 : ACCROITRE LES OPPORTUNITES D'EMPLOIS ET DE REVENUS POUR LES
                   PAUVRES

Le premier cycle des trois premiers CASRP a intégré des mesures visant l'élaboration d'une véritable
stratégie de développement rural. Les actions prioritaires ont concerné le développement de
l'économie de marché en milieu rural, l'accroissement continu des revenus ruraux à travers la
diversification des filières et la réforme de la filière coton par son ouverture à de nouveaux
investisseurs. Cette ouverture a favorisé l'instauration d'une concurrence dans le secteur,
l'accroissement des revenus des producteurs et le renforcement de la sécurité alimentaire et
nutritionnelle grâce aux cultures de contre saison qui suscitent un intérêt croissant avec le
développement de la petite irrigation villageoise.

Concernant ce volet, le CASRP a permis la restructuration en juin 2001 des services de vulgarisation
agricole avec l'appui du deuxième programme national de développement des services agricoles
(PNDSAII) financé par l'IDA. Cela s'est traduit par l'élaboration d'un manuel de procédures, le
financement des projets initiés par les organisations paysannes à la base, l'adoption d'une nouvelle
approche de vulgarisation basée sur la demande en services agricoles et le lancement d'un
programme du partenariat secteur privé/secteur public en décembre 2001. Par ailleurs, afin de
promouvoir la diversification des productions agropastorales, quatre (4) plans d'actions ont été
élaborés pour le développement des filières niébé (juillet 2002), oléagineux (septembre 2003),
porcine (octobre 2003) et fruits et légumes (démarrage en novembre 2003).

Dans le domaine de l'hydraulique rurale et de l'approvisionnement en eau potable, le gouvernement a
adopté une loi d'orientation relative à la gestion de l'eau en février 2001. Il a aussi été initié une
politique de désenclavement des zones rurales par la construction de pistes rurales pour créer des
pôles de développement capables de stimuler une diversification des opportunités d'activités
économiques.

Le CASRP 3 a intégré la question environnementale à travers une analyse environnementale
couvrant les aspects des domaines ciblés dans les secteurs soutenus par le crédit. Cette analyse
s'appuie à la fois sur la réglementation nationale qui exige une étude d'impact environnementale pour
les investissements qualifiés, sur les projets d'investissements sectoriels en cours et soutenus par la
Banque, et sur les activités de construction de capacité en matière d'étude environnementale.

AXE 4 : PROMOUVOIR LA BONNE GOUVERNANCE

Dans le domaine de la gouvernance, les CASRP ont soutenu de manière continue les efforts du


                                              - 51 -

gouvernement en vue de maintenir un cadre macro-économique stable, et d'aligner son cadre de
dépenses à moyen terme (CDMT) avec les priorités de CSLP. Ces objectifs ont été poursuivis à
travers la promotion de :

  -   L'utilisation de règles de formulation, d'exécution et de contrôle de la gestion budgétaire
      favorisant les piliers du CSLP, notamment la santé, l'éducation et le développement rural sur
      la base de solides revues des dépenses publiques ;
  -   le respect des procédures de base en matière de passation de marché et de gestion financière ;
  -   la réforme de la fonction publique et de la décentralisation, en appuyant la mise en oeuvre du
      processus de la décentralisation et de la déconcentration du service public, comme le moyen
      d'améliorer l'efficacité des prestations de services sociaux et la qualité de ces services, et le
      développement du mécanisme de délégation de crédits budgétaires aux régions et aux provinces
      et l'émission d'ordre de paiement aux niveaux régional et provincial.

Plus spécifiquement, on peut signaler, au titre des mesures s'inscrivant dans le cadre du renforcement
de la gouvernance économique soutenues par les CASRP :

  -   l'adoption par décret n°2002-110/PRES/PM/MEF du 20 mars 2002 d'une nouvelle
      réglementation des marchés publics, qui a instauré une plus grande transparence au niveau des
      procédures des commandes publiques et clarifié les rôles des différents acteurs dans le
      processus ;

  -   la réalisation de l'exercice de l'obligation de rendre compte de gestion publique et des pratiques
      de la comptabilité du secteur privé (CFAA) dont les recommandations ont alimenté le plan
      d'action pour le renforcement de la gestion budgétaire adopté le 31 juillet 2002 par le
      gouvernement ;

  -   l'opérationnalisation de la cour des comptes, dans le cadre d'un plan d'action triennal élaboré
      en relation avec la chambre des comptes de la cour suprême ; la cour, installée en 2002 a
      délivré les avis de conformité des projets de lois de règlements de la période 19775-2000 à fin
      décembre 2002 ;

  -   la création en décembre 2001 de la Haute Autorité de Coordination de la Lutte Contre la
      Corruption (HACLC), dotée d'attributions incluant notamment l'auto saisine des cas de
      corruption, la conduite d'enquêtes et la saisine des autorités judiciaires compétentes ;

  -   la résorption des retards en matière de production des projets de lois de règlement, devenue une
      pratique courante de l'administration financière depuis 2002 ; la loi de règlement 2001 a été
      votée en 2003 et celle de 2002 a été soumise à l'examen de la Cour des comptes en mai 2004 ;

  -   la production régulière des balances générales des comptes du trésor, grâce à la mise en place
      du logiciel de comptabilité intégrée de l'Etat, opérationnel depuis l'année 2000 ;

  -   l'adoption d'une instruction relative à la procédure de délégation de crédit, pour permettre
      l'émission des ordonnancements au niveau régional, l'extension du CID à Bobo ­ Dioulasso,
      retenu comme site pilote pour le déploiement à partir d'avril 2003 de l'ordonnancement des
      dépenses budgétaires au niveau déconcentré ; A fin décembre 2003, l'expérience a été étendue
      à Ouahigouya ;

  -   l'adoption par le conseil des ministres a approuvé en mars 2003 de quatre décrets sur
      l'organisation des régions, qui a permis à l'Assemblée Nationale d'adopter les révisions de la
      loi pour la définition des attributions de la région, des provinces et des collectivités locales en
      août 2003, et la création des 13 régions administratives pour compléter le dispositif

IV- PROPOSITIONS POUR LES PROCHAINS CASRP

Les trois premiers CASRP ont établi un système de réduction de la pauvreté à moyen terme qui a
permis d'asseoir une base pour les prochains CASRP. Ces derniers devront prendre en compte les
insuffisances constatées antérieurement lors des différentes évaluations et s'inscrire résolument dans
la ligne des réflexions en cours au plan international en vue d'améliorer les modalités de délivrance
des appuis budgétaires. Sans être exhaustif, nous pensons que les axes d'actions ci-après pourraient
être privilégiés :

  -   premièrement, il faut travailler à une juste compréhension de l'instrument par tous les acteurs,
      tant au niveau gouvernemental qu'au sein de la banque, afin d'assurer la cohérence nécessaire
      des mesures retenues pour supporter le crédit avec celles programmées au niveau des secteurs;

  -   deuxièmement, il y a lieu de revoir les mécanismes de revue dans le sens de réduire leur
      périodicité, en s'efforçant autant que possible de les réaliser en même temps que les
      supervisions sectorielles ; Parallèlement, le gouvernement devra de son côté améliorer
      l'organisation du suivi de l'exécution, notamment par la responsabilisation d'une direction au
      sein des ministères impliqués dans le CASRP, qui rendra compte régulièrement au secrétaire
      général ; ceci sera de nature à permettre une plus grande appropriation par la partie nationale.
      Les revues et évaluations du CASRP devraient progressivement s'inscrire dans le nouveau
      cadre d'organisation des appuis budgétaires (CGAB) dont le projet, objet de concertations
      actuellement avec les PTF, sera opérationnel à partir de 2005 ;

  -   troisièmement, il est nécessaire d'appuyer concrètement, à travers une assistance technique
      appropriée, le renforcement de la maîtrise par le gouvernement des instruments de
      programmation et de gestion budgétaire (CDMT, budgets programmes, logiciels), qui servent
      de point d'appui au CASRP. Cette assistance pourrait être envisagée dans le cadre du
      programme de renforcement des capacités de cinq ministères en cours de mise en place ;

  -   quatrièmement, il convient également d'appuyer la mise en place d'un mécanisme adéquat de
      suivi/évaluation des indicateurs du CSLP, à travers non seulement le renforcement en
      ressources humaines et matérielles de l'INSD et des services en charge de la statistique au
      niveau des ministères sectoriels, mais aussi le développement des capacités d'analyse.
