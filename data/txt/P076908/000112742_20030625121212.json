Operation (PRSC-3) is the third in a series of operations\n            for Burkina Faso to support the implementation of the 2000\n            Poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) in line with the\n            Bank's strategy presented in the 2000 Country\n            assistance strategy (CAS). Consistent with the four\n            strategic pillars of the PRSP this project supports the\n            implementation of key reforms to improve the management of\n            public resources, strengthen basic service delivery in the\n            social sectors, and raise rural incomes.  The project has\n            been selected for grant financing because of its poverty\n            focus and the close monitoring of outcomes under the PRSP\n            process.  PRSC-3 maintains public sector reform and sectoral\n            policies for the poor as its two main components.  It\n            supports a series of measures that build closely on the\n            achievements under previous PRSCs and moves increasingly to\n            more output-related actions. The progress made by the\n            government in implementing its poverty reduction strategy\n            and the related reform program fully justify moving to\n            PRSC-3 as all but one of the triggers were met fully or in\n            large part."}, "docdt": "2003-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
