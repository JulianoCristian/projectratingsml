Lessons highlight\n            that the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series\n            greatly reinforced the importance of the budget, and the\n            country's own capacity for the success of government\n            policies, steadily strengthening the focus on the budget as\n            the main instrument for PRSP implementation. PRSCs also\n            successfully supported a number of cross-cutting reforms.\n            These reforms included the application of de-concentration\n            policies in budget and personnel management, which are part\n            of the policies to improve social service delivery. In the\n            cotton sector, the opening of two zones for private\n            investors, involved the establishment of the new regulatory\n            framework, and the definition of roles of the new and old\n            stakeholders. However, despite achievements, a number of\n            challenges remain for the PRSCs. Burkina Faso faces\n            difficulties in attracting private investment as a result of\n            low skill levels, and high costs of production factors. The\n            growth agenda of the PRSP should therefore be an additional\n            important area for support under future PRSCs, as well as\n            for the Country Assistance Strategy. Other lessons outline\n            improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue; aligning\n            budget support with the budget cycle; reinforcing\n            capacities; improving the link between policy actions and\n            the monitoring and evaluation framework; and, improving\n            inter-ministerial coordination."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
