            THIRDPOVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATION

                         PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:          Burkina Faso.

Amount:             SDR 35.4 million(US$50 million equivalent).

Terms:             IDA grant for debt vulnerable countries.

Description:       The proposed poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-3) is the
                   third in a series of operations to support the implementation of the
                   2000 PRSP in line with the Bank's strategy presented in the 2000
                   CAS. Consistent with the four strategic pillars of the PRSP-
                   accelerating broad-based growth, promoting access to social
                   services, increasing employment and income-generating activities for
                   the poor, and promoting good governance-PRSC-3            supports the
                   implementationof key reforms to improve the management o f public
                   resources, strengthen basic service delivery inthe social sectors, and
                   raise rural incomes.

Benefits:          The proposed operation offers benefits in creating the economic and
                   institutional environment permitting the sustained improvement in
                   policy implementation necessary to advance key social indicators.
                   PRSC-3 underpins the government's objective to maintain a sound
                   macroeconomic environment and accelerate growth by providing
                   external resources for the execution of the government's 2003
                   budget. PRSC-3 thereby enhances the government's capacity to
                   implement the poverty reduction strategy !aid out in the PRSP and
                   the latest PRSP-PR. As regards economic management, the reform
                   program supported by PRSC-3 i s expected to further improve budget
                   formulation and execution as well as fiscal management and ex-post
                   controls. The operation also supports improvements in basic service
                   delivery, notably in education and health, through increases in
                   supply, reductions incosts, and deconcentration of budget execution.
                   These policies will lay the foundation for increasing schooling rates
                   and lowering child mortality. In the area of rural development, the
                   operation accompanies the opening of the cotton sector for private
                   investors to sustain the sector's competitive gains and supports crop
                   diversification to raise rural incomes and lower the country's
                   external vulnerability.

R i S k X          The main risksfor the operation come from vulnerability to external
                   shocks, vested interests, and weak capacity. Fluctuating prices for
                   Burkina Faso's main export good and instability in the region could
                   affect revenue flows and thereby undermine the capacity o f the
                   government to implementbudgetary expenditure as planned. Vested
                   interests could stall application o f reforms or undermine their
                   objectives, notably as far as increasing private sector involvement in
                   the economy, cotton sector reform and procurement reform are
                   concerned. Finally, institutional risks remain due to limited capacity


                                      vi

                        to conceive, execute, andmonitor government programs. The risk of
                        shortfalls in resources due to possible adverse external shocks is
                        being managedby strengthening donor coordination so that various
                        partners are ready to help cover any unforeseen resource gaps that
                        may emerge from such event. The risk that vested interests might
                        resist reforms and cause them to stall will be mitigated by the fact
                        that all reform measures have beentaken before Boardpresentation
                        and that PRSC-3 is embedded in a medium-termreform program.
                       The risk of slower-than required program implementationowing to
                        capacity constraints will be minimized through continued technical
                        support by the World Bank and other donors to build capacity
                       through the PRSP process and a planned new capacity building
                       project.

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

1.       The proposed grant to Burkina Faso for Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 35.4 million, an
amount equivalent to US$50 million, for a poverty reduction support operation (PRSC-3) is the third
in a series of operations that started with PRSC-1 in2001. PRSC-3 is an integral part of the Bank's
strategy-presented     in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and reaffirmed in the CAS progress
report (CAS-PR)-to       support the implementation o f the poverty reduction strategy the government
laid out in mid-2000 in its poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP).' Jointly with the government and
incollaboration with other donors, PRSC-1 established a three-year policy framework and a series of
performance indicators that were closely aligned with PRSP objectives. On the basis o f sound policy
implementation in 2000-01, PRSC-1 was approved on August 23,2001            .2A second operation (PRSC-
2) was approved on July 11,2002 after key policy measures had been implemented in 2001-02.3

2.       The implementation o f government policies in 2001-02 was satisfactory. InNovember 2002,
the Executive Boards o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank examined the
second annual progress report o f the PRSP (PRSP-PR) and concluded that the strategy outlined inthe
PRSP and its implementation remain a sound basis for concessional lending to Burkina F a ~ oAs         . ~
regards the year-to-year program implementation, progress has been fully satisfactory, and all but
one o f the original key performance indicators ("triggers")      for PRSC-3 specified in the program
document for PRSC-2 have been met fully or in large part. The satisfactory progress made since the
approval o f PRSC-2 warrants a move to PRSC-3. Policy measures supported by PRSC-3 continue to
draw on core analytical work undertaken before approval o f PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, notably a growth
and competitiveness study, a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the Accountability and Action Plan (AAP) established under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, as well as other analytical work undertaken by
the government and donors in support o f the PRSP process.

3.       As preceding operations, the proposed PRSC-3 offers benefits in creating the economic and
institutional environment permitting the sustained improvement in policy implementation that is
necessary to advance key social indicators. PRSC-3 underpins the government's objective to
maintain a sound macroeconomic environment and accelerate growth and poverty reduction by
providing external resources for the execution o f the government's 2003 budget. In addition, by

augmenting the envelope to US$50 million, in line with the second scenario o f the CAS-PRYPRSC-3
responds to significant additional spending needs to cushion the impact o f the Ivorian crisis. The
operation thereby enhances the government's capacity to fully implement the poverty reduction
strategy laid out in the PRSP and the latest PRSP-PR. As regards economic management, the reform
program supported by PRSC-3 is expected to further improve budget formulation and execution and
to strengthen fiscal management. The operation supports improvements in basic service delivery,
notably ineducation and health, through increases in supply, reductions in costs, and deconcentration
o f budget execution. These policies will lay the foundation for increasing schooling rates and
lowering child mortality, among others.

4.      PRSC-3 has been selected for grant financing because o f its poverty focus and the close
monitoring o f outcomes under the PRSP process. Under the strategy outlined in the CAS-PR, there
would be lending o f US$177.9 million in fiscal year 2004 for two PRSCs and an energy operation.
PRSC-3 represents approximately 28 percent o f planned IDA lending in fiscal year 2004 and was
chosen for financing   with grants for debt vulnerable countries because o f (i)its prominence in the
government's poverty reduction program set out in the PRSP; (ii)the strong development impact in
supporting reforms summarized above; and (iii) considerable impact o f grant financing o f PRSCs
                                                 the
on the government's debt profile giving their fast-disbursing nature. Moreover, PRSC outcomes are
closely monitored under the PRSP progress reports presented annually to the Executive Boards o f the
IMFand the World Bank as well as under subsequent Bank lendingoperations.

5.      As outlined in the CAS-PR, it is expected that the Bank will continue its programmatic
support with PRSCs inthe interim period until a new CAS has been prepared on the basis o f a fully
revised PRSP. PRSC-4 would be subject to further progress in policy implementation, including by
meeting the triggers presented in this document and the letter o f development policy (Annex 1). It
would also be aligned with the third annual PRSP-PR. The priorities o f the fully revised PRSP that
the authorities intend to prepare in2003 will be reflected in a new medium-termpolicy framework at
the time PRSC-4 will be presentedto the Executive Board.

6.      PRSCs offer scope to maximize the coordination o f donor interventions, based on the
framework o f the PRSP. InBurkina Faso, the majority o f donors, with the European Union (EU) and
the African Development Bank (AfDB) being the largest contributors next to the World Bank, have
adopted the concept o f programmatic support for PRSP implementation but for the time being have
tied disbursements to different criteria drawn from the PRSP. It is fully expected that the PRSP
update in late 2003 will provide a good occasion for the government to give further impetus for the
coordination o f donor support by deepening the policy content o f the strategy and further
strengthening the evaluation and monitoring framework o f the PRSP to achieve common buy-infrom
all donors.


            11.     RECENT DEVELOPMENTSAND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

                              A. Country Context and Background

7.      Burkina Faso is a poor landlocked country o f about 12 million inhabitants with a very narrow
natural resource base. In2001, its GDP reached about $230 per capita and Burkina Faso was ranked
159th out o f 162 countries in the latest United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human
Development Index. Only about 17 percent o f the population live in urban areas (mainly the capital


                                                  2

city Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, the center o f the cotton-growing area) and most Burkinabk
depend heavily on agricultural activities, many o f which do not generate cash incomes.
Macroeconomic performance and progress in reducing widespread poverty therefore remain
vulnerable to exogenous shocks such as climatic conditions and changes in world market prices for
cotton, Burkina Faso's main export good.

8.      Onthe political level, Burkina Faso has made steady progress duringthe past years towards a
broad-based and inclusive process. From independence in 1960 to 1987, Burkina Faso was subject to
instability and frequently changing forms o f government, including a revolutionary government o f
military officers in 1983-87. Since 1987, the country has enjoyed relative stability under President
Blaise Compaore, who initiated a move to greater political pluralism in the 1990s. President
Compaore won elections in 1991 and was reelected in 1998 for a second seven-year term. As part o f
a national reconciliation and appeasement process, a government including several opposition parties
was appointed in November 2000 and a fund for the compensation o f victims o f past political
violence was instituted in 2001. The legislative elections in May 2002 resulted in a large gain for
opposition parties that had boycotted previous elections. As a result, the governing party retained
only a narrow majority in the national assembly, and a new government was formed in June 2002.
Local elections are expected to be held in2003 after the creation o f rural communities.

9.      Since 1994, Burkina Faso has satisfactorily implemented three programs supported by
arrangements under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The last PRGF
arrangement expired on December 9,2002 after the final disbursement was made. On June 11,2003,
the IMF Executive Board concluded the 2003 Article IV consultations and approved a new three-
year arrangement under the PRGF for Burkina Faso in an amount equivalent to SDR 24.1 million to
support the implementation o f the government's program in2003-06 (see Annex 2).

10.     The conflict in neighboring CBte d'Ivoire has exacerbated the vulnerability o f the Burkinabk
economy, which is heavily dependent on the Abidjan port for imports and exports and on Ivorian
inputsfor certain industrial activities. Since the onset o fthe crisis on September 19, 2002, the border
between C6te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso has been closed and railway operations have stopped.
Burkinabk operators were forced to divert trade to other ports in Benin, Ghana, and Togo at higher
costs and to find new suppliers for consumption goods and essential inputs. As a result, consumers
face higher costs, and some businesses had to reduce work hours or close down. Exports o f cotton
have been diverted to other ports, and livestock exports to CBte d'Ivoire have largely ceased with
repercussions on cash incomes in rural areas. Moreover, the public treasury and rural communities
have to bear the economic and social costs o f Burkinabk returning from CBte d'Ivoire, a number
currently estimated at about 160,000. Although close historical links between the northern part o f
CBte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso may result in some sympathies for the rebellion among the
Burkinabk population, the government has played a constructive role in the peace process by
encouraging the full and swift implementation o f a negotiated settlement. Discussions are now under
way to reopenthe borders and the railway at end-June 2003.

11.     Foreign assistance, including assistance provided under the HIPC Initiative, plays a large role
for macroeconomic management and poverty reduction in Burkina Faso. As a result o f the weak
internal resource base Burkina Faso remains heavily dependent on foreign aid to maintain necessary
levels o f government services and investment. In 2001, financial assistance by way o f grants, loans
and HIPC relief accounted for more than US$350 million, representing 124 percent o f government
tax revenue or more than 14 percent o f GDP. After assessing Burkina Faso's debt burden and the



                                                    3

implementation o f policy implementation since inception o f the HIPC Initiative, the Executive
Board's o f the IMF and the World Bank approved the completion points for the original and
enhanced HIPC framework in June 2000 and April 2002, re~pectively.~Taking into account a
deterioration o f the external environment, the Boards also granted an exceptional topping up o f debt
relief in April 2002. Despite the reduction in debt service, it i s expected that Burkina Faso will
depend on significant levels o f foreign financing in the medium term to implement its poverty
reduction strategy and create the conditions for a broader domestic resource base that is necessary to
generate faster growth.

12.      Although some progress has been made in recent years in a context o f fairly stable growth
rates o f about 5 percent on average since 1996, key social indicators are substantially below the sub-
Saharan average (Annexes 3 and 4). Illiteracy rates still reach an estimated 74 percent, primary
school gross enrollment rates have stayed below 45 percent, and repetition rates are high. Likewise,
infant mortality rates, child malnutrition rates, and maternal mortality rates remain elevated and have
changed little over the past decade. According to the 1998 household survey, the latest available to
date, 45 percent o f the population are below the poverty line. These summary figures combined with
the economic vulnerability and highdependency on foreign assistance demonstrate the challenge for
Burkina Faso in making significant strides towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).

                                  B. Recent Economic Developments

13.      Growth and inflation. After the drought-related decline in the growth rate to 1.6 percent in
2000, growth rebounded to 5.6 percent in 2001 and is estimated at 4.6 percent in 2002 (Table 1 and
Annex 5). The large increase in cotton production in 2001-02 and a pick-up o f growth in secondary
and tertiary sectors in2002 were the driving forces o f the growth recovery. However, growth in 2002
was about 1percentage point below expectations since cereal output stagnated at the fairly highlevel
attained in 2001. After the drought-related inflationary spike to 4.9 percent in 2001, consumer price
inflation reached 2.3 percent on an annual basis in 2002. However, inflation accelerated at year-end
to 3.9 percent as a result o f higher import costs after the closure o f the Ivorian border.

14.      Cotton sector developments. With production costs o f about CFAF 700 per kilogram o f
cotton fiber-    almost 60 percent o f which represent the producer price-the             cotton parastatal
SOFITEX remained the most competitive cotton producer inthe sub-region. However, in 2001-02, it
could not avoid losses on its record harvest o f 380,000 tons on account o f the low international
cotton prices. SOFITEX lost CFAF 7.7 billion (0.4 percent o f GDP) on the sale o f cotton fiber, part
o f which were compensated by the sale o f cottonseeds. Although SOFITEX maintained the producer
price o f CFAF 175/kg o f seed cotton in 2002-03, it could not pay the CFAF 25/kg bonus that was
paid in2001-02. However, since cotton prices have recently firmed up the cotton parastatal has been
able to generate profits in 2002-03 on a cotton harvest o f about 400,000 tons, despite the higher
transport costs following the Ivorian crisis, and a bonus o f CFAF 10/kg has been announced for the
2003-04 crop cycle. SOFITEX management has taken early steps to secure alternative export
channels by renting secured storage facilities in the Cotonou, Lome and Tema ports and by
negotiating with transport unions to allow foreign trucks to evacuate Burkinabi: cotton.

15.      Public finances. As a share o f the revised GDP, the overall budget deficit in2002 was about
as large as projected. However, this outcome masks some weaknesses inthe 2002 budget execution.
The deficit on a commitment basis, including grants, is estimated at 5.0 percent o f GDP (3.6 percent
excluding spending under the HIPC Initiative) compared with a programmed deficit o f the same
magnitude but with higher HIPC-related spending (resulting in a deficit o f 2.6 percent excluding
HIPC spending). As summarized in Table 2, this outcome is largely due to the slow execution o f
capital expenditure, especially those financed with HIPC resources, while current expenditure
exceeded program targets.

16.      Revenues experienced a shortfall o f 0.6 percent o f GDP (CFAF 14 billion) compared with
original program projections. Nonetheless, tax revenue increased by more than 13 percent and rose
from 10.5 percent o f GDP in2001 to 11.1 percent of GDP in 2002. While tax collection in 2002 was
encouraging overall, especially at customs, corporate tax receipts and internal VAT collections
remained weaker than expected on account o f lower-than-projected economic growth. The Ivorian
crisis affected tax revenues only to a small extent toward the end o f the year.

17.      In executing the 2002 budget, the government faced unexpected spending needs related to
rising oil prices, legislative elections, and the Ivorian crisis. Current expenditure were executed at a
fast pace ahead o f the May 2002 legislative elections and subsidies for electricity fuels and butane
gas were higher than expected throughout the year. Moreover, with the onset o f the Ivorian crisis,
substantial unplanned expenditure for security purposes and humanitarian aid, estimated at more than
0.5 percent o f GDP, used up budgetary allocations for materials and services and forced the
government to postpone the payment o f the second and third quarter utility bills. These bills will be
settled during2003.

18.      Recurrent cash shortages in the first half o f 2002, delays in allocating HIPC resources, and
some weaknesses in absorption o f aid resulted in a low level o f capital expenditure and limited the
catching up o f HIPC-related spending. In late 2001, the government was faced by a significant
shortfall in foreign financing for which it compensated by accumulating expenditure commitments
for which payment orders were not issued. The total stock o f these unpaid commitments at end-200 1
reached 1.4 percent o f GDP. Combined with the above-mentioned pressures on current expenditure
the expenditure overhang resulted in a recurrent tight cash position in early 2002 and forced the
government to delay the commitment o f domestically financed capital expenditure. Moreover, 2002
HIPC resources were only allocated to the different line ministries in April 2002. Although the total
spending o f resources received under the HIPC Initiative accelerated considerably to CFAF 28.2
billion in 2002, it remained below the target o f CFAF 52.3 billion and was insufficient to execute

both the leftover 2000-01 HIPC resources and those released in 2002.6 Regarding foreign-financed
investment spending, the time needed to start-up new projects, notably in the education sector, as
well as unexpected delays in procurement processes for certain infrastructure investment, slowed
down disbursements.

1/ Projections for 2003 assume a full execution of the remaining2002 HIPC-financed expenditure.

19.       Despite a significant disbursement o f budgetary aid in late 2002 (CFAF 37 billion), the
government did not succeed in reducing the expenditure overhang and the stock o f its treasury
obligations at year-end. The stock o f expenditure commitments for which payment orders were not
yet issuedincreased further to about CFAF 41 billion (1.9 percent o f GDP) and deposits in treasury
accounts by public entities increased by CFAF 30 billion, including the unpaid 2002 utility bills.
These latter developments are representative o f certain deficiencies in budget management processes
at year-end rather than lack o f cash since donor resources arriving inNovember and December 2002
went to build up government deposits at the BCEAO. Accordingly, the government began to use
h e s e bank deposits in early 2033 to make the payments and ;tduce the stock o f outstanding
commitments.

20.       Notwithstandingthe difficult overall context for the implementation o f the 2002 budget, the
government was able to achieve a hrther significant increase in executing social expenditure. As
outlined in Table 3, domestically-financed social expenditure, including HIPC-financed expenditure
in the priority sectors, increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to 5 percent of GDP in 2002. A
further net progression i s expected for 2003 with an acceleration o f the use o f leftover HIPC
resource~.~

21,       In 2002, the government successfully managed the transition to bond financing in regional
markets. With the freeze o f statutory advances from the Central Bank o f West African States
(BCEAO), the treasury twice successfully accessed the financial markets o f the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and issued short-term treasury bills for a total o f CFAF
23.3 billion at very favorable interest rates o f below 4 percent on average. Two-thirds o f the T-bills
were bought by banks inother WAEMUcountries.




7The plannedacceleration of HIPC-relatedspendingappears realistic taking into account that most of the leftover

22.      Monetary developments. Monetary developments, which have to be interpreted in the
regional context, appear to be in line with stable expansion o f monetary aggregates. Preliminary
figures show a small increase in Burkina Faso's contribution to the BCEAO's external reserves in
2002 despite the turmoil in the subregion late in the year. Money supply increased only slightly but
the decline in net credit to the government allowed an expansion o f credit to the economy o f more
than 18 percent, including some further increase in crop credits reflecting the new financing
mechanism o f cotton inputs and the fairly slow execution o f export contracts o f the cotton company.
Preliminary figures for the development o f prudential ratios through September 2002 indicate that
commercial banks in Burkina Faso continue to respect most o f them but that difficulties remain in
adhering to the risk concentration ratios as a result o f the limited number o f large and medium-sized
enterprises. The share o f provisioned loans out o ftotal commercial bank lending remained essentially
unchanged in 2002.

23.      External sector. The current deficit stabilized at about 10 percent o f GDP in2002 mirroring
a stabilization o f the trade deficit following a slow-down in imports that compensated for the
declining export revenues for cotton after the fall in international prices. Foreign financing from
public and private sources was more than sufficient to meet the needs to cover the current account
deficit and contributed to a small reserve accumulation at the BCEAO and commercial banks.

                                        C. Economic Outlook

24.      Growth and inflation. The growth outlook for 2003 remains clouded by the fallout o f the
political and economic situation in CBte d'Ivoire. Even with a return to peace, overall economic
activity in Burkina Faso will be affected by the time it will take to restart the broken trade links and
for the Ivorian economy to regain momentum. On this basis, the originally projected real growth rate
o f 5.7 percent has been revised downward to 2.6 percent. Primary sector growth potential will be
limited by the already large cereal output in 2001 and 2002, the disruption o f livestock exports and
difficulties for the cotton company to distribute fertilizers and pesticides. Industrial production
(cement, metal products, tires and a variety o f consumer products) inthe area o f Bobo-Dioulasso will
likely be affected by the disruption o f economic links with CBte d'Ivoire for the immediate future.
With industrial production representing about 13 percent o f GDP and an important part o f the formal
economy, declining output could lead to a loss o f income in the formal sector. Trade and services
activities would also suffer from the general slow-down in economic activity. Moreover, the slow-
down in growth, decline in competitiveness and reduced attractiveness for foreign investment will
likely affect the Burkinabe economy beyond 2003. The exogenous pressures from the higher import
costs related to the Ivorian crisis have already resulted in an acceleration o f inflation at end-2002 to
3.9 percent. The inflationary pressures are expected to persist with the continuing closure o f the
border and are projected to result inan average inflationrate o f 4.5 percent in2003.

25.      Public finances and financing requirements.The current economic context will constrain
the government's ability to generate revenues. At the same time the government will attempt to (i)
further increase social spending; (ii)cushion the impact o f the crisis by subsidizing the higher
transport cost component o f fertilizers, estimated at CFAF 2 billion, to avoid a strong reduction in
production o f the main cash crop; (iii)significantly increase spending on road maintenance (by
CFAF 3 billion), to prevent a deterioration o f the main routes to Ghana and Benin and accelerate
payments to small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector; (iv) accommodate the Burkinabe
returning from CBte d'Ivoire by financing their transit and giving immediate humanitarian assistance;
and (v) achieve a considerable reduction in unpaid expenditure commitments and treasury

commitments by end-2003. The fiscal framework for 2003 (Table 2) reflects these cash needs. Since
the fiscal impact o f the Ivorian crisis is significant and leads to clearly identifiable additional
expenditure outlined above, the volume o f PRSC-3 has been increasedby US$10 million, inline with
the second scenario o f the CAS-PR. Out o f total financing requirementso f CFAF 299.4 billion (12.6
percent o f GDP) external financing would cover CFAF 270.2 billion (Table 4). Project disbursements
are expected to reach CFAF 156.4 billion, with estimated program aid from the EU (CFAF 33.2
billion), AfDB (CFAF 21.2 billion) and several bilateral donors (CFAF 16.8 billion) accounting for
another CFAF 71.2 billion.* The residual external financing requirements o f CFAF 37.2 billion (1.6
percent o f GDP) would be covered by the World Bank disbursement under the augmented PRSC-3
and additional bilateral support.'

26.      Monetary and external developments. The financial program builds on a largely
unchanged level o f Burkina Faso's share o f net foreign reserves o f the BCEAO. The slight reduction
inthe government domestic debt would give room for credit to the private sector to expand by more
than 14 percent in 2003. On the external side, the trade deficit i s expected to widen on account o f
crisis-related higher import costs that will outpace the growth in revenues from cotton exports.
However, the expected increase in grant inflows (including the PRSC-3 disbursement from the
World Bank) would allow the current account deficit to narrow slightly to 9.4 percent o f GDP. The
current account deficit would be fully financed by the expected foreign disbursements, debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative, and private capital inflows.

 Support to close the residual financing gap has been pledged by the EU, Canada, and Denmark. France recently
announced its intention to provide budget support inthe future.

27.      Sustainability and regional convergence. Debt relief under the original and enhanced HIPC
Initiatives and the topping-up o f relief at the completion point in 2002 have reduced Burkina Faso's
net present value o f debt-to-export ratio to 150 percent at end-2001. However, the external
vulnerability and the narrow resource base imply that Burkina Faso will depend on considerable
external assistance for the foreseeable future (see also Annex 6). Achieving a sustainable external
and fiscal  deficit would require steady progress in enhancing and diversifying Burkina Faso's
domestic economic resource base. The increasing share o f grant financing (including this operation)
also will ensure that Burkina Faso's debt levels will remain sustainable but, given the limits to
international assistance in the long term, it cannot solve the fundamental issue o f the country's
dependence on external resources unless both grants and credits are used to lay the foundation for
long-term economic development. As regards regional convergence, Burkina Faso has been among
the leaders in the WAEMU in complying with regional directives for trade, notably the common
extemal tariff (CET) introduced in2000. The country is currently pursuingthe implementation o f the
fiscal policy and accounting directives. However, the large external and fiscal resource gaps imply
that Burkina Faso will need some time to meet the convergence criteria for the fiscal deficit and the
current account balance, and the formal sector needs to expand for the country to meet the tax
revenue criterion.

                                          A. Poverty Profile

28.      Existingpoverty analysis is based on the 1994 and 1998 household surveys. A new survey is
currently underway to allow a full update o f the poverty profile in 2003. The new survey will also
provide a clearer indication on the progress made under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 in 2001 and 2002 and
underpin a poverty assessment the Bank will prepare in fiscal year 2004. Between 1994 and 1998
poverty incidence remained broadly stable (see Table 5) despite real growth rates o f abo:;t 5 percent
on average. Limited progress in improving this indicator resulted in part from a sharp increase in
inequality in some areas, particularly non-cotton growing rural areas in the center-south and the
north, as well as all urban areas. Overall, the incidence o f poverty i s significantly higher in rural (51
percent) than urban areas (16 percent) and the income distribution i s highly skewed, with the richest
20 percent o f the population accounting for over 60 percent o f aggregate national income and the
poorest 20 percent accounting for less than 5 percent. Food crop farmers are the group with the
highest poverty rates, and between 1994 and 1998 poverty increased for all socioeconomic groups
except for growers o f cash crops. Moreover, sharp regional disparities inpoverty remain.

                                        B. Poverty Dynamics

29.      Halving poverty rates between 2000 and 2015 is one o f the important goals o f the
Millennium Initiative. Burkina Faso faces quite a few challenges in meeting this objective. The first
difficulty arises from vulnerability to external shocks, which could prevent the country from
sustaining sufficient per-capita growth rates. These shocks include fluctuating climatic conditions,
external price variations, and unstable political conditions inthe subregion. A second challenge arises
from the low overall educational attainment and the limited growth potential o f the traditional rural
economy, where most Burkinab& live. These factors could initially limit the decline in overall
poverty rates, despite sustained growth, because the benefits o f economic growth are unevenly

distributed and are not moving a large enough share o f the population above the poverty line to
quickly reduce overall poverty rates.

30.      In order to better understand the potential dynamic interaction between macroeconomic
developments and poverty, Bank staff recently prepared a poverty analysis macroeconomic simulator
(PAMS) for Burkina Faso that is accompanied by a standard macroeconomic model (RMSM-X).
PAMS can be used for several purposes, including the poverty impact o f a variety o f growth
scenarios and external price shocks, as well as poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) o f certain
reforms." The model has been shared with the Burkinabe authorities as part of the Bank's support
for the PRSPprocess, and the Bank will continue to provide training and technical support for its use.

31.      A few growth scenarios have been simulated with PAMS to investigate the poverty impact of
economic growth and the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire (see also Annex 7 for a more detailed discussion).
PAMS has been calibrated for a poverty rate o f 45 percent in 2000 on the basis o f the I398
household survey and the projection o f developments in 1999 and 2000. It reflects the distribution o f
incomes among socio-economic groups from the household survey. The simulations are based on an
initial macro-economic projection ("initial")            from September 2002 reflecting the continuation o f the
economy on a solid growth path with steady increases in external trade. The second scenario has
been established after the onset o f the Ivorian crisis and reflects the trade-diversion and disruption o f
certain exports, notably livestock, as well as the changes in commodity prices, inparticular higher oil
prices than expected in September 2002. The "shock" scenario assumes an economic recovery in
2004-05 with a return o f exports to pre-crisis levels.

32.      As indicated in Table 6 and Figure 1, even with anticipated stable growth rates o f 5 percent
or more over the 10-year horizon inthe initial projections prepared before the crisis, the progress in
Burkina Faso's poverty rates, although important, would be lessened by rising inequality. The
increase in inequality in the simulations is generated by the assumption o f a limited growth potential
for traditional exports (cotton, live animals) and a diversification o f incomes to less traditional

income sources. Although the simulations take into consideration an increasing urbanization and
participation inthe formal sector, the larger poverty gap inrural areas and the limited growth o f farm
incomes restricts the progress o f the poorest segment o f the population with the largest poverty gap
(see Table 5) and thus limitsthe decline inthe poverty incidence.

33.       A second poverty scenario uses a new macroeconomic framework that reflects the estimated
impact o f the crisis in CGte d'Ivoire on growth and incomes as well as higher petroleum prices and
other changes in the economic environment. The slow-down in growth combined with the assumed
impact o f the closure o f the Ivorian border for livestock exports has a potentially important impact on
rural incomes. Given that the poverty gap in rural areas i s largest and many people are close to the
poverty line, the slow-down in growth and the interruption o f trade could have a significant impact
on poverty rates. Although it is assumed that trade channels will reopen in 2004, the lost output
during the crisis year has a permanent impact on long-term progress in poverty rates, with an
incidence still exceeding initial rates by 4 percentage points 7 years after the impact o f the shock.

34.       The PAMS simulation illustrates the fragile foundation o f the Burkinabe economy for
making quick progress towards the MDG o f halving poverty by 2015. Small shocks, especially to
rural incomes, can have a lasting impact on reducing poverty rates. To meet this challenge, the
government's strategy expressed in its PRSP simultaneously addresses several angles o f income and
inequality. In the growth area, government policies aim at lowering factor costs and creating more
attractive conditions for private investment, as well as diversifyingrural incomes by encouraging the
planting of different crops and encouraging private irrigation, among others. These policies are
accompanied by a special effort to improve education and health services for the poorest areas and
for women in order to permit the most disadvantaged social groups to take advantage o f growth
opportunities and put growth on a broader base. Inthe short term, the government is cushioning some
o f the impact o f the crisis in CGte d'Ivoire through higher transfers to the rural sector, notably by
covering the higher transport costs for fertilizers distributed by the cotton producer organization.
Further improvements could be made in developing targeted social protection mechanisms for the
most vulnerable groups o f the population.

35.       Links between growth, poverty rates and inequality are focal areas for Bank economic and
sector work in 2003-04. Bank staff is currently finalizing a study on risk and vulnerability that will

help in identifyingtargeted measures for the population most exposed to shocks. On the basis o f the
new household survey, Bank staff will also prepare a poverty assessment in 2004 to take stock o f
developments in 1994-2003 and improve the understanding o f the poverty-growth linkages,
including through updates o f the PAMS model. The poverty assessment will also look at the
information on poverty links to gender, household characteristics and educational attainment, and
will provide useful input for a revision of the government's growth strategy and the Bank's country
economic memorandum planned for 2005.

                              A. PRSPImplementationin2000-2002

36.     The 2000 PRSP is grouped around four thematic pillars (i)accelerating broad-based growth;
(ii)promotingaccesstosocialservices; (iii)increasingemploymentandincome-generatingactivities
for the poor; and (iv) promoting good governance. In their joint staff assessment o f the PRSP, the
staffs o f the Bank and Fund considered the strategy to be well founded, with a sound diagnostic
base." The subsequent translation o f the strategy into budgetary priorities was facilitated by the
introduction o f program budgets and a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). However,
although the PRSP included a set o f costed investment programs, it did not elaborate a set o f priority
policy actions. The PRSP remained therefore largely a document o f broad policy orientation and the
underlying policies to achieve its objectives needed to be fleshed out further through additional
exchanges with the authorities, including through the preparation o fthe PRSCs.

37.      As laid out in the first and second annual PRSP progress reports, the record o f PRSP
implementation in 2000-01 has been mixed.12 On the positive side, despite adverse external
developments, the government has been able to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework in
2000-02. However insufficient domestic revenue mobilization following a drought and delays in
receipt o f donor disbursements disrupted the implementation o f the budget in 2000-01, and the
execution o f expenditure financed with HIPC debt relief was initially slow. The 2000 drought also
had a considerable impact on the livelihood o f a large part o f the population and its impact on
poverty could only partially be compensated with food assistance. As laid out more fully below,
steady progress was made in implementing institutional and structural reforms, notably in the area o f
public finance management. As to the area o f financial control and fight against corruption, changes
to the legislative framework have been made and now need to be fully implemented to bear full fruit.
Inother areasthe pace ofreforms remainedbehindearlier ambitions, inparticular as regards private
sector involvement in electricity generation and telecommunication services. In addition, in the
growth area a comprehensive agricultural development strategy to underpinthe government's efforts
infavor o fdiversification is still under preparation.

38.      Some notable progress was made in improving social indicators but as a result o f the
fluctuating climatic conditions and unsteady public expenditure execution, some targets could not be
met (Table 7). Slow execution o f school construction projects, delays in implementing the ten-year
basic education development project (PDDEB), and drought-related higher opportunity costs for
sending children to school resulted in smaller-than-expected progress in raising school enrollment
rates, which went up from 41 percent in 1999 to 43 percent in 2001. Health center staffing and prices
o f essential drugs improved and met their targets. Impressive gains were made between 1999 and
2001invaccination rates for diphtheria-tetanus-cholera-polio (DTCP3) and measles, which increased
from 42 to 64 percent and from 53 to 65 percent, respectively. However, more efforts are needed to
encourage demand for curative care by increasing the size and execution rate o f deconcentrated
budgets, verifying the application o f reductions in health fees and drugs, and meeting health center
staffingnorms.

39.      During the first two years o f implementation of the PRSP, difficulties of monitoring and
evaluating progress on the basis o f a narrow set o f outcome or impact indicators became evident. It
became clear that the selected indicators changed little on an annual basis and were subject to factors
outside the government's control. Moreover, the overall impact on poverty rates i s only available
every 3-4 years with an updated household survey. The government recognized this fact and began a
consultative process on broadening indicators, operating through the national observatory for poverty
and sustainable development (ONAPAD) o f the donor-supported Program for the Reinforcement o f
Economic Governance. The extended list o f indicators should lay the foundation o f improvements
for the monitoring and evaluation system for the new PRSP, and will also be linked to future PRSCs.
As regards the government's PRSP monitoring system, certain weaknesses, such as irregular
meetings o f sectoral groups and some confusion about their role, will need to be addressed to put the
PRSP monitoring and the preparation o f the revised PRSP on a sound footing. The reorganization o f
the government should give an opportunity to the newly created Ministry o f Economy and
Development to focus mainly on the PRSP and strengthen monitoring and analytical underpinnings.

                              B. Progressand ChallengesinMeetingthe MDGs

40.      The MillenniumDevelopment agenda (see box 1)to reduce poverty, increase schooling rates,
lower mortality rates, fight communicable diseases, and improve sanitary conditions i s reflected in
the objectives o f the PRSP. However, the horizon o f the MDGs goes generally beyond the horizon o f
the PRSP.

41.      Progress towards the goal o f reducing poverty rates has already been discussed in the
previous section in some detail. However, it is important to keep in mind that the income poverty
measure used by the Burkinabb statistical services, to which the previous section refers, does not
correspond to the measure o f $1 per day. The 1998 poverty line o f CFAF 72,690 per year and person
represents about $0.34 per day. Accordingly, poverty rates based on an unadjusted measure o f $1 per




                                                            15

day would be much higher and would exceed 90 percent o f the p~pulation.'~ measure adjusted for   A
purchasing power parity o f the US$ would still show poverty rates above 50 percent. In light o f the
poverty dynamics outlined above, halving this figure by 2015 constitutes a formidable challenge and
the goal is unlikely to be met despite satisfactory policy implementation and strong donor support for
the PRSP.


                                     Box 1: The MillenniumDevelopmentGoals

      Goal 1targets: Halve, between 1990and2015, the proportionof people whose incomeis less than one dollar aday.
      Halve, between 1990and2015, the proportionofpeoplewho suffer from hunger.

      Goal 2 target: Ensurethat, by 2015, childreneverywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course
      of primaryschooling.

      Goal 3 target: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondaryeducationpreferablyby 2005 and to all levelsof
      educationno later than2015.

      Goal 4 target: Reduceby two-thirds, between 1990and2015, the under-fivemortality rate.

      Goal 5 target: Reduceby three-quarters, between1990and 2015, the maternalmortality ratio.

      Goal 6 targets: Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS. Have halted by 2015, and
      begunto reverse, the incidence ofmalariaand other major diseases.

      Goal 7 targets: Integratethe principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reverse
      the loss of environmental resources. Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe
      drinking water. By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum
      dwellers.

      Goal 8 targets: Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatorytrading and financial system.
      Addressthe SpecialNeeds of the Least DevelopedCountries.Address the special needs of landlockedcountries and
      small island developing states. Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through
      national and international measures ir order to make debt sustainable in the long term. In cooperation with
      developing countries, develop and implement strategies for decent and productive work for youth. In cooperation
      with pharmaceuticalcompanies, provideaccess to affordable, essentialdrugs in developingcountries. Incooperation
      with the private sector, makeavailablethe benefits of new technologies, especially informationand communications.



42.       Inthe education sector, attainment of the MDGs to reach universal primary education and
eliminate gender differences also poses unique challenges (see also Annex 8). As outlined in the
PRSP and its progress reports, school enrollment rates were very low in 2001, even by sub-Saharan
standards, and considerable regional and gender inequality in schooling persisted, although all
indicators had progressed significantly over the 1990s. The ten-year basic education development
program (PDDEB) the government began implementing in 2001 sets out to increase school
enrollment rates from around 40 percent to 70 percent in 2011. It aims at (i)eliminating supply
constraints through school construction and hiring o f additional teachers; (ii)reducing demand
constraints by improving the quality o f the school environment and lowering direct costs o f
education; (iii)creating the institutional capacity for effective and sustained implementation o f
policies; and (iv) targeting girls and zones with lowest enrollment rates to remove regional and
gender differences. However, the resources committed to primary education under the PDDEB



l3This fact shouldnot be surprising consideringthe per capitaincome levelo f $230 in2001 andthe skewedincome
distribution.


                                                              16

would not have been sufficient to reach the MDGs in the sector. In light o f its well defined strategy
and sufficient policy implementation, Burkina Faso qualified for the "Education For All - Fast
Track" (EFA) Initiative in 2002 and can count on additional grant support to accelerate the
implementation o f the PDDEB and make faster progress toward the MDGs. With resource
constraints being lifted as a result o f additional external support under EFA, the challenge is to
reinforce the capacity and create an enabling administrative environment to successfully implement
the government's strategy.

43.      As regards the health sector, meeting the MDGs for child and maternal mortality rates will
require a considerable change in past trends (see Annex 9). Latest available data shows that little
progress, if any, has been made inthe 1990s for child and maternal mortality rates. Moreover, health
outcomes in Burkina Faso remain below those in comparable sub-Saharan African countries despite
similar allocations o f resources, which points at inefficiencies in the use o f funds. The Burkinabe
health care system i s characterized by low access, poor coverage, low quality o f care, large
inequalities, and a skewed allocation o f health personnel in favor o f urban areas. Accordingly, the
ten-year national health development program (PNDS) o f the government attempts to address these
issues by (i)lowering barriers to health and nutrition service to the poor; (ii)improving quality and
utilization o f health service; (iii)strengthening communicable disease control; and (iv) reinforcing
capacity and human resource policies. Growing budgetary resources, includingHIPC-related savings,
were devoted to the health sector (see Table 3) under the PNDS-after      a decline in the late 1990s-
and served to expand the supply o f health services (i.e., construction o f health centers and advanced
medical centers, and increase in staff) and to reduce the cost o f services, including the free
vaccination o f children. Further improvements o f equity and efficiency will be needed to make
progress in outcome indicators. As regards HIV-AIDS, Burkina Faso belongs to the countries with
the highest infectionrates inWest Africa. The government has shown strong commitment to stop the
spread o f HIV-AIDS in line with the MDGs and implements since 2001 an IDA-supported project
using a community-driven approach. The project is also supporting anti-retroviral therapy. Other
communicable diseases such as malaria have been addressed through targeted initiatives for
preventive measures but efforts need to be stepped up further.

44.      The environmentaland sanitation targets also will need attention from the government to
make progress. Increasing population pressures and urbanization will lead to large additional
investmentsneeds for water supply facilities and require increased attention to environmental issues
to ensure that Burkina Faso's development remains sustainable. Sanitation and water issues are a
focal issue under the PRSP agenda and the government i s implementing a multi-donor financed
project for the expansion o f water supply to the capital city Ouagadougou. Capacity building for
environmental safeguards has also been included as one o f the objectives under the PRSC series, and
the government has developed plans to fight soil degradation and desertification. However, to reach
the MDGs more emphasis will need to be given to the environmental sustainability o f current
policies.

           C. The 2000 Country Assistance Strategy and Bank Supportto the PRSP

45.      The November 2000 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is closely aligned with the June
2000 PRSP. The 2003 CAS-PR confirms the strategic orientation o f the 2000 CAS for an interim
period until the new PRSP can be finalized. The 2000 CAS aims at supporting the government's
efforts to achieve sustained high growth rates, reduce the high incidence o f poverty, and improve the
nutrition, health, and education outcomes o f the rural population. Specific objectives are (i)



                                                   17

supporting policies and programs aimed at improving the supply side o f the economy to allow for
sustained, broad-based and export-oriented growth; (ii)improving public finance management to
increase the flow o f resources to poverty-reducing activities; and (iii)ensuring that the allocation
process and public spending goals place special emphasis on social services.

46.      In supporting the implementation of the PRSP, the 2000 CAS proposes an increase in IDA
resources for programmatic lending under PRSCs. Programmatic lending represents almost 30
percent o f the Bank portfolio proposed in the 2000 CAS, up from 18 percent in the 1997 CAS.
PRSCs were conceived as primary instrument for (i)addressing budget management and public
finance management issues; (ii)ensuring the dialogue on programs and budgetary allocations to
reach the PRSP targets in the social sectors, with the health sector being exclusively covered by
PRSCs since the closure o f two health projects in2001; and (iii)covering cross-cutting growth issues
involving several sectors and ministries. The additional lending instruments proposed by the CAS
support other aspects o f the government's poverty reduction program.I4 Inthe social sectors, PRSCs
are complemented with an investment project for basic education with a capacity buildingcomponent
to support the implementation o f the ten-year education project (PDDEB) and to lay the foundation
for increasing the resource flow through the budget in the latter part o f the ten-year plan. A post-
secondary education project addresses the development needs o f secondary and higher education, and
an HIV-AIDS disaster response project underpins the government's strategy in damming the spread
of the disease and treating the infected. In the growth area, a technical assistance project for
competitiveness and enterprise development supports the implementation o f the divestiture,
regulatory reform, and enterprise development agenda o f the government. Furthermore, the Bank's
portfolio includes three rural sector investment credits-a              community-driven rural development
project (PNGT2), a private irrigation project, and an agricultural services project (PNDSA2)-which
use specific instruments to directly encourage small-scale activity at the local level in line with the
third PRSP pillar. Further, to address large-scale infrastructure needs, the Bank portfolio includes
investment operations in water supply, urban development, mining, and transport. The water and
transport project are closely coordinated and integrated with support from bilateral donors, notably
the EuropeanUnion (EU).

47.      A series o f three PRSCs was designed in 2001 (see Figure 2) on the basis o f a significant
amount o f analytical work undertaken in 1999-2001, including a study on competitiveness and
economic growth, a country financial accountability assessment (CFAA), a country procurement
assessment report (CPAR), and a number o f public expenditure reviews (PERs), notably in the area
of health and ed~cati0n.I~The PRSCs-developed in line with the policy framework o f the PRSP
and on the basis o f the rich body o f analytical work-focused                on two broad areas: public sector
reform and governance and sectoral policies for the poor. The first component, reflecting objectives
of the first and fourth PRSP pillar, included strengthening o f the budgetary process, improving audit
functions, revising procurement regulations, introducing budget deconcentration, and reforming the
civil service. The second component, based on PRSP pillars 2 and 3, incorporated measures to
improve service delivery in education and health and strengthen income-generating agricultural
activities, The supported measures were perceived as inputs for improving economic management
and social service delivery, considered to be essential to reach PRSP objectives.

48.    Under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 a number o f different policy measures were implemented, which
are presented in Table 8. The immediate results o f these policy actions could be summarized as
follows:

        0  Budget formulation. Significant progress was made in mastering the preparation o f
           MTEFs, which have been established regularly since 2000. Moreover, program budgets
           linkingPRSP objectives with budget allocations were established in all key ministries.
           Budget formulation       in several sectors (education,     health,  infrastructure, rural
           development) benefited from public expenditure reviews as analytical basis for
           improvements in budget efficiency. However, in 2000-01, weaknesses remained with the
           realism o f the revenue projections under MTEFs and their integration into the budget
           preparation cycle. The limited capacity for formulating expenditure programs linked to
           PRSP objectives also resulted in a mixed quality o f program budgets, especially in
           sectors without a long-term sectoralprogram.
        0  Budget execution. Burkina Faso fully operationalized a computerized expenditure
           management system in 1999-2000. The system captures all domestically financed
           expenditure at the different stages o f the expenditure process (engagement, liquidation,
           mandatement, paiement) and allows to closely monitor the execution o f the budget and
           the level o f payment obligations. Moreover, the legal framework was created to delegate
           credits to regions and provinces and to deconcentrate the powers for the issuance o f
           payment orders. However, for technical reasons the payment orders continued to be
           issued inthe capital city Ouagadougou.
           Procurement. Roles for the different ministerial departments were clarified by the
           government, and a new procurement decree was prepared and adopted. The terms o f
           reference for the preparation o f a manual o f procedures and the audit o f 2001
           procurement were drafted and an action plan for capacity building was drawn up.
           However, the new procurement decree had some s5ortcomings that were addressed inthe
           final version adopted inMay 2003.
        0  Budget reporting and good governance. The government caught up with its legal
           obligation to submit budget execution reports to the audit court for the years 1996-2000.
           To strengthen external controls, an independent Supreme Audit Court was created and
           the resources were made available to make the court fully operational in 2002. The
           CFAA was finalized and its recommendations were integrated into the new budget
           management reform plan (Plan d 'actionpour le renforcement de la gestion budge'taire or
           PRGB) adopted in July 2002. A good governance plan was prepared and a highauthority
           for the fight against corruption was created.
        0  Civil service reform. The development o f the computerized civil service payroll and
           salary management system was finalized. However, inconsistencies remained for about
           9000 cases between the files o f the Ministry o f Civil Service and Ministry o f Finance,
           which needed to be resolved.
        0  Policy monitoring and evaluation. A new list o f PRSP monitoring indicators was
           prepared in2002 that was used to expand the list o f indicators inthe second annual PRSP
           progress report.

       0  Education. In preparing for the roll-out o f the PDDEB, a number o f measures laid the
          ground to achieve a significant increase in supply o f education services at sustainable
          expenditure levels. These measures include the end o f automatic hiring o f graduates o f
          ENEP into the civil service and the preparation o f delegation o f human resource
           management decisions to the regional level. The government continued the preferences in
          terms o f school supplies for the 20 provinces with lowest enrollment rates and increased
          the number o f schools with sanitary facilities.
       0  Health. A new national health development strategy was adopted in 1999. The
          vaccination program was successfully continued. Prices o f essential generic drugs were
          reduced through a reduction o f the profit margins o f the National DrugProcurement and
          Distribution Company (CAMEG). The government hired additional health staff to
           increase staffing levels in health centers.
       0  Rural Development.A strategy for a stepwise opening o f the sector was prepared. As a
          first step, the legal monopoly o f SOFITEX was removed and an action plan for the
          opening o f the sector for private investors was established. Several studies for the
          diversification o f crops were either undertaken or proposed for future consideration.
       0  Environment. A national plan for training in environmental issues was adopted and the
          different role o f actors inthis area was clarified.

49.     The policy measures supported under the PRSC series were designed by the government to
achieve key PRSP output and impact indicators. Table 9 presents the set o f indicators established at
the time PRSC-1 was presented to the Executive Board. These indicators overlap with the PRSP
monitoring and evaluation framework inthe health and education sectors (see Table 7).16 It should be
noted that achievements to date, notably in education and health, reflect data available for 2001. A
full evaluation of the PRSP-PRSC program in 2000-03 can only be finalized with a certain lag in
2004-05. The most impressive gains in terms o f outcomes have been made in vaccination coverage
after a very focused campaign that began under the closed health project. Additional results o f the
first two PRSCs include an increasing share o f the budget o f the social sectors that is executed on a
deconcentrated level, a return to regular reporting on budget outcomes and their publication in PRSP
progress reports, as well as a modest increase in school enrollment rates. However, in general the
progress has been slower than envisaged, in part because o f weak revenue performance and
disruption o f budget execution due to slow disbursement o f donor funds in 2001, illustrating the
generally fragile situation o f the Burkinab& economy and the resulting risks for PRSP
implementation.

50.     As regards gender issues, the PRSP and previous PRSCs have focused on improving gender-
related social indicators, most importantly female school enrollment rates and maternal mortality
rates. For example, in the education sector, expanding the availability o f school meals and
constructing sanitary facilities were intended to facilitate female school enrollment. In the health
sector, free provision o f pre-natal services was introduced to reduce the incidence o f mortality at
child birth and identify problem pregnancies early. However, although female enrollment rates have
progressed in 2001 and 2002, the gap to male enrollment rates has not been closed. The impact o f
lower costs o f maternal health services has yet to be measured. In order to more directly address
gender issues, the government intends to address gender issues explicitly in the forthcoming PRSP
revision. Bank staff i s currently preparing a gender assessment, which could inform the government's
PRSP revision as well as future PRSCs.

                          E. DonorCollaborationinSupportingthe PRSP

51.     The PRSCs have been part o f a concerted effort o f donors to provide a larger part o f
assistance through programmatic support with a view to enhance ownership and reinforce the
country's capacity. Under the leadership o f the EU, which committed euro 125 million o f budgetary
assistance for 2002-2004,        several other bilateral donors (Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden) signed a memorandum o f understanding to create the group for harmonization
o f budget support (soutien budgktuire concert&-SBC). The Bank and the third largest donor AfDB
could not formally sign this memorandum in light o f the definition o f disbursement conditions
conflicting with the Bank's PRSC guidelines and the AfDB's programmatic lending operations.
However the Bank has worked as a very close associate to the SBC, participated in almost all
meetings o f this group, and coordinated the PRSC with SBC members and other donors present in
Burkina Faso. In particular, the PRSC team regularly exchanged views on the PRSP and program
implementation, shared its written conclusions with the donor community, and donors were invited
by the government to participate in recent Bank and joint Bank-IMF missions. The coordination
ensured consistency o f supported measures and avoided duplication o f government reporting efforts.
Bank staff i s currently seeking ways to broaden the specifications o f the memorandum o f

understanding so that the Bank might become one o f its full members for future programmatic
operations.

52.      The differences between bilaterals and the Bank arise largely as a result o f different
approaches for measuring progress inpolicy implementation. Currently, the Bank and the AfDB link
their disbursement to measurable policy inputs whereas the EU focuses on progress in PRSP
outcome indicators-such     as vaccination rates and school enrollment rates. In particular, the EU
disburses its budget support in two tranches: the first tranche o f a fixed amount is linked to good
macroeconomic performance, evidenced by the IMF's PRGF program remaining on track; and the
second tranche varies based on the level o f certain PRSP outcome indicators. The EU has typically
disbursed about two-thirds o f its variable tranche. The Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland are
providing direct budget support mainly linked to the IMF reviews under the PRGF and a satisfactory
annual review o f progress in implementing the PRSP. The Belgian Cooperation offered parallel
financing for PRSC-2for approximately US$5 million.

53.      The disbursement criteria usedby the Bank and the SBC group are both fully consistent with
the PRSP approach. The PRSP broadly defines a set o f government policies for achieving a number
o f results. Implementation o f the PRSP can thus be measured by successful policy implementation
and by the achievement o f results. Nonetheless, the relationship between policies and results can be
distorted by exogenous factors and, as outlined in the previous section, is subject to important lags.
Moreover, despite overall consistency o f the framework, the government-driven PRSP process could
still give further impetus in 2003 for a closer harmonization o f support by providing a tighter link o f
government policies with the input and impact indicators o f the monitoring and evaluation
framework. The forthcoming revision o f the PRSP therefore should help to further enhance the
coherence o f donor interventions by including a clearly defined set o f priority policy measures and
related indicators.

   V.      THE PROPOSEDTHIRD POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION

                                       A. Contextof PRSC-3

54.      The proposed PRSC-3 would be the third operation to support the implementation o f the
2000 PRSP. The PRSC-3 builds on the analytical work undertaken for PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 and the
policy areas identified in previous operations as key issues to make progress in attaining PRSP
objectives. Accordingly, the proposed PRSC-3 maintains public sector reform and sectoral policies
for the poor as its two main components. PRSC-3 supports a series o f measures that build closely on
the achievements under PRSC-1and PRSC-2 (Table 8) and move increasingly to more output-related
actions.

55.      The proposed PRSC-3 aligns itself closely with the 2003 budget. The 2003 budget, approved
by the national assembly in December 2002 and amended by a supplementary budget law in May
2003, is consistent with PRSP objectives. The amended budget law i s an appropriate response to the
changes in the macroeconomic environment after the onset o f the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire. It remains
fully aligned with the PRSP.

56.      As outlined in detail in the following two sections, the progress made so far by the
government in implementing its poverty reduction strategy and the related reform program fully
justify moving to PRSC-3. Triggers for moving to PRSC-3 were established in the program
document for PRSC-2. As discussed in more detail below (Table        lo), before presenting PRSC-3 to
the Executive Board, all but one o f the triggers were met fully or in large part. The single trigger that
was not met had to be postponed to a later date to allow a close alignment with other donors
supporting the government in designing personnel incentives in the health sector. Moreover, a
substantial body o f additional reform measures has been taken that demonstrates the government's
ownership and d :termination inpursuingthe program outlined inits PRSP.

                             B. Public Sector Reformand Governance

57.      Budget formulation. After the introduction of MTEFs and program budgets under PRSC-1
and PRSC-2, the government hlly integrated the MTEF and program budget preparation into its
annual budget cycle in 2002. The MTEF was prepared in March 2002 and established the ceilings
used to notify line ministries in the May 2002 budget circular about their spending limits for 2003
and the ceilings for the 2003 program budgets. The 2003 finance law and program budgets were
adopted by the council o f ministers in September 2002 and voted by the national assembly in
December 2002. The finance law i s fully consistent with the priorities o f the PRSP. Notably, the
budget incorporates an increase in allocations for social sectors (Table 3) in order to meet the school
enrollment targets, further improve vaccination rates, and lower the cost o f curative care. Allocations
to the social sectors were protected in the subsequent supplementary finance law, approved by the
national assembly inMay 2003. An action plan for the 2004-06 MTEF exercise was prepared inearly
2003, and the 2004-06 MTEF was elaborated and adopted by the government in April 2003. The
trigger inthis area was accordingly met.

58.     The government could usefully strengthen the credibility o f the budget planning exercise in
2003-04. Revenue projections in the finance law still tend to be optimistic and thus expenditure
envelopes are overstated often requiring cutbacks during budget execution. Nonetheless, overall the
projections have become much more realistic over time and the value o f the MTEF as a medium-
term planning instrument has increased greatly. Evenwhen spending cuts from the finance law were
necessary in the past under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, the government has consistently protected priority
expenditure. Budget execution rates for domestically financed expenditure inthe social sectors were
high, exceeding 90 percent inbasic education and 95 percent inhealth in2001 (Table 9), with similar
rates achieved in2002.

59.     The government has taken several steps under PRSC-3 to lay the foundation for a further
improvement in budget formulation. The systematic follow-up on public expenditure reviews (PER)
i s now being assured by a standing committee. The latter also prepares a program for future PERs
and supervises their execution. For 2003, reviews o f the Ministry o f Higher Education and the
Ministry o f Justice are being envisaged, as well as updates to the health and basic education PERs
undertaken in 2000. As regards program budgets, a note was prepared on the government's
experience with this instrument. It will underpin further analytical work, including a forthcoming
global PER piloted by Bank staff, to focus government activity on improving the quality o f program
budgets inareas with the largest impact on achieving PRSP objectives.

60.     Budget execution and deconcentration. The government has made very good progress
under PRSC-3 to make the computerized expenditure management system (CID) more
comprehensive and allow a deconcentration o f budget execution. The CID was conceived originally
to cover domestically financed budgetary expenditure. As a first step, the CID was expanded in
2001-02 to cover also expenditure financed with the special HIPC account. Under PRSC-2, the CID
was linkedto the cooperation directorate (DGCOOP) in order to capture foreign-financed investment
expenditure in the CID. However, despite the establishment o f a computer link between the
DGCOOP and the CID and the training o f DGCOOP personnel, the CID was not fed with the
necessary information to produce reliable information on foreign-financed spending. To align
procedures and concentrate the disbursement functions for foreign-financed investment spending, the
Minister o f Finance decided to transfer the supervision of project disbursements from the DGCOOP
to the budget directorate (DGB) and the treasury and public accounting directorate (DGTCP) in
2003. Currently, data on project grants and loans are being reestablished and the full integration o f
project disbursements into regular budget execution procedures and the CID i s planned for the 2004
budget. As regards the planned extension o f the CID to the debt management system SYGADE, the
software and hardware have to be upgraded before proceeding with the integration. Establishing the
connection to the CID therefore had to be deferred.

61.     In order to support the deconcentration process, issuance o f payment orders on the regional
level began on a pilot basis in Bobo-Dioulasso in April 2003. As part o f the effort to move budget
execution closer to the beneficiaries, speed up execution, and improve service delivery, the
government had begun a process o f budget deconcentration (the execution o f the central budget on
the regional and provincial level) under PRSC-1 and PRSC-2. These previous operations prepared
the ground for delegating budgetary credits to regions and provinces and issuingpayment orders on
the regional and provincial level. However, the lack o f access to the CID outside the capital city
limited the practical impact o f budget deconcentration. Although budget officers on the provincial
and regional level could commit and verify expenditure, payment orders could only be issued in
Ouagadougou. To actively pursue budget deconcentration while maintaining spending control, the
Minister o f Finance issued instructions for the execution o f delegated budget credits in September


                                                 37

2002 and ministry staff prepared a feasibility study for extending the CID to the second-largest city
Bobo-Dioulasso. On the basis o f the study, changes to the CID interface were installed and a
computer link was established between Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou. Since April 2003, the
linkhas been actively usedto issue payment orders on the regional level and the related trigger was
met.

62.     The government also took the first steps for the establishment o f a computerized integrated
revenue management system (CIR). A study for its establishment was completed in 2002 and the
government has contracted out the preparation o f a concept for the CIR.

63.     Procurement. In 2003, the government undertook an important reinforcement o f the
procurement framework and mostly met the different measures included under the procurement
trigger. The CPAR prepared in 2000 identified several weaknesses in Burkina Faso's procurement
system, among them the legal framework. A sound legal basis for public procurement and respect o f
procedures are essential to making good use o f public resources. However a first attempt to revise the
procurement regulation for PRSC-2 in2002 was unsatisfactory and neededfurther work. Therefore, a
high level working group for procurement reform was created in December 2002 and a new decree
meeting the standards o f best international practice was prepared under its supervision. The decree
was adopted by the council o f ministers on May 7,2003.

64.     Inaddition to the new decree, the government implementeda variety o fmeasures to improve
procurement mechanisms under PRSC-3. In December 2002, the Minister o f Finance issued an
instruction to line ministries to prepare a procurement work plan for 2003. This plan has been
implemented successfully since the beginning o f 2003 and resulted in a faster execution of
investment spending, particularly as regards priority and HIPC-related expenditure. On the basis o f
the terms o f reference prepared for PRSC-2, a consultant was contracted to prepare a manual o f
procedures for the new procurement code. A draft o f the manual was received by the government in
June 2003 and will be adopted shortly. Likewise, a capacity building plan for procurement has been
drafted by a consultant and submitted to the government in June 2003. As regards an audit o f
procurement contracts for 2001 to identify weaknesses and inform the future reform agenda, the
government accepted an offer from the EU in late 2002 to fully fund the audit. In view o f the
significant size o f the contract, the selection o f an audit firm is still under way, with the opening o f
the bids scheduled for end-June 2003. The results o fthe audit are expected for end-2003.

65.     Public financial management. The 2002 CFAA, prepared by a group o f donors under Bank
leadership, the HIPC accountability assessment and action plan (AAP), and the government's own
2001 action plan for budget management reform are the analytical underpinnings for the
improvement o f financial resource management. In this respect, the 2002-04 action plan for the
improvement o f budget management (Plan d'actionpour le renforcement de la gestion budge`taire or
PRGB)was approved by the council o f ministers inJuly 2002. It incorporates and operationalizesthe
recommendations of the different studies and its satisfactory implementation, as measured by a set o f
agreed indicators, was a condition for moving to PRSC-3.17 Overall, the government implemented
the PRGB in a satisfactory manner and met the trigger in this area. In particular, the government
implemented the following measures:




"AsregardsthespecificmeasuresincludedintheHIPC-AAP,Annex12givesanupdateontheirimplementation.



                                                     38

                The budget execution reports for the years 1995 to 2000 were forwarded to the
                national assembly after their examination by the Supreme Audit Court, which had
                become fully operational in 2002. The national assembly adopted the reports after an
                intense debate in May 2003. The budget execution report for 2001 was examined by
                the council o f ministers in April 2003 and forwarded for evaluation to the Supreme
                Audit Court.
                A new organic budget law, in line with regional guidelines, was approved by the
                national assembly in January 2003. The law lays the foundation for the application o f
                the new budget classification by 2004, the changes to the chart o f accounts, and the
                fiscal accounting framework necessary to comply with regional guidelines.
            0   The government defined a timetable for the closure of budget operations for 2002
                and closed the budget management system for further commitments o f material and
                services spending at end-November 2002. However, the ongoing commitment o f
                investment expenditure and approval o f exceptional requests related to the Ivorian
                crisis continued until year-end. As a result, as mentioned earlier, the government
                could not reduce the expenditure commitments for which payment orders had not
                been issued in 2002. In early 2003, a number o f unpaid expenditures were cancelled
                and recommitted under the 2003 budget exercise. In 2003-04, the government could
                usefully draw on this experience and more systematically enforce the closure o f
                budget operations.
            0   Legal opinions were sought out to define an administrative procedure for the budget
                accounts (comptes de gestion) before 2002. The procedure is necessary to define
                opening balances for 2002 accounts and to regularly produce the accounts for
                submission to the Supreme Audit Court starting in2003.
            0   A draft decree was preparedto strengthen the role o f inspectors for the General State
                Inspectorate (IGE) and General Finance Inspectorate (IGF). The adoption o f the
                decree has been delayed to design a consistent framework for all bodies involved in
                external control, including the newly created high authority fc- the coordination o f
                the fight against corruption, which has the right to follow-up on findings of IGE and
                IGF and to order independent investigations. Its members were named only in late
                April 2003. IGE and IGF continue to be involved with donor audits by exploiting
                their results or, inthe case o f UNDP, participating directly inaudits..

66.     Civil service reform and decentralization. The decentralization agenda has gained new
momentum in 2003. After little progress in 2001-02, the government has chosen a procedure o f
stepwise deconcentration o f budgetary and personnel management to transfer capacity to the
regional, provincial, and local level. The capacity building o f decentralized units is essential to
permit the decentralization process to reap the intended benefits o f improved service delivery and
closer scrutiny o f government priorities.

67.     The Ministry o f Decentralization and Regional Administration (MATD) prepared revisions
for the 1998 decentralization laws (TOD) and texts for their operationalization. Intotal 35 draft texts
were identified for adoption in 2003 by an ad hoc committee for the implementation o f the TOD, o f
which 26 passed the committee by end-May 2003 for further consideration by the government.
Among these i s a draft law to change the TOD by defining the department as being equivalent to a
rural community, which allows to cover the entire territory with rural communities. The revision will
establish the conditions for holding local elections in 2003, as planned. A draft decree establishes the
framework for a transfer o f personnel to deconcentrated and decentralized authorities, which to a



                                                   39

certain extent has already been anticipated by the deconcentration o f education staff. 4 texts were
approved by the council o f ministers in March 2003 and prepared the ground for the nomination o f
governors for the 13 regions by defining the role and attribution o f the deconcentratedauthorities and
specifying the organization o f the governor's office.'*

68.      In the area of civil service reform, the government has reinforced the policies of the public
sector reform law of 1998. The previous introduction o f a merit-based personnel management system
had not been successful because many job descriptions were not prepared. In the meantime, the
Ministry o f Civil Service has trained personnel managers in the new system and the council of
ministers issued new instructions in September 2002 for applying the system in 2003. Two decrees
adopted by the council o f ministers inApril 2003 further clarify the setting o f objectives for different
administrations and the evaluation and grading o f civil servants. The Ministry o f Civil Service has
also received additional resources to finalize the unified personnel database. Inconsistent or missing
personnel files for about 9,000 civil servants hampered progress and the files o f these employees still
needed to be reconciled. It i s expected that most o f these inconsistencies can be resolved in 2003 to
fully operationalize the unified database o f the integrated system for the administrative and salary
management o f government personnel (SIGASPE).

69.      PRSP monitoring and evaluation. The planned complete update of the PRSP in 2003
underscores the importance o f solid new data on poverty. For this purpose, the government has
launched a new household survey in April 2003. In the first wave o f the survey during April-June,
household welfare indicators a being collected and first results should become available by July
2003. The survey will continue with two more waves to gain a more comprehensive picture on
household expenditure and will include modules on cotton and health that will permit to more closely
study the poverty and social impact o f certain reforms. The government also conducted a
participatory poverty assessment (PPA) that was completed in March 2003 and will complement
household survey data with qualitative results. As outlined above, in the area o f poverty-growth
linkages, the government has benefited from technical assistance by the Bank. A RMSM-X macro-
model was fitted to Burkina Faso and a poverty analysis macro simulator (PAMS) was then
calibrated for Burkina Faso on the basis o f 1998 household data to analyze the impact o f different
growth paths derived from the RMSM-X.

                                      C. Sectoral Policies for the Poor

70.      Basic education.The government's program for improving indicators o f basic education has
been outlined in the PDDEB. The PDDEB i s fully aligned with the PRSP and being supported by a
Bank investment project and the PRSCs. Budget allocations for the education sector in 2003 include
a further increase from domestic and HIPC resources (Table 3) and have been aligned with the
objectives o f the PDDEB. The 2003 budget also continues to pay particular attention to increasing
resources for the most deprived areas by making special allocations for the 20 provinces with lowest
schooling rates. Accordingly, the trigger for the education sector was met. The government's strategy
includes strong measures to increase supply o f education services inrural areas through major efforts
inschool construction and hiringofnew teachers. Itmakes use ofthe changes undertaken in2001-02


'*Burkina  Faso has 13 regions and 45 provinces. Regions (headed by governors) have no independent budgets and
represent the central government. Provinces have a double function o f deconcentrated powers (with the high
commissioners representingthe central government) and decentralized units (a provincial advisory council allocates
the limited own resources of the province).

inthe regulation ofthe education sector, after extensive consultationswith unions, to reduceprimary
teacher training to one year, end the automatic link between teacher training and entry into civil
service, and hire teachers at a salary level that is both comparable to other African countries and
sustainable in the long run. Moreover, with the 2002-03 school year the MEBA has begun the
deconcentration o f teaching positions and attached the budgetary posts o f more than 1000 new
teachers to regional education directorates. Inorder to speed up the execution o f school construction,
the government has removed bottlenecks by broadening the set o f supervisory agencies and it is
planning to move the responsibility for execution and supervision o f construction to the provincial
directorates o f the MEBA.

71.     The measures on the supply side are accompanied by measures to lower direct and
opportunity costs o f sending children to school through provision o f free books, construction o f
sanitary facilities in schools, and installation o f school canteens managed by parents. Under the
PDDEB, MEBA has also been at the forefront o f the budget deconcentration process to improve
local service delivery and three-quarters o f the materials and services budget are now transferred to
regional or provincial directorates for execution. The progressive extension o f the public expenditure
management system to regional capitals outlined above should allow a considerably faster execution
o f payments over time.

72.     The execution o f the PDDEB is closely monitored by a group o f several donors who support
its implementation. A joint supervision mission took place in March 2003. As a result o f the strong
commitment o f the government and the sound long-term strategy, Burkina Faso was declared eligible
for the EFA fast track initiative, which will provide the resources to speed up the implementation o f
the PDDEB. To this end, further reinforcement o f capacity inprogramming and executing activities
will be necessary to ensure the efficient absorption o f additional resources.

73.     Health. Improving key health indicators such as maternal and infant mortality rates requires
determined implementation o f sectoral policies under the health sector development plan to improve
services and make them accessible for a broader set o f the population. In turn, achieving these
outcomes requires that staffing o f health centers be further improved, their management
strengthened, and prices for curative care be lowered to increase the uptake o f medical services by
the population. Moreover, a more regular delivery of budget resources to the health districts needs to
be ensured to allow a steady implementation o f health district programs. PRSC-3 supported a set o f
policy measures aiming at improving both the supply of health services and lowering the cost for the
most vulnerable segments o f the population.

74.     Inorder to investigate policies that could encourage health workers to stay in remote areas,
the government has conducted two studies in 2002-03 testing different incentives and their
effectiveness. It was originally envisaged that these studies would be finalized in 2002 and the
government would implement a change in human resource policies in 2003. However, the studies,
one o f which was conducted by the WHO, took longer than planned and were only finalized in2003.
Given the sensitivities o f changes to civil service remunerations beyond the health sector, the
government believed that a careful preparation o f the reform was necessary and further discussion
with donors and unions was warranted. This view was shared by the donors interveninginthe sector
who participated in a recent round table meeting. Accordingly, the measure was postponed and the
related trigger could not be met as specified. The agenda will be pursued under PRSC-4 with the
development o f an action plan on the basis o f the recommendations arising from the studies and
adequate budget financing for its implementation.



                                                  41

75.      The government continued its highly successful vaccination policies that were instituted
under the health and nutrition project in2000. All basic vaccinations are now provided free o f charge
and "vaccination days" were held in October and November 2002 to raise awareness among the
population. It is expected that the remarkable increase in vaccination rates will continue and
vaccination rates will meet the targets set inthe PRSP.

76.      The government made additional efforts to lower the cost o f medication and medical services
and met the related trigger. Under PRSC-2, the profit margins for CAMEG in distributing generic
drugs were lowered, which put downward pressure on drug prices. For PRSC-3, the government
issued and published a unified list o f prices for standard medical services in hospitals (CMA) and
health centers (CPSP), including a reduction inthe cost o f pediatric treatment and assistance at birth.
The list also confirmed that prenatal and vaccination services were free o f charge. Moreover, the cost
of three drugs for children were subsidized at a rate o f 10 percent. It will now be necessary to put a
mechanism in place that verifies the application o f the price list in different regions and health
districts.

77.       In order to improve the flow of budgetary resources to health districts and replicate the
management o f health services on the local level instituted with IDA resources under the closed
health project, petty cash accounts (rkgies d'avance) were created for all 66 health districts and
regions in 2002. At the request o f account managers, resources were transferred starting in March-
April 2003. Their effectiveness in replacing a previous IDA-financed mechanisms o f health district
accounts will be subject o f further evaluation in 2003.

78.      Other measures taken before presentation o f PRSC-3 include a study on the legal framework
and the composition o f health center committees to allow for an improvement in health center
management. Moreover, a manual for the training o f health center staff was elaborated and about 66
percent o f health centers now have at least one member who was trained in health center
management issues. Instructions for the application o f deconcentration and decentralization o f health
staff were prepared to begin the transfer o f responsibilities to the regional and provincial level after
the revisions to the decentralization texts have become effective. Finally, community strategies were
developed and implemented for malaria, nutrition and reproductive health.

79.      Rural development. Rural development plays a crucial role in achieving the PRSP
objectives to create employment and generate incomes for the poor. In this respect, the PRSC-
supported policies intend to raise the income from cash crops, diversify agricultural activities, and
increase the effectiveness o f the administration o f the ministrieso f agriculture and livestock.

80.      In 2001, the government established an action plan to open the cotton sector for private
investors, who could compete with the parastatal SOFITEX. Introducing competition in the sector
aims at further raising producer prices through increases in efficiency and stabilizing the sector by
decreasing dependence on the performance o f a single marketing company. In order to keep the
confidence o f cotton farmers and not disrupt the sector, the government decided to carefully prepare
the regulatory setting and consult with producer organization before inviting new operators. The
process o f reforms began with lifting the cotton trading monopoly o f SOFITEX at end-2001. In2002,
consultations began on the sale o f two smaller zones to private investors, the assets o f SOFITEX in
the two zones were evaluated, a list o f the staff to be transferred to the new operators was
established, documents on the two zones and their production potential were elaborated and
validated, and a team from the privatization commission at the Ministry o f Commerce was
dispatched to help SOFITEX preparing the sale o f the two zones. In January 2003, a permanent


                                                    42

committee for cotton sector reform, presided over by the representative o f the Ministry o f
Commerce, was formally nominated, and studies on the new price setting mechanism and modalities
to secure payments to producers were elaborated. The plan for the evolution o f the cotton sector and
two decrees demarcating the new zones were approved by the council o f ministers in May 2003 and
are reflected in the specifications o f the biddingdocuments. The technical part o f the biddingprocess
was launched inJune 2003, and technical bidswill be evaluated inAugust 2003, followed by a round
o f financial biddingfor pre-qualified bidders.

81.      Compared with the original timetable, the implementation o f the action plan was delayed by
about 6 months inorder to conduct studies necessary to ensure a sound basis for the price setting and
risk sharing mechanisms.Moreover, the needto ensure an environmentally sound management o fthe
sector required that environmental audits of ginningplants be completed before the financial bids can
be launched. Therefore, the financial biddingprocess and negotiations to reach the point o f sale will
be conducted only later in2003. Accordingly, despite the considerable progress that has been made,
the trigger was met only partially and the reform process will needto be pursued in2003.

82.      The government undertook several studies to underpin the global rural development strategy
to be finalized in 2003 and increase the effectiveness o f the Ministry o f Agriculture. Several action
plans for the diversification were finalized or are under way. After the action plan for cowpeas
prepared in 2001-02, the plan for cereals (millet, sorghum) was finalized, an action plan for oilseeds
will be finalized by end-June 2003, and the action plan for fruits and vegetables is under preparation
by a consulting firm. An institutional study o f the Ministry o f Agriculture was launched to identify
weaknesses inthe organization o f the Ministry and the management o f the sector. As a next step, the
conclusions o f these studies will need to be translated into policy changes duringthe implementation
o f the global rural development strategy that i s currently being developed. They will also inform the
forthcoming PRSP update.

83.      Environment. The Bank provided support to the government to strengthen the capacity for
environmental assessment (EA) and streamline environmental concerns into government operations.
A workshop introducing the principles and methods o f EA was held in Ouagadougou with key
government officials in November 2002. Ministries also named focal points for the implementation
of EAs and joint ministerial instructions have been issued by the Ministry for the Environment and
sectoral ministries on the application o f EAs. Further capacity building will be part o f future budget
support operations to create a culture o f safeguarding the environment when executing public
projects (see Annex 13).


                                  VI.       FUTUREOPERATIONS

                                          A. Lessons Learned

84.     The PRSC series has greatly reinforced the importance o f the budget and the country's own
capacity for the success o f government policies. The PRSCs have steadily strengthened the focus on
the budget as the main instrument for PRSP implementation and have clarifiedthe government's own
role in defining a programmatic agenda to achieve its objectives. The importance o f the MTEF in
formulating the government's budget has grown substantially. Moreover, expenditure systems were
expanded and controls were reinforced. Inthe social sectors, the PRSCs have resulted in a process o f
reorientation to program budgets as tools to translate priorities expressed in long-term sectoral



                                                    43

programs into budgetary allocations. However, a further reinforcement o f capacity is necessary to
underpin this process and ensure that program budgets are closely aligned with the executed
administrative budget and fully integrated in the evaluation and monitoring mechanism o f each
ministry'splanning department.

85.      PRSCs also successfully supported a number o f cross-cutting reforms. These reforms
included the application o f deconcentration policies in budget and personnel management, which are
part o f the policies to improve social service delivery. Inthe cotton sector, the opening o f two zones
for private investors involved several ministerial departments in setting up the new regulatory
framework and defining the roles o f the new and old stakeholders. Despite these achievements, a
number o f challenges o f remain for the PRSCs.

86.      Improving the PRSC-related sectoral dialogue. There is currently no specific sectoral
investment operation in the health sector (except for the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS disaster response
project) and initially the ownership o f the PRSC-supported reform program by the Ministryo f Health
was weak (see Annex 14). The transition from project to programmatic support was difficult because
o f the required changes in instruments and the new focus on the budget. The Bank's PRSC team,
with the health experts taking the lead, will attempt to advance the dialogue through greater
involvement inhealth sector budget discussions, inparticular the design o fprogram budgets.

87.      Reinforcingcapacity.The capacity o f the administration to formulate and execute programs
remains weak. The preparation and implementation o f program budgets can only advance further if
the capacity o f the civil service is improved. Inthis respect, the Bank will work with the government
on a global PER in fiscal year 2004 to give guidance for further improvements in the budget process,
especially as regards program budgets. Inthe area o f civil service management, the Bank i s currently
preparing a capacity building project for presentation in fiscal year 2004 to accompany and
complement future PRSCs, with preparatory work already being financed under a Japan Policy and
Human Resources Development (PHRD) grant. Over time, the project aims at giving technical
assistance for capacity assessment, establishing a work program, streamlining public administration,
modernizing personnel management,            strengthening o f poverty focus o f expenditure, and
strengthening policy formulation. In the statistical area, the Bank will work closely with other
donors, notably the IMF which is currently preparing a report on the observance o f standards and
codes (ROSC) and the German cooperation (GTZ), to put together a capacity buildingplan that could
be financed by the Bank's statistical capacity buildingcredit (STATCAP).

88.      Aligning budget support with the budget cycle. The time necessary for policy
implementation and complicated government credit approval procedures have thus far hampered the
alignment o f PRSCs with the budget cycle. The implementation o f reform measures under the first
PRSCs took about 12 months and all PRSCs have been approved in the months o f July-August.As a
result o f onerous approval procedures on the side o f the government, PRSCs were often not
disbursed until October-November, toward the end o f the government's budget year. Bank resources
have hence not been able to alleviate the beginning-of-year cash shortages that are constraining
investment spending. In order to align PRSCs more closely with the budget cycle, it is proposed to
target PRSC-4 appraisal in January-February 2004, after approval o f the 2004 budget by the national
assembly, with a possible Board date inMarch 2004. Subsequent PRSCs would then follow a similar
timetable and closer align PRSCs with the budget cycle and PRSP implementation, which both
follow the calendar year.




                                                   44

89.      Stimulating growth. The PRSC series has addressed issues regarding service delivery and
public sector performance. However, Burkina Faso faces difficulties in attracting private investment
as a result o f low skill levels and high costs o f production factors. The growth agenda o f the PRSP
will therefore be an additional important area for support under the PRSC, as discussed in detail
below.

90.      Improving the link between policy actions and the monitoring and evaluation
framework. The link between PRSC measures and the PRSP impact indicators is at times tenuous
as a result o f certain weaknesses o f the 2000 PRSP, which did not include a matrix o f policy actions
and only contained a narrow set o f indicators. The government has already undertaken a substantial
body o f work as part o f the UNDP-financed Poverty Observatory (ONAPAD) to improve its set o f
PRSP indicators. ONAPAD's enhanced indicator list was discussed with the donor community and is
a first step for establishing the monitoring framework o f the revised PRSP. In developing the revised
PRSP, the government will needto closer integrate objectives with government policies by preparing
a matrix o f costed policy actions and intermediate outputs that are linked with PRSP outcome and
impact indicators. Future PRSCs would draw on this work. Bank staff, jointly with the donor
community, will accompany the work on the PRSP revision throughout the year 2003 by providing
feedback on different drafts o f the revised strategy. Moreover, the Word Bank Institute (WBI) is
willing to conduct trainingactivities to reinforce the technical capacity o fthe PRSP team and sectoral
planning directorates for preparing the logical framework o f the PRSP and sectoral strategies. The
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has spearheaded a regional study on strength
and weaknesses o f monitoring and evaluation systems and, in collaboration with WBI, is
disseminating the lessons from this study in mid-2003. Finally, the forthcoming capacity building
project will give the means to reinforce the capacity o f planningdirectorates (DEP) to evaluate policy
outcomes and make more effective use o f available poverty statistics and result indicators under the
PRSP process.

91.       Alignment with PRSPs and CAS. Given the timeframe for the revision o f the full PRSP,
PRSC-4 would be an interim operation based on the third annual progress report o f the 2000 PRSP
and the extension o f the CAS described in the CAS-PR. Subsequent operations would then be
adapted to the fully revised poverty reduction strategy and aligned with the new 2004 CAS. The
revised PRSP is expected to contain similar focal areas as the original 2000 PRSP but with increased
weight on the growth agenda and a closer reflection o f the long-term sectoral programs. It would also
be expected to contain a detailed policy matrix and costed programs. Inthe meantime, PRSC-4 will
focus on three broad areas: growth and employment creation (pillars 1 and 3 o f the PRSP), human
development (pillar 2) and good governance (pillar 4). Triggers for PRSC-4 have been designed
according to these three areas and are presented in Table 11. The policy matrix has benefited from
intensive discussions with government officials and has also been shared and discussed with the
donor community at several occasions during its development. As was the case for PRSC-3, Bank
staff will be responsive to adapt PRSC measures if necessary to improve donor coordination, and the
list o f indicators inTable 11will be fully aligned with the revised PRSP duringPRSC-4 preparation.

92.     Growth and employmentcreation. Inaddition to sound macroeconomic policies, which lay
the foundation for growth, the first PRSP axis covers government policies to improve the investment
climate, increase rural income and employment opportunities, lower factor costs, and reinforce
infrastructure. Policies inthis area draw on the 2001 Growth and Competitiveness Study undertaken
jointly by the government and the Bank.'' It identifies costs o f labor and other productions factors,
notably transport, electricity, water, and telecommunications, as important constraints for
competitiveness and growth (see Box 2). To accelerate growth rates, the study identifies a variety o f
areas for intervention, including the promotion o f alternative crops in the agricultural sector and
removal o f marketing constraints, a more enabling environment for small and medium-sized
enterprises, promotion o f more efficient infrastructure services, and development o f a broader human
resource base. The agenda is supported under several Bank projects-the             Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development technical assistance project (see Box 3 for a summary), the Transport Sector
investment project with a focus on rural roads, a water supply project for Ouagadougou, the basic
education development project, and a planned energy sector investment project. The PRSCs support
selected reforms inclose synergy with these projects. Particular areas o f reform proposed for PRSC-4
are:

            0   Rural development. PRSC-4 would accompany the deepening o f the reforms
                undertaken under previous operations in the cotton sector to increase private sector
                involvement and competition in the sector. In particular, the bidding process will
                continue and negotiations with new private operators will be finalized. PRSC-4
                would also support the dissemination and implementation o f some o f the action plans
                developed for several subsectors (cowpeas, oilseeds, cereals, fruits and vegetables)
                under prior operations.
            0   Factor costs and utilities. The Growth and Competitiveness study and the PRSP
                identify high factor costs as one o f the obstacles for the competitiveness o f the
                Burkinabk economy. To tackle this issue,             PRSC-4,    in synergy with the
                competitiveness and energy projects, would accompany the crucial steps in
                introducing competition in the energy and telecommunication sectors and opening
                them up for private investors.         The government intends to privatize the
                telecommunications company and i s preparing new regulation to pave the way for
                private sector investment in power generation and petroleum distribution. Increasing
                competition and modern investments are expected bring down telecommunication
                and electricity costs inthe medium to long term. Telephone tariffs would likely come
                under downward pressure with proliferation o f cellular phones and the potential for
                efficiency gains with the expansion o f the fixed line network. Inthe electricity sector,
                there could initially be upward pressure on tariffs if the government subsidy for
                petroleum products used by SONABEL was removed and the high capital costs for
                interconnecting the power grid with CGte d'Ivoire outweighed the falling variable
                costs o f electricity. To investigate these issues in preparing for SONABEL
                privatization, studies on short-term tariff policies and financial outlook financed by
                respectively the Danish (DANIDA) and French (AFD) Development Agencies are
                currently under way. An additional study will be conducted on lowest investment
                costs and long-term tariff policies. As regards the opening o f the capital o f

      aviation authority, andprivatization o f airport administration.

  Enterprise Development
     Improving the business environment. The project provides resources for a reform and codification o f
      business laws andthe simplification and streamlining o f administrative barriers, notably as regards land
      access and international commerce.
      Technical assistance to entrepreneurs. The project supports measuresto better organize information,
      improve access to technical assistance, improve the quality and diversityo f products, and ease access to
      financing. It does so by supporting the start-upo f an entrepreneur center, provide matching grants for
      support services, andprovide training and advice on quality management.
     Development of microfinance services. The project assists with the strengtheningo f the supervision
      authority for microfinance institutions at the Ministryo f Finance and building capacity inthe
     microfinance industry.


93.    Human resource development. Human development encompasses policies in the
education and health sector as well as improvements in supply o f safe water:

            0    Education. PRSC-4 would support sufficient budget allocations in line with the
                 PDDEB, the pursuit o f the decentralization agenda, and the preparation o f a sectoral
                 MTEF. The sectoral MTEF would include post-primary education and provide a
                 financial outlook for the entire education sector. This cohesion will become
                 increasingly important with an increase in school enrollment rates and a larger
                 number of students continuing their education beyondprimary school.
            0    Health. Inthe health sector, PRSC-4 will attempt to deepen the dialogue around the
                 program budgets to seek improvements in equity and efficiency o f health ministry
                 spending. Measures would focus on the free provision o f vaccinations and further
                 cost reduction in selected services, as well as a deepening o f the deconcentration
                 agenda on both the personnel and budgetary side. In addition, PRSC-4 will support
                 the preparation o f a sectoral MTEF.
            0    Water sector. PRSC-4 would include management aspects o f the water sector as a
                 new component to support the government inmaking progress towards the MDGs in
                 this area. PRSC-4 would support the preparation of a strategy for public-private

                partnership, accompanied by technical, organizational, and financial assistance to
                water management concessionaries.

94.     Good governance.Under this thematic area, PRSC-4 would continue to support a variety o f
public sector reform measures, as follows:

            0   Budget preparation.PRSC-4 would continue the support o fthe MTEFand program
                budgeting exercises as part o f the annual budget preparation. In synergy with the
                forthcoming capacity building project, PRSC-4 would put its emphasis on further
                improvements in the quality o f program budgets in key sectoral ministriesand better
                mastery of revenue projections underlying the MTEF. Bank staff will also follow
                closely the implementation ofpast and ongoing PERs.
            0   Budget execution. PRSC-4 would provide for the further extension of the
                computerized expenditure management system. In particular, the extension o f the
                CID to foreign-financed investments would become fully operational and integrated
                into the budget. Moreover, the controlled deconcentration o f budget management
                would continue with the extension o f the CID to further regions after the successful
                implementation at Bobo-Dioulasso.
            0   Procurement. Measures for PRSC-4 would include the full application o f the 2003
                procurement decree. They would cover the conduct o f regular and random audits to
                verify the systematic application o f procurement procedures, the preparation o f a
                decree on leasing contracts and concessions, and the technical preparation o f the
                integration o fprocurement information inthe CID.
            0   Public financial management. PRSC-4 would support the implementation o f the
                related PRGB measures. Specific measures will include the application o f the
                WAEMUbudgetclassification, the monthly preparation o ftreasury account balances,
                and the drafting o f a concept for an electronic management system for government
               property.
            0   Capacity building, deconcentrationand decentralization.PRSC-4 in combination
                with the capacity building project would support the deconcentration and
                decentralization agenda. Under PRSC-4 the regions would become functional
                deconcentrated government units. Other measures include the deconcentration o f
               personnel management after a full operationalization o f the personnel management
                system and its extension to line ministries and regions.
            0   Environment. PRSC-4 would pursue the implementation of the capacity building
               plan and the preparation o f guidelines for environmental assessments.


                        VII.    GRANT ADMINISTRATION AND RISKS

                                      A. Grant Administration

95.     Grant amount and financing. The proposed amount o f IDA grant financing is US$50
millionequivalent.

96.     Tranching. The grant will be disbursed inone tranche o f SDR 35.4 million (US$50 million),
to be released at effectiveness, anticipated to be in September 2003. The grant closing date would be
June 30,2004.


                                                    56

97.      Disbursement. The grant will follow IDA'S simplified disbursement procedures for
adjustment operations?' Grant proceeds will be made available for disbursement upon effectiveness.
The government will open an account with the central bank BCEAO. Upon notification o f release o f
the tranche, IDA will deposit the proceeds in this account when requested to do so by the
government. If, once deposited with the central bank, withdrawals are used for ineligible purposes
(i.e., to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), IDA will require the government to
refund the amount to the grant account.

98.      Auditing. IDA reserves the rightto seek an audit o fthe deposit account.

99.      Implementation. The reform program funded by this grant will be implemented by the
Ministry o f Finance and Budget and other ministries. The Permanent Secretariat for the
Supervision o f Financial Policies and Programs (SP-PPF) at the Ministryo f Finance and Budget is
coordinating the contributions o f different ministries. Ministries involved in the implementation o f
the program are the Ministries o f Finance o f Budget (budget management reform, budget process,
and budget allocations for line ministries), the Ministry o f Economy and Development (economic
developments and statistics, PRSP, statistical monitoring system), Ministry o f Basic Education and
Literacy (implementation o f PDDEB), Ministry o f Health (implementation o f PNDS), Ministry o f
Commerce and Enterprise Development (privatization program, cotton reform), Ministry o f
Agriculture, Water, and Fishing (cotton reform, institutional reforms, agricultural diversification,
sanitation program), Ministry o f Decentralization and Territorial Administration (decentralization
program), and Ministry o f Civil Service and Reform o f the State (civil service reform). The
coordination by the SP-PPF has been generally successful in mobilizing contributions o f line
ministries. A deeper and earlier exchange o f line ministries with the SP-PPF would at times be
useful, however, to avoid delays in coordinating sectoral activities under the PRSCs. Because o f its
nature as a single-tranche operation, overall program implementation and macroeconomic
performance will be reviewed in the context o f preparation for the following operation, as well as
throuzh the assessment o f the implementation o f the PRSP with the IMF and other donors.

                                B. Risks andMitigatingMeasures

100.     The main risks to achievingthe objectives ofthe grant are vested interests, weak capacity and
vulnerability to external shocks, which could all result in a smaller-than-estimated poverty impact o f
the policies supported by PRSCs. Vested interests can represent important reform obstacles, notably
as regards policies aiming at increasing private sector involvement in the economy, cotton sector
reform, and procurement reform. The reform program supported by the PRSC series reduces the
influence o f those with important stakes in sectors with limited competition, in public enterprises,
and inpublic administration by removing obstacles for competition, diminishingpublic sector control
over productive assets, and improvingtransparency and ex-post controls. Therefore, PRSC-supported
policies may be challenged by influential groups, resulting ina slow-down o f the reform process, and
policies may be subject to reversal after their implementation. Under the PRSC, these different risks
arising from vested interests are mitigated by the fact that all policy measures are implemented
before grant approval and that each operation is embedded in a medium-term policy framework.
Owing to the close link between subsequent PRSCs, the likelihood that reforms are being followed
through and policies are sustained i s being enhanced. The link between operations also permits to

8, 1996.


                                                   57

move increasingly from measures changing the institutional environment to measures verifying the
application o f these changes, such as the adoption and subsequent implementation o f the new
procurement regulation. Moreover, the commitment o f the government to the principle o f
programmatic support through PRSCs combined with the financial importance o f the Bank's
assistance enhances the likelihood that interests o f narrow groups can be overcome.

101.     Achieving the grant objectives could become more difficult as a result o f weak administrative
capacity in Burkina Faso and slow program implementation. To mitigate this risk, the Bank is giving
technical support to the PRSP process with other donors and will prepare a technical assistance
project for capacity building to accompany future PRSCs and underpin the implementation o f the
government's poverty reduction and growth agenda.

102.     The impact o f the credit could also be affected by fluctuating external conditions. To the
extent that drought and economic conditions in the subregion, notably the Ivorian crisis, have an
important impact on the government's own tax resources, external shocks could disrupt the
implementation of the budget and thus disrupt the spending program implementing the PRSP.
Moreover, the exogenous shocks also directly affect economic conditions o f the population and thus
change poverty rates and other indicators measuring the impact o f government policies. In order to
mitigate the risks and under the condition that government policies are sound, the donor community
has generally closely coordinated its support to provide additional support ifnecessary to cushion the
budgetary consequences o f exogenous events. Inresponding to the additional financing needs PRSC-
3 has been increasedby US$lO millionequivalent over the baseline scenario.

103.     Fiduciary risks have become less important with successful implementation o f the PRSC
reform program. As discussed in more detail above, recommendations o f the CFAA as regards the
timeliness o f budget execution reports and reinforcement o f external audit functions are being
followed. To ensure the sustainability o f these reforms, the PRSC series will continue to emphasize
the full and timely application o fthe fiduciary safeguards.

Ouagadougou, June 5 2003

NO.2003-975/MFB/SP-PPF

The Minister o f Finance and Budget

To:
Mr.James WOLFENSOHN
President o f the World Bank
WASHINGTON DC, 20433 (USA)

                              LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

Dear Mr.President,

1.      This letter o f development policies intends to describe the recent developments o f the
economic and social situation o f Burkina Faso and the perspectives for the next years. It builds
entirely on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) o f May 2000 and the last progress report o f
September 2002. The policies discussed in this letter focus mainly on the elements o f the PRSP
reform program suppofled by the World Bank's Poverty ReductionSupport Credits (PRSC!.

2.      The recent time has been marked mainly by the crisis situation in CBte d'Ivoire since
September 19, 2002, a crisis with several effects o f different nature on Burkina Faso resultingfrom
the very close historical and economic links between the two countries. CBte d'Ivoire was, up until
the beginningo f the crisis, the most important economic partner o f Burkina Faso in the sub-region,
home o f the principal port o f evacuation for its exports, and origin o f most o f its imports. Inaddition,
CBte d'Ivoire is the most important country o f immigration for Burkinab6 (almost 3 million o f them
reside there) who contributed until 1999 through their substantial and regular remittances to
balancing external accounts.

3.      Despite the difficulties appearing in the last quarter o f 2002 from the effects resulting from
the Ivorian crisis, economic activity increased by 4.6 percent, certainly less than expected, but at a
still remarkable pace given the disturbances o f deliveries to enterprises, notably in the Western and
South-Western region. These enterprises depend almost exclusively on CBte d'Ivoire for the primary
inputsandtheir sales outside the country.

4.      The government has maintained its efforts in fighting against poverty while consolidating the
achievements and deepening the reforms undertaken previously within the framework o f different
programs. It has begun, in line with the timetable annexed to the second annual PRSP progress
report, the process of revising its strategy within an enlarged participative framework and this



                                                    59

process should lead until the end o f 2003 to the elaboration o f a new poverty reduction strategy
paper.

5.       The government has maintained the rhythm o f execution o f priority programs in the PRSP
during 2002. Social expenditure financed with domestic resources have grown considerably, from
CFAF 80 billion to CFAF 109 billion, o f which CFAF 28 billion represent additional expenditure
financed   with HIPC resources. It is noteworthy that the latter have seen a certain acceleration after
the difficulties encountered in2001 linked, among others, to the novelty o f the spending mechanism,
requiring a learning effort on the domestic level as well as the level o f the partners participating in
the initiative. Owing to the monitoring device put in place and the guide for the execution o f HIPC
expenditure elaborated in close relationship with the sectors benefiting from these expenditure, the
procedures are now better mastered, leading to an improvement in speedo f the use o f resources.

6.       This letter analyzes in its first part the recent developments o f the economic and social
situation and the state o f the execution o f measures and reforms in 2002 supported by PRSC-3. The
second part o f the letter outlines the perspectivesfor 2004.

1-Recent Developmentsof the Economic and Social Situation: Implementationof the Poverty
Reduction Strategy

7.       The Burkinabb government has pursued the implementation o f the PRSP to continue the
creation o f conditions favorable for a significant decline o f poverty. To do so, multiple reforms have
been put in place or begun. This reform program has been supported by PRSC-3. The appraisal o f
reforms can be confirmedby the description below.

1.1-Accelerate EquitableEconomicGrowth

8.       Despite the Ivorian crisis, the Burkinabb economy has been able to grow by 4.6 percent in
2002, compared with 5.6 percent in 2001. Inflation measured by the consumer price index ranged at
2.3 percent on an annual average, which is below the ceiling o f 3 percent established by the
WAEMU convergence criterion.

9.       In 2002 the execution of the budget has been confronted by difficulties, linked in part to a
weakening o f fiscal revenue, which fell short by CFAF 13 billion, and in part to the growth o f
unforeseen humanitarian expenditure. In total, the basic fiscal deficit (excluding HIPC), which
reflects the result o f fiscal operations excluding foreign-financed investment, deteriorated from 2.2
percent o f GDP in 2001 to 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2002.

10.      Money supply increased on average by 3.4 percent during 1999-2002, which is less than the
nominal growth rate o f GDP, and the improvement in the position o f public finances allowed the
government to limit the growth innet bank credit to the government. Inthese conditions, net foreign
assets have continued to improve and the credit to the economy was able to grow to sustain economic
growth.

11.      Resulting mainly from a rebound incotton exports and a weakening o f imports for goods and
equipment, the external current account deficit, excluding current official transfers, has been reduced
from 15 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 12.9 percent o f GDP in 2002. The overall balance has improved
considerably, leading to an accumulation o f gross foreign assets o f about CFAF 27 billion.



                                                    60

12.      Despite the difficulties mentioned above, the government has continued to safeguard the
budgetary expenditure allocated to the fight against poverty with a strong acceleration o f HIPC
expenditure and the commitment o f almost all allocations o f the 2001 HIPC account. Thus, these
expenditure increased from CFAF 6.5 billion in 2001 to CFA 28.2 billion in 2002, including CFAF
3.7 billion from the 2002 debt relief, which had not been committed untilthe fourth semester.

13.      In order to support the process of improving budget management-indispensable          to better
fulfill the obligation to justify the use of resources-efforts have been made in the direction of
renewing the computer tools o f budget management. These efforts were made in order to adapt them
to the requirements for a modern management and to the new needs expressed by different financial
administrations.

14.      The 2003 budget, building on the sectoral budget envelopes o f the 2003-2005 MTEF,
allocates almost 30 percent o f the total budget resources to the social sectors, including an
appropriation o f more than 50 percent o f resources mobilized under the HIPC Initiative. The concern
to accelerate the improvement o f social indicators justifies the importance given to the adequate
financing o f the PDDEB and PNDS.

15.      In the area of budget formulation, it is advisable to raise the issue of the extension of the
MTEF working group to the main ministerial departments, in line with the recommendations o f the
workshop on the instruments for budget programming that was held in Kaya in March 2002. This
workshop has acknowledged the need to enlarge the ownership o f the MTEF by the different actors
inthe budgetary process.

16.      Agriculture employs the majority o f the population, remains the principal source o f growth,
even if its contribution to GDP has weakened in 2002. The consolidation o f measures to support
production, an improvement in returns, and the strengthening o f their organization allowed to better
sustain the development o f other sectors.

17.      To achieve the results outlined above, the priority actions have aimed at the development o f
the rural market economy and the growth o f rural incomes through diversification o f sub-sectors and
the reform ofthe cotton sector through its opening to foreign investors. The latter was translated into
action through the launching o f the bids for the pre-qualification o f candidates to take over the East
and Central cotton zones, after the rules that will govern the cotton sector and the validation o f the
biddingdocuments were adopted by the cotton sector reform committee. This opening will introduce
competition in the cotton sector, increase the income o f producers, and improve the food and
nutritional security owing to crops growing in different seasons, which receive growing attention
with the implementation ofa small irrigationprogram for villages.

1.2 - Guarantee Access of the Poor to Basic Social Services

18.      Vigorous actions have been undertaken to allow a larger number o f Burkinab6, particularly
the poorest, to have access to basic social services, namely basic education, health, and access to safe
water. The intention o f the government has been translated into an increase in school and health
infrastructure, improvements in equipment, and increase personnel (student, teachers, and health
workers). The construction o f infrastructure was concentrated inthe poorest zones. A special effort to
increase the school enrollment rate has begun in 2001-02 in the context o f the ten-year basic
education development plan (PDDEB), financed with budgetary resources, HIPC resources, and
external aid from different donors. Additional resources, notably under the "Education for All"


                                                   61

Initiative continue to be mobilized from donors in order to accelerate the implementation o f the
PDEB in order to attain the Millennium Development Goals. In addition, with a view to reduce
considerably the mortality and morbidity rates, infrastructures were made available to the population
for a greater access to health services and medication. Globally, resources allocated to social sectors
have increased on average by 10.7 percent annually between 1998 and 2002 and the share in the
budget excluding debt service and HIPC has increased from 21.7 percent to 24.7 percent during the
same period. This outcome reflects the demonstrated desire of the government to increase the supply
and the quality o f education and health services, especially as regards the most deprived part o f the
population, and to intensify the fight against AIDS.

1.2.1 -Access to Basic Education

19.       As regards basic education, the government's policies build on the PDDEB, which
constitutes a key element o f the PRSP. The principal objectives o fthe government to achieve through
this program are (i)increase supply o f basic education; (ii)increase the quality, relevance and
efficiency o f basic education; (iii)promote literacy; and (iv) develop the capacity o f the Ministry o f
Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA) to develop, manage and evaluate programs. In the 2003
budget, approved by the national assembly in December 2002, the government has allocated
substantial resources to MEBA to implement the PDDEB. The level o f allocations has been
safeguarded in the supplementary budget law, adopted in May 2003 by parliament, which
incorporates the impact o fthe Ivorian crisis on public finances.

20.      In the context of deconcentration of the administration and to accelerate the execution o f
construction works for schools and reduce costs, the government has begun the transfer o f
responsibilities for work in this area to the provincial level, under the control o f provincial
directorates o f basic education.

21.      As regards recruitment, the year 2002 has been a year o f innovationwith the decentralization
o f recruitments for basic education. More than 1750 teachers have thus been recruited inthe regions,
bringingthe total number o fnew hires to 3600.

22.      The effort to reduce disparities in schooling rates has been pursued.Inthe 20 provinces with
the lowest schooling rates, the gross enrollment rate has increasedby 13 percent between 1999-2000
and 2000-01, compared with an average progression o f 5.8 percent nationwide. These provinces have
besides benefited from an increased effort regarding endowment o f books, furnishings, and food for
school kitchens.

23.       Inpursuingthis policy o f priority for basic education development in quantity and quality,
the government will also give attention to the development o f secondary and higher education. This
i s to assure a continuation o f education for students finishing basic education in 2005-10 and to find a
balance o fthe entire education system inthe medium and long term.

1.2.2 -Access to Health Services

24.      As regards health services, the government's policy in the PRSP has been defined by the
national plan for health development (PNDS). This plan, which was the subject o f a donor round
table in April 2003, translates the government's desire to increase the quantity and quality o f health
care. It also attempts to reduce health care costs to improve access to health centers and their use,
seen as a way to reduce the still highmortality o f children and women.


                                                    62

25.      Inthe context of reforms aiming at improving access to generic drugs, the government has
already taken measures in 2002 to reduce the profit margin o f the CAMEG (by 32 percent). In order
to deepen the policy o f lowering basic health care costs, a letter has been addressed inFebruary 2003
to the regional health directors. It defines a harmonized list applicable on the national level for the
fees o f certain medical interventions, notably birth and caesarians, and the price for three drugs for
pediatric use, which are subsidized at 10 percent. The list was widely disseminated in May-June
2003, including inthe localpress.

26.      The government is aware o f the difficulties to place and maintain health workers in rural
areas. In the context o f finding appropriate solutions, it had the objective to conduct two studies on
health worker incentives in 2002, one o f which financed by the World Health Organization, and to
begin the implementation o f resulting recommendations in 2003. However, as a result o f the delay in
receiving the financing, the studies could not be finalized before May 2003 and the formulation o f
government policies will take place during 2003. An action plan for the strengthening o f incentives
for workers will be elaboratedand implemented beginning in 2004.

27.     The deconcentration o f government services and the eventual transfer o f responsibilities to
the deconcentrated level have already been taken into account by the health services. To improve the
execution o f budget resources allocated to health districts in the context o f budget deconcentration,
66 petty cash accounts (rkgies d'avance)have been created in the regions and districts in 2002. The
managers o f these accounts have been nominated at the beginning o f 2003 and will now be able to
call funds for the provisioningo f the accounts. Inaddition, the Ministryo f Health, in anticipating the
texts for the decentralization that are about to be adopted, has elaborated the texts for the
decentralization o f health personnel, which will be applied after the implementation o f the regions.

28.     In addition to the reforms described above, the government has taken measures for the
strengthening o f management committees o f health centers (COGES). About 66 percent o f COGES
have currently at least m e member trained in micro-planning on the basis o f training manuals. The
Health Ministry is also preparing revisions for the judicial framework o f COGES on the basis o f a
2001 study.

1.3 -Increasethe Opportunitiesof Employmentand Income-GeneratingActivities for the Poor

29.      Taking account the amplitude o f the poverty incidence in rural areas, the government's
actions have been concentrated on the strengthening o f rural development sectors (agriculture,
environment and rural water sector).

30.     Cotton i s the primary source o f rural incomes and most important export good o f the country.
The Burkinabk cotton sector, organized along the model o f an integrated sector, has been able to
keep its financial stability despite the sharp decline in international prices linked for a large part to
the subsidies o f industrialized countries. The government has integrated the producers already for
several years inthe management o f the sector and has turned over to them 30 percent o f its shares o f
the cotton company (SOFITEX). This decision explains the great stability o f the sector and the
enthusiasm o f farmers for this crop. Notwithstanding these achievements, the government remains
aware o f the risks linked to the great dependence o f this primary activity of the country on a single
company. It also decided, after broad consultations with all the actors in the sector, notably the
producers, to begin a process o f opening o f the sector to other operators. In this context, the
government has lifted the monopoly o f SOFITEX in 2001, created a cotton sector reform committee
in2002 andundertakensince early 2003 studies onthe producer price setting mechanism andthe risk


                                                    63

sharing mechanism for the opened sector, and prepared the bidding documents for two cotton zones
(East and Central) and launched the bids for the technical pre-qualification at end-May 2003.

31.     Other priority actions of the government inthis area consisted of:
            -   the implementation o f actions to reduce in a sustainable way the vulnerability o f the
                agricultural activity to desertification and insufficient water management, including
                the operation o f 50,000 dung pits, the program o f small irrigation in villages and the

            -   SAAGA program (artificial rains);
                the initiation o f series o f actions inthe direction o f intensification and modernization
                o f agriculture by way o f distribution o f agricultural material, improved seeds
                generating higher yields and fertilizer to poor farmers to allow them to produce
                sufficient amounts to nourish them and sell their surplus;

            -
            -   the support o ftraditional livestock raising and the upgrading o f grazing zones;
               the financing o f activities generating higher and more diversified rural incomes.
                Thus, morethan 100projects o femployment have beenfinanced and the Fundfor the
                Support o f Income-GeneratingActivities o f Women (FAARF) has mobilized in 2001
                some CFAF 2.3 billion to finance the economic activities o f women in almost all
                provinces; the promotion o f small irrigation invillages also takes part inthe objective

            -   to improve rural incomes;
                a support for the creation o f farmer organizations by the adoption o f the decrees on
               the creation and status o f regional agriculture chambers (CRA) in December 2001,
               translating the government's desire to accompany different actors operating in the

            -   agricultural sector; and
               the reduction o f isolation o f rural areas through the construction o f rural roads to
                create axes o f development capable to stimulate a diversification o f opportunities for
                economic activities. Thus, a first tranche o f 266 km o f rural roads has been
                constructed in 4 provinces and a second tranche o f 387 km in nine provinces have
                been realized with HIPC resources inthe context o f a program for the construction o f
                6000 km o f rural roads by end-2004.

1.3 -PromoteGood Governance

32.      Inthe area ofgovernance, efforts have been concentrated in2002 inthe political area on the
strengthening o f democracy and the state o fjustice. Inthe economic area, the mechanisms that assure
transparency, responsibility and the control o f the management o f public finances have been
implemented.

33.     Inthe area o fdemocratic governance, the search for a transparent electoral process receiving
the support o f the entire political class has led to the revision o f the electoral code and the
strengtheningo f the privileges o fthe national independent election commission (CENI). Inthe same
thrust, the charter o f political parties and status o f opposition have been adopted by the national
assembly and an independentobservatory for elections has been createdwithin civil society.

34.     In the context of the implementation o f justice reform, the government has installed and
made operational in 2002 the new supremejurisdictions (Constitutional Court, Supreme Audit Court,
State Council, Appeals Court). Besides, the government has accelerated the implementation o f the
support program for the consolidation o f the democratic process, the state o f justice, and good
governance, with support from certain donors.


                                                      64

35.     As regards economic governance, the preparation o fthe budget has beenfurther strengthened
with the adoption o f the 2003-05 MTEF in April 2002, in line with the priorities o f the updated
PRSP. The ceilings o f the MTEF have been integrated into the budget circular for 2003. The
government has also adopted program budgets for 2003, consistent with the MTEF.

36.      Significant progress as been made as regards the implementation o f the action plan for the
improvement o f budget management (PRGB), adopted by the government in July 2002. It can be
mentioned inthis context:
            -   the operationalization o f the Supreme Audit Court in2002, materialized by its release
                o f its opinion on the conformity o f budget execution reports, authorizing the national
            -   assembly to examine and adopt the reports for 1995 to 2000;
                the transmission to the Supreme Audit Court in 2002 o f the budget execution report
            -   for 2001 that was adopted by the council o f ministers inApril 2003;
                the adaptation o f the legal framework for public finances to the harmonized
                regulation o f the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), as
                signified by the adoption by the national assembly in January 2003 o f a new organic
                budget law and by the council o f ministers in May 2003 o f a new budget
            -   classification applicable with the 2004 budget;
                the adoption o f an instruction for the delegation o f budgetary allocations to allow the
                issuance o f payment orders on the regional level, the extension o f the CID to Bobo-
                Dioulasso and the start-up o f the pilot site in Bobo-Dioulasso for the issuance o f
            -   payment orders at the deconcentrated level inApril 2003;
                the pursuit o f reforms in the procurement area with the creation o f a working group
                for supervision o f reforms in December 2002, the establishment in the same month
                by ministerial arret6 o f an obligation for administrators o f the budget to prepare a
                procurement plan starting in 2003 and the adoption by the council o f ministers in
            -   May 2003 o f a new decree for public procurement;
                the renovation o f the computerized budget management tools to adapt them to the
                requirements o f modern management and new needs expressed by different financial
            -   administrations; and
                the extension o f the MTEF working group to different ministerial departments to
                enlarge the ownership o f the MTEF by the different actors in the budgetary process,
                in line with the recommendations of the workshop on the instruments for budget
                programmingthat was held inKaya inMarch 2002.

37.     To deepen the analysis o f poverty in the context o f the preparation o f a revised PRSP in
2003, the government has launched in April 2003, financed with its domestic resources, a third
household survey. The first results o f this survey are expected inJuly 2003.

38.     As regards local governance, the process o f decentralization has made significant progress.
The organizational set-up o f decentralization has been completed in 2001 with the creation o f 13
regions. The installation o f a permanent committee for the texts to apply the orientation texts for
decentralization (TOD) and the creation o f an inter-ministerial structure for the implementation o f
decentralization have allowed a significant improvement in the dynamic o f the programming and a
better planningo f the actions to be undertaken.

2 -Outlook for 2003-04

39.      The implementation o f structural reforms has allowed the Burkinabh economy to make
notable progress in the macroeconomic area. However, the constraints linked to the social-political
crisis in CGte d'Ivoire should effect growth in 2003 and reduce it to about 2.6 percent according to
the projections established under the new three year program supported under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility. Nonetheless, the government will implement a series o f measures to keep the
projected decline inreal GDP growth incheck and move it progressively to the desired level o f 5 to 6
percent, while limiting inflation to 3 percent, with the ultimate objective to reduce poverty to 37
percent or less by end 2006. To achieve these goals, the policies in the area o f employment, human
resource development, and good governance will be reinvigorated to accelerate growth and the
creation o f employment.

2.1 - Growth and EmploymentCreation

40.      The acceleration o f growth requires in the first instance a reinforcement o f the
competitiveness o f the economy by way o f a reduction o f factor costs. Duringthe next program, the
government will pursue the opening o f the cotton sector to private investors, as well as the opening
o f the telecommunications and energy sectors.

41.      Inthe telecommunications sector, the privatization ofthe historicaloperator will be finalized
in2003 withthe aim to increase the capacity for investments ofthe sector and subsequently increase
the density o fthe network o f fixed lines and reduce the price for fixed and mobile telephone.

42.      Similar measures will be undertaken to accelerate the opening o f the capital o f SONABEL
and SONABHY for private operators with a view to improving their management, reduce the costs
o f energy, in particular the production o f electricity and its consumer price. To this end, the
government will proceed with the revision o f the judicial framework for the production and sale o f
electricity and will put inplace an authority for the regulation o f the energy sector to watch over the
respect o fthe enacted rules o f the game.

43.      To support the environment for the private sector, the government will undertake a study for
the legislative and regulatory framework of the labor market in order to identify the areas that merit
strengtheningby appropriate reforms.

44.      The improvement o f rural incomes will be pursuedwith the diversification o f crops. In this
direction, the results o f the studies undertaken on different sub-sectors, notably fruits and vegetables,
will be disseminated. To support the development o f crops and activities to be identified, local
development windows will be put in place on the deconcentrated level in the 13 regions o f the
country. To ease the transport and commercialization o f these products, the pursuit o f the rural roads
programwill reduce the isolation o f remote areas.

45.      To increase the income generating opportunities in rural areas, appropriate measures will be
taken to finalize the opening o f the cotton sector with the sale o f two cotton zones (East and Central),
the adoption o f a new price-setting mechanism and guarantee mechanism. This framework should
guarantee producers a profitable price while ensuring the viability o f the sector. The increased
investmentin the sector through this operation should allow an increase in mechanization rates (by
about 10 percent until2005) and subsequently an increase inyields and income o fproducers.



                                                    66

46.        In order to accompany the rebound of the mining sector, the government will encourage
the development o f small minesby way o f a support to mechanization. HIPC resources will be made
available to contribute inthis sense starting in2004.

2.2 -Developmentof HumanResources

2.2.1 -Basic Education

47.     Despite progress made in the area of literacy during the past years, the gross enrollment rate
has remained at about 43 percent in 2002. This rate shows well the efforts that still need to be made
to attain the objectives o f the PRSP in the area o f basic education. For this reason, during the
following years sufficient budget allocations will be made to the sector for the implementation o f the
PDDEB,which has becomethe instrumentto channel allenergies inthe area o fbasic education.

48.     Inaddition, the government will pursue the decentralization o fthe recruitment of teachers to
the level o f regions (DREBA) while giving the DPEBA the budgetary resources necessary inorder to
favor the practice o f managing resources close to the beneficiary. To improve the level o f teaching
and increase the gross literacy rate in school-year 2003-04, the effective number o f teaching hours
for teachers will increase to 780 per year at a minimum.The generalized application o f the sub-cycle
will be verified with a view to reducing the rate o f class redoubling to 12percent, at a minimum,and
increase the rate o f class attainment o fprimary school to 40 percent.

2.2.2 - Secondary Education

49.     The taking into account of the systematic links between the different levels o f education is
inevitable within a dynamic vision for the education sector. To this end, the government has
organized the national sessions on education inApril 2002 to better specify how to arrive at a better
synergy o f different components o f the education system (basic, secondary, higher). To pursue the
research o f consistency between the primary education development program and post-primary
education, a sectoral MTEF will be tried out in 2003 for MEBA and MESSRS.

2.2.3 -Health Care

50.     Inthe health area, efforts will be channeled to an implementation o f measures contained in
the PNDS. Inparticular, as regards the plan for the protection o f children, the program: 1/ assures the
effective distribution, free o f charge, of vitamin A supplements; 2/ will undertake controls to assure
the application o f the new prices structure for drugs and medical services with a view to verify its
application; 3/ allocate sufficient budgetary resources to pay for subsidized health services.

51.     Onthe institutional and organizational side, efforts will be made to strengthen deconcentrated
personnel management on the level o f regional health directorates (DRS) and health districts and to
create a monitoring framework for the annual evaluation o f the PNDS. Such a framework will ensure
that actions are aligned with objectives by exposing difficulties and proposing solutions to lift
constraints.

52.     Inthe area ofwater and sanitation, inurban and rural areas, the government will implement
with support from donors an action plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. To
accelerate the progress in this sector and increase in particular the proportion o f the population
having access to safe drinking water while reducing the disparities between urban and rural zones,


                                                    67

the strategy will be based largely on a participation o f the private sector. The structures for a
technical support to provinces, communities, and water committees will be created and made
functional. Moreover, a technical, organizational and financial support system for water
concessionaries will be created.

2.3 -Promotionof Good Governance

53.      The democratic process will be consolidated with the holding o f elections in rural
communities in2003.

54.      In the budget area, efforts will be maintained to consolidate the progress made in the past
years. The actions o f the government will thus build on the achievement o f reforms defined in the
plan for the strengthening o f budget management (PRGB).

55.      Inthe area o f budget formulation, the accent will be placed on the improvement o f budget
programming by strengthening the consistency between program budgets, MTEF, and budget law.
The budget beingthe principal instrumento f economic and social policies inBurkina Faso, it will be
formulated with a view to optimize the impact o f public finances on growth and poverty reduction, in
line with PRSP objectives.

56.      Inthe area o fbudget execution, the efforts undertaken inthe direction to facilitate execution
will be strengthened with the improvement o f the computer systems o f budget management, the
operationalization o f the integration o f foreign-financed investment spending into the CID and the
finalization o f a technical concept for an computerized integrated revenue system (CIR). In parallel,
the measures will be taken with a view to a rapid deployment o f the CID to four additional regional
capitals, after the evaluation o f the experience in Bobo-Dioulasso.

57.      As regards budget accounts, vigorous measures will be taken to apply effectively the budget
classification o f the WAEMU starting in 2004, to produce monthly treasury account balances and to
define an action plan for the development o f an accounting system for public property.

58.      To keep budgetary discipline, the ex-post controls should be able to better take their role
through a strengthening o f the capacity o f the General State Inspectorate (IGE) and the General
Finance Inspectorate (IGF).

59.      As regards procurement, the measures to take with a view to increase transparency and
simplify procedures are the large distribution and verification o f the effective application o f the new
decree regulating public purchases. To fully revise the regulatory framework for procurement, the
leasing and concessions will also be subject o f a regulation. The measures inthis regard will be taken
during the next weeks for the development o f a computerized application for monitoring public
purchases to be connected to the CID. The plan for the strengthening o f capacity o f the actors in
public procurement will be finalized and implemented to optimize the efficiency and the entire new
systemthat will beput inplace.

60.      In the area of civil service reform, the emphasis will be placed on deconcentration of
personnel management, notably by elaborating and implementing an action plan for the deployment
o f the integrated public personnel and salary management system (SIGASPE) to sectoral ministries.




                                                     68

61.       The government o f Burkina Faso, which follows the principle sustainable development, will
continue to strengthen the capacities for environmental impact analysis though the operationalization
o f the environmental cells in ministries, as recommended by a workshop in March 2003 and
specified inthe environmental assessment of PRSC-3.

62.      The household survey under way will allow to draw up a new poverty profile that will allow
to revise the PRSP within an improvedparticipatory process and to apply the lessons drawn from the
PRSPunder way.

63.      The Burkinabk authorities remainconvinced that the programs and measures described above
are prone to contribute to enlarge the bases for healthy and sustained economic growth, with growth
o f size and quality sufficient to draw the largest part o f the population out o f extreme poverty.

         1 , La presente iettre de politique de deveioppement se propose de retracer
             I'evoiution recente de la situation economique et sociale du Burkina Faso et ses
             perspectivespour les deux prochaines annees. Elle s'appuieiniegraiementsur la

             rapport de sa mise en ceuvre etablien septembre 2002. Les deveioppementsde
             ia letire sont principalementcentres sur les elements du programmede reformes
             du CSLP soutenus par des credits d'appui a la strategie de reduction de ia
             pauvrete (CASRP)de la BanqueMondiaie,
          2. La periode recente reste marquee principalementpar ia situation de crise en
             CGte d`lvoire depuis ie 19 septembre 2002, crise dont ies effets induits sur ie
             Burkina     sont multiples et multiformes, en raison des iiens historiques et
             economiques particulierement etroits qui existent entre les deux pays. La CGte
             d`lvoire etait, jusqu'a i`avenementde la crise, le premier partenaireeconomique

        interieur ont ete sensiblement accrues, passant de 80 milliards FCFA a 109
         milliards, dont 28 milliards de depenses additionnelles financees par les
         ressources de I'initiative PPTE. II convient de souligner que celles-ciont connu une

1- EVOLUTION RECEhTEDE I-4 SITUATIONECONOMIQbjE ETSOCWE:
     MISE ENCEWVRJZ DEI-4 STRATEGIE DE REDUCTIONDEW PAUVRETE

     7 . Le gouvernement burkinabe a poursuivi la mise en ceuvre du CSLP pour continuer
          a creer les conditions propices a un recui significatiide la pauvrete.Pour ce faire,
          de multiples reformesont ete realiseesou engagees.Ce programmede reformes
          a ete soutenu par le CASRP Ill, Ce bilan peut etre confirme par les reaiisations
          decrites ci-dessous.
 1.1- ACCELERER LACROISSANCE ECONOMIQUEETLAFONDERSURL'EQUITE
     8. En depit de la crise ivoirienne,I'economieburkinabe a pucroitre de 4,6% en 2002
          contre 5,6% en 2001, L'inflation mesuree par I'evolutionde I'indiceharmonise des
           prix a la consommations'est situee en moyenne annuelle a 2,306, soit en dessous
           du plafondde 3% fixe par les criteres de convergencede I'WEMOA,
     9. En 2002, I'executiondu budget a ete confrontee a des difficultes. liees d'une part
           a un tassement des recettes fiscales interieuresqui cnt enregistre des moinsvalues
           de 13 milliards de F CFA et d'autrepart, a la croissance des depenses imprevues
           d'ordre humanitaire. Au total, le deficit de base (horsdepenses PPTE), qui reflete
           le resultat des operations financieres de I'Etat hors investissements sur
           financementsexterieurs,s'est degrade en passant de 2,2%du PIB en 2001 a 2,5%
           du PIB en 2002.
      10.La masse monetaire a augmente en moyenne de 3,4% l'an au cours de la
           periode 1999-2002,soit moins que le taux de croissance nominale du PIB, et
           I'amelioration de la position des finances publiques a permis de limiter
           I'accroissement du credit bancaire net a I'Etat. Dons ces conditions, les avoirs
           exterieursnets ont continue a s'ameliorer et le credit a I'economiea pu s'accro?tre
           pour soutenir la croissance.
      1 1 , Du fait principalement de la reprise des exportations de coton et d'un
           flechissement des importations de biens d'equipement, le deficit du compte
           courantexterieur, dons exclus, a ete ramene del50% du PIB en 2000 a 12,9'/0 en
            2002. Le solde global est en nette amelioration, entrainant une accumulation
           d'avoirs exterieurs brutsd'environ 27 milliards de francs CFA.



                                              71

    12.Malgre les difficultes evoquees, le gouvernement a continue a securiser les
       depenses budgetaires affectees a la lutte contre la pauvrete avec une forte
       acceleration de I 'execution des depenses PPTE et l'engagement de la quasi-
       totaiite des credits du compte PPTE 2001, Ainsi de 6 3 milliards en 2001, ces
       depenses ont progresse en 2002 a 28,2 milliards de F CFA incluant 3,7 milliards
       de F CFA au titre des mobilisations de 2002, dont l'utilisation n'a ete engagee
       qu'auqemetrimestre,
    13,Afin de soutenir le processus de renforcement de la gestion budgetaire
       indispensable pour mieuxfaireface a I'obligation de rendrecompte de l'utilisation
       des ressources, les efforts ont ete poursuivis dans le sens de la renovation des
       outils informatises de gestion budgetaire, pour les adapter aux exigences d'une
       gestion moderne et aux nouveoux besoins exprimes par les differentes
       administrationsfinancieres
    14.Le budget 2003, cale sur ies enveloppessectorielles definies duns le CDMT 2003-
       2C05, alloue pres de 30% des credits aux sectecrrs sociaux, y compris une
       affectationde plus de 50% des resourcesmobiliseesduns le cadre de I'initiative
       PPTE, Le souci d'accelerer le redressement des indicateurs sociaux justifie
       I'importanceaccordee a unfinancement adequat du PDDEB et du PNDS.
    15.Duns le domaine de I'eiaborationdu budget,il convient de relever I'extensiondu
       groupe de travail du CDMT aux principaux depa~ements ministeriels,
       conformement aux recommandations de I'ate!ier sur les instruments de
       programmationbudgetairetenu a Kaya en mars 20C2. Cet atelier avait reconnu
       la necessite d'elargir I'appropriation du CDMT par les differents acteurs du
        processusbudgetaire.
    16.L'agriculture qui occupe la majeure partie de ia population, reste la principale
        source de croissance, meme si sa contribution a la formotion du PIB a faibli en
        2002, La consolidation amorcee des mesures de soutien a la production,
        I'ameliorationdes rendements et le renforcement de l'organisationdes acteurs Iui
        permeltentde soutenir davantageie developpementdes autres secteurs,
    17. Pour atteindre les resultats enumeres ci-dessus,les actions prioritaires ont vise le
        developpement de Ileconomie de marche en milieu rural, I'accroissementdes
        revenus rurauxa travers la diversification des filieres et la reforme de la filiere coton
        par son ouveriure a de nouveaux investisseurs,concretisee par le lancement de
        I'appel d'offres de pre-qualification des candidats a la reprise des zones
        cotonnieres de I'Est et du Centre, apres i'adoption du cahier des charges devant
        regir le secteur et la validation du dossier d'appei d'offres par le Comite de suivi
        de la reforme. Cette ouverture permeRra d'instaurer la concurrence duns le
        secteur, d'accroitre les revenus des producteurs et la securite alimentaire et
        nutritionnelle grdce aux cultures de contre Saison qui suscitent un interet croissant
        avec la mise en o3uvre du programme de la petite irrigationvillageoise.

1.2-  G.~RA~"TIR   L'ACCES DES PAUVRESAUX SERVICES SOCLlUX DE BASE
     18,Des actions vigoureusesont ete engagees pour permeitreau plus grand nombre
        de Burkinabe,et precisementles plus pauvres, d'avoir acces aux services sociaux
        de base, que sont I'educationde base, la sante et I'acces a I'eau potable. La
        volonte du gouvernement s'est traduite par I'augmentation des infrastructures
        scolaires et sanitaires, I'amelioration de leur equipement et I'accroissementdes
        effectifs (nombred'eleves, personnels enseignant et soignant).Les constructions
        d'infrastructures ont ete concentrees duns les zones les plus pauvres. Un effort
        particulier pour relever le taux de scolarisation a commence en 2001-2002 duns
        le cadre du Programme decennal de developpement de I'education de base
         (PDDEB)finance par le budget de I'Etat, les ressourcesPPTE et les apports exterieurs
        de plusieurspartenaires. Des ressourcescomplementaires, notamment au titre de

                                         72

      i'initiative education pour tous )>, continueront a &re mobilisees aupres des
                  ((
      partenaires pour accelerer la mise en ceuvre du PDDEB afin datteindre les
      objectifs du milienaire. De plus, en vue de reduire sensiblement les taux de
      mortalite et de morbidite, des infrastructures ont ete mises a la disposition des
      populations pour une pius grande accessibiiite aux soins de sante et aux
      medicaments, Globalement, les ressources allouees aux secteurs sociaux ont
      augmente en moyenne de 10,7% par an entre 1998 et 2002 et leur part relative
      dons le budgetde I'Etathorsservice de la dette et hors PPTE est passeede 21,7%
      a 24,7'/0     sur la m h e periode. Ceci reflete la volonte manifeste du
      gouvernement d'accroitre I'offre et la qualite des services deducation et de
      sante, suriout en direction des populations les plus demunies, et d'intensifier la
      lutte contre le sida.
  1.3.1- Acc& ausservices d'kducation debase
  19,En matiere d'education de base, la politique du gouvernement est b6tie autour
      du PDDES qui constitue un element cle du CSLP. Les principaux objectifs vises par
      le Gouvernement a travers ce programmesont :i] accroitre I'offre educative de
      base, ii) ameiiorer la quaiite, la pertinence et l'efficacitede I'educationde base,
      iii) promouvoir l'alphabetisation,iv) developper les capacites de pilotage, de
      gestion et d'evaluationdes structures du Ministere de i'Enseignement de base et
      de I'Alphabetisation (MEBA),Dans la loi de finances 2003 votee par I'Assembiee
       Nationale en decembre 2002, le gouvernement a ailoue des ressources
      substantielles au MEBA pour la mise en ceuvre du PDDEB. Le niveau des
       aliocations a &e securise dons la loi de finances rectificatives adoptee en mai
       2003 par le Parlementet qui integre les effets de la crise ivoirienne sur les finances
       publiques.
   20.Dans le cadre du processus de deconcentration de I'administration et pour
       accelerer I'execution des travaux de construction des salles de classe et baisser
       les coOts, le gouvernement a commence la delegationde la maitrise d'ouvrage
       dons ce domaine           au niveau provincial, sous le contrale des Directions
       Provincialesde I'Enseignementde Base.
   21. En matiere de recrutement, 2002 a ete une annee d'innovation avec la
       decentralisation des recrutements dans le domaine de i'enseignement de base,
       Plus de 1750 enseignants ont ainsi ete recrutes dons ies regions portant le totai
       des recrutementsa 3600.
    22. L'efforl de reduction des disparites en matiere de taux de scolarisation a ete
        poursuivi, Dans les 20 provinces les moins scolarisees, le Taux brut de scolarisation
        (TBS) a augmente de 13% entre 1999-2000et 2000-2001 contre une progression
        moyenne nationale de 58%. Ces provincesont par ailleurs beneficied'un effort
        accru en matiere de dotations en manuels, fournitures scolaires et en vivres pour
        les coniines.
    23.Tout en poursuivant cette politique de priorite pour le developpement de
        l'education de base en quantite et en qualite, le gouvernement portera
. ..    egalement une attentionau developpementdes niveauxsecondaire et superieur
        afin d'assurer une continuite de I'education pour les eieves sortant du cycle
        primaire sur la periode 2005-2010 et un equilibre densembie du systeme a
        moyenet long terme.

    1.2.2-   Acchs aux services de santk
    24. En ce qui concerne la sante, la politique du gouvernement contenue dons le
        CSLP a ete definie par son Plan national de developpementsanitaire (PNDS).Ce
        plan, qui a fait I'objet d'une table rondeavec leS partenaires en avril 2003, traduit
        la volontedu gouvernement d'augmenterla quantiteet la qualite des services de
        sante et de reduire le coOt des soins de base afind'ameliorer I'accesaux centres

       de Sante et leur utilisation,vue comme un moyende reduire la'mortaliteencore
       elevee au niveaudes enfants et des femmes,
    25. Duns le cadre des reformes visant a ameliorer I'acces aux medicaments
       generiques,le gouvernement a deja pris des mesures en 2002 pour baisser la
        marge beneficiaire de la CAMEG (de 32%), Afin d'approfondir la politique
       d'abaissementdes prix des soins de base, une lettre circulaire a ete adressee en
       fevrier 2003 aux directeurs regionaux de la sante, definissant une listeharmonisee
        applicable a l'echelonnationaldes frais de certainsactes medicaux,notamment
        les accouchements et les cesariennes, et des prix de trois (3) medicaments a
        usage pediatrique subventionne a hauteur de                  La liste a ete largement
        diffusee en mai/juin2003, y comprisdans la presse locale.
    26. Le gouvernement est conscient des difficultes d'affecter et de maintenir le
        personnel de la sante dons les zones rurales.Duns le cadre de la recherchede
        solutions idoipes, il s'etait fixe i'objectif de conduire deux etudes sur les incitations
        du personneien 2002, dont I'une sur financement de I'Organisationmondiale de
        la sante (OMS],et d'entar?er la mise en ceuvre des recommandations qui en
        deCoUierGnt en 2003. Cependant, en raison des deiais de mise en place du
        financement, les dudes n'ont pas pu etre achevees avant mai 2003 et la
        formulation de la pclitique du gouvernement se fera au cours de l'annee 2003.
        Un plan d'action pour le renforcement des incitations du personnei sera elabore
        et misen ceuvre a partir de 2004,
    27. La deconcentration des sewices de I`Etat et ie transfert eventuel des
        responsabilites au niveau deconcentre ont deja ete pris en compte par les
        sewices de la sante,Pour ameliorer I`execution des credits accordes aux districts
        sanitaires dans le cadre de la deconcentrationbudgetaire, 66 regies d'avances
        ont ete creees dans les regions et les districts en 2002. Les regisseurs ont ete
         nommes debut 2003 et seront desormais en mesure de faire les appels de fonds
         pour I`appiovisionnementdes regies d`avance. De plus, le ministere de la sante,
         anticipant les textes sur la decentralisationen cours d`adoption, a eiabore des
         textes sur ia decentralisation du personnel de la sante, qui seront mis en

1.3. ACCROIlTE LES OPPORTUNITES D'EMPLOIS ET D'ACTIVITES GENEEUTRICES DE
     REVENUSPOUR LES PAWRES
     29.Compte tenu de I`ampleur de l'incidence de la pauvrete en milieu rural, les
         actions ont ete concentreessur le renforcementdes secteurs du developpement
         rural (agriculture,elevage,environnementet hydraulique rurale].
     30.Le coton est la principalesourcede revenus du monde rural et le premier produit
         d`exportation du pays. La filiere coton burkinabe, organisee selon un modele
         integre, a pu garder sa stabilite financiere malgre la chute brutale des cours
         internationaux lieeen grande partieaux subventionsdans les pays industrialises.Le
         gouvernementa integredepuisdeja quelques annees duns la gestion de lafiliere
          les producteursen leur cedant 30% de ses actions dans la societe cotonniere
          (SOFITEX). Cela explique la grande stabilite du secteur et I'enthousiasmedes
          paysans pour cette culture. Nonobstant ces acquis, le gouvernement reste
          conscient des risques lies a la grande dependance de cette activite principale
          du pays d'uneseule entreprise.Aussi a-t-ildecide, apres des concertationsetroites

                                            74

        avec I'ensemble des acteurs de la filiere, notammentles producteurs, d'engager
        un processus douverture de la fillere a d'autres operateurs. Dans ce cadre, il a
        leve le monopole de la SOFITEX en 2001, Cree un comite de suivi de la reforme
        du secteur coton en 2002, engage debut 2003 des etudes sur le mecanismede
        fixation des prixau producteur et sur le portagedes risques duns le contextedune
        filiere ouverte, preparele dossier d'appeld'offres pour deux zones cotonnieres (Est
        et Centre) et lance I'appel d'offres pour la pre-qualificationtechnique fin mai
        2003.
    31,D'autresactions prioritairesdu gouvernement dons ce cadre ont consiste en
                                                                                        ~


  -  la conduite d'actions a m&me de reduire de faCon durable la vulnerabilite de
     I'activiteagricole Iiee a la desertification et a une insuffisantemaitrise de I'eau, dont
     l'operation 50 000 fosses fumieres, le programmede la petite irrigation villageoise
     et ia conduite du programme SPAGA (piuiesprovoquees).
  -  l'initiationd'une serie d'actions duns le sens de I'intensificationet de la modernisation
     de I'agricuiture,a travers ia diffusion des equipements agricoles, de semences
     ameliorees a haut rendement et d'engrais aux paysanspauvres pour leur permettre
      de produire suftsamment pour leur alimentarion et de degager des surplus
      commercialisables ;
  -   le soutien du developpement de I'elevagetraditionnel et ia valorisation des zones a
      vocation pastorale.
  -   le financement des activites remuneratrices pour un accroissement et une
      diversification des revenus des ruraux, Ainsi, pius de 100 projets d'embouche ont
      ete finances et le Fonds d'Appui aux Activites Remuneratricesdes Femmes (FAARF)
      a mobilise au titre de I'annee 2001, quelque 2,3 milliardsde FCFA pour financet les
      activites economiques des femmes duns la quasi-totaiite des provinces ; la
      promotion de la petite irrigation villageoise participe egalement de cet objectif
      d'ameliorationdes revenus du monde rural.
   -  un appui a I'emergence des organisations paysannes par I'adoption des decrets
      portant creation et statuts des Chambres regionales d'agriculture (CRA) en
      decembre 2001, traduisant ainsi la volonte du Gouvernement d'accompagner les
      differentsacteurs operant dons le secteur agricole;
   -   le desenclavementdes zones ruraies par la construction de pistes rurales pour creer
       des p6les de developpement capables de stimuler une diversification des
       opportunites d'activites economiques.Ainsi, une premiere tranche de 266 km de
       pistes duns quatre (4)provinces et une seconde tranche de 387 km duns neuf (9)
       provinces ont ete realisees sur les ressources PPTE, duns le cadre dun programme
       globalde construction de 6000 kilometresde pistes ruralesa I'horizon2004.
1.4. PROMOLJVOIRLABONNEGOUVERNAiiCE
     32,Au plan de la gouvernance, ies efforts ont ete concentres au cours de i'annee
          2002 sur le renforcement, au plan politique, de la democratieet de I'Etat de droit.
          Dans le domaine economique, des mecanismes qui assurent la transparence,la
          responsabilite et I'obligation de rendre compte de ia gestion des finances
          publiques ont ete mis en oeuvre,
     33. En matiere de gouvernance democrukpe, la qu&e dun jeu electoral
          transparent recueillant I'adhesion de I'ensembiede la classe politiquea conduit a
           une revision du code electoral et au renforcement des prerogatives de la
          commission electorale nationale independante (CENI]. Dans cette m&me
           dynamique, la charte des partis politiques et le statut de I'opposition ont ete
           adoptes par I'Assemblee Nationaleet un observatoire independantdes elections

        IMFApprovesUS$34 MillionThree-Year PRGFArrangementfor BurkinaFaso

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year, SDR
24.08 million (about US$34 million) arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) for Burkina Faso, which will support the government's economic reform program for 2003-
06. The decision will make available to Burkina Faso an amount equivalent to SDR 3.44 million
(about US$5 million).

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that PRGF-
supported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a
participatory process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to
foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10years with a 5 %-year grace period on principal payments.

In commenting on the Executive Board's decision, Am:: Krueger, First Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:

"Burkina Faso's performance under three medium-term PRGF-supported programs during 1993-2002
was broadly satisfactory, and the policy agenda laid out in the PRSP adopted in 2000 i s being
followed faithfully. Real GDP growth has recovered over the period, inflation has remained low, and
progress has been made in improving expenditure management and implementing structural reforms.
However, Burkina Faso's economy remains fragile, and vulnerable to external shocks. Poverty
remains high, and limited administrative capacity and poor infrastructure pose a challenge to efforts
to raise the social indicators. A further strengthening o f governmental institutions, well-targeted and
effective public spending, measures to improve competitiveness and economic diversification, and
encouragement o f private sector and rural development will be needed to alleviate poverty and
achieve sustained economic growth.

"The authorities' fiscal consolidation efforts should continue. Particular attention needs to be paid to
revenue collection, which has been weak and has fallen short o f the level required to meet the
convergence criterion on revenue collection set by the West African Economic and Monetary Union.
In light of this, the authorities appropriately plan to strengthen customs administration and tax
administration, control, and collection inthe coming months.

"The authorities will also continue to contain domestically financed public expenditure, and remain
current on all domestic and external payments obligations. At the same time, resources will be


                                                   81

reserved to protect social sector spending, in particular for education and health. The government
intends to strengthen transparency in public finance management and the effectiveness o f public
spending, including HIPC Initiative-related spending. Further progress is expected inpromoting good
governance, combating corruption, and further encouraging public debate on economic and social
policy. The program and the PRSP policy agenda are appropriately focused on fostering economic
growth and working toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

"The government's program i s appropriately ambitious, and well aligned with the country's PRSP
policy agenda. It merits the support o f the international community. All multilateral and non-Paris
Club creditors are urged to participate fully in the HIPC Initiative for Burkina Faso," Ms. Krueger
said.

RecentEconomicDevelopments

Since 1993, Burkina Faso has satisfactorily implemented three PRGF-supported programs associated
with the conduct o f sound macroeconomic policies and significant structural reforms. Under these
programs, and following the devaluation o f the CFA franc in 1994, the real GDP growth rate
increased to 4.7 percent on average during 1996-2002 from 3.5 percent during 1990-95, despite two
drought years in 1998 and 2000 and terms o f trades shocks in 2000 and 2002.

Inflation remained low, but the external current account deficit widened during 1996-2002,
reflecting, among other things, a weak performance in non-cotton exports. Fiscal policy improved
generally, with the overall fiscal deficit contained. Major structural reforms have been carried out,
including inthe areas o f price, trade liberalization, and governance.

ProgramSummary

Achieving the macroeconomic objectives o f the program will require the implementation o f
appropriate fiscal policies and key structural reforms, including in tax administration, fiscal
transparency, and governance.

The fiscal program for 2003-04 aims at containing the basic budget deficit (including HIPC
Initiative-related social spending) at 4.5 percent o f GDP in 2003 and at reducing it to 3.5 percent o f
GDP in 2004. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would be limitedto 11.O percent o f GDP
in 2003 and reduced to 10 percent of GDP in 2004. To improve fiscal transparency and good
governance, the government will implementits medium-term action planto strengthen public finance
management. Government revenue i s projected to increase to 11.4 percent o f GDP in 2003 and to
12.3 percent o f GDP in 2004. On the expenditure side, the ratio to GDP o f total budgetary outlays
and net lending, excluding foreign-financed investment and lending, will increase from 15.7 percent
of GDP in2002 to 17.1 percent o f GDP in 2003 and fall to 16.7 percent in 2004.

The program also calls for reducing the stock o f expenditures committed but for which payment
orders have not been issued by CFA 15 billion in 2003, and stabilizing them in 2004, with the view
o f maintaining them below 10 percent o f total expenditure. The regional central bank BCEAO will
continue to pursue a prudentmonetary policy in 2003-04 aimed at containing inflationary pressures
and at reinforcingthe external position o fthe banking system.

On the structural front, the cotton sector has been liberalized gradually in recent years, with the
emphasis on strengthening the role o f producers' associations. To ensure the long-term viability o f
the sector, the government's strategy involves opening the sector to private sector participation, with
a view to improving further efficiency and competitiveness.

                  Annex 7: SimulatingPoverty-GrowthLinkageswith PAMS

        The Poverty Analysis Macroeconomic Simulator (PAMS) simulates income changes o f a
variety if representative households for any given change in aggregate economic output?l To do so,
PAMS decomposes aggregate income changes into income changes o f a number o f representative
households on the basis o f overall income growth and changes in relative incomes between
households representing different socio-economic groups. The characteristics o f the socio-economic
groups are drawn from a household survey and in Burkina Faso PAMS retraces income changes for
the 9 groups derived from the 1998 household survey.

        PAMS methodology could be summarized as follows. PAMS builds on any standard
consistent macroeconomic model. In the case o f the Burkina Faso model, PAMS data draws on a
standard RMSM-X. The macroeconomic model is then linkedto a set o f representative households
reflecting the original poverty headcount and income distribution. Representative households are
grouped into representative households with different labor categories. PAMS disaggregates the GDP
into sectors equivalent to the representative groups. By way o f simulating labor demand and supply
for each group the model determines the wage for each group and ensures that these prices feed
through to the production level. It then takes into account the income tax rates and transfers to
determine income growth by group and representative agents. This information can then be used to
derive the poverty headcount and determine the level o f inequality.

        The PAMS model has two shortcomings that should be kept in mind when analyzing its
output. First, it depends on a macro-consistent model and therefore the quality o f the results will
depend on the quality o f the model and the macroeconomic variables it produces. For example, the
RMSM-X that was used in the Burkina Faso model depends on a fixed coefficient production
function. Relative price changes therefore have no impact on the composition o f inputs since output
requires the exact combination o f certain levels o f production. Second, the model depends on
assumptions regarding the distribution o f incomes within representative groups and the elasticity o f
labor supply and demand usedto generate the changes in labor incomes.

        The model can be used for a variety o f different policy simulations. In particular, it can be
used to simulate the poverty impact o f changes inthe general macroeconomic environment, o f public
spending and transfer levels, taxation, and o f certain structural reforms leading to shifts o f relative
incomes.

        For the purpose o f the program document, the model has been used to represent the poverty
impact o f the change in the macroeconomic environment following the Ivorian crisis, as played out
by the differences in the macroeconomic scenarios before and after the crisis. In the following, the
annex presents a few key outputs from the model underpinning the summary results shown in the
main body o f the paper. For this purpose, Table 1 summarizes the main assumptions o f the
macroeconomic framework used for the analysis.

        As regards the development o f poverty incidence, figure 1underpinsthe explanation
p rided inthe text as regards the distributional impact o f the Ivorian crisis. The "hump" of
higherpoverty incidence (PO) is largely explained by income losses o f livestock exporters in
the rural area (PO-R) buffering from the closure o f thz border. By contrast, the pover:y
incidence in urban areas (PO-U) changes little. Rural poverty remains the driving force o f the
overall poverty incidence.

        The second figure presents the development of income inequality under the crisis
scenario. In particular, it shows that the macroeconomic assumptions presented in table 1
combined with the PAMS model assumption about labor demand and supply elasticities will
lead to a gradual increase in inequality as measured by the Gini coefficent. Interestingly, the
increase in the overall coefficient (Gini-T) i s much more pronounced than can be explained
by the change in either o f the two subgroups, with the urban sector (Gini-U) showing an
increase and the rural sector (Gini-R) a decrease in their coefficients. Hence the increase in
overall inequality projected by the model i s largely a result o f an increase in inequality
betweenrural and urban areas, reflecting the different income opportunities in both sectors
under the projected long-term growth scenarios.

                      Annex 8: Attainingthe MDGs inthe EducationSector

         During the last decade, Burkina Faso followed a satisfactory policy o f resource allocation
which reflects the priority given to basic education. As a result, between 1990 and 2002, the primary
school enrollment rate went up from 30 percent to 44 percent (36 percent for girls). New enrollments
inthe first year o fprimary school doubled over the same period. Education opportunities have been
greater for children in urban areas and especially for those in rural areas where 70 percent o f the new
classes were constructed during the past few years. Moreover, discrepancies between provinces are
diminishingsince the percentage o f provinces not achieving the national average school enrollment
rate went down from 73 percent to 57 percent.


resources were allocated for basic education in order to sustain its development - the portion o f the
         Recent progress was achieved through the implementation o f two strategies (i)additional

education sector budget which was allocated to basic education increased from 45 percent to nearly
60 percent between 1990 and 2001 - the availability o f schools also increased through the
construction o f an average o f 800 classes per year; and (ii)several measures were taken in order to
substantially reduce high unit costs so as to facilitate the expansion o f basic education. These
measures include among others (a) substantial hiring o f auxiliary teachers, thus allowing for the
reduction o f the average salary cost o f primary school teachers from 8.2 to 6.2 times the GNP per
capita in the country; (b) introduction o f double-shift classes, thus facilitating the enrollment o f 40
percent o f students in urban areas and thereby reducing urban demographic pressure; and (c)
introduction o f multigrade classes which allowed for the enrollment o f 25 percent o f rural area
children living inmunicipalities with very low populationdensity.

         Burkina also deployed major efforts to reduce demand constraints. To this effect, the ratio o f
schools with running water and sanitary facilities reached 47 percent and 45 percent respectively.
The number o f literacy centers more than doubled since 1990 and literacy programs which used to
involve 90 villages in 1990 now cover 4,500 villages. Inorder to further encourage the enrollment o f
poor students, the government has set up a system o f free donation o f school textbooks since 1996
and encouraged greater participation o f students' parents in school management. To lessen the
opportunity costs and benefit poor households as well as to promote girls' schooling, an important
effort was made to construct schools inthe vicinity o f villages; financial and material resources were
made available to students' mothers associations, thus allowing them to conduct income-generating
activities; inaddition, endogenous school canteens were opened inrural areas.

         The construction o f facilities for after school hours in rural areas (so-called bissongos) is an
interministerial measure toward the promotion o f girls' education and it also helps women to be more
productive.

         In parallel to those efforts, Burkina has taken measures to improve the quality of education
by (a) distributing school textbooks on a regular basis, thus allowing for an average o f one textbook
for two students in basic subjects; (b) improving the qualifications o f teachers, especially in rural
areas; and (c) introducing bilingual education on an experimental basis. Overall, these improvements
have helped reduce enrollment disparities between rural and urban areas, between regions as well as
between boys and girls.




                                                     95

Constraints

Despite these efforts, major problems still prevail, namely:

         Resource allocation to education can still be improved: public resources allocated to the
         education sector represent 21.6 percent o f public spending and 2.8 percent o f GNP, whereas
         African countries under HIPC devote an average o f 4.0 percent o f their GNP toward
         education;
         Unitcosts remainhighat the primary level (0.24 percent o fGNPper capita comparedto an
         average o f 0.15 for French-speakingAfrican countries);
         Inrural areas, the proportionof households not enrollingtheir children inschools increases
         with deciles o fthe less poor to the poorest;
         Retention rate i s low (60 percent compared to an average o f 67 percent for French-speaking
         African countries; and only 49 percent in rural areas and 41 percent for girls inthose areas);
         The education system remains characterized by high repetition rates: 15 percent between
         the first and the fifth years o f primary schooling and about 40 percent in the third year,
         which translates into highsocial demand for lower secondary education; and
         The cost o f one student successfully completing the primary level is double what it should
         be: drop out rates are high in the North (10.9 percent) and lower in the South-West (3.5
         percent); the gender gap expressed indrop out rates varies between regions: 12.5 percent for
         boys and 7.1 percent for girls in the North; and in the West, rates are respectively 8.1
         percent and 3.7 percent; in other regions, girls' drop out rates are either higher or more or
         less the same; in addition, the AIDS pandemic may undermine the results achieved so far.
         Not only does the life expectancy reduction due to AIDS limit the benefits from education
         investment, but it also threatens the efficiency o f the system due to the increased
         absenteeism o f teachers and students as well as to the necessity o f replacing sick teachers.
         The increased number o f AIDS orphaned children further complicates the management o f
         tasks within the education system.

Visions toward MDGsinthe context ofthe Ten-Year Program

        In regard to basic education, PDDEB aims at increasing access to a good quality basic
education for the majority of the country's population by looking for cost-efficient and financially
sustainable solutions which would be capable o f solving the problems which have so far hampered
the development o f the sector, causing its inequity and inefficiency.     The PDDEB will involve
communities andNGOs, setting up programs aiming at:

a. Increasing access to basic education by acting both on the demand and supply sides:

            On the supply side, policies and programs put inplace will be expanded so as to: increase
            the number o f primary schools; improve the capacity o f schools through multigrade and
            double-shift systems; reduce repetitions, recruit and train more teachers; develop new
            literacy and basic education approaches for women and out-of-school children; and give
           priority, in terms o f expenditures, to rural areas in general and to the most vulnerable
            populations.
        0   On the demand level, policies and programs set in place will be expanded so as to:
           provide all children with school textbooks and materials free o f charge (thus reducing
            costs for families); develop nutrition programs; involve students' parents in school



                                                   96

              decision making and management; intensify efforts and incentives to attract girls to
              school and set up awareness programs in areas which are still opposed to school
              enrollment.

b. Improving the school learning environment by offering instructional programs and materials
which promote learning; reinforce the efficiency o f continuing education courses; make schools more
responsible for education quality and better results; and increasing the volume o f teaching hours to
over 800 hours.

c. Through the education program, follow-up to the HIV/AIDS Population Project by recruiting
enough teachers to replace those who contracted the HIV/AIDS virus; training and informing
existing staff as well as new staff about HIV/AIDS related problems; ensuring that information
reaches students by setting up (i)a tutorial system; (ii)a sensitization program; (iii)by changing
attitudes; and (iv) by revising curricula, and by involving associations and NGOs already fighting
AIDS to provide assistance to AIDS orphans.

d. Reinforce decentralization and budget support capacities through improved procurement and
financial management and by follow-up to the education system.

e. Increase equity and efficiency o f expenditures by increasingthe share o f non-wage items

The objectives for the nextten years are as follows:

     0   At a reasonable cost, increase the gross enrollment rate inprimary school from 40 percent to
         70 percent, especially for children and girls in rural areas and improve the quality and
         efficiency o f schooling, thus raising the graduation rate from 24 percent to 55 percent;
     0   Offer quality functional literacy courses to adults (especially to women and to people living
         in deprived areas), to prematurely drop-outs and non-wage earning teenagers, and raise the
         literacy rate from 22 percent to 40 percent, to be provided by NGOs and community
         associations with low recurrent costs and with the creation o f a literacy and non-formal
         education fund;


     0   Offer 300,000 children aged 3 to 6 years old an education based on early childhood
         development, and offer 165,000 youngsters aged 9 to 15 years old who never went to school
         or who dropped out, a four-year bilingual education, as well as a pre-professional training at
         low recurrent costs;


     0   Improve the quality o f training and teaching in order to reduce waste due to high repetition
         and drop-out levels;


     0   Reinforce the management capacity o f schools, inspectorates and regions as well as MEBA
         pilot capacity to better handle the high volume o f activities which will be generated by the
         program and the decentralizatioddeconcentrationpolicy o f the country.

         Inthe year 2010, mainly due to an increase inthe school-agepopulationby about 30 percent,
the number ofyoung students enrolled inschools at that level will grow from 800,000 to 1,800,000,
an 123 percent increase over the period.

Policymeasuresto advancethe education agenda

   Five essential and highly complementary educational policy measures are in the process o f being
implemented:

      Gaining control over the financial framework o f the Ten-Year Program by: (i)increasing (in
      connection with debt reduction) the proportion o f the State budget allocated to education
      sector operations from 21.6 percent to 26 percent by 2010, while at the same time ensuring
      that the allocation for basic education will represent 60 percent o f the budget, and that the
      allocation for literacy will in turn represent 7 percent o f the budget for basic education;
      (ensuringthat primary school teachers are recruited over the next ten years at the regional
      level, and that they are recruited under conditions comparable to those o f community-level
      teachers in satellite schools, Le.: with compensation ranging from 3.5 to 5 times the per
      capita GDP, dependingon seniority. Application o f this measure would result in an average
      cost corresponding to about 4.7 times the country's per capita GDP, thus makingthe program


                                                                 98

  financially feasible.   An essential element taken into account under the program is the
  recruitment o f primary school teachers, since it is anticipated that 29,000 teachers will be
  recruited betweennow and 2010.
0 Gaining mastery o f the institutional framework. The directorates charged with management,
  design, evaluation, programming, steering and supervision in the educational sector, as well
  as the regional and departmental directors and inspectorates, will become a key element in
  the implementation o f the Ten-Year Program. In addition, the HIPC initiative will make
  substantial budgetary credits available to the social sectors. The plan is therefore to
  reorganize MEBA so that its services can be totally operational as soon as possible. This in-
  depth organization o f MEBA's administration will make it possible to specify mandates,
  responsibilities, appropriate professional profiles, norms and management and steering
  strategies, and to establish budget categories at the decentralized level. Improved capacity,
  within the Regional Directorates for Basic Education and Literacy (Directions Rkgionales de
  1'Enseignementde Base et de 1'Alphabe'tisationor DREBA) for guiding basic education, and
  within the Provincial Directorates for Basic Education and Literacy (DPEBA) and
  inspectorates for the coordination o f activities, will thus be assured.
  Targeted actions geared to the poorest and most vulnerable population groups: the pursuit o f
  an integrative approach to education (both formal and non-formal) in order to stimulate
  demand for education and better integrate schooling into its larger context; the continuation
  and intensification o f construction o f equipped classrooms and teachers' housing, essentially
  inrural areas, inorder to satisfy demandwhere it exists; the routine construction oflatrines in
  all new schools in order to foster a healthy environment and a proper education in hygiene
  and health; the systematic construction o f water points (either boreholes or large-bore wells)
  in the interest of an education integrating hygiene and health and for purposes of
  environmental protection; the generalization and intensification o f activities to promote
  school canteens, especially in rural areas, through investments and equipment that would
  make canteens autonomous, since they are an important element in school attendance; the
  implementation o f economic projects geared to adult women as an accompaniment to their
  training; the authorization o f flexible school year calendars in rural areas, and exemption
  from annual parent contributions for the parents o f female pupils and inthe twenty provinces
  with the lowest school enrollment rates; and the continuation o fthe policy o f free distribution
  o f school textbooks.
0 Increasing the efficiency o f public resource utilization in education through interventions
  aimed at ensuring a smoother procession o f pupils through the educational systems at the
  primary and secondary levels. Measures currently under preparation are aimed, on the one
  hand, at increasing, by 2010, the proportion o f CPI pupils who go on to the CM2 level from
  60 percent to 75 percent and, on the other hand, at reducing grade repetition at the primary
  level from 18 percent to 8 percent. Comparable progress is envisaged for the secondary
  level.
  Taking appropriate measures, to the extent that progress in school enrollment will mainly
  affect rural areas, to allow these populations, and particularly the poorest ones, to benefit
  effectively from the educational investments provided, and to ensure that those investments
  yield the anticipated social benefits. The important point i s that it will undoubtedly be
  necessary to make adjustments to the supply o f traditional educational services tin order to
  meetthe needs o fthese populations.

EFA-PAFinancingNeeds

        Macro-Financial Framework. The changes that occurred within the context o f the EFA-PA
and within the Ten-Year Program framework are related to(i) a GNP growth expectation o f 5
percent; and (ii)the share o f primary education in current education expenditures which would
diminish from 58 percent to 50 percent, instead of 55 percent as initially projected. Indeed, the
current budget share o f basic education does not allow for financing post-primary levels o f education.
The approach chosen frees up national resources and ensures an overall balanced system. The Ten-
Year Program's projected share o f current education expenditures compared with revenues is
maintained and would grow from 19,6 percent to 25 percent in 2015.              This adherence to the
framework will allow freeing up adequate national resources for the education sector.

        EducationPolicy Framework. The school enrollment rate would reach 100percent instead
o f 80 percent by 2015. The access rate in the first school year would reach 100 percent in 2010
instead o f 72 percent and the completion rate in primary school would reach 100 percent by 2015.

        The main constraint will be the capacity to implement the volume o f activities generated by
EFA-PA. This question was already addressed inthe context o f the Ten-Year Program and had led
to proposed institutional reforms to be progressively implemented before the end o f 2003. Within
this framework, decentralized levels will be given more responsibilities, and NGOs and associations
will be called upon by ministerial departments to assist the Ministry.

                       Annex 9: Attainingthe MDGsinthe HealthSector

         The recent Burkina Faso Country Status Report (CSR) provides the most comprehensive
source o f information on trends and patterns in key HNP indicators over the 1993-1999period, using
the last two Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). The CSR provides the analytic underpinnings
for health sector support, along with a series o f studies proposed under a PHRD grant that
accompanies the PRSC-3. The CSR will soon be widely disseminated and discussed at the country
level to raise awareness and to generate a consensus on key policy issues. The 2004 DHS (to be
partly financed by the Bank under the Burkina MAP) will provide further insights on progress during
the period covered by the CAS in terms o f HNP indicators as well as the first nationally
representative data on trends and patterns in HIV infectionrates.

         A number o f trends in the MDGs are worthwhile highlighting. First, infant and child
mortality, child malnutrition, and fertility are high in both an absolute terms, but also relative to other
African countries and what might be expected for Burkina Faso's income level. This suggests that
available resources (government and household) and not being mobilized efficiently or equitably to
improve health outcomes. Second, with a few exceptions, most o f the key indicators appear to have
stagnated or worsened during the 1990s, despite various efforts to increase health sector spending
and initiate sector reforms. For example, infant mortality remained unchanged (about 105 deaths per
1000 births), but deaths among children aged 1-5 increased (from 109/1000 to 127/1000). Child
malnutrition may also have increased slightly, with one-third o f children malnourished. Maternal
mortality may have also declined during the 1990s but remains relatively high. Third, there are
significant variations inHNP outcomes, particularly between rural and urban areas, and also between
the richest 20 percent and the poorest income quintiles. Fourth, principle direct causes o f high
morbidity and mortality include malaria (responsible for 1/3 child deaths), diarrhea, respiratory
infections, and increasingly HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Indirect causes include poverty, low rates
o f female education, and malnutrition.

        A cursory analysis o f the MDGs suggests that if trends in key health indicators were to
continue, Burkina Faso would not meet its MDG targets. In fact, the country appears to be
'considerably off track' interms o f most o f these targets. For example, as can be seen from the figure
above, if trends in infant mortality since the mid 1990spersist, Burkina will only be able to attain a

very modest decline inthe IMRby 2015. While the country is highly unlikely to reach the MDGgoal
o f an IMR o f 37 by 2015 it will need to take appropriate actions to facilitate an accelerated and
sustained decline. This will imply further raising immunization coverage rates, improving nutrition
conditions, and promoting child spacing and exclusive breastfeeding. Particular attention will needto
be given to identifying cost effective ways to target those in greatest need. By simply regaining the
rate o f decline attained during 1975-89, the IMRcould reach 85 per 1000 live birthsby 2015; a more
rapid rate o f decline would move the country even closer towards the MDGs.

HIV/AIDS Operations

         IDA has played a pivotal role in supporting the government's HIV/AIDSnational program
since the mid 1 9 9 0 providing well over 50 percent o f the total funding. The IDA-funded Population
                       ~ ~
and AIDS Control Project, which closed in September 2001, assisted in raising awareness,
strengthening treatment o f opportunistic infections and sexually transmitted infections, and
supporting non-governmental organizations and associations. This project was instrumental in
piloting an innovative community driven scheme for combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. An
external evaluation o f this scheme found that it i s feasible to mount a major initiative, on a large
scale, in a relatively short time, and at a reasonable cost. In nine months, the pilot scheme funded
close to 600 micro-projects worth US$175,000. This was a major accomplishment, with close to 95
percent o f all villages o f Poni province reached by the scheme. The pilot demonstrated the capacity
and commitment o fprovincial and local authorities to mount an initiative o f major scale, and to move
away from boutique approaches to HIV/AIDS. This scheme i s now being scaled up to other
provinces in Burkina under the IDA-funded US$22 millionHIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project.

         The Burkina HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project was approved in July 2001 under the
Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa region framework. With the rapid preparation and
approval o f the MAP operation, IDA has maintained a continual presence inBurkina Faso. The credit
became effective in March 2002. The project built on many o f the lessons from both the Health and
Nutrition Project and AIDS and Population Control Project, and is being implemented through the
same experienced coordinating unit that managed the previous AIDS & Population Project. A Q A G
assessment (August 2002) found that the overall quality at entry o f the project was satisfactory, with
relatively high marks in terms o f project design, piloting o f key activities (e.g. Poni community
scheme), tapping country and sector knowledge and monitoring and evaluation. The assessment also
highlighted some weaknesses in terms o f environmental and implementation arrangements, and
excessive number o f conditions o f effectiveness.

         The operation has gotten offto a good start with steady progress towards the accomplishment
o f the development objectives. InJanuary 2003, roughly US$2.9 million had been disbursed or close
to 13 percent o f the total project cost, suggesting that this is a relatively well disbursing MAP
operation. Main achievements can be summarized as follows.

         First,the line ministry component has gotten off to an excellent start, buildingon the earlier
experience with the channeling o f funds to line ministries piloted under the recently closed
Population and AIDS Control Project. The CNLS has approved the work plans o f 12 line ministries
for a total o f roughly US$2.0 million. All these line ministries have launched their activities and
many have already requested replenishments. The execution rate (Le. percentage o f activities carried
out in relation to programmed activities) is well over 70 percent in most cases. The challenge now
will be to improve reporting and monitoring o f these activities and give greater attention to care and
support.


                                                  103

         Second, there has been good progress in moving forward on the community driven activities.
Activities have restarted in Poni province with roughly 430 sub-projects now approved and
underway. The 'scale up phase' has now gotten off the ground and is more ambitious in scope and
scale than previously planned. The goal i s to extend this scheme to the 12 most populated provinces
o f Burkina, reaching approximately 45 percent o f the total population. Training modules are now
under translation into three local languages (Mori, Dioula, and Fulhlde). A workshop was held in
late November 2002 to train some 220 provincial trainers. The goal is to use a cascade approach to
training, whereby the 220 provincial trainers will train some 900 departmental trainers, who in turn
will work with close to 20,000 village representatives. All provinces are expected to their sub-
projects by early March 2003. This undertaking is rather ambitious, which will necessitate close
follow up and technical support.

         Third, the Bank team is in the process o f finalizing the design o f a care and support
component, including anti-retroviral therapy. Burkina Faso is one o f the first countries in the Bank
(inaddition to Barbadosand Senegal) to include fundingo fARV drugsunderan IDA operation. The
government has developed a well designed proposal which includes a three-prong approach: (i)
strengthening the urban service delivery networks in Ouagadougou & Bobo Dioulasso by supporting
the university hospitals and other service providers to expand the number o f patients under treatment
and working with the lower level facilities to ensure patient follow up; (ii)developing a rural model
for introducing ARV therapy to demonstrate the feasibility o f delivering these drugs in a rural
setting; and (iii)supporting a prospective 2-year clinical trial through the Centre Muraz, which will
place a cohort o f patients under treatment with a view to testing the efficacy o f a regimen o f generic
ARV drugs; identifying most appropriate alternative drug regimens in case o f drug resistance and
serious secondary effects; and testing two modalities for following up patients (Le. weekly vs
monthly DOTS). The clinical trial is expected to provide valuable information to inform an eventual
scaling up o f this initiative. It is expected that IDA support for ARV therapy would have an
important catalytjc effect, encouraging other donors to support this program as well.

         The Bank team has also devoted a substantial amount o f attention to ensuring that a good
system for monitoring and evaluating the HAART (highly-active antiretroviral therapy) initiative i s
in place from the outset to assess results and to draw lessons for an eventual scale up of these
activities. To this end, we have been working to foster a partnership between the government o f
Burkina and ANRS (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA), with a view to putting in place
an external, independent evaluation o f the HAART initiative. The proposed evaluation would cover
the national HAART initiative and not only the IDA operation. The 'process' evaluation would cover
such as issues as: adequacy o f pricing arrangements; frequency o f drug stock outs; and quality o f
services at various levels. The 'clinical and biological' evaluation would assess the efficacy o f
treatment on a sample o f patients from all facilities, comparing certain indicators with those patients
benefiting from the clinical trial. The 'socio-economic ' evaluation would aim to quantify the benefits
o f treatment (e.g. gains inproductivity; foregone medical costs due to hospitalization; quality o f life
improvements) incomparison to the costs (direct and indirect) o f treatment. Likewise, the evaluation
would explore changes in discriminatory practices and solidarity mechanisms at the household and
community level resulting from expanded access to treatment. The economic evaluation would also
assess what is the most cost-effective way o f delivering these services in both an urban and rural
setting. Finally, there would be an assessment o f how the introduction o f treatment has influenced
sexual behavior and attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS.

PartnershipinBurkina Faso's DevelopmentStrategy

        The government o f Burkina Faso outlined its development strategy in a poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP) in May 2000. The Bank and FundBoard endorsed this strategy in June 2000,
as well as the first (December 2001) and second (November 2002) annual progress report. The
government intendsto fully update the PRSP in2003. The PRSP sets out the following four pillars o f
the government's strategy (i)accelerating equitable growth; (ii)  promoting access to social services;
(iii)increasingemploymentandincome-generatingactivities forthepoor; and(iv) promotinggood
governance.

        The Fundhas supported Burkina Faso under three arrangements under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility between 1994 and 2002, and the authorities intend to request a fourth
subsequent arrangement in 2003. The Fund takes the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic
policies and monitors macroeconomic performance by way o f quantitative performance criteria. In
addition, it has established inthe recent past structural performance criteria inthe areas o f tax policy,
financial transparency and good governance, and trade policy. The Bank is supporting the
implementation o f the PRSP in the areas o f public finance management, good governance,
decentralization, health, education, and cotton reform through a series o f poverty reduction support
credits (PRSC) complemented with a portfolio o f specific projects to address AIDS, basic education,
infrastructure investments, rural development, and private sector development, as outlined more fully
below.

The Country Assistance Strategy (FY 00-03) and the BankPortfolio

         The general objctive o f the November 2000 Co,.mtry Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
World Bank i s to support the Government's efforts, as described in the June 2000 PRSP, to achieve
sustained high growth rates, to reduce the high incidence o f poverty, and to improve the nutrition,
health, and education o f the rural population, which constitutes the largest group among the poor.
The CAS has three specific objectives: (i)supporting policies and programs aimed at improving the
supply side o f the economy to allow for sustained, broad-based and export-oriented growth;
(ii)improving public finance management to increase efficiency of public spending; and (iii)
ensuring that the allocation process and public spending effectiveness goals result in special
emphasis on social services.

         The Bank's assistance to the PRSP is intended to be selective and complementary to
activities supported by other donors. Specifically, the Bank envisages a program and related country
budget allocation which will (i)give priority to supervision o f ongoing projects; (ii)acknowledge the
important role o f donors; (iii)consolidate lending operations into fewer but broader resource transfer
mechanisms that are more closely integrated with the Government's own budgetary allocation and
execution processes; and (iv) include a share o f non-lending services to foster a robust analytical base
for consensus and partnership building.

         To refocus its assistance program with a consistent emphasis on rapid growth with poverty
reduction, the Bank Group strategy in Burkina Faso focuses attention on (i)     key social sectors where
there are viable long-term strategies or where they can be developed; (ii)longer-term economic



                                                   105

reforms to improve competitiveness and reduce business costs; (iii)improving public resource
management; and (iv) adapting Bank programs to the sub-regional framework and potentials. Bank
lending to Burkina Faso takes the form o f results-driven programmatic credits (PRSCs) and self-
standing projects for capacity building, support for Community Driven Development activities
(concentrating on rural, social or HIV/AIDS interventions) and infrastructure investments directly
targeted to poverty alleviation and private sector development. There is a continued commitment to
analytical and advisory activities as knowledge i s the critical input for progress in the substantive
areas presented inthe PRSP.

        The March 2003 CAS Progress Report (i)assesses the progress made on implementing the
PRSP and the FYO1-03 CAS; (ii)      provides an update on the economic and social developments;, (iii)
elaborates the new challenges which Burkina Faso i s facing; and (iv) identifies the risks for
continued implementation o f the PRSP and CAS. The progress report confirms that the strategy set
out inthe 2000 CAS remains appropriate and proposes an extension o f this strategy for 12-18 months
to cover the period until the new CAS is prepared. The new CAS is expected to follow closely the
full update o fthe PRSP, which will likely be completed inearly 2004.

        Assessment of Country Policies. Inclose collaboration with the Burkinabe authorities, IDA
has undertaken a substantial body o f analytic work over the past three years to assess key social,
structural, and sectoral development policies and identify policy and institutional reform priorities for
poverty reduction. IDA has relied on a combination o f the PRSP and its annual progress reports, a
second priority poverty survey and two poverty profiles, sectoral policy notes, and informal papers
on specific issues such as constraints to growth and competitiveness, or the dynamics o f poverty and
income inequality. IDA has also helped the Burkinabe authorities carry out analytical work in key
sectors (education, health, rural development, energy, transport, and private sector development) and
assisted with the preparation o f a comprehensive economic study on long-term sources o f growth and
competitiveness in 2001. On poverty reduction, two further studies are planned in the near future, a
Participatory Poverty Assessment (2002-2003) and the ThirdNational Household Survey (2002-03).

        Since the beginning o f the structural reforms in the early 1990s, the World Bank has
approved, in addition to support for investment projects, two structural adjustment credits, an
economic recovery credit, an agricultural sector adjustment credit, a transport adjustment credit, an
economic management reform credit and two poverty reduction support credits (PRSC-1 and PRSC-
2). The Bank's cumulative commitments to Burkina Faso as o f May 12,2003, amount to US$1,359.5
millionequivalent for 64 operations, comprising 61 IDA credits and 3 IFC investments.

        The currenr portfolio amounts to commitments o f US$504.3 million, o f which
US$353 million is undisbursed. IDA'Sactive portfolio inBurkina Faso is as follows:

        The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2) was approved in July 2002 for
        US$35 million. The PRSC program focuses on key sectoral action plans and reforms to
        improve public finance management, the competitiveness o f the economy, and to facilitate
        the country's integration into the regional and world economy.

        Three operations support IDA'Sstrategy in the agriculture sector. A second Agricultural
        Services project (US$4 1.3 million, FY98) aims at increasing agricultural productivity and
        farmers' incomes, improving natural resource management and promoting institutional
        development. A Private Irrigation project (US$5.2 million, FY99) supports provision o f the



                                                  106

  demand-driven services necessary for the development o f an efficient, sustainable small
  irrigation subsector in Burkina Faso. A Community-Based Rural Development Program
  (US$66.7 million, FYO1) aims at reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development in
  rural areas. Its first phase provides for building local capacity to plan and implement rural
  development projects, accelerating the pace o f public transfers for decentralized rural
  development, and supporting implementation o fthe country's decentralization framework.

  To support human resource development, four operations are being implemented. In
  education,a Basic Education operation (US$32.6 million) was approved inJanuary 2002 by
  the World Bank Executive Board. The project provides support for the Government's Ten-
  Year Basic Education Program, which will be implemented inthree phases the first o f which
  covers the period 2001-05. The main development objective o f Phase Io f the Ten-Year
  Program is to lay the foundation for accelerating the development o f basic education, while
  ensuring adequate quality and financial sustainability. A Post-Primary Education project
  (US$26 million, FY97) finances parts o f the Government's post-primary education strategy.
  The Bank also assists the country with the implementation o f a new Development Learning
  Center (US$ 2.5 million, FY03) for distance learning activities that will give the Burkinabk
  access to the latest research worldwide. A HIV/AIDS Disaster Response project
  (US$22 million, FY02) underpinsthe implementation o f the government's 2001-04 medium-
  term HIV/AIDS/STIs strategic plan, which has been endorsed by the country's technical and
  financial partners.

  In the urban sector, an Urban Environment project (US$37 million, FY95) aims at
  improving living conditions through priority urban works and urban services benefiting low-
  income groups. Under this project, supplemental financing o f US$22 million to the
  government's decentralization process was approved inFY02.

  A water supply project (US$70 million, FYO1) aims at increasing access to adequate and
  reliable potable water in Ouagadougou through expanded distribution and tertiary water
  networks and improvedurban water subsector management.

0 In the mining sector, a Mining Sector Capacity Building and Environmental Management
  project (US$2 1.4 million, FY97) supports regulatory reform and training, institutional
  strengthening and resource management, environmental management and small-scale
  artisanal mining.

0 A technical assistance credit for private sector development (Competitiveness and Enterprise
  Development project, US$30.7, FY03) provides support to implement the privatization
  program; improve the quality, access, and cost o f telecommunications; and promote the
  development o f a strong indigenous private sector in Burkina Faso through a streamlined
  business environment and well-targeted financial and non-financial services to small and
  medium-size enterprises.

  The Bank approved a Transport Sector Project in April 2003 for US$92.1 million. It is
  expected that this project will be effective by June 2003. The project concentrates on rural
  roads as the rural economy is the main source o f income and employment for 80 percent o f
  the population.

The Bank'sproposedlendingprogramis as follows:

    0   In the energy sector, the Bank is considering assisting the Government, through a sector
        reform operation (FY04), aimed at introducing private sector participation to improve the
        efficiency o f the provision o f electricity services and the supply o f hydrocarbon products to
        the economy, and increasing access to infrastructure services, especially for rural
        communities.

    0   A third PovertyReduction Support Credit (PRSC-3) is envisaged for Board presentation
        inearly FY04.


Bank-FundCollaborationin Specific Areas

        Cotton sector. Bank and Fund staffs jointly follow developments in the cotton sector
because o f its importance for macroeconomic aggregates and rural incomes. Fund staff focuses on
the overall financial management of the cotton sector in order to limit spillover effects for
government finances and the banking sector. Bank staff i s accompanying the government's structural
reform agenda in the sector under a series o f PRSCs. These reforms aim at creating a more
competitive environment by introducing additional operators over time while safeguarding the
historical achievements o f a prudent financial management and involvement o f producer
organizations in decision-making processes, includingthe setting o fproducer prices.

        Public finance management and good governance. Bank and Fund closely collaborate in
supporting the government's reforms in the area o f public finance management and good
governance. Important elements o f the reform program are enshrined inthe government's own action
plan for the improvement o f budget management and incorporate the main recommendations o f the
HIPC Assessment and Action Plan prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staff and the Country
Financial Accmntability Assessment (CFAA). Recently, the Bank's PRSC has %cused on creation
and operationalization o f the Supreme Audit Court, resumption o f regular submissions o f budget
audit laws to the Supreme Audit Court and the National Assembly, as well as revisions to
procurement laws and regulations. The Bank's PRSC i s also supporting extensions o f the
computerized expenditure circuit to deconcentrate budget execution, and together with sector-
specific projects is assisting with the preparation for the political decentralization planned for 2003.
The Fund's PRGF-supported program included measures for the effectiveness o f the Supreme Audit
Court, and the Fund has given technical assistance for tax and customs administration. Both Bank
and Fund staffs have followed jointly the government's anti-corruption policies, including the
creation o f the HighAuthority for the Fight against Corruption.

        Promotion of private sector activity. Given the importance o f private sector development
for accelerating growth, Bank and Fund staffs take a close common interest in policies that foster
competition as well as privatization. The Fundfocuses on trade policies and protection and monitors
the financial performance o f public enterprises. The Bank has taken the lead in assisting with the
privatization inthe energy and telecommunications sectors and removing administrative obstacles for
the creation ofenterprises and private investment.

EnvironmentalClassificationand SafeguardPolicy

         Based on the above project objectives, PRSC-3 was classified as a sectoral adjustment credit
(SECAC) at a meeting convened by the Bank-wide PRSC Working Group, in accordance with the
Interim Guidelines for PRSCs o f May, 2001. According to Bank policy, the Operational Directive
(OD) 8.60, Adjustment Lending, and Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 `Environmental Assessment'
apply to this Credit. Inaccordance with OP 4.01, the Credit was categorized as a B without a separate
Environmental Assessment. Since the Credit will support rural development through the
development o f action plans in key `filihres' such as cotton and horticulture, OP 4.09, Pest
Management may also apply. However, an environmental analysis consistent with the requirements
o f OD 8.60 is annexed to the Program Document. In accordance with the Bank's revised disclosure
policy, this environmental analysis annex was disclosed through the World Bank InfoShop, and in
Burkina Faso prior to the appraisal o fthe credit.

Analysis and Mitigation Measuresof the PotentialEnvironmentaland SocialImpactsof PRSC-


Analysis of PotentialImpacts

         The potential environmental and social impacts o f PRSC-3 are those resulting from its
sectoral coverage. Such impacts that relate primarily to the investments in education, health, and
rural development are not expected to be o f a great magnitude, nor would be irreversible. At this
stage, these potential environmental and social impacts can only be described in generic terms. More
specific description o f the potential impacts associated with each targeted sector is provided below.

         Rural development: The rural development operations envisa5ed under PRSC-3 fall under
two categories. The first category concerns the development o f actions susceptible to encourage
agricultural diversification. The second category o f activities includes those associated with the
liberalization o f the cotton sub-sector.

         The potential environmental impacts associated with the above-mentioned activities are o f
many kinds, though not irreversible. Diversification may improve soil fertility management and
reduce the need for insecticide use, but could also be accompanied by more intensive agricultural
methods. Efforts aiming at intensifying agricultural production may lead to better soil fertility
management (e.g., through nutrient replenishment) but may also lead to increased and inappropriate
use o f pesticides, which may result in adverse (and sometimes catastrophic) environmental and social
impacts. The privatization o f some o f the cotton ginning plants may require that environmental
audits be commissioned inorder to identify and remedy outstanding any environmental problems that
are associated with the operations o f these plants.

        Health sector development: Overall, the activities supported under the basic health sector
development evolve around strategic policy reforms aimed at more effective targeting o f the poor for
the delivery of basic services, institutional strengthening and decentralization o f service provision,
and human resource strengthening. More specifically, improved access (through removing fees on
preventive services, reducing the price o f essential drugs), maintaining adequate budget allocations
for basic health services, and development o f better incentives for the outpost personnel will be the



                                                   116

priority under PRSC 3. Essentially, these activities that are all based on the 10-year national health
development plan will generate limited irreversible adverse environmental impacts. The main
environmental concerns evolve around the management o f hazardous medical waste, including
needles, disposal o f hazardous substances, human body parts, etc..

         Basic education development: As mentioned above, the main activities planned under the
proposed PRSC 3 include continued support to the poorest families in the form o f subsidized school
supplies, expanding the number o f schools, and strengthening the capacity o f the Ministry of Basic
Education. The only potential environmental impacts associated with such activities would be those
resulting from the construction o f school buildings and sanitary facilities.

Mitigation measures

         PRSC-3 will address the environmental concerns described above by drawing on both the
national regulations requiring environmental impact assessment o f qualified investments, on the on-
going Bank-supported sectoral investment projects, and on environmental assessment capacity
buildingactivities supported by PRSC-3.

         Rural development: The potential environmental associated with the intensification of
agricultural production are addressed through two main axes o f government interventions. The first
axis i s the promotion o f conservation practices that help maintain the productive capacity o f the
resource base. Soil and water conservation activities have long been at the core o f the national efforts
aimed at encouraging the adoption o f sustainable agricultural practices. In fact, soil and water
conservation was the single most important environmental concern identified and included in the
PRSP. Duringthe first year o f PRSP implementation significant progress was made inthis area under
the aegis o f the national soil fertility initiative (supported by the HIPC resources). Labor-intensive
soil and water conservation structures were constructed on 51,000 ha, and the adoption rate 80
percent in some of the targeted areas. The creation o f village resource comervation associations
helped accelerate these efforts during the second year o f the PRSP implementation, although
quantitative assessment is not available yet.

         The second axis o f intervention aimed at mitigating the adverse environmental impact o f
agricultural intensification is the control o f pesticide-related pollution, and hazards. The most
significant efforts in this area are related to pesticide registration. In addition to national policy
initiatives, these efforts benefit from a regional pesticide registration initiative supported by a number
o f donors through the CILSS. Pesticide and pest management efforts have increased inthe last years
in Burkina Faso due to the increasing number of pesticide contamination and poisoning cases, but
also to the increasing resistance o f pest to existing pesticides. In the country, there are cases of
successful integrated pest management initiatives. However, these success stories are still very
limited innumber. Inparticular, there i s no articulated national pest management plan.

         Through the on-going IDA-financed decentralized rural development operation, the
government will support the promotion o f alternative and complementary ways o f pest management,
in compliance with the requirements of Bank OP on Pest Management (OP 4.09), and Burkinabe
regulations contained in articles 42-46 (dealing with pesticide and fertilizer management issues) o f
the Environment Code. Compliance with these policies and regulations will require putting in place
specific measures for handling, using, and storing products, awareness raising, and training o f
stakeholders in these areas. The IDA-financed community-driven rural development operation is



                                                     117

developing a screening tool that will help identify and mitigate any adverse social and environmental
problems associated with community-driven investments.

        Finally, en environmental audit o f the plants to be privatized will be conducted in order to
capture any environmental problemdliabilities associated with this privatization. In addition to
determining the scope o f these environmental liabilities, the audit will establish how the latter will be
handled in the privatization transaction. The environmental audit will be completed before the
financial bids are submitted, in order to make allowances for potential environmental and social
mitigation costs. The environmental audit o f these plants will take place during the preparation o f
PRSC-4. Prior actions for PRSC-4 also include activities pertaining to the privatization o f two key
utility enterprises (SONABEL, SONABHY, and ONATEL). Inaddition to changes inthe regulatory
framework and the adoption o f the privatizationstrategy, such activities will include the launching o f
the bidding process for the transfer o f assets. The bidding documents and the "cahier des charges"
will include provisions for addressing the environmental aspects identified by the environmental
audits o f these two enterprises conducted in2002.

        Health sector development: Long before the country adopted an Environmental Code,
hazardous healthcare waste was a concern to the authorities. Specific measures consisting mainly in
the conditioning and disposal o f these wastes (through incineration) were included in the
management and administration o f all health care facilities/services. These requirements are included
inthe current 10-year national plan. Here also, the IDA-supportedHIV/AIDS operation has prepared
and adopted a national healthcare waste management plan that will guide the implementing unit in
handlingthese wastes.

         Basic education sector development: Through the Basic Education Sector project, PRSC-3
will make sure that Bank's requirements and policies are met inthe construction o f school buildings.
The Basic Education Sector project has prepared a framework that meets Bank's requirements.

Links Between PRSC-3 and Complementary Sector Investment Projects in Safeguards
Compliance

        As is apparent from the analysis presented above, there is a direct and strong link between
PRSC-3 and the on-going sector investment projects, as far as the compliance with environmental
and social safeguards is concerned. Given the fact that these accompanying sectoral investment
operations have their own environmental management plans (EMPs) that were developed to mitigate
the main environmental and social impacts identified duringtheir appraisal, it makes more sense to
rely on these elaborate plans to ensure compliance with Bank's requirementsandpolicies.

     Since, the TTLs o f these investments operations are members o f the PRSC-3 team, they are
individually (at least, before the PRSC-3 team) responsible for ensuring that the EMPs o f the
operations they manage are fully implemented. The details o f these EMPs can be found in the
disclosed EA documents o f the respective projects. In addition to the operations o f the sectors
covered by PRSC-3 (i.e.,      rural development, health and education), the Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development project, and the Urban Environment project will also be part o f these
compliance efforts because prior actions o f PRSC 4 include some activities o f these two projects (as
mentioned above). More details on these compliance responsibilities are addressed below. For the
sake o f information, the list o f the sector investment operations engaged in, and responsible for
ensuring compliance with the environmental and social safeguards o f PRSC-3 include the following:

         The Basic Education Sector Project;
         The HIV/AIDSDisaster Response Project;

Consultationand Disclosure

         In accordance with the requirements of the revised disclosure policy, this annex was
disclosed publicly in-country, and at the World Bank Infoshop. Investments made with support o f the
PRSC will be subject to government policy, which likewise requires public consultation and for
environmental impact statement ("notice environnementale") documents o f projects with potential
adverse impacts on the environment.

         Inall cases, an environmental management plan, or a medical waste management planwould
have to be produced (cost and institutional arrangement for implementation) and implemented.
Arrangements should be made within each ministry in order to oversee the integration o f these
aspects into the evaluation and implementation o f sectoral projects. Overall, PRSC-3 as a single
tranche operation i s not likely to generate significant adverse environmental and social effects.

BorrowerReadinessfor Addressing SafeguardIssues

         Like many other IDA countries Burkina Faso prepared a NEAP in the early 1990's. But
unlike others, the Burkina NEAP did not get translated into a coherent investment program that
would have included capacity building components. This resulted in delays in the establishment o f
the regulatory framework, insufficient experience and low capacity in some areas o f environmental
management, especially, environmental impact assessment. The current regulatory framework for
environmental managment o f the country i s the result o f a slow but steady development o f
environmental laws, includinga land law, a forestry law, and a mining law.
         In compliance with the Interim Guidelines (for PRSCs) and OD 8.60, the preparation of
PRSCs provided the opportunity to ascertain the readiness of the country to apply environmental
assessment to development projects. This readiness that was conducted under PRSC-1 focuses on the
institutional and technical capacity o f the       government agencies involved in the oversight o f
environmental assessment (EA). Most environmental policies and practices in Burkina Faso are
based on the Environmental Law enacted in 1997. Articles 17-24 o f this law describe the conditions
under which an environmental assessment (EA) o f development activities i s required, and the
procedures to be followed inpreparing EA studies. Typically, the law requires that any development
activity that is likely to generate significant negative environmental impacts be subject to an
environmental impact assessment, and that this assessment be cleared by the Ministry o f
Environment. The law also requires public consultation to be heldwith affected parties/communities
to discuss the potential impacts and their mitigation.

         The assessment found that although Burkina Faso has the necessary regulations pertainingto
environmental assessment, compliance with such regulations is quite weak. There are three main
reasons for this low performance in complying with EA regulations. The first one i s the very recent
enactment o f these regulations (1997), and the late adoption o f the implementation decree o f these
regulations (June 2001). The second reason i s the lack o f clarity in the responsibilities o f the
institutions responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations. Finally, the lack o f technical



                                                    119

capacity and awareness both within the government and in the non-government sector for applying
EA to development operations constitutes a great obstacle to getting higher level of compliance with
the enacted regulations. Based on this assessment, an agreement was reached to make capacity
building in environmental assessment the key aspect of the measures proposed to deal with these
environmental issues in PRSCs.

         PRSC-2 provided the opportunity for beginning to tackle these constraints. An agreement
was reached during the appraisal o f PRSC-2 that the following measures will implemented in order
to create the conditions necessary for ensuring compliance with both the World Bank environmental
and social safeguardpolicies and the Government's own EA regulations:

            Preparing a three-year capacity buildingplan for EA;
            Establish small EA cells, at minimum in the ministries covered by PRSC-2 (i.e.,
            Education, Health, and Agriculture and Livestock). These units will help screen sectoral
            investments for the integration o f environmental and social safeguards when necessary
            with technical and regulatory oversight from DGPE and CONAGESE). Environmental
            management plans (EMPs) will be financed by the investing sector/ministry, but the latter
            may benefit from technical support from other ministries, or specialized public or non
            public institutions;
            Clarify the mandates and responsibilities o f CONAGESE and DGPE in those areas
            pertaining to EA compliance and enforcement (will be done through the up-coming first
            national conference o f CONAGESE);
            Hold a workshop to share and disseminate the content o f national EA procedures and
            World Bank environmental and social safeguards in order to make it easier for the
            ministries involved (and other ministries involved in future PRSCs) to comply with these
            procedures and safeguards; and
            Prepare technical guidelines for sector- or activity-specific EAs.

         Some o f these measures were to be implemented before o f effectiveness o f PRSC-2, others
during the implementation o f the credit and the preparation and implementation o f PRSC-3, still
others, such as capacity building required long-term on-the-job, and formal training. In addition to
the above measures, it was agreed that in the short-term the main burden o f complying with
environmental and social safeguards (as required by Bank Policies) will fall on on-going IDA
operations.

Implementationof Agreed Measures

         Duringthe course o f 2002, the Government implemented most of the measures agreed at the
time o f PRSC-2 appraisal:

   (i)TheGovernmenthasdevelopedacomprehensiveEAcapacitydevelopmentplan;
   (ii)FocalpointsforEAhavecreatedinkeylineministries;
  (iii)A workshop was heldwiththe sectoralfocalpoints, NGOs,andafew consultingfirms to
         workshop to share and disseminate the content o f World Bank environmental and social
         safeguard policies in order to make it easier for the ministries involved (and other ministries
         involved infuture PRSCs) to comply with these policies;




                                                  120

  (iv) The responsibilities o f the former CONAGESE (now CONED) and the Directorate o f
        Environment in assuring compliance with EA requirements were clarified in a national
        workshop.

        Under the new institutional arrangements, the `Direction GCnCrale de 1'Environnement-
DGE" holds primary responsibility for enforcing EA requirement, and CONED (national council for
sustainable development- -former CONAGESE) i s to ensure that environmental concerns are fully
integrated into development planningand policy making. It i s worth mentioning that during2002, the
Ministry o fEnvironmentadopteda new organizational and functional chart that made it necessary to
update the distribution o f responsibilities in the implementation o f the EA capacity development
plan. Overall, by preparing a capacity building plan, establishing EA focal points in line ministries,
and clarifying the responsibility between government agencies responsible for ensuring compliance
with EA regulations, the Government has created important enabling conditions for ensuring the
enforcement and compliance with its own EA requirements, and Bank safeguards.

        However, these one-shot measures need to be complemented and supported by sufficient
investmentincreating the technical skills neededto improve the enforcement o f EA requirements in
the implementation o f the public investment program, inparticular inthe sectors covered by PRSC-3.
In fact, compliance with EA requirementsremains weak in both the private and the public sector
despite the above-mentioned achievements. Lack o f awareness among public and private operators,
and low technical capacity o f the agencies responsible for enforcing EA requirements remain strong
bindingconstraints to achieving effective enforcement of, and compliance with EA requirements.

Arrangementsfor Borrowerto Address SafeguardIssues

        Removingthe constraints to ensuring effective compliance with Bank safeguards policies and
Burkina's EA requirements will require a long-term commitment to capacity building. In fact, Based
on the review o f environmental pclicies and practices o f the county (PRSC-l), an agreement has
been reached between the Bank and the Borrower on the fact that long-term national capacity
building(national agencies, consulting firms, NGOs, civil society, etc.) in EA is the best avenue for
assuring effective compliance with Bank safeguards in PRSCs. This approach that aims at filling the
Borrower's capacity gap i s consistent with the Operational Memorandum on the Interim Guidelines
for PRSCs (Attachments 1 & 2). The arrangements proposed for the Borrower to address safeguards
issues build on PRSC-2. In particular, these arrangements evolve around two sets o f activities and
aim at enhancing due diligence while allowing for the development o f local capacity to reach where
national agencies can provide effective oversight and assure adequate enforcement o f EA
requirements. The first set consists o f follow-up measures to those adopted and implemented under
PRSC-2 and the preparation o f PRSC-3, while the second set focuses on enhanced supervision o f on-
going Bank operations inthe country, in order to ensure full compliance with the environmental and
social safeguards management plans agreed to at the appraisal o f these operations.

        Follow-up activities to PRSC-2: As mentioned above, there is a need for the Government to
expand its efforts inthe creations o f the enabling conditions for the enforcement o f EA requirements.
PRSC-3 will continue and expand the implementation o f the capacity building activities initiated
under PRSC-2. More precisely, the arrangements aiming at assuring appropriate treatment o f
environmental issues inthe proposed PRSC-3 build on the PRSC-2 measures and will evolve around
three elements.




                                                  121

         The first element is capacity buildinginEA. The activities o f the 3-year EA capacity building
plan developed by the Borrower include training (Govemment staff, consulting firms, and NGOs),
awareness-raising (education and information campaigns), and enforcement (environmental auditing,
and technical assistance in the implementation o f environmental management plans o f investment
operations). The cost o f this plan is about US$ 2 million. The plan was prepared with the idea to
mobilize donor co-funding to support its implementation. Apart from some limited fundingprovided
by a bilateral donor (now exhausted), resources have not been forthcoming. Thus, little capacity
building activities has taken place since PRSC-2 due to lack o f lack of appropriate funding. An
interim solution proposed under PRSC-3 is to identify priority capacity buildingactivities that could
be fhded under the 2004 government budget. Inthe meantime, the dialogue with the Borrower will
examine other means to assuring reliable funding sources that will allow a sustained and effective
implementation o fthe updated capacity-building plan.

         The second element focuses on the mainstreaming o f environment into sectoral ministries,
through development o f capacity and awareness raising. Under PRSC-2 this objective was pursued
through creation o f EA focal points in line ministries. In fact, these focal points consist o f one
individual per ministry. Given the high risk of having the focal point moved to a different
locatiodfunction, it was felt that this risk o f disappearance o f the focal point would be mitigated by
expanding it to include more than one individual. During the November 2002 workshop on Bank
safeguards, the participants made the request to replace the notion o f sectoral EA focal point by
sectoral EA cells which will include 2-3 members. These cells will help to ensure compliance with
EA requirements insectoral investments when necessary and several o fthese cells have already been
created. In particular, they serve as environmental screening starting points for public investments in
their respective ministries, before the Ministry o f Environment can provide more elaborate
recommendations, and follow-up.

         The third element o f EA capacity strengthening under the proposed credit is the development
o f sectoral guidelines in order to help the Ministry o f Environment, the sectoral focal cells, and the
non-govemment actors (NGOs and consulting firms assisting in conducting EA) in the screening,
reviewing, and enforcement o f EA requirements.

         To sum up, the measures to be taken under PRSC-3 to ensure compliance with Bank
     ...
environmental and social safeguards include:

         Financing o fpriority EA capacity development under the government's budget;
         Developing sectoral EA guidelines for the preparation, and review o f EA studies; and
         Changing the sectoral EA focal pointsto sectoral EA cells with more 2-3 members.

         Enhanced supervision of environmental management plans (EMPs): In order to ensure
due diligence and compliance with Bank safeguards under PRSC-3, when EA capacity development
activities are underway, it will be necessary to pay increased attention to the implementation o f the
EMPs on-going sectoral operations supported by IDA. In fact, the task o f ensuring compliance with
environmental and social safeguards during PRSC-3 will primarily be incumbent upon the ongoing
operations in those sectors covered by the credit, that is, Rural Development, Education and Health.
Because environmental and social mitigation measures constitute a key element o f any EMP, these
operations will comply defacto with Bank safeguards policies when they implement their respective
EMPs.Makingsure that the EMPs are adequately funded and implemented is therefore a prerequisite
for assuring compliance with Bank safeguards policies under PRSC-3. The specific environmental
issues requiring attention in each sector involved inPRSC-3 are described above.


                                                    122

        The sectoral investment operations involved include the Community-Based Rural
Development Project, the Basic Education Sector Project, and the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response
Project. Given the sequential nature o f PRSCs, and the importance o f completing prior actions, this
follow-up o f EMPs and other issues will also apply the environmental aspects associated with PRSC-
4. As a resultthe PRSC-4 prior actions inthe area o f utility and telecommunication privatization, and
the preparation of an action plan for the achievement o f MDGs in the rural and urban water sector,
the Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project, and the Urban Environment Project will
also be covered the enhanced supervision efforts.

        Monitoring and Supervision.A monitoring and technical assistance plan will be developed
incollaboration with the Ministryof Environment. This planwill allow the Ministryo fEnvironment
to help the project implementation units o f the sectoral investment projects in the implementation,
monitoring, and supervision o f their respective EMPs. IDA will ensure the supervision o f the
arrangements and safeguards measures included in this environment annex, and will produce an
implementation report summarizing the results o f the PRSC-3 EA measures. This report will provide
the basis for developing the EA annex for PRSC-4.




                                                123

                   Annex 14: Experiences with the PRSCsinthe Health Sector

         Health and Nutrition Project. The Bank played a pivotal role in supporting the
development o f the health districts through the IDA-funded Health and Nutrition Project, which
closed in September 2001. As noted inthe ICR for this operation, a participatory, strategic planning
and budgeting process was satisfactorily introduced with stakeholders playing an important role in
setting priorities, developing local responses, and providing oversight. The decentralization o f
financial resources and use o f management agreements enhanced ownership and accountability at all
levels o f the health system. The channeling o f funds directly to local bank accounts gave district and
regional authorities autonomy and flexibility in the use o f resources. Management agreements were
instrumental inclarifying expectations and motivatinghealth personnelto improve performance.

         Following the completion o f the Health and Nutrition Project, the decentralized planning
processes stopped abruptly in those districts that were financed primarily through the IDA credit
(about half o f all districts nationally).  This was because (i)transfers to district bank accounts
stopped, which had been the primary source o f funding for the action plans; (ii)the planning and
performance monitoring process that had been established and financed by the project, including
regional workshops and other forms o f technical assistance, also stopped; and (iii)the project
management unit which played a key role in organizing and implementing the process was
disbanded. Those districts that were more heavily dependent on IDA resources have experienced a
substantial disruption in activities. In districts that benefited from other donor financing, this
planning process reportedly continued to varying degrees, but the overall system put in place by the
IDA operation, however, (including regional workshops for developing plans are reporting on
progress toward contracted results) has been dormant for the past year. The Netherlands is planning
to restart the district planning and performance monitoring system through forthcoming project, and
the first regional planningworkshops inover a year are currently scheduled to re-start inFebruary.

         After some iritial delays, the rigies d'avance \\:ere established in late 2002. This mechanism
creates the potential for transfer o f government funding directly to districts. This is a positive
development, and an important contribution o f the policy dialogue under the PRSC. It creates the
potential for internalizing the resource transfer system that was initiated under the Health and
Nutrition Project, and permitting direct decentralization o f government funds. However, there are
concerns with: (i)the level and consistency o f transfers, which remains to be demonstrated; (ii)    the
equity and impact o f regional and district health spending, which will not necessarily be assured by
the improved availability o f resources. Effective planning and monitoring o f progress toward priority
outcomes is also required.

PRSCs. With the closing o f the Health and Nutrition Project, support for the health sector was
provided through a series o f PRSCs. To date, one could characterize the impact o f the Burkina
PRSCs on the health sector as modest. It has not been easy to use the public expenditure program as
an effective tool to bring about significant shifts in budgetary allocations, particularly as Burkinabe
authorities have been reluctant to center the policy dialogue o f around budgetary choices in the
Ministryo fHealth. The PRSC has not been able to substitute for the previous financial and technical
assistance supporting the performance based contracting o f health districts under the closed IDA
Health and Nutrition Project.

        As in other countries, the PRSC process has been centered around the Ministry o f Economy
and Finance, which has the greatest sense o f ownership Initially, the Ministry o f Health (MOH) had



                                                   124

little ownership and understanding o f the PRSC and how this instrument could be more effectively
used. The situation is beginningto improve but the process is slow. Eventhough Burkina was one
o f the first countries to prepare a PRSP the Ministry o f Health lacked the capacity to translate PRSP
objectives ineffective programs. The first two years o f PRSP implementation did not allow sufficient
time for buildingbroad-basedconsensusand ownership either inthe country or inthe country team.

          The PRSC experience for the health sector in Burkina over the past two years has a number
o f important lessons. The instrument should be considered among a menu o f other choices for
supporting health system development and for attaining the MDGs under the Country Assistance
Strategy. The main lessons learned for the health sector can be summarized as follows:

             0   Importance o freinforcing capacity: It is important to prepare sectors for inclusion
                 inthe PRSC. Areas for need ofprior capacity buildingcould include bothmacro
                 measures (e.g. level o f progress o f public finance reform) and sector-specific ones
                 (e.g. progress on developing institutional capacities, particularly with regard to
                 preparing and implementing program budgets). The PRSCs should be used as a
                 mutually reinforcing instrument to bring about policy reforms while providing
                 support to the health sector through sectoral operations.


             0   Need to further improve national budget as an effective tool: Another important
                 lesson relates to the need to use the national budget as an effective tool for
                 bringingabout changes in budgetary allocations. Because o f some reluctance to
                 share the national budget prior to presentation to the national assembly, donors
                 experienced difficulty using the PRSC process to engage the government inprior
                 dialogue regarding improving the equity and efficiency o f health spending.

             0   Need to strengthenownership and commitment: One o f the key lessons which has
                 emerged from the Burkina PRSCs has been the need to build ownership and
                 commitment to the PRSC process within the government, working closely with
                 the Ministryof Healthto assist it to understand and accept this new way o f doing
                 business. This would imply allowing sufficient time to mobilize a broad-based
                 consensus, organize workshops and focus group discussions, and hold high-level
                 discussions.

Main Results. Levels and trends in health sector spendingThe PRSCs aimed to support an increase
inresources for the health sector, including through the HIPC initiative. Likewise, measureswere to
be taken to improve the efficiency and equity o f health spending and to reduce the financial burden
     .
on households. Progressover the past two years can be summarized as follows:

         Total resources available to the health sector have increasedinthe past two years, both as a
     .   percentageo ftotal expenditures.

         While an encouraging trend, these increases represent a returnto the level of spending that
         prevailed in 1996-97 (see table). Total spending declined during the late 1990s, reaching a
         low point in 2000. Thus the CAS periodhas seen a successfulreversal o fthe declining trend,
         but overall resource availability for health in the public sector is currently about the same as
         inthe mid-1990s.

     .  Moreover, while domestic financing has increased (including HIPC resources), external
        financing has declined (inpart due to the closure o f two IDA credits in2001), An unintended
        result o f this shift has been a relative increase in centralized control over health sector
        resources (PRSC funds are controlled by MOF, and HIPC allocations negotiated centrally
     .  between MOF and the central MOH).

        The health budget expenditure "credit dC1CguC.s" to the health regions remained unchanged
        between 2000 and 2001 (at about 7 percent o f budget), although the rate o f execution
        increased (88 percent to 94 percent). These resources are programmed at the regional and
        district level, but require central approval before incurring expenditures.          An increased
     .  percentage o f the budgetwas allocated to this line in2002.

        The availability of liquid resources at the health district level appears to have declined with
        the end o f the Health and Nutrition Project, as the MOF was reluctant to allow transfer o f
        government funds to private bank accounts controlled by the districts following the close of
        the IDA operation. However, this situation may change with the rdgies d'avance accounts
        that were recently established.

        Total external financing o f the health sector has declined by half compared to the mid-
        1990s (with more than a 50 percent decline in the past 2 years). This is likely in large
        partattributable to the closure o ftwo IDA-financed projects inthe healthsector in2000

PerformancebenchmarksThe Bank and other partners have been monitoring a series o f indicators
(e.g. immunization coverage, prenatal care, drug stock out) that are used as proxies for health sector
performance. The overall trends in these indicators is positive, as summarized in the recent PRSP
progress report.

        According to service data from the Ministry o f Health vaccination coverage has improved
progressively during the CAS period, as noted below.             This progress, to be confirmed by the
forthcoming Demographic and Health Survey, is likely due to a number o f factors, including the
direct activities o f the GAVI initiative, contributions o f individual projects (including the Health and
Nutrition Project, which included vaccination coverage as a key indicator in the performance
contracting system), and the HIPC support, which has financed vaccination supplies and supported a
government initiative to make vaccination free to public health centers in2001.
