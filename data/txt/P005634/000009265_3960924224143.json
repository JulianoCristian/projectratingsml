The objectives\n            of the project were to develop groundwater resources in the\n            southern region, increase production of dates and vegetables\n            and raise living conditions of smallholders in the existing\n            oases. After experiencing lengthy delays due to the late\n            creation of the Agricultural Development Agencies (OMV) for\n            two project areas, Djerid/Tozeur and Kebili/Gabes, project\n            implementation progressed according to the approved schedule\n            of implementation laid down by different Bank supervision\n            missions. Consequently at the official closing date almost\n            all civil works were completed. Infrastructure is now\n            operational while agricultural objectives will soon reach\n            the expected development, and as a consequence, it may be\n            concluded that project objectives have been met and an\n            important impact on regional and local development has been achieved."}, "docdt": "1988-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
