          Government's investment program of the Master Plan for\n            Water Resources Development in Southern Tunisia by\n            developing the groundwater resources of the region with a\n            view to increasing the production of dates (mostly for\n            export), vegetables and forage, improving the living\n            standards of the smallholders in the existing oases and\n            providing employment opportunities for farm labor in the new\n            oases. It would consist of: (i) rehabilitation of 7 existing\n            oases on about 3,000 ha in the Djerid, Nefzaoua and Gabes\n            areas; (ii) creation of 9 new date palm plantations and date\n            palm/forage plantations on 2,100 ha in the Djerid and\n            Nefzaoua areas; (iii) creation of a date processing\n            facility; and (iv) provision of equipment, facilities and\n            personnel for agriculture services, research and technical\n            assistance (60 man-months). About 5,100 small holders or\n            about 30,600 people, mostly in low-income groups would\n            benefit from the project. In addition, improved income\n            opportunities would be provided to about 1,100 permanent\n            workers and about 114,000 man-days of seasonal work would be created."}, "docdt": "1979-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
