F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To provide more accessible services of increased quality and with improved health
outcomes for those requiring maternity and newborn care, emergency medical care, and
rural primary health care.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)

PDOs were revised in 2008 as part of a restructuring that cancelled activities under
Component 3 of the project. Revised PDOs were (i) to provide more accessible services
of increased quality and with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and
newborn care and emergency medical care, and (ii) to support the development of a
primary health care strategy.

Achievement
                 DROPPED. This indicator tracks all maternal deaths detected and investigated by the
                 Specialty Commission of the MoH. Its operations have been sporadic and not all deaths
                 are investigated and discussed nor feedback given to the providers. The MTR estimated
                 that there was a small probability that this situation may improve in the future (MTR,
Comments
                 Aide-Memoire, 2007).
(incl.%
                 Since this indicator does not measure the impact of the project, it was agreed to no longer
achievement)
                 monitor this indicator, but to use the number of maternal deaths and the maternal
                 mortality ratio instead. In conclusion, instead of evaluating the process, project
                 monitoring started measuring the project impact on improving the situation of maternal

                 degree emergencies. In 2009, the reporting system was changed and the emergency
                 degrees were reset as red, yellow and green codes, with red and yellow code cases
                 corresponding to former 0 and 1st degree emergencies, while the green code referred to

million) European Investment Bank (EIB) loan, and US$44.8 million (€36.4 million) in funding
from the Government of Romania. The project was closely linked to the objectives of the FY02-
04 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and built on activities initiated in the first phase of the
program. The project was approved on December 16, 2004 and became effective on June 27,
2005, with an original closing date of December 31, 2009.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.     Romania, the second largest country in Central and Eastern Europe, was larger than 19 of
the 25 members of the European Union (EU) at the time. Romania was classified as a lower
middle-income country, with a GNI per capita equal to US$2,260 and a population of 21.7
million, 25 percent of which were below the poverty line. Since 2000, the Government of
Romania was implementing different macroeconomic reforms to support growth and
development. A disciplined fiscal policy and complementary tight monetary policy triggered a
decline in inflation and interest rates, and the fiscal deficit had been brought under control. In
2000-2004 GDP grew by an average 5 percent. The Government had taken some steps to
underpin growth through mechanisms of accountability and transparency, ensuring that the
population benefited from these reforms by improving the social and health sectors, among
others. Notwithstanding these achievements, public service delivery required significant
improvement when this project began.

3.      In 1997, Romania began to enact key reforms in the health sector to shift the health
system from a centralized government model to a more decentralized and diversified one. The
main change was the establishment of a compulsory health insurance fund paid for by an
earmarked wage tax and by contracting public service delivery with public and private service
providers. In the area of governance, there were major revisions of the health insurance law to
strengthen the accountability of the insurance fund in order to increase the role of local
authorities in the ownership and accountability of health care providers.

4.     The ongoing program supported by the World Bank in the health sector was based on a
reform strategy elaborated by the Government in 1997-1998 and outlined in a 1999 Letter of
Sector Development Strategy, which identified the following key issues:

      weaknesses in governance of the system and the legislative framework;
      shortcomings in the efficiency, equity and transparency of sector financing;
      inefficient use of physical capacity and human resources in health care delivery;
      critical infrastructure deficiencies resulting from inadequate maintenance and investment;
      mismatch between population health needs and health services distribution and priorities;
      consumer dissatisfaction with the health services.



                                                1
5.      At project preparation stage, substantial progress had been made on the agenda, and a
clear sector strategy was in place for addressing remaining reform needs. In terms of efficiency,
equity and transparency of health sector financing, there had been an increase in public
funding for the health sector, capacity building for health insurance, and piloting of new case-
based payment mechanisms for hospitals. The remaining agenda included increasing the
resources allocated for primary care services, ambulatory care, and hospital day surgery; rolling
out new payment mechanisms for hospitals; containing the escalation of pharmaceutical costs;
better defining the benefit package to be covered by health insurance, and ensuring the more
transparent and affordable contribution of private financing.

6.     Progress in the area of capacity and efficiency improvements included preparing and
approving a high-level rationalization strategy, closing about 15 percent of acute hospital beds,
converting hospitals into medico-social care units, and developing financial and contractual
approaches for home care. While many activities were supported under APL 1,2 more investment
and effort was required in the following areas: improving the distribution of resources and the
motivation of medical personnel in remote areas; restructuring underutilized hospital capacities;
and introducing new models of health care, e.g., home care, social long-term care, and
ambulatory/ day care services, especially in remote and unprivileged areas.

7.      Improvements in infrastructure had been addressed through the upgrade of equipment
for essential hospital services and pre-hospital emergency care, a major upgrade of hospital
equipment financed through commercial credits with governmental guarantees, lease schemes
for medical offices, and the interest of different donors. Nonetheless, continued investment in
rehabilitation was needed to modernize maternities and neonatal care units (maternal mortality
was five times higher than EU average and neonatal death rate 2.5 times higher3) as well as
intensive care systems.

8.      Population health needs had been addressed through the development of a public health
strategy, capacity building, and strengthening national programs (especially TB, reproductive
health and HIV/AIDS). Important tobacco control legislation had also been passed and
community nursing was implemented on a pilot basis.

9.     The area of consumer satisfaction saw relatively little activity, although there were
some information campaigns on the rights of insured. This agenda was to be moved forward
through increasing the focus on informal payments and explicitly addressing patient satisfaction.

10.     Various donors were involved in the different areas outlined above, including the Bank
via previous health sector projects as well as through Programmatic Adjustment Lending (PAL).
A first health project, at a total cost of US$224 million (including a US$150 million IBRD loan),
was implemented over 1992-1999 and supported the upgrading of selected Primary Health Care
(PHC) units, maternity and emergency medical services, the procurement of essential drugs, TB
control, and capacity building. The second project, the Health Sector Reform Project (APL 1),

was completed in June 2004. APL 1 was a US$69 million project (including a US$40 million
IBRD loan, disbursed 98 percent) and covered the upgrade of essential hospital care facilities
(operating theaters and ICUs), further improvements in emergency medical services, support for
PHC in six judets (counties), strengthening the planning capacities of the MoH and the counties,
and selected public health interventions. Triggers to move from APL 1 to APL 2 (all of which
were achieved) included:

      As necessary, amendments to the legal and regulatory framework for health care
       providers and for financing of health sector investment initiated by MOHF.
      Public Health Strategy with targets in priority areas issued.
      A lending and/or leasing scheme for financing family physicians in primary care
       practices has been established by the Health Insurance House and operating at least on a
       pilot basis for six months or more.
      3-4 judets in each socio-economic development region (at least 30 in total) have
       completed health services plans and associated investment and human resource plans for
       developing and rationalizing capacity in the sector.
      Substantial rogress has been made on contractual commitments (at least 80 percent) and
       disbursements (at least 70 percent) from APL 1.

11.    The APL was chosen as a lending instrument because activities to be undertaken were
more appropriately funded through an investment operation and APL 2 was a follow-on to APL
1; and the investments were complementing reforms under the ongoing PAL (with the APL
providing additional TA to PAL policy actions. APL 2 was to be implemented over four years
and seven months, financing civil works, goods, technical assistance, training and incremental
operating costs. APL 2 was included in the FY02-04 CAS that had as one of its objectives the
improvement of delivery of health services. The project was one of the targeted poverty
interventions identified in the CAS to reduce inequity of access to basic social services across
regions and for vulnerable groups.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.     The objectives of the overall APL program were as follows: (a) improve efficiency and
equity in the planning and regulation of the health service delivery system; (b) reduce
preventable deaths among emergency medical cases; (c) improve access and quality health care
in poor and remote areas; and (d) help the Romanian health sector to better focus on priority
public health problems, thereby reducing preventable illnesses and deaths.

13.    The specific objectives for Phase 2 of the APL were to provide more accessible services
of increased quality and with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and
newborn care, emergency medical care, and rural primary health care.

14.     PDO outcome indicators for APL 2 included: (i) the percentage of maternal deaths
formally documented/investigated; (ii) neonatal and post-neonatal deaths and deaths rates, (iii)
the percentage of deliveries where birth-weight is less than 2,500 grams; (iv) utilization rates for
primary and emergency care stratified by residence and income status; and (v) the percentage of



                                                 3
deaths within 48 hours and ER discharge for patients with major trauma or cardiac emergencies
arriving alive at the hospital emergency department.

1.3 Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

15.     PDOs were revised in 2008 to reflect changes in the project design with the cancellation
of Component 3. The revised PDOs were (i) to provide more accessible services of increased
quality and with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and newborn care and
emergency medical care; and (ii) to provide support for the development of a primary health care
strategy.

16.     Revised PDO outcome indicators were (i) Maternal Mortality (MM) and Maternal
Mortality Rate (MMR) by hospital, county, and region (new indicator); (ii) neonatal deaths (ND)
and rate (NDR) by hospital, county, and region (same as before); (iii) post-neonatal deaths
(PND) and rate (PNR) by hospital, county, and region (same as before); and (iv) the 24-hour
death rate among patients treated in the ER, then admitted to ICU in that hospital (new indicator).
PDO indicators related to percent of maternal deaths formally documented/investigated, percent
of deliveries where birth rate is less than 2500 grams, and utilization rates for primary and
emergency care stratified by residence and income status were dropped largely because they
were not specific to the interventions to be measured. As part of a second restructuring in 2011,
the target and frequency of data collection related to the 24-hour death rate indicator was refined.

17.     The reason for restructuring the PDO in 2008 was due to changes in health sector
legislation, which prevented MoH from financing investments in primary health care
infrastructure and faster than expected development of the capital market, which gave general
practitioners better access to loans (with accession to the EU, subsidized credits also became
problematic due to EU regulations on state aid). . In addition, as recorded in the mid-term review
(MTR), there was little buy-in for the introduction of multi-purpose health centers (MPHCs)
envisaged under Component 3.

18.    Consequently, MoH proposed cancelling Component 3 activities related to establishment
of multifunctional health centers and implementation of micro-credit schemes for family doctors.
The component was significantly downsized and retained only technical support to develop a
new PHC strategy. Component 3 funds (€9.52 million) were reallocated to other components
where additional financing needs were identified.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

19.     As discussed in the PAD, pregnant women and newborns, rural populations, and those
needing emergency services were the principal beneficiaries of the project. Beneficiaries were
also defined in the loan agreement as a family doctor or a family doctors’ association providing
medical services in selected areas, including but not limited to rural areas. The direct
beneficiaries of project investments were judged to be the communities benefiting from the
scaling-up of the health care services and the population served by the hospitals with modernized
emergencies and ICUs. Other key beneficiaries included: (a) the general population of Romania,



                                                 4
and particularly vulnerable groups, e.g., those living in remote and unprivileged areas, Roma
minorities, women, children, and the elderly; (b) the Ministries of Public Health and Finance and
various subordinated structures to these ministries, including the Project Management Unit, and
the Cantacuzino Institute; (c) local authorities, academic institutions, various universities and
training centers; and (d) physicians, nurses, other health professionals, managers, policy makers,
etc.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

20.    The project had the following five components:

21.    Component 1: Maternity and neonatal care (US$129.0 million equivalent, €104.9
million). The objective of this component was to fund the rehabilitation of maternity and
neonatal care units and provide medical and other equipment to ensure high quality neonatal and
maternity services. Technical assistance and training were to be provided to ensure
implementation of the best international practices, building on already existing partnerships
between the Government, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and bilateral donors, including USAID and
the Swiss Development Cooperation. Support was to be provided to improve the capacity of
health care authorities and support provider units to monitor service quality and access.

22.    Component 2: Emergency Care Services (US$58.1 million equivalent,
€47.2million).This component’s objective was to upgrade hospital emergency areas and develop
and implement an integrated ambulance dispatch capability. It had two sub-components: (i)
upgrade hospital emergency areas; and (ii) integrate the ambulance dispatch system.

23.      Component 3: Primary Health Care and Rural Medical Services (US$14.0 million
equivalent, €11.4 million). This component focused on improving the accessibility and quality
of basic medical services in rural and small urban areas and supporting two of the most important
activities included in the Primary Care Strategy approved by the Government. It had two sub-
components: (i) multipurpose health centers; and (ii) sub-loans for family doctors.

24.     Component 4: National Health Accounts and Planning (US$0.64 million equivalent,
€0.52 million). This component’s objective was to support the development of the National
Health Accounts and the preparation of proposals for rationalization and service development
projects with the following sub-components: (i) national health accounts (NHA); and (ii)
planning and program development.

25.     Component 5: Project Management (US$4.72 million equivalent, €3.85 million). The
objective of this component was to support the operation of the Project Management Unit (PMU),
building on the implementation arrangements of Phase 1 and expanding its responsibilities to
properly incorporate the new activities related to the physical rehabilitation of buildings and the
procurement of goods and equipment, and to ensure appropriate monitoring and evaluation of
project activities.




                                                5
1.6 Revised Components

26.    The     2008     restructuring    revised       the   project   components      as    follows:

27.     Component 1: Maternity and neonatal care (€108.75 million, of which €23.14 million
was from IBRD; US$133.76 million equivalent, of which US$28.46 million equivalent was
from IBRD). The objective of this component was to fund the rehabilitation of maternity and
neonatal care units and to provide medical and other equipment for high quality neonatal and
maternity services. Technical assistance and training was provided to ensure the implementation
of the best international practices.

28.     Component 2: Emergency Care Services (€42.30 million, of which €33.8 million was
from IBRD; US$52.03 million equivalent, of which US$41.57 million equivalent was from
IBRD). This component sought to upgrade district and local emergency areas, develop multi-
trauma operating theaters in emergency hospitals, develop an integrated ambulance dispatch
system, and support the establishment of a regional telemedicine pilot project, thus increasing the
effectiveness of the emergency system.

29.     Component 3: Primary Health Care and Rural Medical Services (€5.64 million, of
which €4.17 million was from IBRD; US$6.94 million equivalent, of which US$5.13 million
equivalent was from IBRD).This component sought to prepare the ground for improving the
accessibility and quality of basic medical services by establishing criteria for the identification of
underserved areas for further interventions, and supporting the preparation of a primary health
care strategy.

30.     Component 4: National Health Accounts and Planning (€0.21 million, of which €0.15
million was from IBRD; US$0.26 million equivalent, of which US$0.18 million equivalent was
from IBRD). This component’s objective was to support the development of a national health
accounts system and preparation of proposals for rationalization and service development
projects.

31.      Component 5: Project Management (€4.46 million, of which €2.88 million was from
IBRD; US$5.49 million equivalent, of which US$3.54 million equivalent was from IBRD).
The objective of this component was to support the operation of the PMU in activities related to
rehabilitation of infrastructure, equipment delivery, and the monitoring and evaluation of project
activities.

1.7 Other significant changes

32.     Restructuring(s). A first restructuring of the project took place in 2008. It included
amendments to the PDOs, restructuring of the third component (cancelling the activities related
to the rural multifunctional health centers and the micro-credit line for general practitioners),
reallocating funds (€9.52 million) to other components, making revisions in the results
framework, and consolidation of loan categories into a single category to ensure greater
flexibility in the loan allocations. A restructuring in December 2011 introduced new technical
assistance (TA) activities to support ongoing sector reforms; introduced a minor reallocation of



                                                   6
loan proceeds among categories of expenditures; fine-tuned the results framework; and extended
the closing date.

33.    Closing date extensions. The project was extended a total of five times. The first
extension of 12 months was granted from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. This was
followed by a second extension (in two steps) to December 15, 2011, a third extension to
December 15, 2012, and a fourth extension to March 15, 2013. The last and fifth extension was
granted on March 14, 2013, with a final closing date of December 31, 2013. The additional time
was needed largely due to start-up delays, delays experienced with rehabilitation of maternities,
and challenging procurement of medical equipment (more in Section 2).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

34.     Original project design was consistent with the Government’s policies and
objectives. The project was based on a health reform strategy elaborated by the GoR in 1997-
1998, and its major areas were outlined in the 1999 Letter of Sector Development Strategy.
Restructurings took a practical approach to incorporating the evolution of sector developments
(such as those that led to the cancellation of activities under Component 3), related implications
for the PDOs, and refinements to the results framework based on implementation experience.
However, the general design of the project remained relevant over what turned out to be a
significant lifetime of the project.

35.    Project design was well coordinated by GoR with other development partners. MoH
worked closely with DFID, EIB, USAID, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation
(SDC), UN agencies, EU, and many others. Different donors complemented project investments
through their special mechanisms and influenced project outcomes. The EIB co-financed a
substantial proportion of project costs. Much work was done by the SDC, based on the
memorandum signed between the World Bank and the agency training ambulance and medical
personnel (approximately 3,000 persons at PHC and hospital levels were trained). EU and UN
agencies provided a wide range of technical assistance to the project.

36.     Project design was in line with the CAS. The project was included in the FY02-04 CAS,
which established as one of its objectives improving the delivery of health services. This project
was one of the targeted poverty interventions identified by the CAS to reduce the inequity of
access to basic social services across regions and for vulnerable groups and complementing
health sector reforms under development policy agenda. The flexible design allowed APL 2 to
add the provision of new TA in 2011 and 20124 to support the implementation of DPL series
prior actions for provision of quality health care within limited fiscal space.5Thus the project
remained relevant through CPS FY09-13 beyond improvements in health care service delivery.

  APL 2 TA supported the DPL1-3 (2009-2012) prior actions to reduce the excessive number of acute care hospital
beds and introduce copayments; and the DPL-DDO (2012) prior actions for updating the package of health benefits
insured by the Government.


                                                       7
37.    Project design incorporated lessons learned. Phase 1 provided valuable lessons for the
design of the second phase. Previous experience clearly demonstrated that the availability of
committed counterparts and sound implementation capacity, with good planning and execution
capabilities, are critical to success.

38.    The chosen instrument – an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) – was adequate to
respond to the Government’s sector strategy needs. The choice of instrument provided a long-
term framework for implementing reforms in the sector, including predictable financing and
Bank support. Moreover, the investments financed by this loan were complimentary to other
reforms achieved through the PAL.

39.     Identified project risks were well mitigated. Out of four project risk areas identified,
only one was rated as Substantial, namely the slower pace of hospital restructuring processes or
reduced level of commitment for implementing rationalization activities. This risk was mitigated
by providing leverage though the sequence of PAL conditionality mechanisms and triggers,
support in the form of technical assistance funded by Private and Public Sector Institutional
Building Loan (PPIBL), monitoring the project’s progress as part of the policy dialogue
undertaken throughout project implementation, and finally, by approval of the rationalization
strategy by the GoR.

2.2 Implementation

40.     The project was approved at the end of 2004 and became effective in mid-2005. During
the first two years of implementation, the project experienced delays and slow disbursements
(ISRs 4 and 5 rated implementation progress moderately unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory,
respectively). This was largely due to a change in government soon after project approval (more
below). 6 Project status improved to moderately satisfactory by the end of 2007, with some
limited action under the PHC and NHA components keeping the ratings at moderately
satisfactory in 2008 at the time of the MTR.7 Project performance became solidly satisfactory
from 2009 onward. As evidenced in the data sheet, the majority of outcomes were achieved, with
some were over achieved (see details in Annex 2).

41.      The project benefited from several factors:

     GoR Leadership. Strong leadership and vision from MoH drove achievements under the
      project, especially in the areas of emergency services and telemedicine. The country became
      a model for other countries in the introduction and implementation of integrated emergency
      medical system.

                                                     8
     Project Implementation Capacity. Strong existing capacities for project implementation
      and further capacity development were key successes of the project. The project benefitted
      from the experience and knowledge of human resources deriving from APL 1. Despite a
      certain turnover at management level, the project succeeded in retaining key staff, ensuring
      continuity and retention of qualified members at the PMU. Broad reforms in public financial
      management in Romania also created an environment conducive to better performance by
      government agencies, including those responsible for project implementation.

     Flexibility to Support Additional Activities. Flexibility under the APL allowed for the
      provision of critical TA. Per agreement at the MTR, support for training under the MCH
      component to develop an operational manual for referral and quality assurance (QA)
      measures was implemented. Some project funds were also used to support TA activities
      related to the development and provision of basic training for Health Technology
      Assessments. Bank support to the Emergency Medical Component also expanded during
      project implementation—the component experienced savings and flexibility allowed for
      additional activities to be undertaken when resources became available.8


42.      Major challenges encountered during project implementation included:

     Start-up Delays. A change in government soon after project approval led to start-up delays
      as priorities were revisited. There was a need to review and reach agreement on the
      approaches to PHC and rural medical services, and on the priority MCH investments. Further
      delays were experienced with lengthy planning of investments and identification of specific
      beneficiaries (review of maternity capacity and determination of maternities to be supported
      by the project with civil works, training, and equipment) as well as the establishment of
      project implementation mechanisms (the Steering Committee was established in mid-
      February 2006, project implementation responsibilities delegated at end June 2006, Technical
      Working Groups by component established by June 2006). The project also accommodated a
      high turnover of ministers, which caused implementation to slow.

     Rehabilitation Delays. While World Bank and EIB collaboration is notable, there was a
      substantial delay in the revision of the architectural designs requested by EIB for the
      rehabilitation of the maternities. Twenty-two maternity hospitals were included in the
      infrastructure rehabilitation program supported by the project. This activity was mainly
      financed by the EIB, with the World Bank accounting for only a small share of co-financing
      (€5.4 million World Bank, €45 million EIB). The overall implementation of this component
      was greatly delayed because some designs were of low quality due to the limited experience
      available in the country. EIB requested that all architectural designs be revised so that they
      complied with international standards. These revisions caused almost a one-and-a-half year
      delay, with the last revision completed in 2012. Secondly, delay in the procurement process
      was due to constant changes in the appointment of the members of the specialty technical



8
 This was also due to the extremely strong leadership and enterprising approach of the Undersecretary of State in
charge of the emergency department and his long and continuous tenure.


                                                         9
    commissions, causing frequent revisions of technical specifications and bid evaluation
    reports.


   Unexpected Repairs. Originally, the project planned to provide physical investment (small
    rehabilitation as well as medical equipment) to 183 obstetrics/neonatal units. However, at the
    early stages of implementation, it became clear that the original plan called for just small
    repairs of these units, while the buildings surroundings these units were in extremely poor
    conditions. Therefore, the decision was made with the EIB’s support that the project would
    include core building repairs, including roofing, electricity supply, etc., for those buildings.
    At the time of the MTR, 45 such facilities were planned, while the project invested in only 22
    maternities. One of the reasons for decreasing the number of maternities selected for
    rehabilitation was the rapid price escalation for civil works per unit, and also the size of
    works.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


43.     M&E Design. The PAD included a comprehensive set of project outcome and
intermediate outcome indicators that reflected the project objectives. Revision of these indicators
(both PDO and intermediate) was necessary to maintain the relevance of the results framework
over the life of the project, particularly in light of the cancellation of activities under Component
3. Under the first restructuring in 2008, a total of three PDO indicators were dropped, two new
ones were introduced, one was modified, and two remained unchanged. The intermediate
outcome indicators changed substantially, with 15 indicators dropped, 12 new ones introduced,
one modified, and another one slightly modified. Two more restructurings occurred in 2011, and
these further refined the results framework, particularly to address indicators that could not be
measured properly. One PDO indicator was dropped and slight adjustments were made in
intermediate outcome indicators: two were revised, three dropped, and three new ones added.

44.     M&E Implementation. From the beginning, the M&E framework was developed in
very close collaboration with the PMU and other major stakeholders. The PMU was responsible
for collecting and reporting on project monitoring indicators, developing a database that would
allow them to submit and update the information directly. However, consistency of reporting
data was a matter of concern since some definitions were not similarly understood by the various
reporting entities across the country. From 2009, the situation in terms of data collection and
analysis became less of an issue. M&E functions became integral to the work of eight regional
coordinators, with one M&E expert devoted to this function in the central office.

45.    Regular Monitoring. Progress monitoring was a key instrument of project management
and ensured the timely receipt of comprehensive and regularly updated information. The PMU
submitted to the Bank biannual progress reports on the status of implementation and reported on
outputs and outcomes indicators. These reports were prepared in a satisfactory manner.




                                                 10
46.     M&E Utilization. A disappointing aspect of the M&E system established under the
PMU was that there was little evidence that the Government was using it sufficiently. This
assertion is based on the fact that at certain points policy makers were not taking into account the
results of program monitoring.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



47.     Environmental Safeguards. The project was classified as a Category B operation. An
Environment Management Framework was completed and published in 2004. No major
environmental impacts were anticipated under the project given the limited amount of proposed
rehabilitation and the fact that no new structures/facilities of significant size were envisaged.
Existing environmental regulations in Romania provided a mandatory control and supervision of
construction works with an emphasis on environmental issues. Contracts included clauses that
ensured the appropriate disposal of unacceptable construction materials and waste. All tender
documents covering rehabilitation required tenderers to set aside adequate sanitary facilities,
including those for the appropriate disposal of wastewater and sewerage. Specific environmental
management guidelines were incorporated into all civil works contracts.

48.     Fiduciary Arrangement. The financial management (FM) performance over the
implementation of the project was satisfactory. Significant strengths in terms of FM
arrangements were represented by the substantial experience of the PMU in implementing Bank-
financed projects and reliance to a large extent on the well-developed country public financial
management systems, which satisfy Bank requirements. The PMU had proper FM capacity over
the implementation period, which included three financial experts who undertook the project’s
financial management.9 “Ciel,” the accounting software used by the PMU for the project records,
had adequate security levels and was used to supply inputs for the preparation of the project’s
semi-annual Interim un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs).

49.     Disbursement. Disbursement of funds was undertaken using the traditional mechanism
based on Statement of Expenditures (SOE). Since effectiveness until the end of 2008, the PMU
has kept a Designated Account (DA) in EUR in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank.
Starting January 1, 2009, the project eligible expenditures were pre-financed 100 percent by the
State Budget. The Ministry of Public Finance (MPF) then requested reimbursement from the
Loan using the SOE. The Treasury issued a project code to be used for this pre-financing. The
PMU followed the procedures set out in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by
the MPF and the Bank, as well as in the Loan Agreement. The PMU kept detailed records of the
eligible amounts to be financed from the IBRD Loan proceeds and of the Government’s
contribution. The PMU reported to the MPF the expenditures against the Loan amount in RON
and EUR on a monthly basis. While the pre-financing received in general has been sufficient for
the implementation needs under the IBRD Loan, the project faced particular issues in 2013 and

  The financial coordinator bears overall responsible for the financial management aspects of the project. One part-
time financial expert and one accounting expert were responsible for keeping all the accounting records and all the
reporting aspects current.


                                                        11
2014 with respect to the available budget for the activities planned under the EIB financing. The
IBRD disbursement level as of May 2, 2014 was 97 percent, or EUR 63.07 million withdrawn
from the signed EUR 65.1 million.10

50.     Internal Controls and Reporting. An adequate internal controls framework was
instituted for the project, including regular reconciliation of bank accounts, and adequate
segregation of duties. The walkthrough reviews carried out during the regular FM on-site
reviews confirmed that the internal controls applied while preparing the withdrawal applications
(WA) were adequate; the required supporting documentation was in place, properly checked and
authorized. The PMU used a comprehensive set of accounting policies and internal control
procedures in accordance with the Romanian legislation and the project financial management
manual. Semi-annual IFRs were generally produced on time according to satisfactory standards
in form and substance of financial information. The latest IFRs submitted to the Bank covered
the period of July 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 and were found acceptable.

51.     External Audits. Since project effectiveness in June 2005, the annual Project Financial
Statements for the IBRD and EIB funding were audited by eligible independent auditors in
accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. Auditors issued independent audit
reports with a clean (unmodified) opinion alongside with management letters mentioning some
minor internal control issues, which were adequately addressed by the PMU. The latest audit
report covered 2012 and was submitted on time. The final audit required for the project will
cover 2013 and any transactions incurred during the grace period ending April 30, 2014. There is
a multi-annual contract in place with an acceptable independent audit firm. The report will be
submitted to the Bank no later than June 30, 2014.

52.     Procurement issues. The overall procurement process faced certain difficulties and was
quite lengthy, especially due to the cumbersome and long-term agreement process required by
MoH for the approval of the technical specifications for medical equipment and civil works and
the bid evaluation reports. In general, prior review of the procurement packages and procedures
conducted under the project, as well as post-review of randomly selected contracts, showed
satisfactory quality of the documents and compliance with the applicable World Bank Guidelines
and established rules and procedures. The procurement processes were conducted in accordance
with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and of the agreed Procurement Plan, which was
regularly updated. All Bank comments and recommendations were taken into account and
incorporated. No mis-procurement was reported. However, several re-bidding procedures took
place. The PMU procurement specialists were qualified and had prior experience implementing
Bank financed projects.

53.    This project had the largest amount of complaints in the entire country portfolio. About
395 documents are logged into the World Bank’s project filing system due to many factors, such
as (a) strong competition among firms and suppliers of sophisticated and complex medical
equipment; (b) existence of several groups of beneficiaries with specific preferences for the type
of equipment to be supplied; and (c) challenges in ensuring that the required functionalities of

  This excludes the amount of the latest withdrawal applications received by the Bank as of May 2, 2014, which
are pending processing for reimbursement for an amount of a little over EUR 1.4 million.


                                                     12
the equipment did not compromise competition. It was also reported that complaints resulted in
some leakage of information during the tenders’ evaluation stage.

54.    Due to complexity and very competitive nature of the medical equipment industry, the
following issues emerged during project implementation:

         Organization and the role of the “expert groups” working on the technical specifications
          (TS) and evaluation of bids as well as constant staff turnover created considerable delays
          in the procurement process.
         There were very different opinions on the technical quality of the equipment, with some
          trying to ensure that only reputable, high quality equipment from leading manufacturers
          was purchased rather than equally qualified equipment from less well known
          manufacturers at a lower price.
         At the bidding stage, complaints related to TS and the length of time to receive
          clarifications on the TS led to extensions of the submission deadline for bids.
         At contract award stage, there were complaints related to disqualification of bids on
          technical grounds, including that (a) the TS were biased towards a particular
          manufacturer; (b) bids were unfairly rejected even though the equipment was technically
          better and priced lower than those offered by the firms’ competitors; and (c) the bids of
          the firms awarded the contracts did not meet the TS. A few complaints were referred to
          INT.
         There were substantial gaps between the preparation of the TS and the actual tendering
          process due to very intense discussions and the long process of awarding contracts, which
          affected the original cost estimates for the equipment.
         The long evaluation period of the bids and the lengthy internal approval process also had
          implications on the validity extensions of rather frequent bids. Also the higher price of
          equipment, in the case of fixed priced contracts, was due to the correction factor being
          applied because of the lengthy evaluation of bids.
         The scope of delivery or the scope of work was modified during contract implementation
          due to requests by MoH. On several occasions, MoH requested larger quantities of
          medical equipment for more hospitals or for additional quantities to be purchased at the
          same unit rates. MoH also took advantage of the provision in the bidding documents
          allowing an increase of 15 percent of the contract award for additional quantities of
          goods.

55.       The following issues regarding civil works emerged during project implementation:

         Revisions of the architectural designs requested by EIB for the rehabilitation of
          maternities were considerably long and complicated.
         A large number of amendments to ongoing civil works contracts and cost increases to
          reflect revised architectural designs (in accordance with EIB’s comments). In some
          instances, revisions to the design increased the civil works contract by more than 15
          percent of the contract amount, which therefore required a rebidding process, resulting in
          increased estimated costs and delays.




                                                 13
      Cost overruns were foreseen even during the planning stage as the team identified many
       issues in the quality of the architectural design, causing last minute changes in the scope
       of the civil works and cost increases.

56.  Despite cost overruns in certain areas, it is important to mention that other ICBs, e.g.,
EMS packages, resulted in cost savings estimated at EUR 5 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

57.     A new Improving Health System Quality and Efficiency Project was approved by the
World Bank Board of Executive Directors on May 28, 2014. This new project focuses on
improving health system quality and efficiency. More specifically, the new investment operation
for the health sector aims to improve the access, quality, and efficiency of the public health
services by supporting the rationalization of the health care service delivery network. The new
project will finance the implementation of short- and medium-term interventions to support the
health sector reform program (2014–2020), help the GoR access resources from the EU and
other development partners, and support the efficient use of these resources. The project will
support the first phase of comprehensive medium-term and long-term health sector reforms by
focusing on the following three main areas/components: (1) hospital network rationalization; (2)
ambulatory care strengthening; and (3) health sector governance and stewardship improvement.

58.     Continuous policy dialogue on health. Apart from the APL 2, the Bank has had a
continuous policy dialogue on health sector reforms in Romania over the last four years through
the development policy loan (DPL) series and the ongoing DPL Deferred Drawdown Option
(DPL-DDO), which contain significant health related measures. The DPL-DDO, in the amount
of EUR 1 billion approved in 2012, supports a comprehensive three-year reform program which
includes improvements in the fiscal sustainability of the health sector (e.g., e-prescription for
compensated drugs, increase of funds allocated for health prevention and promotion programs,
and reduction of expenditures for several drugs for which cost-benefit analysis proved not to be
efficient).

59.     The Bank was also actively involved in health policy dialogue as part of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Commission (EC) programs. The recent precautionary type
arrangements with the IMF and EC include new structural reforms in the health sector, which
aim to increase the efficiency of health services delivery, improve their quality, and deliver better
health outcomes in a financially sustainable manner. The definition of the basic package of
medical services, revision of reimbursable drugs lists, implementation of Health Technology
Assessments, introduction of supplementary private health insurance, and improved revenue
collection for the public health insurance system are just some of the areas covered.

60.    Maintenance. Maintenance costs and their implications for the recurring health budget
have been addressed, especially for those related to the emergency health program, and now fall
under a separate line item in MoH’s budget, ensuring autonomy and adequate level of financial
resources.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

61.     The relevance of the objectives, design, and implementation arrangements are considered
substantial. Supporting the implementation of the health sector reform program by providing
more accessible and higher quality services for maternal and child health and emergency medical
care was a fundamental development priority of the GoR at the time of project approval and
restructurings. The PDO was fully relevant to the priorities of the national program (Program of
Romanian Government, 2001-2004) as well as the National Public Health Strategy (2004). This
project was included in the FY02-04 CAS, which focused on improving delivery of health
services. Also, this project was identified by the CAS as one of the targeted interventions to
reduce inequity of access to basic health care services across regions and by vulnerable
populations.

62.     The PDOs remain highly relevant because (a) maternities, neonatal and emergency health
care centers continue to be the main health service delivery points; (b) quality and accessibility
of services continues to be an issue in many places where civil works for the rehabilitation of
maternity centers financed by the EIB have not yet been completed.

63.     With this project support, access to health care services has been improved, especially in
rural areas. The project led to successful and sustainable achievement in terms of access and
quality of care in three major areas of the health care delivery – maternal, child and emergency
services.

64.     The maternal mortality rate in Romania has declined noticeably since the 1990s.
However, the current maternal mortality rate in Romania is still among the second quintile in the
European Region: 53 (46-62) per 100,000 live births in 2000 down to 33 (26-44) per 100,000
live births in 2013.11 It is hard to attribute the positive trend to the project. However, to improve
maternal health, barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services must be identified
and addressed at all levels of the health system, and the project managed to support better
infrastructure, improved access to antenatal care, improved access to skilled care during
childbirth, and provision of care and support in the weeks after childbirth. Even though
Romania’s infant mortality rate declined from 26.9 ‰ (per 1,000 live births) in 1990 to 13.9 ‰
in 2006 and further to 10.1 ‰ in 2009, the levels are still above the average of the EU and the
Countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Most infant deaths are related to perinatal conditions
and malformations (57 percent), but some are also due to diseases of the respiratory system.
Maternal and neonatal mortalities are complex indicators with multi-faceted problems, however
the project managed to address these issues through a holistic approach in the hospitals and
maternities benefiting from project support. In addition, the entire network of 204 maternities
received medical equipment and their staff was adequately trained. This enabled them provide
better health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications. Also 20 reference maternities
were rehabilitated to comply with best practice hospital standards.

                                                             15
65.     A new institutional approach of maternal and neonatal care was introduced during the
project lifespan. Maternal and neonatal care was provided by the integrated regional network
with one centralized level, one hub/regional center, and several subordinated level two and three
units. Such a regional network covers a defined geographic area, where a number of about
15,000 to 20,000 births per year are registered. The project invested in all levels of facilities.

66.     Although the project focused on the acute care part of the health care system, there was
some effort to strengthen the PHC component through the National Health Insurance. Antenatal
care figures are showing positive trends for the period 2008-2012, with at least one visit in 93.5
percent of the cases and four visits in 76 percent of the cases. 12 Vaccination rates (DPT3)
decreased from 99 percent in 2000 to 89 percent in 2012.13

67.     The project has had substantial impact on emergency services and can be considered an
international good practice in this regard (detailed description of achievements in Annex 2).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

68.     Achievement of Project Development Objectives is derived according to the
methodology of the ICR guidelines (Appendix B) for evaluating the achievements of the PDOs
against the original and revised PDOs and related key performance indicators.14

69.    The original PDOs were to provide more accessible services of increased quality and
with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and newborn care, and emergency
medical care , and rural primary health care. Achievement of the original PDO indicators is
summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

                                 replaced by a different one (7): “Prevalence of chronic diseases in
                                 target intervention rural communities (If investment is made in
                                 rural areas).” This indicator was also dropped later because no
                                 investments were made in rural communities. The indicator was
                                 replaced by the more relevant: “Development of a primary care
                                 rural strategy.”

70.    Of the five original PDO indicators, two were impossible to measure, one was not
achieved, one was partially achieved, and one was over-achieved.

71.    The PDOs and key performance indicators were changed during restructuring in 2008.
The results framework was changed twice in 2011. The revisions were as follows:

   PDOs were revised in 2008 to reflect the new intended outcomes of the revised third
    component of the project. The revised PDOs were (i) to provide more accessible services of
    increased quality and with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and
    newborn care and emergency medical care; and (ii) to support the development of a primary
    health care strategy.
   Revised results framework included the following PDO indicators: (i) Maternal Mortality
    (MM) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) by hospital, county, and region (new indicator);
    (ii) neonatal deaths (ND) and rate (NDR) by hospital, county, and region (same as before);
    (iii) post-neonatal deaths (PND) and rate (PNR) by hospital, county, and region (same as
    before); (iv) 24-hour deaths rate among patients treated in the ER, then admitted to ICU in
    that hospital (new indicator); and (v) prevalence of chronic diseases in target intervention


                                                        17
    rural communities (new indicator). This last indicator was subsequently dropped because no
    investment was made in rural communities. The indicator was replaced by a more relevant
    intermediate outcome indicator: “development of a primary care rural strategy”
    (Restructuring Paper, October 24, 2008 and Amendment to the Loan Agreement dated
    November 2008).
   In 2011, the indicator “prevalence of chronic diseases in target intervention rural
    communities” was dropped because it was intended to measure the establishment of
    multipurpose health centers, which was cancelled as part of the 2008 restructuring.
   Later in 2011, the baseline and frequency for the fourth indicator “24-hour death rate
    amongst patients treated in the ER who were admitted to ICU in that hospital,” was changed.
    These revisions were reflected in the restructuring paper of December 12, 2011.

3.3 Efficiency

73.    The ICR team considers efficiency as substantial. The objectives of the second Romania
Health Reform Project (APL 2) were to provide more accessible health services of increased
quality for those requiring maternity and newborn care, emergency medical care, and rural
primary health care to achieve improved health outcomes. The project was restructured in 2008
and the revised project components included rehabilitation of maternity and neonatal care units;
development of district and local emergency hospitals; and the development of National Health
Accounts and the project management component.

74.     The project outcomes exceeded the targets for Components 1 and 2. As a result, the
economic internal rate of return was 28 percent and the benefit/cost ratio was 1.65. The
sensitivity analysis also shows that even under conservative assumptions, the rate of return was
reasonable, and as high as 15 percent. These results are in agreement with the expected results
presented in the Project Appraisal Document.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The project’s overall outcome is considered as Moderately Satisfactory based on its
substantial relevance, efficacy, and efficiency and in line with the methodology above for
deriving the outcome rating for projects with formally revised objectives. The relevance of
project objectives and its overall sound design is considered substantial. Meanwhile, due to
insufficient data, the evaluation of efficiency is carried out based on a number of assumptions.
However, available data clearly show that the project, especially its first and second components,
have generated considerable benefits and is expected to yield reasonable returns even over the
coming years. The sensitivity analysis shows that even under conservative assumptions of
significant reduction in project benefits, the rates of return were about 15 percent. These results


                                                     19
are close to the expected measures of economic efficiency presented in the Project Appraisal
Document, which confirms that the project had achieved the expected outputs and outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

76.    This project was one of the targeted poverty interventions identified in the CAS to reduce
inequity of access to basic social services across regions and by vulnerable groups.

77.     A full social assessment of the project was completed at the initial stage of project
implementation. Four of the top five reasons for the population’s dissatisfaction with medical
services were likely to influence the poor more than the non-poor. Three of the five leading
reasons have to do with cost, e.g., the cost of drugs and medical services and informal payments.
Another reason listed in the top five reasons was the distance to the nearest clinic, which is an
issue for rural residents, and especially poor households. All these findings provided support for
the project interventions with a focus on the improvement of services in rural areas which suffer
from high poverty.

78.     The social impact of the project and overall impact in terms of improvements in health
outcomes were larger in rural and poorer localities. Household survey data suggests that health
care utilization varies significantly by poverty status and not by urban/rural residence. More
detailed targeted mechanisms for the project interventions were used, such as the Romania
Poverty Map, developed as part of the 2003 World Bank supported poverty assessment. This
mapping exercise was used in collaboration with the Romania Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion
Commission to target project interventions, especially for the PHC component. However, the use
of these mechanisms never evolved in the way they were originally planned.

79.     It should be noted that there were no specific gender aspects highlighted in the project.
Nevertheless, the project addressed gender imbalances by improving access to quality maternal
health care services, especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas. Indeed, the indicators related to
maternal health care have a strong gender aspect. Ultimately, the majority of beneficiaries of the
project were women, including those working as medical personnel, including rural doctors and
nurses, etc.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.     The project had a substantial institutional development impact, at both local and national
levels. The project significantly increased the capacity of MoH to plan and manage the health
system. Specific attention was focused on the rationalization of health services, building HTA
capacity and other elements. Moreover, the project assisted in advancing the overall health sector
reform achieved in APL 1 and further strengthened national capacity to manage two of the main
areas of the health system: Emergency and Maternal and Child Services, i.e., obstetrics and
neonatology. Several fundamental documents also were written and/or adopted by the GoR,
including the PHC strategy that is expected to be approved within the framework of the Health




                                                20
Sector Reform Strategy for the next programming period of the EU financing exercise 2014-
2020.

81.    The project also strengthened local government capacity to implement health reforms. All
decisions related to infrastructure and human resource capacity development were made with the
enthusiastic involvement of local government bodies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

82.    Close coordination and synergies with activities financed by various donors have
resulted in better outcomes for the health sector. EIB, EU, DFID, USAID, SDC, have all
supported efforts to improve maternal and child health and emergency services through civil
works, equipment, and capacity development. Specialized UN agencies, like WHO and UNICEF,
have provided general technical assistance in all these mentioned areas.

83.     A modern, integrated ambulance dispatch system was established by upgrading the
existing communication systems of district ambulance service dispatches and linking them to
Central Emergency Call Centers, which patients reach by dialing the new single emergency
number 112. The new system also enables voice and data communication between dispatchers
and ambulances sub-stations. This upgrade has resulted in a nation-wide communication system
that encompasses all parts of emergency services, including ambulance, police, defense, and fire-
brigades. The system is considered a best practice and many countries are turning to Romania to
learn from its example, e.g., Croatia, Bulgaria, and Moldova.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

84.    Client Satisfaction Survey for maternities is summarized in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible

85.     The risk to development outcome is rated Negligible. The Government and its institutions
demonstrated strong ownership and commitment in maintaining the achieved gains. In addition,
the new health project will continue to provide financial support for the various areas addressed
by this project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

86.    Team leadership changed four times over the lifespan of the project, causing some
adjustments in the way the Bank guided implementation.

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.     This evaluation rates the Quality at Entry as Moderately Satisfactory. As described in the
earlier sections, it is the view of the ICR team that (i) the project objectives and scope were


                                               21
appropriate for the stage of development of the sector; (ii) the project built on the experiences of
the APL 1 and other health sector reform projects in the ECA region; (iii) the project addressed
the Romanian Government’s program goals for health outcome improvements; and (iv) it
supported key elements of the CAS to improve the delivery of health services. Nevertheless, this
evaluation finds that while selected objectives were appropriate for the status of the reforms, a
less ambitious scope of design would have simplified implementation and better taken into
account certain legal framework drawbacks (e.g., state budgetary limitations for allocations and
strict ceilings). The ambitious project scope resulted in multiple project extensions. In addition,
as was born out during implementation, some of the original PDO targets were not easy to
measure and required revision..

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

88.     The Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory. Supervision of the project was intense,
with frequent, technically adept visits from the project’s onset to monitor progress, ensuring
consistency of policy dialogue, and providing hands-on support to the implementing agency. The
fourth and last Task Team Leader (TTL) led the project for almost three years. The project
benefitted immensely from having the TTL and seasoned health consultants located in the
country. Such an arrangement worked well, with professional staff able to engage and interact
with the Bank’s team and benefit from its high level of responsiveness and commitment. In
addition, it afforded an excellent opportunity for the Bank team to supervise project
implementation on an ongoing basis, taking appropriate measures as needed.

89.      The Bank team made all possible effort to collaborate with international donors and
implementing agencies involved, particularly the EIB and SDC. The World Bank team met
international partners and exchanged regular status updates during implementation visits.
Partners discussed coordination mechanisms, how to effectively share information about the
project’s achievements and challenges, and recent developments in the health sector. This
environment allowed the project team and GoR to reach consensus on the cancellation of certain
activities and addressing new challenges, jointly determining the most efficient use of loan funds.

90.      The Bank team demonstrated appropriate levels of responsiveness by its timely provision
of “no objections,” and informed consent for funding of interventions not originally planned. The
Bank quickly responded to GoR’s needs, demonstrating flexibility in modifying implementation
plans and project design. During supervision, the Bank demonstrated the flexibility to adjust the
project to the changing needs and reality of the sector. One example relates to the unfinished
activities of the Cantacuzino Institute, which were transferred to the project from the closed
Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response project, 15


15
  In 2011, following the fourth amendment to the loan agreement, the rehabilitation of the vaccine production and
ampoule filling and sealing area at the Cantacuzino Institute (Bucharest) was transferred from the Avian Influenza
Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project.15 The APL 2 itself managed to finish the civil
works for the influenza vaccine production unit, aseptic ampoule sealing and filling station in due time (2012). More
specifically, the works for rehabilitation of the influenza vaccine production unit started in January 2012 and were
completed on July 15, 2012. The rehabilitation works for the filling and sealing station started in October 2011 and
were completed in October 2012.


                                                         22
demonstrating the World Bank’s flexibility to accommodate an investment that otherwise would
have remained unfinished.

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.      The moderately satisfactory rating for Quality at Entry and the satisfactory rating for
Quality of Supervision averages to a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for overall Bank
performance. A productive partnership with the Borrower led to smooth technical and
institutional collaboration during preparation and implementation stages. A positive working
environment was fostered with the client, which contributed to achieving, and in some cases
exceeding, the majority of project objectives.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

92.     Government performance during project preparation and implementation is rated
Satisfactory. The performance of the Government varied between the early and later stages of
the project. There were certain shortcomings in the Government’s performance in the early
stages of the project, as demonstrated by MoH’s micro-management and some insufficiencies in
counterpart funding. At later stages of project implementation, the Government demonstrated its
full commitment to the project objectives by accelerating its implementation and initiating the
new investment operation. However, less satisfactory aspects of Government performance
related to (i) budgetary restrictions and complex administrative procedures, which amongst
others affected implementation; (ii) frequent changes in the leadership of MoH, which impacted
on some of the project directions and caused delays; and (iii) the frequent change and difficulties
to mobilize (even for the PMU) the “expert groups,” which were providing input to technical
specifications of bidding documents and the bid evaluation process.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

93.      Implementing agency performance is rated Satisfactory. The PMU was established in
1992 by the GoR to implement the first health project financed by an IBRD loan. The PMU was
also responsible for implementation of the Global Fund projects from 2003 until 2007. Effective
2007, the PMU became solely responsible for the APL 2. The unit is a subordinated structure
under the MoH, which has strong oversight over staffing issues and project implementation. The
PMU was adequately staffed with component coordinators and a fiduciary team. A total of 10
full-time staff members were in charge of project implementation, though turnover was high over
the life of the project. The director of the PMU changed three times during the project’s life and
staff salaries decreased twice during 2010, impairing the likelihood of attracting and retaining
qualified staff. However, these issues were gradually resolved in a satisfactory manner through a




                                                23
joint initiative of the World Bank and the MoH. Appropriate staffing, vigorous and intensive
training and accumulated experience resulted in a significant increase in the PMU’s capacity for
project implementation.

94.     The PMU participated actively in ICR discussions and prepared a consolidated final
report on the project from all the progress reports prepared over time (Annex 7).

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

95.    The ICR team rates the overall Borrower performance as Satisfactory in line with ratings
above.

6. Lessons Learned

96.    The key lessons learned and/or reinforced during project implementation are as follows:

      Keep project design flexible, responsive, and simple. Given the scope and pace of
       health sector reform, the two-phased APL was an appropriate approach for ensuring
       achievement of the project development objectives and long-term sustainability. However,
       duration and scope of each phase could have been better planned, and a simpler design
       adopted, including simpler, . more straightforward procurement.
      Strong governmental ownership and close coordination with development partners
       are critical. GoR’s commitment, as well as a clear vision and a reform agenda, were key
       to achieving the project objectives. Close coordination and collaboration with EIB, SDC,
       and other partners in supporting implementation aspects of the program helped keep key
       activities on track despite the delays. Sharing the same implementation unit for EIB and
       IBRD funding ensured harmonization of interventions and efficient use of funds.
       However it would have been more effective to formalize the arrangement between the
       World Bank and EIB in regard to responsibilities related to rehabilitation of of maternal
       health centers.

      Staff continuity is critical. Continuity of staff, particularly on the government and PMU
       sides, is a critical element of project success or failure. Project preparation was carried
       out with one government, however implementation fell to a new administration, which
       led to substantial start-up delays. Thankfully, despite major changes introduced in the
       management of the PMU, the core team of experts remained practically unchanged,
       which helped with continuity.

      Proactive and timely supervision by the Bank’s team is also crucial for a successful
       project. The project greatly benefitted from the continuous technical support provided by
       the local World Bank team, backed-up by strong and timely policy dialogue provided by
       the headquarters-based health specialists. In-country presence of the TTL and his close
       collaboration with the frequently changing senior decision makers from the MoH allowed
       quick resumption of the policy dialogue after staff changes and early identification of
       bottlenecks that could have further hampered project implementation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component I: Maternal and Child Services

The project was supposed to initially finance minor rehabilitation works for all maternities. Later on the
MoH decided to limit the number of sites to 22 major hospital units to bring them up to international
standards. As a result, the EIB decided that a rigorous approach should be taken in the revision of the
detailed architectural designs, which created implementation delays for civil works.

The project supported the development of feasibility studies, technical analyses, and architectural designs
for the selected 22 hospital units (maternities). However, in the end only 20 maternities were rehabilitated,
works for other two ones (Craiova and Brasov) being cancelled due to big structural problems in Craiova
and uncertain property status in Brasov. Although the rehabilitation of these maternities was financed
through EIB funds (total cost € 45 million), around € 5.4 million was also planned under IBRD funding.

A total of 204 maternities were provided with various types of equipment, including newborn incubators,
monitors, ECGs, etc. Overall 10,500 units were purchased and delivered to the maternities for a total cost
of €19, 6 million from the loan proceeds.

A wide range of technical assistance and trainings were provided throughout project implementation.
Several in-depth documents were developed and introduced, including an Operational Manual on
Maternal and Neonatal Referral System, Quality Assurance System, etc. Around 830 persons were trained,
including health care managers and administrators, as well as health care professionals (see table below).

Component II: Emergency Health Care Services

Integrated emergency health care supported by the project is considered a reference and best practice in
the region. Several countries are intending to adopt and implement the Romanian model with support
from World Bank financed projects.

The project supported major rehabilitation of the emergency department at the 1,300 bed Tirgu Mures
county emergency hospital, which delivers services to a population of around 2,250,000, most of whom
are poor and from the Roma minority. Another 16 Emergency Departments were also renovated. Various
types of medical equipment were delivered to the Emergency Departments of 63 hospitals throughout the
country, including monitors, ECG machines, artificial pulmonary ventilators, CT scanners, X-ray
equipment, intra-hospital transportation, tools for resuscitation, airway management and immobilization,
etc. In addition, monitors were purchased for ICUs and cardiology departments. The hospitals that
received this equipment represent the major trauma and emergency receiving centers in the country.
Moreover, a total of 190 small municipal and town hospital emergency rooms were provided with basic
equipment. These emergency centers are now better able to provide emergency care for patients in critical
condition and stabilize their health condition before being referred to the intensive care unit.

The introduction of the telemedicine system for imaging data transmission for the central and south
regions was extended to further cover the north-east region. Radio equipment, data transmission


                                                    28
equipment, and GPS for ambulances were funded under the IBRD loan. The MoH was able to create an
operational communication network covering the entire country. This unified data transmission with the
same equipment available at all levels (regional and central). A total of 40 regional dispatch centers were
created, with six sub-stations per region, and around 1,451 type A, B, and C ambulances were equipped
with necessary communication equipment. The project had initially aimed to support communication
equipment for 400 ambulances; however, it has successfully exceeded this target by far.

The project purchased simulators for the training of medical personnel working at emergency services to
strengthen their technical capacity.

Component III: Primary Health Care and Rural Medical Services

Initially this component focused on improving the accessibility and quality of basic medical services in
rural and small urban areas, but was substantially revised during the restructuring carried out in 2008. The
majority of the activities were dropped, with the exception of the development of the PHC strategy.

Nevertheless, before cancellation of the activities, this component developed a new concept based on the
existing system of rural health centers. These centers were intended to deliver diversified services by
family doctors, ambulatory care specialists, community nurses, home care and social services in remote
rural areas and small towns.

Sub-loans for family doctors were supposed to finance specific investments in medical equipment,
consumables, transportation means, and IT equipment to help the doctors improve access to a wider range
of health services. It was expected that this would bring about an improvement in the quality of the
services provided in selected locations, including but not limited to rural areas. There were two specific
reasons for the cancellation: (i) changes in the legislation of health sector financing no longer allowed the
MoH to finance investments in PHC infrastructure; and (ii) developments in the capital market which
gave Group Practices better access to commercial loans.

One of the tangible outcomes of this component is the development of the PHC strategy, which redefined
the PHC and outlined the ways to increase access to medical services in rural areas through physical
rehabilitation of PHCs and through offering incentives for young family doctors to keep them as part of
the medical system in rural and underserved areas.

In 2011, following the fourth amendment to the loan agreement, the rehabilitation of the vaccine
production and ampoule filling and sealing area at the Cantacuzino Institute (Bucharest) was transferred
from the Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project.16 The APL 2
finished the civil works for the influenza vaccine production unit; the aseptic ampoule sealing and filling
station will be completed in due time (2012).




16
   Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project (IBRD Loan No. 4839 RO) was closed on
December 31, 2010. One of the unfinished activities was taken on by the APL 2 based on the request of the MoH and WB letter
(as of January 25, 2011).




                                                           29
Component IV: National Health Accounts and Planning

This component supported the development of National Health Accounts (NHA) and the preparation of
proposals for rationalization and service development projects.

It was a first attempt by the health sector to develop and internalize NHA. All the required support,
including international and local, was provided to the stakeholders and Technical Working Group
(TWG) 17 to adapt internationally validated methodology (WHO/OECD), propose regulation changes
regarding the reporting of financial flows in the health sector, conduct analysis of existing financial
information and surveys, conduct additional surveys, train staff, and prepare, publish, and disseminate
reports. The project financed the participation of the designated staff in various trainings, seminars and
workshops, investments in IT equipment and software, surveys and studies, local and foreign TA.

The National Institute for Statistics (NIS) is responsible for the NHA and is supposed to develop the NHA
for the purpose of international comparisons. Although the NIS continues to collect data from various
institutions and compiles the NHA Report annually, these reports do not use the templates and
methodology developed under the project since they are lacking much information (mainly from the
private sector), which are outdated by the time the NHA is released. As a result, the instrument is not
adequately used by various stakeholders, especially by policymakers for decision-making.

The second activity under this component included support to the MoH, District Public Health Authorities,
health care institutions or local authorities with resources for the preparation of projects to be submitted to
financing institutions and donors. These projects would aim to implement the rationalization strategy and
service plans prepared in APL 1 and make use of the capacity for planning developed at the local level.
This activity was dropped in 2009, mainly because the health sector did not have a sector operational
program for EU Funds.

Component V: Project Management

This component was designed to provide institutional support to the MoH to implement the project
through a Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU had 10 full time staff with component
coordinators and a fiduciary team.

The following technical assistances (TA) were provided, namely:

     (a) Information, Education and Communication Campaigns on the Health Sector Reforms – the TA
         successfully collaborated with the ministry and other stakeholders for about six months in total.
         As a result, new media plans, TV and radio spots based on the newly developed campaign
         messages, slogans, and two interactive websites were delivered.
     (b) The content and listing processes for the Romanian basic package of health services and
         technologies was developed. This TA helped the Romanian authorities deliver a focused set of
         objectives, including the development of a non-exhaustive “negative list” based on explicit
         rationale and with reference to practices in other countries, including the UK and Australia. This
         three-month assignment also covered hands-on support and training for the development of a
         Health Technology Assessment (HTA) in selected areas.


17
  TWG was established for NHA development in the early stages of project implementation, including representatives of the
MoH, MoF, National Health Insurance House, and National Institute for Statistics. The project financed training, seminars and
workshops, investments in IT equipment and software, surveys and studies, local and foreign TA.




                                                            30
    (c) TA training was provided on HTA. The overall objective of this three-month assignment was to
        help the MoH improve the management of the funds, in order to become more transparent, based
        on a clear process to ensure cost-effectiveness. This TA also covered the training for
        professionals concerning the HTA to ensure their adherence to best international practices. A total
        of 12 persons involved in the HTA from the MoH and other relevant institutions were trained
        (National Health Insurance House, National Agency of Medicines, and medical universities).
    (d) TA for impact study of the new health regulations was planned but later on cancelled due to
        several revisions of the ToR and certain policy direction changes in the sector.
    (e) The following TA were carried out in support of the (a) development of a Strategy for Primary
        Health Care in Underserved Rural Areas and the Related Action Plan; (b) development of
        National Health Accounts System in Romania; (c) development of an Operational Manual on
        Maternal and Neonatal Referral System; (d) design and institutionalization of a Quality
        Assurance system within the maternities; and (e) Training Program to ensure implementation of
        best international practices for the Romanian Neonatology and Obstetrics/Gynecology system.

In total 60 contracts (ICB procedures) were entered into and financed out of the proceeds of the IBRD
loan, for medical equipment, communication and GPS equipment, emergency telemedicine system, local
and regional paging systems, and vaccine filling and sealing lines. There were six contracts for civil
works (three directly IBRD financed and three financed by IBRD and EIB loans) procured following
NCB procedures, 21 small contracts for civil works (total budget: EUR 0.48 million) and seven small
contracts for first aid and paramedics manuals, hospital beds, surveillance, telephone and communications
equipment procured following shopping procedures (total budget: EUR 0.36 million). There were 12
ICBs (42 contracts financed out of the IBRD loan) awarded in 2008-2012, with a total cost of EUR 35.8
million; three ICBs in 2006–2007 (18 contracts financed under the IBRD loan) with a total cost of EUR
31.05 million. The pricing of three awarded civil works contracts followed NCB procedures and the three
awarded civil works contracts that followed the shopping procedure has a price increase within the 20-50
percent range. Five medical equipment contracts awarded following ICB procedure during 2006-2007 had
contracts prices increased by 10-15 percent. There were five TA contracts, financed out of the IBRD loan,
awarded based on the QCBS procedure for which contract values did not increase; the same applied to
one contract for TA, one for NHA, and six contracts awarded for the design of civil works based on the
Low Cost Selection procedure. In only one case—an ICB for the procurement of equipment for
emergency rooms in 193 municipal and rural hospitals—in which the supplier had to pay liquidated
damages in the amount of EUR 26,144.86.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Introduction

The objectives of the second Romania Health Reform Project (APL 2) were to provide more accessible
health services of increased quality for those requiring maternity and newborn care, emergency medical
care, and rural primary health care to achieve improved health outcomes. The original project had five
components: rehabilitation of maternity and neonatal care units; development of district and local
emergency areas, development of multi-trauma operating theaters in emergency hospitals, development of
an integrated ambulance dispatch system, supporting the establishment of a regional telemedicine pilot
project; improving primary health care and rural medical services; and supporting the development of
National Health Accounts and the project management component. In 2008, when the project was
restructured, the third component to provide primary health care and rural medical services was
downsized to provide only the required technical support.

2. Project benefits and costs

The total project cost was US$201.03 million, which represents 97.4 percent of the appraisal estimate
(US$206.5 million). The project costs by year are presented in Table 2. The actual costs as a percentage
of appraisal estimates shows a high level of fiscal efficiency in project implementation.

2.1. Project benefits

This section will first present the outcomes realized as a result of the project. The project outcomes are
then quantified in economic terms.


The first component supported rehabilitation of maternity and neonatal care units in 22 major hospitals,
providing equipment units like newborn incubators, monitors, ECGs, etc. A total of 10,500 equipment
units were provided to 204 maternities. In addition to these materials, support from this component also
facilitated training to about 830 medical personnel that included doctors and nurses. These investments
reduced maternal mortality from 24 deaths per 100,000 in 2004 to 14 per 100,000 in 2013. The neonatal
mortality fell from 9.6 deaths per 1,000 in 2004 to 4.5 per 1,000 in 2013, falling from 2068 deaths in 2004
to 673 deaths in 2013. Similarly, the post neonatal mortality decreased from 1,573 in 2004 to 634 in 2013.
The above project outcomes show significant benefits from the interventions completed under the first
component. The development of district and local emergency hospital facilities under the second
component decreased the 24-hour death rate among patients treated in the Emergency Room and then
admitted to Intensive Care Units from 5.78 percent in 2007 (baseline) to 4.16 percent in 2013. As the
third component was downsized, the outcome of this component was development and approval of the
Primary Health Care Reform Strategy, which redefined Primary Health Care and outlined the ways to
increase access to medical services in rural areas through physical rehabilitation and by offering
incentives for young family doctors to stay in rural and underserved areas. The Health Sector Strategy
action plan and the development of National Health Accounts under Components 3 and 4 contributed to
the overall health sector improvement in the country.




                                                    32
The above outcomes from the project are summarized below in Table 1.

Table 1: Project outcomes and achievements in relation to the baseline

Component 4        Developed National Health Accounts

The gains in health outcomes compared to the baseline levels prior to project implementation are
considered the benefits from the project. In other words, the marginal improvements in health outcomes
resulting from the project, compared to the pre-project scenario, are the project benefits. These marginal
improvements with the project are converted to monetary values to assess economic benefits and
measures of economic efficiency.

To estimate monetary values, we have considered the time lags in project investments and its impact on
health outcomes on the population, the size of the target population, the existing patterns of morbidity and
mortality, the number of years of productive life added as a result of the percentage decrease in mortality,
and the existing cost structure in the health sector.

Assumptions

To quantify the benefits from the project the following assumptions were made:
    1. The benefits from the project span over a period of 10 years.
    2. The project investment activities under Component 1 targeted about 17.8 million people, which
       accounts for about 80 percent of the population of Romania.
    3. The investment activities under Component 2 benefit about 50 percent of the country’s
       population, about 11.1 million people.
    4. The investments under Components 3 and 4 improve overall efficiency of the project.

The gains in health outcomes for the targeted population over the ten-year period were converted into
monetary values. These additional benefits with the project then become the benefits from the project.
The project generated both direct and indirect benefits. The benefits from rehabilitation and improvement
of maternal and neonatal care units included reductions in the number of maternal and infant deaths, the
average length of stay following deliveries, the number of Caesarean sections, and low birth-weight
babies. The rehabilitation and improvement of emergency care centers reduced the number of deaths
resulting from accidents, injury and poisoning, ischemic heart disease, and other external factors. The
benefits included both a reduction in the costs of provision of services and an increase in benefits from the
potential life years saved by the project with the economic and financial value of increasing productivity.
These benefits were estimated using data on unit costs and parameter estimates for Romania.

3. Measures of project worth and economic efficiency

The costs, estimated benefits, and measures of economic efficiency are presented in Table 2. The
economic valuation of the benefits from the project outcomes shows a rate of return at 28.4 percent and
the Benefit: Cost ratio of 1.65 at 10 percent rate of discount. These results are consistent with the ex-ante
expected returns and measures of economic efficiency presented in the Project Appraisal Document.

4. Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impacts of changes in the assumptions or expected
benefits and/or costs on net benefits from the project and the consequent measures of economic efficiency.
Thus, the sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the robustness of the results under the assumptions
that the future benefits fall short of the expectations or if there is an unexpected cost escalation. The
Project Appraisal Document provides cases of reduction in project benefits by 40 percent and 20 percent
and two alternative cases of delays in project implementation. To perform the sensitivity analysis we have
not considered the later cases of delays in project implementation as it is no longer relevant. Therefore,
we have only done sensitivity analysis with reductions in project benefits. To do the sensitivity analysis,
three alternative scenarios are considered. The first scenario considers a 20 percent reduction in project
benefits from both the components. In the second scenario, it is assumed that there is 40 percent reduction
in benefits from the first component and 20 percent reduction in benefits from the second component. The
third scenario considers the case when the benefit from the first component is down by 20 percent and the
benefits from second component falls by 40 percent. The fourth scenario considers the case when benefits
fall by 40 percent.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the project remains viable under the first three scenarios. But when
total benefits fall by 40 percent, the ERR falls below 10 percent and a benefit cost ratio at 10 percent

discount rate becomes less than one resulting in negative Net Present Worth. However, it may be noted
that project yields reasonable returns when the benefits are down by 20 percent for both the components
and by 40 percent for either of the first two components. These results further support the fact that health
outcomes/gains from the first two components of the project exceeded the targets envisaged at project
development.

5. Poverty impacts

The beneficiary analysis of the project showed that public sector health interventions to strengthen
maternal and neonatal care and emergency care services under the project benefited mostly rural and poor
sections of the population. In this context it may be noted that in Romania, the sections of the population
that mostly depend on public health facilities are the poor and rural households. Hence improvements in
public health facilities will directly benefit them through reduction in health expenditures, reductions in
mortality rates, and better health outcomes, which in turn will increase their incomes and thus reduce
poverty in the long run.

6. Conclusion

The results show that the returns from the project justified the investment and the measures of economic
efficiency are satisfactory. Due to delays in project implementation, the project had to be restructured
with significant scale back in Component 3 to expand primary health care facilities. However, the project
outputs and achievements exceeded the targets for Components 1 and 2, which in turn resulted in
satisfactory rates of return and measures of economic efficiency. The sensitivity analysis shows that even
under conservative assumptions of significant reduction in project benefits, the rates of return were about
15 percent. These results are close to the expected measures of economic efficiency presented in the
Project Appraisal Document, which confirms that the project had achieved the expected outputs and
outcomes at project development.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Client satisfaction survey for maternities

The client satisfaction survey was designed to show the satisfaction index per level of maternity. This
survey was conducted in four consecutive waves. The first phase of the survey collected the baseline data
and was conducted in 2008 (field work took place in October-December 2008). The survey was also
performed in 2009, 2012, and 2013 using the same methodology, survey design, and questionnaire. The
structured interviews were performed with a total of 1,552 patients who had delivered and were ready for
discharge.

Interviews were performed by trained staff members (the PMU regional coordinators and representatives
of public health directorates). Selection of maternities was made based on the level of maternal and
neonatal mortality.

The objectives of the survey were to collect the information on hygienic and sanitary conditions of
hospitals, information given to patients, involvement of patients in decisions about their care, personnel,
quality of services, etc. Respondents were interviewed for about 30 minutes on average. The answer to
each question was weighed. The maximum score for the whole questionnaire was 140 points.

For the first level maternities (the lowest level), the satisfaction index has been increased by 16 percent.
For the second level, the satisfaction index has been increased by 7 percent, while for the third level
facilities, the satisfaction index has been increased by 9 percent.

Regarding the levels of facilities, the Level 3 facilities represents the highest level of treatment and
equipment, with more severe and complicated cases managed at these hospitals by continuous
improvement of the existing referral system. In this respect, a larger number of more severe and
complicated cases are being transferred from maternity Level 1 to maternity Level 2, and to maternity
Level 3.

OBJECTIVE
This component supports physical rehabilitation for maternity and neonatal care units plus medical and
other equipment necessary for high quality neonatal and maternity services. Technical assistance and
training is provided to ensure implementation of best international practices, building on already existing
partnerships between the Romanian Government and international donors: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA.
Support will be provided to improve the capacity of health care authorities and provider units to monitor
service quality and access.

The MoH has developed a tree concept for the structure and functioning of the future network of
maternity and neonatal care units. Under this approach, maternities are structured according with the
complexity of the services provided, with appropriate regional distribution for each level, in order to
cover the entire country with all levels. The selection of sites for each level is done based on the criteria
such as: number of births or distance to the medical facility.
Based on the results of a detailed analysis of training and other human resources needs in this sector,
which was undertaken during project preparation, training and quality improvement programs are
financed to ensure that the maximum benefits are achieved from the physical investments that are made.

Component 3: Primary Health Care and Rural Medical Services
(Amount allocated €5.64 million, of which €4.17 million was from IBRD)

OBJECTIVE. Initially the Component 3 focused on improving the accessibility and quality of basic
medical services in rural and small urban areas and supposed to provide support through two activities:




                                                  45
Sub-component 1: Multipurpose Health Centers, developed as a new concept that builds upon the
existing rural health centres. These centres supposed to allow the provision on diversified services by
family doctors, ambulatory care specialists, community nurses, as well as home care and social services in
remote rural areas and small towns.
An initiative to rehabilitate rural primary care services, defined as “Health Centers”, was implement
during the period of 1994-1995, but the efficiency wasn’t demonstrate because the way wasn’t adapt to
the local needs and due to the lack of sustainability funds.
Therefore the FDs appointed as a resource of expertise express their doubts concerning the success of
such program.
This subcomponent was dropped at the Project restructuring in 2008.
Sub-component 2: Sub-loans for family doctors. Sub-loans fund/funds for family doctors supposed to
finance specific investments for medical equipment, consumables, transportation means and IT equipment
that will enable FD to improve the access to a wider range of health services and to improve the quality of
the services provided in selected areas (including but not limited to, rural areas).

According to the new Strategy of the Ministry for primary care and to the real needs of the rural and
underserved area, a national program for increase access to quality basic health services in under-served
area was proposed in order to replace the initial objectives of this Component.
Also this subcomponent was dropped at the Project restructuring in 2008.
The third component (PHC and Rural Medical Services) was stalled due to (i) changes in the legislation
of health sector financing, which no longer allowed the MoH to finance investments in PHC
infrastructure; and (ii) developments in the capital market which gave group practices better access to
loans.

The following main activities have been carried out under this component:

    1. Rural PHC strategy:
    - TA in order to define beneficiary map
    - TA to define the Rural PHC Strategy 2012-2020 and related Action Plan

Following the Fourth Amendment to the Loan Agreement, dated February 21, 2011, in the APL2 Project
were included:

    2. Rehabilitation of vaccine production and ampoule filling and sealing area at the
       Cantacuzino Institute of Bucharest, including the purchase of the necessary equipment.
    - technical design for the influenza vaccine production unit rehabilitation
    - rehabilitation of the influenza vaccine production unit
    - rehabilitation of the aseptic ampoule sealing and filling station
    - site supervision of the rehabilitation works
    - upgrade of the vaccine filling &sealing line
    Euro 5.760 million from the third component was relocated to other components as follow:

The objectives of this component have been achieved.

Component 4: National Health Accounts and Planning
(Amount allocated: €0.21 million, of which €0.15 million was from IBRD)

OBJECTIVE. This component supported the development of National Health Accounts (NHA) and
preparation of proposals for rationalization and service development projects.
Sub-component 1: National Health Accounts (NHA). For the development of NHA support would be
provided to adapt the internationally validated methodology, propose changes of regulations regarding


                                                    46
reporting of financial information in the health sector, perform analysis of existing financial information
and surveys, conduct additional surveys, train staff, and prepare, publish and disseminate reports. A
working group for NHA development was established, including representatives of MoH, MoF, National
Health Insurance House, National Institute for Statistics. The project would finance participation in
training, seminars and workshops, investments in IT equipment and software, surveys and studies, local
and foreign TA.

The second activity supported by this component was supposed provide to MoH, District Public Health
Authorities, health care institutions or local authorities the resources for preparation of projects to be
submitted to financing institutions and donors. The projects would aim to implement the rationalization
strategy and service plans prepared in APL 1 and make use of the capacity for planning developed at local
level. This preparatory work will increase the capacity to access and use EU structural funds in the future.
This second activity was dropped in 2009.

The following main activities have been carried out under this component:
   - Development of National Health Accounts (NHA).

The objectives of this component has not been achieved, the NHA has been created, but the system
it’s not functional yet. The legal framework regarding a detailed NHA system, according to budget
lines, is not in place, due to the changes in legislation.

Component 5: Project Management
(Amount allocated €4.46 million, of which €2.88 million was from IBRD)

    1. TA for production and delivery of Public Information Campaign on the Health Sector Reforms in
       Romania and related support programs.
    2. TA for establishing proposals for the basic health care service package from which persons
       insured with the social health insurance system will benefit.
    3. TA for Health Technology Assessment Training.
The PMU was proper staffed with experienced and qualified experts. Their high quality work was
reflected in the high number of contracts and activities that have been carried out during Project
implementation
The PMU staff salaries were drastically reduced twice during 2010 by forty (40) percent. The issue of
PMU staff salaries reduction applied starting with January 2010 has been never been solved until the loan
closing date despite of the memorandums undertaken by the PMU staff internally in the Ministry of
Health, in the Romanian parliament and in the court.
This issue of PMU staff salaries reduction starting with January 2010 until the end of the Project had a
strong negative impact on the Project implementation demotivating the PMU staff.

Commencing with April 2013 and continuing during 2014 the PMU staff was involved in all the
preparation stages of the Health Sector Reform – Improving Health System Quality and Efficiency
Project. Valuable contribution of the PMU staff in new Project preparation was reflected by the World
Bank approval of the Loan in March 2014.

Lessons learned

Some of the activities included initially in the preparation stage of the Project were dropped after 2 years
from the effectiveness. This was reflected in some changes of the PDO.
The unavailability of TWGs members during the process of preparation of the technical specifications or
terms of reference and difficulties in establishing TWG meetings, the TWG delays in providing
clarifications responses to the technical specifications generated delays in the project implementation.
In many cases the evaluation committee members were not available during bid evaluation process and
generated delays in project implementation. Discontinuities in their work due to changes in working
groups and evaluation committees’ composition had also delayed the process.
The low level salaries of the PMU staff starting with January 2010 had a strong negative impact on the
Project implementation. The staff was not committed and few of the experts had left the team due to the
salary reduction. It was obvious that PMU staff remuneration level is essential for a proper
implementation of a project.
Technical designs for the rehabilitation works proved to be outdated. A careful review of the technical
designs could bring benefits to the Project implementation. The EIB requested the revision of the
technical designs after the bidding processes were initiated. This led to significant delays in works
contracts implementation.
Using the ICB method for procurement of Goods and IT systems proved to be the most effective method
resulting in cost savings registered in most of the cases.
During the first years of the project, the budgetary allocation was reasonable good. In the last two years,
secondary to budgetary restraints and to an inadequate prioritization in the budget of MoH, the allocation
was inadequate (smaller). A better communication between the directorates of MoH can give, in the
future, better results.

The cooperation with the World Bank
The PMU and the Ministry of Health had an excellent cooperation with the MoPF and World Bank’s
team. The review of the bidding processes carried out by the Bank procurement specialists was adequate
and very professional. The permanent support of the MoPF team was also an important factor for success.
