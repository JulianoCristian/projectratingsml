                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the overall APL Program are as follows: (a) improve efficiency and equity in the planning and regulation of the health service delivery system; (b) reduce
                         preventable deaths among emergency medical cases; (c) improve access and quality health care in poor and remote areas; and (d) help the Romanian health sector to

                         A fifth extension of the closing date from March 15, 2013 to December 31, 2013, was granted to allow the completion of a financial impact assessment and enable the undertaking of
                         some technical assistance activities in support of the preparation of a proposed newoperation in the health sector. The total level of disbursements under the project has reached US$
                         85 million (approx 107 % of the total loan funds - the over disbursement is generated by the evolution of the exchange rate over the entire project life.

                         Overall progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives is Moderately Satisfactory. Though the targets for PDOs and most of the Intermediate Indicators have been
                         exceeded in several areas, sole attribution to the Project should be read with caution since the civil works for the rehabilitation of maternities under the Project has been delayed. The
                         great majority of these works (almost 90%) is being co-financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB). Besides the delays in the rehabilitation works caused by the revision of the
                         architectural designs, their implementation is also hampered in 2013 by the lack of adequate counterpart funds affecting the disbursements of the EIB financed loan. The EIB loan
                         has been extended until end of 2014.

                         With the support of the activities developed under Component 1 of the Project (Maternity and Neonatal Care), the Ministry of Health has developed maternal and neonatal referral
                         system which ensures that women and newborns have access to appropriate levels of care complexity. Thus, with the support of the medical equipment purchased under the Project,
                         the system now can provide an effective integrated modern prenatal, delivery and postpartum care, to both low and high risk pregnant women as well as high quality neonatal care.
                         The implementation of the Integrated Emergency Health Care System supported by the Project became a best practice in the region, and several other countries are currently
                         learning from this experience.

                         The second major PDO, namely the preparation of the strategy for the development and provision of primary health care services in under-served areas, has also been completed.
                         The strategy is expected to be approved by the Government shortly, within the framework of the Health Sector Reform Strategy for next programing period of the European Union
                         financing exercise for 2014-2020.
