                         The Project was restructured and closing date was extended for third time by 12 months (current being set for December 15, 2012). Almost all the activities envisaged under the
                         project have already been completed, except for the : (i) upgrade of the influenza vaccine production facility at Cantacuzino Institute; (ii) the construction works for the rehabilitation
                         of the 22 maternities mainly financed by European Investment Bank and (iii) implementation of the public awareness campaign on the health sector reforms. The first two activities
                         will likely be completed before the closing date, while the rehabilitation works for 15 maternities will continue during year 2013.
