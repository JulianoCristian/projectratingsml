The nine and a half-month extension are required\n            to complete a few ongoing activities, necessary for the full\n            attainment of the overall APL program development objectives\n            (PDOs). In addition, the extension will allow the completion\n            of technical assistance activities needed to support the\n            Ministry of Health\u0092s commitment in fulfilling requirements\n            under the precautionary stand-by agreement with the\n            International Monetary Fund. These activities suffered an\n            implementation delay due to changes in the Government\n            following the general election of December 2012, and this is\n            why an additional extension of the project is being sought.\n            This fifth extension of the Project closing date from March\n            15, 2013 to December 31, 2013 will enable the preparation of\n            the financial impact assessment of the envisaged health\n            sector reforms, under revised terms of reference prepared by\n            the new Government. This assessment is a performance\n            criterion included in the precautionary stand-by agreement\n            with the International Monetary Fund and in the memorandum\n            of understanding agreed with the European Commission. This\n            extension will also allow the preparation of additional\n            technical assistance activities to support the design and\n            implementation of the next generation of reforms in the\n            health sector in Romania."}, "docdt": "2013-03-12T00:00:00Z"}
