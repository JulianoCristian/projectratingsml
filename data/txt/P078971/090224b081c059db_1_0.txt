                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the overall APL Program are as follows: (a) improve efficiency and equity in the planning and regulation of the health service delivery system; (b) reduce
                         preventable deaths among emergency medical cases; (c) improve access and quality health care in poor and remote areas; and (d) help the Romanian health sector to
                         better focus on priority public health problems, thereby reducing preventable illness and deaths. The specific objectives of Phase 2 are as follows: (i) Provide more
                         accessible services, of increased quality and with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and newborn care and emergency medical care; and (ii)
                         Provide support for the preparation of the primary health care strategy.

                         A fifth extension of the closing date from March 15, 2013 to December 31, 2013, was granted to allow the completion of a financial impact assessment and enable the undertaking of
                         some technical assistance activities in support of the preparation of a proposed newoperation in the health sector. The total level of payments under the project has reached EUR
                         61.5 million (approx 94.5 % of the total loan funds). The Project is expected to be fully disbursed by its new closing date.

                         Overall progress towards achieving the Project Development Objectives remains satisfactory. Though the targets for PDOs and Intermediate Indicators have been exceeded in
                         several areas, sole attribution to the Project should be read with caution since the civil works for the rehabilitation of maternities under the Project has been delayed. The great
                         majority of these works (almost 90%) is being co-financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB). Besides the delays in the rehabilitation works caused by the revision of the
                         architectural designs, their implementation is also hampered by the lack of adequate counterpart funds affecting the disbursements of the EIB financed loan.

                         With the support of the activities developed under Component 1 of the Project (Maternity and Neonatal Care), the Ministry of Health has developed maternal and neonatal referral
                         system which ensures that women and newborns have access to appropriate levels of care complexity. Thus, with the support of the medical equipment purchased under the Project,
                         the system now can provide an effective integrated modern prenatal, delivery and postpartum care, to both low and high risk pregnant women as well as high quality neonatal care.
                         The implementation of the Integrated Emergency Health Care System supported by the Project became a best practice in the region, and several other countries are currently
                         learning from this experience.

                         The second major PDO, namely the preparation of the strategy for the development and provision of primary health care services in under-served areas, has also been completed.
                         The strategy is expected to be approved by the Government shortly.
