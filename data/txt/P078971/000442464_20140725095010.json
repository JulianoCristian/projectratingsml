Sector Reform Program Project for Romania were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was negligible, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: given the scope\n            and pace of health sector reform, the two-phased adaptable\n            program lending (APL) was an appropriate approach for\n            ensuring achievement of the project development objectives\n            and long-term sustainability. Strong governmental ownership\n            and close coordination with development partners are\n            critical. Continuity of staff, particularly on the\n            government and project management unit (PMU) sides, is a\n            critical element of project success or failure. Proactive\n            and timely supervision by the Bank's team is also\n            crucial for a successful project."}, "docdt": "2014-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
