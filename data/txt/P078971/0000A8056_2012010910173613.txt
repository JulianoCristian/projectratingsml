                         Many of the activities initially envisaged under the project have already been completed, including: (i) technical assistance to support Maternity/Neonatal services (referral system.
                         quality assurance and medical staff training); (ii) provision of medical equipment for maternities and emergency health services; (iii) provision of communications equipment for
                         emergency health services: and (iv) development of National Health Accounts. However the construction works for the rehabilitation of the 22 maternities included in the project and
                         co-financed with European Investment Bank, were slower than anticipated due to slow revision of the technical designs.

                         Following the February 2011 project restructuring, several activities in the area of emergency health services that were put on hold in 2010, due to the economic crisis and severe
                         financial constraints, were reconsidered and related procurement therefore were re-launched. For most of these contracts the final deliveries are scheduled for mid December 2011 to
                         end of January 2012. Also the restructuring allowed the continuation of the activities related to the rehabilitation of the influenza vaccine production facility from Cantacuzino Institute.
                         However these activities are not completed to date due to the seasonality of the vaccines production, and they will therefore have to continue in 2012. The needed budgetary
                         allocations have been adequately secured for 2011 and more recently for 2012.

                         The Borrower requested a third extension of the project closing date, up to December 15, 2012, to enable the completion of the ongoing activities, and to include new technical
                         assistance activities that would support the implementation of the forthcoming health sector reforms which result from the Hospital Rationalization Strategy and from the engagements
                         with the International Monetary Fund and European Commission. Following the review conducted , the Bank agreed to positively consider the extension request, which is currently
                         under internal approval processing.
