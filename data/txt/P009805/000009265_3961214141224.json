Some lessons learned included: the design and\n            quality of project management arrangements is probably the\n            single most important element for successful and timely\n            project implementation. The Bank should not agree to support\n            projects where such fundamental conditions are not\n            satisfied. Dependence on design and engineering consultants\n            such as Central Water Commission (CWC) who are not\n            answerable to the project owner should be avoided. Important\n            engineering issues such as anti-sedimentation measures\n            should be resolved at the time of project appraisal or as\n            soon as possible thereafter. The successful use of\n            consultants for project management requires a genuine\n            commitment on the part of the implementing agency and/or\n            project owner, and cooperation by the consultants'\n            counterparts on the ground. Lack of such support will\n            undermine even the best of efforts by consultants. Adequate\n            resources should also be provided. Apparent cost savings\n            achieved by reducing expatriate staff and introducing lower\n            cost but less than fully qualified local support will be\n            over-shadowed by implementation delays and difficulties."}, "docdt": "1996-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
