Lessons learned\n            included: 1) Where the correct responses to water stress are\n            not evident, a demonstration project linked to decision\n            making about broader policy and investment is a powerful\n            approach. It is recommended that, where the institutional\n            conditions are right, innovations in water resource\n            management should be tested through a demonstration project,\n            and then scaled up; 2) A comprehensive approach giving\n            priority to farmer incentives can increase farmer incomes\n            and reduce water consumption; 3) The success of water users\n            association (WUAs) stems, in part, from the clear\n            establishment principles adopted: democratic self organized\n            Associations based on hydraulic boundaries, measuring and\n            charging for water on a volumetric basis. Other factors in\n            success were: (a) flexibility in approach and adaptation to\n            local social, economic and political conditions; (b) the\n            inclusion of farmers from the very start in sub-project\n            design, so that the Associations grew as the sub-project\n            developed; (c) the transfer to the Associations of real\n            control and responsibility over water structures; (d) the\n            incentive framework, with farmers in Associations seeing\n            their incomes rise significantly faster; and (e) the\n            commitment and enthusiasm of both the Ministry of Water\n            Resources and local government; 4) The approach targeting\n            reduction in consumptive water use and based on\n            evapo-transpiration can be a powerful instrument for water\n            management in conditions of extreme water stress."}, "docdt": "2007-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
