It covers about 400km\n            and is China's main agricultural region. The soil of\n            the North China Plain is fertile, but water scarcity is a\n            growing problem. In many areas, increasing agricultural\n            demands can no longer be met by adding hydraulic\n            infrastructure such as storage reservoirs, and groundwater\n            is over-exploited. Water supplies to agriculture are under\n            mounting stress from competing demands for municipal and\n            industrial uses. The problem of water scarcity is compounded\n            by worsening water pollution from heavy industrialization\n            and rapid urban population growth. It is increasingly\n            realized that future growth in agricultural water demand can\n            only partly be covered by the additional development of\n            water resources or possibly by costly water transfer\n            projects that would bring water from the relatively\n            water-rich south to the north. The remaining demand will\n            need to be met through water savings, demand management, and\n            deficit irrigation."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
