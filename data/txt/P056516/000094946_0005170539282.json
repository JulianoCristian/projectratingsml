pesticides on soil, and groundwater, of dust and noise\n            pollution, in addition to social impacts, agricultural\n            production, and economy aspects. Mitigating measures suggest\n            that, through the adoption of water-saving irrigation, water\n            volumes will be reduced, and groundwater recharges will also\n            be reduced, in particular, water leaching will not penetrate\n            groundwater, which is the main cause of pesticide mobility.\n            Although civil works will generate spoils, their impact will\n            be reduced by back filling the excavated areas following\n            pipe laying, and land leveling, and, water, and soil\n            conservation, will be improved to optimize the medium, and\n            low agricultural land yields. Dust pollution will be avoided\n            during the windy dry period of Spring; similarly,\n            construction works will be avoided during the rainy season,\n            to control water and soil losses, and prevent excessive\n            drainage. It is estimated that the project will improve the\n            livelihoods of the local population, and the establishment\n            of a water user authority will help improve management practices."}, "docdt": "2000-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
