enhances the beneficial use of water resources, agriculture\n            production capacity, and farmer incomes by: increasing the\n            value of agriculture production per unit of consumed water\n            through increasing yields and reducing non-beneficial water\n            losses; and establishing mechanisms for sustainable use and\n            management of water resources in irrigated areas.\n            Twenty-seven counties from the provinces of Hebei and\n            Liaoning and the municipalities of Beijing and Qingdao have\n            been identified and all of the subprojects have been\n            prepared at the feasibility level. There are four project\n            components: 1) Irrigation and drainage works and onfarm\n            systems, including canal lining, low-pressure pipes, drains,\n            wells, small structures, surface irrigation improvements,\n            sprinkler systems, and micro-irrigation systems; 2)\n            Agriculture support and services, including land-leveling,\n            non-tillage in the dry season, deep plowing in the rainy\n            season, and soil fertility improvements such as using green\n            manure and stalk, organic and plastic mulching, cropping\n            pattern adjustments, seeds improvement and development of\n            drought resistent varieties, balanced fertilzation, and\n            improved planting and cultivation techniques; 3) Forestry\n            and environmental monitoring; and 4) Institutional\n            development, including training, technical assistance and\n            research as well as establishing and strengthening operation\n            and maintenance entities made up mostly of water users."}, "docdt": "2000-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
