F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective was to enhance beneficial use of water resources over
100,000 hectares in four provinces/municipalities, and to increase the incomes of 257,000
farm families by: (1) increasing the value of agricultural production per unit of water



                                                ii

consumed through increasing yields and reducing non-beneficial water losses; and (2)
establishing mechanisms for sustainable use and management of water resources in
irrigated areas.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Country Background. In recent years, the very rapid growth of China's cities and industries has
created a strong demand for water in the urban sector. Demand has also increased in agriculture, where
most water is still used but where use has been comparatively inefficient. As a result, China suffers from
a serious imbalance between water demand and supply, particularly in the populous North China Plain,
causing serious overdrawing of the groundwater resource and pushing the country towards costly water
transfer projects to bring water from the relatively water-rich south. By the 1990s, the government had
concluded that major water savings in agriculture were essential to deal with water scarcity and the
growing demand for water yet, at the same time, government policy was to increase rural incomes and so
reduce imbalances between urban and rural standards of living. Therefore, government programs focused
on improvements in irrigation efficiency in order to raise water productivity whilst increasing farmer
incomes.

1.1.2 Rationale for Bank Assistance. At the time of project identification, the government was
implementing its irrigation policies through the national Irrigated Agriculture Water Saving Program
(IAWSP). However, that program had an engineering bias, focusing largely on investment in irrigation
infrastructure, and had not succeeded in reducing the pace of groundwater overdraft. Therefore, the
government requested Bank assistance for a water conservation project that could test and demonstrate
ways to achieve its policy goals. This request was in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
objective of support to sustainable land and water management.

1.1.3 Bank sector work and project experience had identified a number of important innovations that had
potential for helping to achieve the government's goals. Although some of these innovations had been
tested on a small scale in other projects, the Water Conservation Project was the first project to combine
them in an integrated fashion. The introduction of these innovative elements in a project designed to
demonstrate to an initially skeptical water management community their value for all water scarce areas
of China provided the rationale for Bank engagement in the project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The project development objectives were to enhance the beneficial use of water resources over
100,000 ha in four provinces/municipalities and to increase the incomes of 257,000 farm families by: (a)
increasing the value of agricultural production per unit of water consumed through increasing yields and
reducing non-beneficial water losses; and (b) establishing mechanisms for sustainable use and
management of water resources in irrigated areas.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1 There were no revisions of the project development objectives or the key indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary target group comprised farm families for which project investments in water-saving
infrastructure, agricultural improvements and better water management were expected to increase
incomes significantly. There was no change in this beneficiary group targeted at appraisal (although the
number of beneficiaries at completion was 40% higher than originally foreseen, see below). Indirect



                                                      1

beneficiaries were to include: workers employed upstream and downstream of project production together
with those benefiting from the increase in levels of economic activity stimulated by the project; the
community at large, benefiting from improved water resource sustainability, reduced pollution and
enhanced rural environment; and local governments benefiting from reduced fiscal outlays on irrigation
operation and maintenance.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 The project comprised four components to be implemented in 27 counties/cities in four
provinces/municipalities in the North China Plain: Hebei and Liaoning provinces and Beijing and
Qingdao municipalities. The project components were: (a) Irrigation and Drainage Works and On-farm
Systems; (b) Agriculture Support and Services; (c) Forestry and Environmental Monitoring; and (d)
Institutional Development.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 There was no major revision of the project components during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.6.2 There were no significant changes in project design, scope and scale, implementation arrangement
and schedule, and funding allocations, etc., except in the Beijing sub-project area where the total
developed water-saving area had been adjusted at the time of the mid-term review (MTR) and reduced by
9,088 ha as a result of the urban development plan.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The background analysis

2.1.1 The project was the latest in a series of seventeen water resources and irrigation projects which
China and the Bank had financed together over the previous fifteen years. Bank sector work at the time
of preparation highlighted the problems of water scarcity in North East China (see Section 6.1) and the
high financial and environmental costs of water transfers (China Water Strategy). At the same time,
sector work in rural development had underlined the need to improve rural incomes (Rural China:
Transition and Development). Both studies identified the improved management of scarce water
resources for irrigation as a key solution.

2.1.2 Based on previous Bank project experience and sector work, the project was correctly focused on
new approaches to two key issues: (a) finding investment and institutional packages that would reduce
water consumption whilst increasing farm incomes; and (b) developing institutions that could manage
water in rural areas in a sustainable manner. The innovative approaches introduced in the project are well
described and justified in the PAD.

2.1.3 The first innovation was to target a reduction in consumptive use rather than increases in irrigation
efficiency. Experience in China had shown that focusing on improvements to physical infrastructure
alone might increase irrigation efficiency but could also reduce the recharge to groundwater and the
availability of water for downstream users. Only a reduction in actual consumption of water represented
a genuine saving of the resource to the hydraulic system. The Bank therefore proposed to government to
adopt a reduction in consumptive use of water as the objective, and to use evapo-transpiration (ET) - that
is, water lost to the hydraulic system through evaporation from the soil surface or through the leaves of



                                                   2

plants - as the performance indicator. The innovative target proposed for the project was to reduce ET
and to increase value-added per unit of ET.

2.1.4 In parallel, the second innovation proposed was to adopt a comprehensive approach to water
saving, integrating not only physical improvements to irrigation and drainage systems but also a broad
range of agronomic measures together with improved water management focused on optimizing soil
moisture available to the crop.

2.1.5 A third innovation was to return groundwater use to sustainable levels through a combination of
planning, investment and incentives. A particular feature was the recognition that farmers would only
comply if they found it profitable to do so. Hence priority was to be given to incentives through the
development of packages that would increase incomes while reducing water consumption.

2.1.6 The final innovation was in institutional arrangements for operation and maintenance through
delegation to water user associations (WUA). For the first time on any scale in China, WUAs were to
assume responsibility for both financing and running the parts of the irrigation system that came under
their control - typically a whole groundwater system or the command area of a lateral canal in surface
irrigation.

2.1.7 These innovations, proposed by the Bank during project identification, did not match the
government's initial concept of the project, which was focused on investments in sprinkler technology. A
protracted (two year) preparation and appraisal period was needed to reconcile the contrasting views
about the project - in which the Bank's Groundwater Management Advisory Team (GW-MATE) played
an important role. Each of the innovations required study and discussion before it could be adapted to the
project.




                                                   3

Assessment of project design

2.1.8 With the background described above, the project objectives were clearly stated and evidently
responsive China's priorities. They met Bank goals as set out in the CAS. The components were well
designed and well matched to project objectives. Because of the wide variation in conditions in the 27
project counties/cities, the irrigation and drainage component provided for a choice of four technologies:
canal irrigation improvement; low pressure pipe irrigation; sprinkler irrigation; and drip irrigation. To
reflect uncertainties over which technologies would prove most appropriate, the project was designed on a
programmatic basis. The first year's program was ready at appraisal, and subsequent investments were to
be approved based on annual work programs to be agreed with the Bank. This flexible approach not only
allowed the mix of different technologies to be agreed once the conditions in the sub-project areas had
been studied in detail but also allowed the innovative approaches to be tested and proved. This was an
appropriate approach, given the uncertainties over the innovative approaches.

2.1.9 Environmental and social factors were adequately incorporated in project design. Environmental
impacts were expected to be largely beneficial, with any minor negative impacts mitigated by project
interventions. A sound concept for participation and WUAs was developed (see below). The only
safeguard to apply to the project was the Environmental Assessment safeguard, although a resettlement
policy framework was agreed in line with OD 4.30 and Chinese law in case unexpected resettlement
issues arose.

Government commitment and stakeholder involvement

2.1.10 Reflecting the innovations built into the project, central government designated the project as a
"demonstration project" intended to develop and test new approaches that could subsequently be scaled
up in national programs. Central government provided institutional support, setting up the Central Project
Coordination Group (CPCG) and the Central Project Management Office (CPMO) before appraisal, and
the PMOs were also set up at local levels. Consistent with government policy that development should,
wherever possible, be locally financed, local government commitment was demonstrated by the fact that
provinces/municipalities and counties/cities were prepared to borrow a share of the Bank Loan, to allocate
their own counterpart resources and to pay a management fee for the CPMO.

2.1.11 The project design provided adequately for stakeholder involvement. Priority in design of sub-
projects was given to improving farmer incomes and participatory processes under the project were to
involve farmers in sub-project design, implementation, monitoring and management from the outset in
order to give a genuinely demand-driven character to investments. The development of WUAs was to
create an institutional structure for self-management and self-financing of irrigation water, and a channel
for capacity building on water saving and agricultural productivity.




                                                     4

Risk assessment

2.1.12      Many risks were assessed at appraisal and, where appropriate, mitigation measures were
correctly built in to the project. In addition to the institutional, government commitment and
environmental risks discussed above, the principal risks and mitigation measures were: (a)
macroeconomic risk - financial, trade and price policy risks were correctly assessed as only moderate to
negligible in the context of China's sound economic management policies; (b) technological and
economic risks - there was a risk that the innovative approaches under the project would be inadequate to
tackle the problems. The project provided for adequate research, training and investment, and for a
flexible and empirical approach adequate to mitigate the risk; and (c) risk to sustainable operation and
maintenance - this risk, particularly that farmers would not accept higher water charges, was assessed as
substantial, and was mitigated appropriately by the participatory approaches adopted through WUAs, with
extensive dialogue and training and a focus on increasing farmer incomes as a top priority in sub-project
investments.

2.1.13 Overall, this was a well designed project. There was no Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review
of the project's quality at entry.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The project was implemented very largely as designed, with small adjustments during the
MTR. Only minor problems and delays occurred during implementation. These were successfully
resolved and did not affect final outputs or outcomes. The project met or exceeded most output targets
and was completed on schedule on June 30, 2006 at the close of the planned five-year implementation
period. Although the irrigated area improved in Beijing was reduced by 9, 088 ha at the MTR as
described above, the total project irrigated area improved at completion was 104,730 ha, 98 percent of the
PAD and 100 percent of the MTR targets. There was no project restructuring.

2.2.2 Mid-term review. Conducted in May 2004, the MTR found implementation largely on track.
However, significant differences from appraisal expectations had arisen in rates of implementation of the
different irrigation technologies under the engineering component. In particular, the poor water
conservation performance of sprinkler technology and the high operating costs had led to a low level of
adoption by farmers. By contrast, there was very strong interest in the canal irrigation improvement sub-
component. Demand for other groundwater technologies (low pressure pipe, drip) was also somewhat
below appraisal estimates. These differences were reasonable in a demand-driven project implemented
on a programmatic basis and with innovative approaches.

2.2.3 As a result of the MTR findings, it was agreed to reallocate funds within the Loan to reflect: (a) the
reduction in the sprinkler target area from 26,817 ha to 10,788 ha; (b) the increase in the target area for
canal irrigation improvement from 17,125 ha to 46,137 ha; (c) somewhat lower targets for pipe
conveyance (reduced from 49,963 ha to 37,327 ha) and for micro and drip irrigation (reduced from
12,914 ha to 10,630 ha); and (d) a reduction in agricultural equipment purchase (farmers financed this
themselves) and reallocation to the greenhouse sub-component. Funds were also reallocated to reflect the
government's decision not to finance vehicle purchase under the Loan. The government request for a
corresponding increase in the Bank's financing share for works from 33 to 50 percent was agreed.

2.2.4 Overall, the MTR proved very effective in accelerating implementation and disbursement. The
report highlighted ten important project actions which had been lagging and set a time-bound agenda for
the balance of the project period. The remaining two years of implementation were without major
problems.




                                                      5

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 The project monitoring and evaluation system, designed with consultant support, selected a large
number of indicators to track outputs and outcomes. A household survey instrument was designed to
collect key socio-economic data. Implementation units were established at every Project Management
Office (PMO) level with adequate staffing, training and supervision. A baseline survey was carried out
and regularly updated. Periodic reports were produced and consolidated at provincial and central level.
Overall, the monitoring and evaluation system was well designed and implemented and reliable
information was generated and put to use.

2.3.2 Various arrangements for continuing monitoring are in place or are under consideration.
Monitoring and evaluation of water balance and ET will continue under the Hai River Basin Integrated
Water and Environment Management Project (P075035) in Hebei Province, and Beijing Municipality.
Groundwater monitoring will continue in all areas under a variety of programs and budgets. At the time
of the Completion Mission, central and local government units were considering how to continue the
household surveys, which would be taken over by the follow-up project if approved.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Financial management was generally of good quality. Capacity was built through the development
of standardized written procedures and by intensive training. Issues detected through the supervision
process were promptly resolved, and audit reports were timely and of acceptable quality. Procurement
performance was good. The Management Information System (MIS) allowed real-time tracking of
procurement and the prompt identification of issues. As a result, procurement was rapid and efficient and
in line with Bank requirements despite the very large number of contracts (2,097 in all) and contracting
units (all 32 PMOs).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Transition arrangements. It is very likely that sub-projects financed under the project will be
operated profitably and in a sustainable manner. Viable operation and maintenance plans are being
implemented for all sub-projects, generally providing for self-management and self-financing by the
WUAs. Experience with this so far is entirely positive, and performance is reinforced by the evident
profitability of the project investment for farmers.

2.5.2 Scaling-up. The project has successfully demonstrated that water consumption can be reduced
while farmer incomes increase and that workable institutional arrangements can be implemented to allow
the recovery of groundwater tables. The government is enthusiastic about scaling-up project successes,
particularly: (a) the targeting of the reduction in consumptive use of water and the employment of ET as
the performance measure; (b) the comprehensive approach integrating engineering, agricultural and water
management measures; and (c) the development of WUAs. The lessons are already being scaled-up in
central government programs, notably the National Water Conservation Program financed by the Ministry
of Finance's State Office for Comprehensive Agriculture Development (SOCAD) and the National
IAWSP by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR). In addition, lessons are also being scaled-up
through local government programs, particularly in Beijing and Qingdao where prosperous urban areas
are keen to invest both in water saving, with a view to urban water supply, and in the "harmonious
society" approach to balancing rural and urban development and incomes. Lessons are also being scaled-
up through other Bank-financed projects, notably the Irrigated Agricultural Intensification Projects II and
III.




                                                     6

2.5.3 In addition to these specific investment programs, some of the technical and institutional
innovations introduced under the project are being adopted in policy, planning and investment for rural
water saving nationwide. For example, the preparation of county-level groundwater management plans,
piloted in four counties under the project, has been taken up by a further 21 counties across Northern
China. Management instruments developed under the project ­ the MIS and the monitoring and
evaluation system ­ have been adopted in both projects and regular operations. This process of scaling-
up responds to China's major policy decision to create a "water saving society" with such broad-ranging
facets as a nationwide education campaign and the rating of local governments and officials based on
their contribution to water saving in their area. In order to assist this scaling-up, the MWR, together with
six provincial/municipality governments, has identified a follow-on project for Bank assistance, and it is
likely that a formal request from the government to the Bank for this project will be received shortly.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The project, as designed and implemented, addresses key development priorities that remain highly
relevant to China today, notably: (a) increasing rural incomes whilst reducing water consumption in areas
of water stress; (b) recovering control over groundwater and managing it in a sustainable manner; and (c)
reducing agricultural water use so that resources can be released for the fast expanding cities. The project
developed viable and replicable models for China to address these problems. The successful experience
under the project is also of global significance, as many water scarce countries are beset by problems
comparable to those of China (see Section 6).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 The project fully achieved its two development objectives. In the achievement of the first
objective, the value of agricultural production per unit of water consumed increased throughout the
project area and non-beneficial water consumption was reduced. The project reached or exceeded in
almost all cases the monitorable outcome targets set at appraisal (see Section 6.5). Regarding the
increase in agricultural production, cash crop production tripled, an increment of 1.9 million tons a year
and 122 percent of the appraisal targets. Regarding the increase in farmer incomes, per capita incomes
increased by between 102-554 percent, depending on the area, compared to all cases were well in excess
of appraisal targets. Regarding the increase in production per unit of water consumed, production per
unit of ET rose for all crops planted within the project areas, in the range 60-80 percent. Average income
per cubic meter of water consumed doubled on average, with increases ranging from 72 percent in
Shenyang to 112 percent in Beijing. Regarding the total annual reduction of non-beneficial water
consumption, average consumptive water use across the project area was reduced from 735 mm to 612
mm, representing an annual water saving of 1,200 m³/ha or 128 million m³ for the whole project area.

3.2.2 In the achievement of the second objective, mechanisms for sustainable use and management of
water resources were successfully established in the project area and the project reached or exceeded in
almost all cases its outcome targets. Regarding the development of self-financed WUAs, at appraisal it
was expected that about 100 associations could be established; in fact, at completion over 500 had been
set up, covering 62,800 ha, about two-thirds of the project area (with 100 percent coverage in Hebei and
Beijing). Regarding the area covered by volumetric water charging, at project completion volumetric
water charging was operational on 62,400 ha, well above the target area of 57,000 ha. Regarding the
progressive increase in water charges, water charges for all irrigation types rose from the relatively low
pre-project baseline by a multiple typically of three to four times, to levels above appraisal targets.
Regarding the control of groundwater use, depletion has been reduced to negligible levels or eliminated
across most of the project area (on average 0.02 m depletion annually, against rates of 0.41 m a year in




                                                     7

comparable non-project areas). Annex 2 gives the details of project outputs which reflect the linkages
between the outputs and the positive outcomes described in this section.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The expected benefit targets were reached. Economic analysis conducted at completion using the
same methodology as at appraisal showed that the project is likely to achieve a high overall net present
value (NPV) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) (about US$226.3 million and 24.1 percent,
respectively), above the appraisal estimates of US$88.4 million and 20.7 percent, respectively. High
EIRRs were also anticipated, ranging from 17.7 to 24.4 percent in each sub-project area. The financial
net present value (FNPV) and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) were calculated to be about
US$180.5 million and 17.6 percent, respectively, above the appraisal estimates of US$47.4 million and
15.6 percent, respectively.

3.3.2 Benefits accrued to a very large number of beneficiaries: 358,088 farm families, more than the
appraisal target of 257,000. On-farm and upstream and downstream employment creation was
considerable: about 423 million labor days during the project period alone. Farm household incomes rose
considerably compared to the baseline data and the PAD expected targets in project area, and were 102-
554 percent of appraisal estimates. This highly satisfactory result can also be added to the numerous non-
quantifiable social and environmental benefits, even though all these gains are not only directly from the
project but also from the other factors, such as the WTO accession and the higher incomes in urban area
that increase in demand for the high-value agricultural products, etc.

3.3.3 Although the conventional economic analysis does not include benefits from "real" water resources
savings, annual project M&E results have showed the substantial benefits from savings of water resources
through the reduction of the groundwater "overdraft" and non-beneficial water losses. Following
appraisal methodology, the benefits from the water resource savings have been recalculated based on the
actual monitoring data collected annually in the field. The achieved total NPV of these benefits is as
much as US$228.5 million. At completion, the total cumulative amount of water saved from the
reduction of non-beneficial water losses in 2001- 2005 was estimated to be about 435.4 million m³ and
the annual amount saved from 2006-2011 is expected to be about 128.4 million m³. The project has
therefore contributed to the sustainable use of surface and groundwater resources in the North China Plain
region. Based on the cost of alternative supplies from water transfer of Y2.0/m³ (or 25 US cents/m³), the
economic value of the water savings from 2001-2005 is expected to be as high as US$108.8 million under
project, and the NPV of these savings from 2001-2011 would be about US$196 million (or Y1,568
million). If these benefits had been included in the economic analysis, the project total NPV and ERR
would have both been much higher than the values shown above. Annex 3 provides more details for the
overall project economic and financial analysis.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

3.4.1 The project was highly relevant to current country and global priorities and to the Bank assistance
strategy; it met or exceeded all targets as measured by outcome and impact indicators and so fully
attained all development objectives, and it was highly efficient, with a rate of return well in excess of the
opportunity cost of capital and above appraisal expectations.

3.4.2 The rating is further justified by the strong demonstration effect of the project (see Section 2.5).
Although not captured in the overall outcomes rating, the demonstration under the project that, with the
innovations tested, agricultural production and farmers' incomes in the vast North China Plain can be
sustained within the rainfall budget without groundwater "overdraft" or water imports has far-reaching


                                                    8

implications for policy makers pondering the challenge of high-cost south-north water transfer. This
demonstration could prove, in the long run, to be the most valuable benefit of the project. In addition, the
government has highly appreciated and built in the ownership of the comprehensive approach developed
under this project for irrigated agricultural water savings, integrating engineering, agricultural and water
management measures, together with the institutional innovation of WUAs. The experiences and lessons
are already being scaled-up in central government programs, notably the National Water Conservation
Program financed by the Ministry of Finance's SOCAD and the National IAWSP of the MWR.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Many beneficiaries are poor, and several of the project counties were officially classified as poor
areas, and it is likely that many of the beneficiaries were below the official poverty lines. One indication
of a "pro-poor" impact is that farm incomes increased faster in Hebei, the poorest of the four provinces,
than elsewhere in the project area. Women's participation in the project was significant, especially with
the high number of female-headed households in rural areas resulting from the temporary migration of
men folk. Women's participation in WUAs was estimated at 30-40 percent, and women were regularly
elected to WUA committee posts. In cases where women were the permanent or temporary head of
household, they were the contracting party for sub-projects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The project caused significant beneficial institutional change. The networks and institutional
linkages between the water resources, agriculture and forestry bureaus, universities and research institutes
that were created under the project have become ingrained in institutional behavior. These linkages have
been consolidated at the working level by the creation in much of the project area of "one stop" integrated
technical service centers at the township level to provide a package of irrigation, agricultural and forestry
guidance to farmers. This integration of producer services at the local level is now being implemented
nationwide.

3.5.3 Several project management innovations introduced have been adopted as standard for the national
irrigations programs (SOCAD, IAWSP), including: (a) project identification and planning procedures; (b)
procurement procedures; (c) the MIS developed under the project; (d) the monitoring and evaluation
procedures; and (e) the environmentally sensitive approaches (e.g., on soil fertility and pest control) and
the use of Environmental Impact Assessments. The ex post evaluation of the latest phase of the IAWSP
used the key indicators developed for the Water Conservation Project.

3.5.4 The organization of WUAs for lower-level irrigation management proved, despite initial reticence
from the Chinese side, to be one of the most significant achievements of the project, proceeding faster
than anticipated in all areas. The innovation generated a high degree of enthusiasm both from local
government and agencies and from farmers. Local government and agencies were able to devolve
management and financing responsibilities to the WUAs and to use the new organizations as a channel for
project innovations in improving water management and farming productivity.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Efficient irrigation management contributes not only to saving water, energy and money, but also
to growth of crop yields and farmers' incomes. These benefits became the basis for farmers' incentives
for WUA operation and development as well as for their aspirations and achievements of a real win-win



                                                     9

situation. Many case studies show farmers' incomes were enhanced with scientific irrigation methodology
and cropping pattern readjustment under WUA arrangement, such in Guantao of Hebei, with the low-
pressure pipeline irrigation managed by the WUA of Hanxu village, wheat yield increased from
400kg/mu to 600kg/mu; and in Faku county of Shenyang, greenhouses produced vegetable yield
increasing from 1400kg/mu before the project to 3400kg/mu after it, by which farmers' incomes
increased by about Y3000. These kinds of yield growth and farmer income enhancement had been further
demonstrated through typical household survey done in project area (see Annex 5).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

4.1.1 There are possible financial risks to the sustainability of project outcomes. Although prospects for
the financial viability of project investments are good, especially as the market for higher-value produce
is growing very fast, there is a risk that further currency devaluation could affect export market
prospects. However, local authorities and farmers in the project areas have developed strong market
awareness and have the skills and flexibility to manage the risk.

4.1.2 There is a potential social risk of over-rapid expansion of WUAs, with numerical targets and a high
level of government involvement in their creation. In some areas, such as Beijing municipality, WUAs
are being designated as the fourth and lowest level of water management and government is proposing to
subsidize the post of water master in each Association. The development of WUAs does need to be
tracked and periodically evaluated, but the following factors suggest that these risks - which stem from a
significant success under the project - will not compromise the autonomy inherent in the democratic
WUA concept: (a) their creation responds to farmers' clear desire to take control of their own water
management; (b) the partnership arrangement between farmer-controlled WUAs and government
agencies is essential in order to attain the public interest objectives of a reduction in consumptive water
use and sustainable groundwater management, and reflects a politically- and socially-appropriate
approach in the rural development and political economy context; and (c) in practice, farmers and local
government and agencies have adopted a flexible approach to WUA development, adapting the concept to
local needs and constraints. For example, in Beijing municipality where the massive national capital
market is adjacent, WUAs have been legally established as cooperatives rather than as civil society
organizations in order to ensure that they have legal personality and can engage in commercial operations.

4.1.3 The environmental benefits of reduced resource depletion and improved water and soil quality are
implicit in the project and are likely to be sustained and expanded on a much larger scale. There is,
however, an environmental risk throughout the North China Plain of declining precipitation which would
constrain water resources still further and could lead to a decline in farmer incomes in some areas.
Precipitation during the project period was on average 40-70 mm below the long-term average in Hebei
and Beijing. The project has developed the instruments needed to manage this risk through water
planning and reduction in agricultural water consumption, with compensating investment strategies to
sustain rural incomes.

5.1.1 Overall, the Bank ensured through the preparation and appraisal process that the project design was
sound and that the project could achieve its development objectives. The Bank also ensured that fiduciary
arrangements were adequate and that provision was made to respect safeguards. The project was of high
strategic relevance, and the Bank played a vital role in ensuring that it was responsive to issues of the
highest concern to policy makers. Preparation and appraisal of technical aspects was exceptionally well
conducted, with the Bank engaging government in dialogue, studies and fieldwork to develop and build a
constituency for the inclusion of the major project innovations.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2 The Bank maintained a focus on development impact, consistently emphasizing the targeted
outcomes and the innovations being tested under the project. Bank missions ensured that monitoring and
evaluation began early in the project period and that the baseline survey was promptly conducted. Aide
Memoires systematically recalled the development objectives, and variations from target key indicators
were raised as issues. Learning and ownership building about key innovations was continuous, and the
incorporation of lessons into other Bank and national programs was timely and appropriate. The
supervision of fiduciary and safeguard aspects was of good quality: specialists in financial management,
procurement and social science participated consistently in supervision.

5.1.3 Issues were promptly flagged and resolved. Aide memoires and supervision reports were full and
clear. Supervision inputs and processes were adequate. The mid-term review was well prepared and the
mission well staffed. Careful early preparation for the ICR process focused on transition arrangements:
there was organized training of project staff at all levels in ICR requirements, and a fully staffed and
complete ICR mission visited all project areas. There was no supervision rating by QAG.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank teams played a decisive role in ensuring quality at entry and in resolving problems and
identifying opportunities during supervision. The Bank had a determinant input into the success of the
project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 A strong impetus to both preparation and implementation was provided by the commitment of
central and local governments at all levels, which not only provided both loan and counterpart funding but
actively coordinated project preparation and implementation. The Central government, although initially
reticent about the proposed innovations, accepted the lengthy process of dialogue and study needed to
work out the project concept and design the project, agreeing to an empirical process that ultimately
resulted in a change of project concept away from an emphasis on engineering towards a comprehensive
approach and the concept of reduction in consumptive use. There was notable involvement of the
Ministry of Finance as a full project partner at central and local levels. Central and local government
ensured that the CPMO and PMOs at all levels were financed and fully staffed and effective.

5.2.2 Overall Borrower performance is rated as highly satisfactory. The experiences and lessons are
already being scaled-up in central government programs, notably the National IAWSP of the MWR.


6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1 This demonstration project offered an innovative and well thought out package. Linked to decision
making about broader policy and investment, the project proved to be a powerful way to test responses to
water scarcity that could be rapidly scaled-up.

An innovative but initially contested approach to water management was successfully tested and
mainstreamed because of a partnership approach between the Bank and China, the flexible and learning
approach under the project, and the institutional linkages between the demonstration project and national
policy and programs. The lesson is that where the correct responses to water stress are not evident, a
demonstration project linked to decision making about broader policy and investment is a powerful
approach. It is recommended that, where the institutional conditions are right, innovations in water
resource management should be tested through a demonstration project, and then scaled up.

6.1.2 A comprehensive approach giving priority to farmer incentives can increase farmer incomes and
reduce water consumption.

Through a comprehensive approach involving not only engineering works but also agricultural
investments, husbandry and cropping pattern improvements and improved irrigation management, the
project raised farmer incomes whilst reducing water consumption and helping groundwater levels to
recover. Factors that facilitated the success of the approach were: (a) China's very fast growing economy
which provided profitable market outlets for higher-value produce; (b) a well-functioning mechanism for
delivering agricultural and water management services; (c) the existence of numerous straightforward



                                                       12

productivity improvements; (d) good social capital and a sound governance structure at all levels; and (e)
central and local government policy priority to raising rural living standards.

The lesson is that approaches to water saving in agriculture are more likely to succeed if they give priority
to farmer incentives to change water use and water management behavior. The factors helping success in
the project are not unique to China, although they do not exist everywhere. Where they do exist, the
project shows how the potential for water conservation may be exploited.

6.1.3 A flexible, decentralized approach can facilitate WUA development.

The success of WUAs stems, in part, from the clear establishment principles adopted: democratic self-
organized Associations based on hydraulic boundaries, measuring and charging for water on a volumetric
basis. Other factors in success were: (a) flexibility in approach and adaptation to local social, economic
and political conditions; (b) the inclusion of farmers from the very start in sub-project design, so that the
Associations grew as the sub-project developed; (c) the transfer to the Associations of real control and
responsibility over water structures; (d) the incentive framework, with farmers in Associations seeing
their incomes rise significantly faster; and (e) the commitment and enthusiasm of both the Ministry of
Water Resources and local government. Central government has now adopted WUA development as
national policy, and Associations are being promoted on a broad scale.

6.1.4 The approach targeting reduction in consumptive water use and based on ET can be a powerful
instrument for water management in conditions of extreme water stress.

The approach targeting reduction in consumptive water use and adopting measurement and management
based on ET was highly contentious and was included in the project only following long and arduous
dialogue. After successful demonstration during implementation that these concepts are of great practical
value to China in managing water scarcity, they have been scaled-up to river basin level (in the Hai Basin
Project), where they are being used for overall river basin management and for allocation of water rights
and quotas at all levels from sub-basins down to individual farmers. The lesson is that targeting reduction
in consumptive water use and the use of ET and remote sensing technology for measurement and
management are powerful instruments for water conservation in conditions of extreme water stress. It is
recommended that these approaches should be considered in all water-stressed countries.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      Major economic and financial benefits achieved by the project include the increase in agricultural
production and farmers' incomes through increases in crop yields and in the value of agriculture
production per unit of consumed water, and reductions in non-beneficial water losses. These benefits
were obtained in all four project areas (Beijing, Hebei, Qingdao and Shenyang sub-project areas) and the
expected benefit targets were in almost all cases achieved or exceeded.

2.      The economic and financial analysis was conducted for the completion report on the same basis as
at appraisal. The analysis included the quantifiable benefits derived through the (substantial)
improvements in water and agriculture productivities resulting from the implementation of improved
irrigation technologies, through the integrated water-saving measures, and through the significant
adjustments in the cropping pattern (from grain crops to higher-value cash crops). Following appraisal
methodology, the benefits resulting from "real" water resources savings were also estimated but these
were not included in the EIRR and NPV calculations.

Irrigated Agricultural Benefits

3.      Increases in production and financial returns per unit of water. The project made a significant
impact on agricultural production in the project area, compared to the baseline case and also compared to the
quantitative targets set at project appraisal for the "with-project case". At completion, the expected
agricultural benefit targets have been fully achieved and, in most cases, exceeded. The average yields of main
crops in the project area increased from 4.55 tons to 6.14 tons for wheat (121 percent of PAD estimate), 5.78
tons to 6.32 tons for corn (104 percent of PAD estimate), 3.89 tons to 5.03 tons for peanuts (105 percent of
PAD estimate), 0.8 tons to 1.16 tons for cotton (123 percent of PAD estimate), 62.1 tons to 224.7 tons for
greenhouse vegetables (299 percent of PAD estimate), 3.42 tons to 3.45 tons for chestnut (101 percent of
PAD estimate), and 14.57 tons to 21.33 tons for grape (122 percent of PAD estimate).

4. Overall, the average crop yield and value per unit of irrigation water increased: (i) in Beijing from 3.7 kg
per m³ of water and Y3/ m³ to 7.3 kg/ m³ and Y10.9/ m³; (ii) in Hebei from 2.4 kg/ m³ and Y2.9/ m³ to 3.3 kg/
m³ and Y4.5/ m³; (iii) in Qingdao from 3.3 kg/ m³ and Y3.8/ m³ to 5 kg/ m³ and Y5.6/ m³; and (iv) in
Shenyang from 4.3 kg/ m³ and Y9.1/ m³ to 9 kg/ m³ and Y18.5/ m³. The particularly high yields and values in
Beijing and Shenyang are due to the large greenhouse area for high-value vegetables in those provinces.
Clearly the project had a significant impact on the crop yields and the value of agriculture production per unit
of consumed water, compared to the "without-project" scenario; all these gains cannot be directly attributed to
the project, but are also the result of other factors such as the WTO accession and the higher incomes in urban
area that increase demand for high-value agricultural products, and were also one of the major drivers behind
the increase in high financial return.

5.      Increases in aggregate production. The total area of irrigated land improved under the project was
104,730 ha. At completion, the aggregate crop production and value had increased significantly for all sub-
project areas, due to the substantially improved water-use efficiency, irrigation technologies and management,
and adjustment of the cropping patterns. This is mainly due to the higher yields for both grain and cash crops,
and shifted cropping pattern (to higher-value cash crops). The annual incremental productions are about
98,717 tons for rice (216 percent of PAD estimate), 30,245 tons for peanuts (202 percent of PAD estimate),
6,229 tons for cotton (227 percent of PAD estimate), 1505,819 tons for greenhouse vegetables (362 percent of
PAD estimate), 110,572 tons for pears and grapes (484 percent of PAD estimate), 41,192 tons for apples (154
percent of PAD estimate), 5,027 tons for watermelon (183 percent of PAD estimate), 81.57 million piece for
flowers, 30,300 m³ for timber, 49,427 tons of new production for garlic and walnut, and 3,159 tons for other
crops (309 percent of PAD estimate, mainly for various beans and other small-scale cash crops).

6.      Move to higher value crops. These very large increases are offset to a minor extent by a small
reduction in aggregate grain production, which fell by about 2,679 tons for wheat (64 percent of PAD
estimate) and 199,141 tons for corn (73 percent of PAD estimate). This decline in grain production was in
fact largely a result of project success in equipping farmers to move out of lower-value grain production into
higher-value crops. This change to higher-value crops occurred at a faster rate than anticipated at appraisal:
comparing the "without-project" case and quantitative targets set at project appraisal, the cropping pattern
shifted from 81.6 percent to 59.6 percent for grain crops (70 percent was anticipated in the PAD) and from
18.4 percent to 40.4 percent for cash crops (30 percent at PAD). Thus the total area cultivated for grain crops
dropped by about 12,373 ha for wheat (53 percent of PAD estimate) and 37,244 ha for corn (70 percent of
PAD estimate). This positive development was helped by changes in relative prices resulting from the freeing
of the grain market; grain prices declined during 2001-2004 (affected by WTO accession).

7.      Aggregate increase in production. Overall, the total incremental gross value of production (grain and
cash crops) is estimated at Y1267.6 million in 2005 (about 161.3 percent of PAD estimate). The detailed
incremental cropped area, yield and production of various crops are summarized below:

Economic Analysis

8.      Methodology. Following appraisal methodology, the NPV and the ERR were re-estimated for
each irrigation technology in Qingdao, Shenyang, Beijing and Hebei, and for the project as a whole. The
analysis compared "with-project" and "without-project" scenarios, and the quantifiable benefits derived
through the improvements in irrigation technology and management, water and agricultural
productivities, the eco-environmental system (forestry belt), and the estimated economic costs. The
economic analysis included the estimated economic costs, but not the benefits, for institutional
development and improved environmental management. The benefits resulting from "real" water
resources savings were also estimated (see below), but these were not included in the NPV and ERR
calculations.

9.      Overall highly favorable returns. Comparing costs and benefits over a period of 20 years, the
estimated ERRs are all favorable and in line with appraisal expectations. The ERRs for individual
irrigation technologies range from about 20.9 percent for canal lining irrigation to 25.3 percent for
sprinkler irrigation, and for the various sub-project areas from 17.7 percent in Beijing to 24.4 percent in
Shengyang. The factors in the variation in returns were the variation between technologies and areas in
actual improved crop yields, cropping intensity and cropping pattern, in the size of the irrigated land
planted, and in the investment, production, and O&M costs for each type of irrigation technology at the
time of implementation. The overall project ERR is estimated at 24.1 percent (with a NPV of about
Y1810.2 million) which is higher than the 20.7 percent (with a NPV of about Y734.1 million) estimated
at appraisal. A comparison of detailed ERRs by each sub-project area and irrigation technology is
showed below:

10.    Reasons for lower than expected returns. The economic analysis of the sub-projects shows that
the recalculated overall ERRs for sub-project areas and overall irrigation technologies are all favorable,
and generally higher than those estimated in the PAD. The slightly lower than anticipated (but still very
satisfactory) returns in the Beijing sub-project area are due to the reduced irrigation area (9,088 ha)
adjusted at the MTR. This is linked to the very fast expansion of the urban area ­ under the urban
development plan in Beijing, a part of the project area will be transferred to the city according to the local
government policy. The main reasons for the lower than anticipated returns for low pressure pipeline and
sprinkler irrigation in Hebei, for drip irrigation in Qingdao, and for sprinkler irrigation in Shenyang were
the higher than expected unit costs, attributed to higher quality and standard of the construction work.

11.    Reasons for higher than expected returns. In most cases, results were above appraisal
expectations. The main reasons include: (a) the substantial increase in yields and outputs for both grain
and cash crops (see above); and (b) the faster than anticipated adjustment of the cropping pattern to high-


                                                     22

value cash crops (see above). Costs were somewhat higher than expected (108 percent of the PAD
estimate) but this was more than compensated by the higher than expected revenues.

12.     Non-quantifiable benefits. In addition to the highly satisfactory rate of return, the project
produced numerous non-quantifiable social and environmental benefits. These include the benefits from
the lower groundwater drawdown resulting in less O&M and replacement costs in pumping areas (see
below), the water resources savings (see below), increased employment opportunities for farmers (about
413.3 million labor days provided under the project), improved women's status (especially through the
WUA activities), development of improved water management, social capital and institutional capacity
through the success of WUA, improved road access to communities and the rural social service system,
the improved quality of soil and agricultural products due to IPM, and improved forestry coverage and
farmland ecological environment.

Benefits from Reductions in Consumptive Use of Water

13.     Reason for assessing benefits from reductions in consumptive use. A reduction in consumptive
use of water was one of the main project objectives. The conventional economic analysis does not
include the benefit of this water conserved within the hydraulic system ­ and, in fact, the conventional
agriculturally-derived benefits were more than sufficient to provide economic justification for the project.
However, an exercise was carried out at appraisal to try to quantify and value the benefits from this water
saving, which are of two types: (i) a reduction in pumping costs below the levels that would have been
incurred had groundwater depletion continued at the same rate as without the project; and (ii) a
calculation of the economic value of the "saved" water. Policy makers have expressed interest in this
latter calculation, because it provides useful information for China's water planners as they consider the
alternatives of pushing for further water savings in agriculture or of investing in very expensive inter-
basin water transfers.

14.     Reduction in rates of groundwater overdraft. The effective implementation of integrated water
saving measures has resulted in a reduction in consumptive use. The average groundwater pumped for
irrigation in the project area dropped by about 30 percent (from 296 m³ to 200 m³ per mu). This was a
better performance even than that anticipated at the mid-term review (115 percent of the MTR estimate).
This reduced pumping led to consequent reductions in rates of groundwater overdraft and has helped to
stabilize groundwater levels. Comparing the annual groundwater monitoring data in the Beijing project
area with the non-project area, the average annual reduction of groundwater level in the project area is
estimated at 0.18 meters, compared to 0.50 meters without the project. Equivalent figures are 0.18 m and
0.53 m in Hebei, 0.004 m and 0.14 m in Qingdao, and -0.28 m (i.e., a recovery of the groundwater table)
and 0.45 m in Shengyang, respectively. These are average figures: the actual values in each year vary,
largely depending on rainfall.

15.     Reduction in pumping costs. These reductions in rates of groundwater depletion result in lower
annual operation and maintenance costs (O&M) including repair, maintenance, energy, management,
overhead, depreciation and the extra replacement cost for deeper wells and larger size of pumps. The
benefit analysis indicated that the annual benefits from the reduction in O&M costs ranged from Y33.7
million to Y34.7 million in 2001-2005, and from Y35 million to Y35.6 million in 2006-2011 for the
groundwater used in the project areas. The NPV of these savings would be Y260.4 million (about 124
percent of PAD estimate).

16.     Economic value of water resources saved. The project M+E calculated water resource savings
by measuring the reduction in consumptive use of water (by measuring the reduction in evapo-
transpiration). By this method, the cumulative water saving over the period 2001-5 was calculated to be



                                                    23

about 435.4 million m³, and the annual amount likely to be saved between 2006-2011 has been estimated
at about 128.4 million m³. Following appraisal methodology, the "opportunity cost of water" has been
applied to estimate the economic value of water savings under project. The opportunity cost was assumed,
as at appraisal, to be Y2 per m³ of water, equivalent to the unit cost in 2000 for the water transferred from
the Yangtze River Basin to the North China Plain region. On this basis, the economic value of the water
savings from 2001-2005 was Y870.8 million, and the annual value 2006-2011 would be Y256.8 million
(135 percent of PAD estimate). The NPV of these savings would be about Y1,568 million.

17.    Total benefit from water savings. Taking the saving in pumping costs and the value of water
saved together, the total NPV of these benefits is as much as Y1,828.4 million. Had these benefits been
included in the EIRR calculation, returns would have been considerably higher.

Financial Analysis

18.    Project impact on farm household incomes. Farm-level financial analysis was carried out to
assess the improvements in financial viability of farming through project investments. The financial
analysis indicates that all expected benefit targets have been fully achieved and exceeded. The project
investments generated substantial increases in farmers' incomes for some 358,088 farm families (139
percent of PAD estimate), resulting from improved irrigation efficiencies and technologies, increased
crop yields, and the shift of cropping patterns toward higher-value cash crops.

19.    Methodology and increase above expected levels. To measure the increases in farmer incomes,
and in line with the PAD approach, representative farm households were selected in the four sub-project
areas and surveyed as part of the project M&E system. The survey data show that, in 2005, the average
net per capita income of typical farm households benefiting from the project varied according to project
area and irrigation technology but was almost always above appraisal expectations. The pattern by region
and technology is as follows:

        In Beijing, incomes range from Y2,183 for canal lining (229.5 percent of PAD estimate) up to
        Y6,020 for drip irrigation (102.5 percent of PAD estimate).
        In Hebei, incomes range from about Y1,985 for canal lining (153.7 percent of PAD estimate) up
        to Y2,937 for drip irrigation (120.5 percent of PAD estimate).
        In Qingdao, the range is from about Y1,910 for canal lining (285.9 percent of PAD estimate) up
        to Y5,856 for drip irrigation - this latter figure is in fact slightly (5 percent) below PAD estimates,
        because investment is for fruit trees not yet at full production.
        In Shenyang, net incomes range from about Y2,605 for canal lining (158.8 percent of PAD
        estimate) to Y4,840 for drip irrigation.

20.    Increase above base-line levels. These increases all represent a substantial increase over non-
project and base-line income levels. Actual growth rate of per capita income in 2005 in each sub-project
area ranged from about 23.1 percent to 209.6 percent in Beijing, about 38.4 percent to 88.3 percent in
Hebei, about 14.1 percent to 619 percent in Qingdao, and about 109.4 percent to 237.6 percent in
Shengyang. Thus, the project clearly achieved its objective to increase farmers' incomes. This highly
satisfactory result can also be added to the numerous non-quantifiable social and environmental benefits,
even though all these gains are not only directly from the project but also from the other factors, such as
the WTO accession and the higher incomes in urban area that increase in demand for the high-value
agricultural products, etc. The summary table of income impact on typical households in each sub-project
area is presented below:

20.     Financial Rate of Return. Overall, the project has substantially improved the financial viability
of farming through increased annual returns to farm labor and capital investments. Comparing costs and
benefits over a period of 20 years, the recalculated FRRs are all favorable. The FRRs for individual
irrigation technologies range from about 16.9 percent (low-pressure pipeline irrigation component) to
21.5 percent (sprinkler irrigation component). The overall project FRR is re-estimated at 17.6 percent
(with a NPV of about Y1,443.9 million), which is higher than the 15.6 percent (with a NPV of about
Y393.3 million) estimated at appraisal. Overall, the results of the financial analysis indicate the financial
incentives of farmers to participate in the project and the financial viability of the project investments. A
comparison of detailed FRRs by each irrigation technology is shown below:

22.     Water Charges and Farmers' Ability to Pay. The substantial increase in beneficiary farmers'
incomes provided adequate incentives and full ability for farmers to participate in the development
investment, take over the full responsibility for O&M of on-farm irrigation system through the WUAs,
and pay for the increased water charges as expected at the project appraisal. Water charges for all types
of irrigation technologies have increased from the relatively low pre-project baseline to levels above
appraisal targets. Comparing the rate of water charges "with-project" (the current rate covered by O&M
costs) and baseline scenarios, average rates of water charge (Y/ m³) for different type of irrigation
technologies have gone up as follows:

         from Y0.09 to Y0.2 for canal lining irrigation (143 percent of PAD estimate)
         from Y0.09 to Y0.28 for low-pressure pipeline irrigation (117 percent of PAD estimate)
         from Y0.09 to Y0.35 for sprinkler irrigation (152 percent of PAD estimate)
         from Y0.1 to Y0.49 for drip irrigation (132 percent of PAD estimate).

23.     Collection rates. The overall collection rate for water charges has improved from between 75-90
percent to 96 percent, above the target at appraisal (101 percent of PAD estimate). In addition, the area
covered by volumetric water charging at completion was 62,362 ha (about 109 percent of MTR estimate).
In almost all cases, these higher water charges cover all O&M expenditures (and in some areas part of the
replacement costs as well), thereby creating good prospects for WUA self-financing.

24.     Share of water charges in farmer incomes. The financial analysis indicates that although water
charges went up by a multiple of two to three, their actual share in farm incomes generally dropped. The
drop varied by technology: for example, for canal lining, the share fell from an average about 5.6 percent
to 3.2 percent, from 2.8 percent to 2 percent for low-pressure pipeline irrigation, and from 2.4 percent to
1.4 percent for sprinkler irrigation. Only for the drip/micro irrigation did the share increase (from 1.2
percent to 2.5 percent) because of the higher water demand for greenhouse vegetables production with a
multiple harvest of three to four seasons per year. These shares in income are lower than expected at
appraisal because, on the one hand, farmers' costs were lower (reduced O&M costs resulting from the
stabilization of the groundwater tables) and, on the other hand, farmers' incomes were well above
expectations. Thus, the project is likely to be financially sustainable because farmers can well afford to
take over full responsibility for O&M and pay the increased water charges, and have good incentives to
do so. A comparison of detailed water charges and their impact on household income by different
irrigation technologies in each sub-project area is presented below:

Main Assumptions for Financial and Economic Analysis:

25.     The ERR estimate was compared with that calculated in the PAD, using revised estimates based on
the latest data and information for actual costs and benefits and up-dated assumptions on future costs and
benefits provided by PMOs in MWR, and in Beijing, Qingdao, Shengyang and Hebei sub-project areas in
2006. The framework of the analysis follows, to the extent possible, that of the PAD. Key assumptions
have been changed only when clearly better estimates are available. The general assumptions are as
follows:

(a) The analysis compared "with-project" (the up-graded irrigation system with canal lining, low-pressure
pipeline, semi-fixed sprinkler and micro/drip irrigation systems plus agronomic and management water
saving measures) and "without­project" (the original groundwater irrigation system with wells and the
conventional canal facilities and techniques) scenarios;

(b) All project costs [1], including project investment costs, physical contingencies, agricultural
production costs and O&M costs (including reduced energy requirements for pumping resulting from the



1 At completion, total actual project investment costs in financial terms for the four sub-project areas were about US$203.54
million (or about Y1,669 million, 108 percent of PAD estimate).




                                                              27

improved irrigation efficiencies), have been considered in estimating the economic costs of the project,
but price contingencies, taxes, duties and other charges were omitted. The economic analysis also
included the economic costs, but not the benefits, from institutional development and improved
environmental management;

(c) The analysis has been expressed in constant prices [2]. Input and output prices used in the crop
budgets are 2005 average farm-gate prices prevailing in all sub-project areas and provided by the project
authorities. Bank commodity price projections or export prices actually realized in China were used to
estimate farm-gate prices in constant 2005 terms. These were then used to calculate the farm-gate value
of wheat, maize, paddy rice and fertilizers with appropriate adjustments for domestic and international
transport and handling costs for each sub-project area. A standard conversion factor of 1 was applied to
all non-traded items. All economic values were converted to local currency at the prevailing official
exchange rate of Y8 to US$1. A discount rate of 12 percent was used to approximate the opportunity cost
of capital in China. The economic life of sub-projects is assumed to be 20 years.

(d) The benefit analysis for reduced groundwater drawdown resulting in less O&M and replacement costs
in pumping areas excludes: (i) the negative impact on the sub-project areas from surrounding areas that
may continue to over-extract groundwater and thereby have a negative impact on the groundwater table in
the sub-project areas; and (ii) the positive impact of the groundwater stabilization in the sub-project areas
on surrounding areas lessening their overall groundwater drawdown and consequent O&M costs related
to groundwater extraction outside the sub-project areas;

(e) Project benefits are based on the actual performance of existing crop production and the
implementation of integrated water-saving measures, especially for the reductions in groundwater
overdraft and non-beneficial water losses in each sub-project area. All data/information were collected
from the project monitoring sites during project implementation and reflect actual cropping patterns and
intensity by year and type of the irrigation technology in each sub-project area. The detailed crop budgets
reflect actual scenarios for various crops in the field with actual average yields from 2001-2005. The
amount applied of seeds, fertilizers, farm chemicals and irrigation water delivered and consumed by main
crops are also the actual average and incremental levels in each sub-project area applied for different
irrigation technologies.

The details of these and other assumptions applied in the financial and economic analysis are presented in
the project files.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results


1.     Efficient irrigation management contributes not only to saving water, energy and money, but also
to growth of crop yields and farmers' incomes. These benefits became the basis for farmers' incentives
for WUA operation and development as well as for their aspirations and achievements of a real win-win
situation. Many case studies show farmers' incomes were enhanced with scientific irrigation
methodology and cropping pattern readjustment under WUA arrangement, such in Guantao of Hebei,
with the low-pressure pipeline irrigation managed by the WUA of Hanxu village, wheat yield increased
from 400kg/mu to 600kg/mu; and in Faku county of Shenyang, greenhouses produced vegetable yield
increasing from 1400kg/mu before the project to 3400kg/mu after it, by which farmers' incomes
increased by about Y3000. These kinds of yield growth and farmer income enhancement could be further
demonstrated through typical household survey done in Hebei, as shown in below.

productivity rates in the WAU areas all over the four project province/municipalities can be shown in
Table 2 below that also explains the factual economic increase between 2000 and 2005 as the project
impact in general.

3.     Finally, typical statistics of annual net incomes per person of WUAs before and after the project
could conclude the general situation of project WUAs' impact on farmers' economic lives, as shown in
Table 3 below.

4.     Farmer incomes grew everywhere under WUAs in the project context. Hebei as the poorest place
among the four project provinces grew the most, with its 86 percent growth rate compared with 71
percent as the average and 61 percent as the lowest. This certainly means that the project WUAs had more
impact in poor areas than others. On the whole, according to the project M&E statistical analysis, five
years of project implementation helped local farmers improve their life quality by reducing 7.7 percent of
their production costs on average and enhancing 8.2 percent of their living consumptions, meanwhile
rehabilitating their living environment of housing and drinking water, promoting their access to health
care and school education. At this point, along with the national program of new countryside construction,
farmers were able to start creating and enjoying their better-off lives.
