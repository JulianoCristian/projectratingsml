locked countries; 2)\n            help improve maintenance planning and operations of\n            rural/feeder roads serving agricultural areas; and 3)\n            strengthen institutions responsible for project\n            implementation. In order to achieve these objectives the\n            project will consist of highway rehabilitation and\n            strengthening component, a pilot rural road maintenance\n            program and consultant services."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
