                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A project restructuring was finalized in January 2012 which aimed at ensuring sufficient time and resources for completion of all project activities, as well as streamlining the project
                         performance. The Borrower’s national procedures on enforcement of this restructuring were finalized and the amendments were enforced as of end of June 2012, following national
                         ratification procedure.
                         Since end of 2011, the notable progress in the project development objective monitoring indicators continued to grow, in terms of reduction of the Border processing times at the two
                         major Border crossing points (BCPs) at Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo. According to data submitted based on the revised methodology, the transit time over the period October
                         2011-March 2012 has been improved by about 39% compared to the revised 2010 baseline.
                         The rehabilitation of Kapitan Andreevo BCP is now being launched after the contract was signed in end June 2012, while taking into consideration the seasonality of the traffic in
                         planning of the works at the BCP.
                         The rehabilitation of 4 smal BCPs (Bregovo, Vrushka chukka, Zlatarevo and Logodaj) is in a design stage, with the works expected to be launched in the Fall of 2012.
                         The delivery of large specialized customs equipment at the ports of Varna and Bourgas, as well as at the Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCPs was finalized in early spring 2012 and
                         they have been currently put in operation.
                         The construction of the last 3.4 km of Maritsa highway under component 2 is on-going and the Land acquisition plan (LAP) for component 2 was disclosed in December 2011.
