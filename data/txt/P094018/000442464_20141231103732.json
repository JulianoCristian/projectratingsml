{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Trade and\n            Transport Facilitation Project for Bulgaria were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: trade and transport facilitation\n            projects require very clear leadership and proactive\n            coordination between the various agencies on the\n            Borrower's side as well as with the Bank. Institutional\n            and capacity building through improved procedures,\n            cooperation, and information exchange is equally important\n            as physical improvements made to the infrastructure.\n            Upgrading of border crossing points (BCPs) requires careful\n            attention to planning of land expropriation during\n            preparation and design including proper baseline surveys.\n            Adequate attention to monitoring and evaluation (M and E) of\n            processing times is essential to evaluate large investments\n            needed to enhance BCP performance. Also, impact of such\n            investments often requires a relative long gestation\n            periods. A medium term evaluation is more appropriate."}, "docdt": "2014-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
