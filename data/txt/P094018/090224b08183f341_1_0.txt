                         The development objective of the project is to facilitate trade by improving the capacity, efficiency and quality of services at selected European Union border crossings
                         with particular focus on the Trans-European Transport Network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         notable reduction in border processing times at the two major border crossing points (BCPs): Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo (KA). According to data submitted based on the revised
                         methodology, the transit time over the period April -September 2012 decreased by about 37% compared to the revised 2010 baseline.
                         The work program is running behind schedule, although progress has been made. The biggest civil works contract for reconstruction of the KA BCP has been launched and is
                         progressing. The other big works contract under Component 2 for the construction of the motorway is in implementation, although running behind the schedule.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project implementation is impacted by delays in launching some activities, as well as in implementing of existing contacts. In spite of those delays however, all activities could still
                         realistically be completed by the revised closing date of the project, should the contract implementation is speeded up, the remaining contracts are signed with no delay and sufficient
                         financing is made available from the annual state budget to the project.
                         The remaining contracts for reconstruction of 4 small BCPs need to be launched in the beginning of 2013 in order to be completed before the closing date of the project.
