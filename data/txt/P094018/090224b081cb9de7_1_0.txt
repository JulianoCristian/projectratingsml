                         notable reduction in border processing times at the two major border crossing points (BCPs): Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo (KA). The transit time over the period October 2012 -
                         March 2013 decreased by about 28% compared to the revised 2010 baseline.
                         The work program is running behind schedule, with delays in implementation of the two biggest civil works contract for reconstruction of the Kapitan Andreevo Border Crossion Point
                         (BCP) and 3.4 km section of access road to the BCP.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although the contract for the Kapitan Andreevo BCP reconstruction has been launched and has progressed, it is most likely that the works will not be completed by the loan closing
                         date.
                         The other big works contract under Component 2 for the construction of the access road to Kapitan Andreevo BCP is still impacted by delays, mainly due to discovery of
                         archaeological remains, as well as current archaeological works on the site. While currently progress has been made, some new archaeological structures were discovered (in May
                         2013), in the right of way of the motorway, leading to a recent decision of the respective local authorities to stop the works on the road. Actions for the necessary archaeological
                         measures are still to be agreed. Any delays in solving this issue would cause further delays with construction of the road and will risk slippage of the completion of this motorway
                         section after the loan closing date.
                         The remaining contracts for reconstruction of 4 small BCPs are still not contracted and it is less likely to be implemented within the current project closing date.
