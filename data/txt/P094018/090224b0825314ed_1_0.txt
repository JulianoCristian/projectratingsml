                         The development objective of the project is to facilitate trade by improving the capacity, efficiency and quality of services at selected European Union border crossings
                         with particular focus on the Trans-European Transport Network.

                         •         Project development objectives (PDO) were mostly achieved, which is evident in the: (1) reduced freight processing time at the Road Corridors IV and IX at the Border
                         Crossing Points (BCPs), with Serbia at Kalotina and with Turkey at Kapitan Andreevo (2) increased efficiency for vehicle throughput on the last 3.4 km section of Corridor IX (Maritsa
                         Motorway), providing access to Kapitan Andreevo BCP and (3) improved capacity, organization, coordination and communication between border agencies in terms of establishment
                         of functioning inter-agency coordination bodies (Inter-ministerial Council for Border control). In addition, the PDO monitoring indicators in the last reported period (October 2013-

                         March 2014) continue the same trend of reduction in border processing times at the two major border crossing points: Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo, with the exception for entry at
                         Kapitan Andreevo BCP, due to the ongoing reconstruction works. The overall improvement in the transit time is about 41% compared to the revised 2010 baseline and 64%
                         compared to the original 2008 baseline.
                         •         In terms of project implementation, currently, about a month before project closure, most project activities have been completed and the focus is on two outstanding
                         contracts: (i) reconstruction of the Kapitan Andreevo BCP; and (ii) construction of Customs terminal in Svilengrad (freight terminal between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria). It has been
                         agreed by the World Bank and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) that the priority is to have the main part of the reconstruction at Kapitan Andreevo BCP completed (Phase 1) by
                         the end of June to accommodate the peak of summer passenger travel, and to complete the whole reconstruction by the end of 2014.
                         •         The construction of the last 3.4 km section of the Maritsa highway, which provides access to the Kapitan Andreevo BCP, was completed in December 2013 and the road can
                         be put in operation in June 2014. The design of the road (the overpass) provides unimpeded access to the corresponding lanes, for light and heavy vehicles, as opposed to the
                         current crossover, which generates additional bottlenecks, especially during the peak hours of the day. As a result, the operation of this access road is expected to further improve the
                         efficiency and throughput at Kapitan Andreevo BCP.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the current progress of the works contract for reconstruction of the Kapitan Andreevo BCP, a close supervision and support is needed by the government team to ensure that
                         at least “Phase 1” of the reconstruction (the vehicles processing lanes and the link with the access road) are completed by the project closing date by all means and that the
                         completion of the outstanding works is secured during the rest of the calendar year .
                         Strengthened project management and supervision is also needed at Svilengrad Customs Terminal to ensure timely contract completion.
