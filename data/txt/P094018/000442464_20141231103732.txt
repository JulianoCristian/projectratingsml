1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and sector issues: During the project preparation period (2005–2007), Bulgaria’s
top priority was accession to the European Union (EU), which was achieved in 2007.
Bulgaria’s economy grew steadily between 2000 and 2005, achieving a growth rate of 5.6
percent in 2004 and 5.4 percent in 2005. This growth was expected to continue. Many of the
Bulgarian government’s social and economic development policies were driven by the goal of
EU membership, including a series of reforms, which made improvements in transport
corridors and trade facilitation, both of which were considered important prerequisites to EU
membership. The impact of EU accession had significantly encouraged external trade in
Bulgaria. Yet, Bulgaria’s producers faced increasing competition from exporters such as
China and India, not only for a share of the European market, but also within Bulgaria’s own
domestic market. For Bulgaria to improve its competitiveness a core reform agenda was
needed, i.e., one that encompassed upgrading trade infrastructure and border management,
enhancing the labor market, and improving regulatory and institutional frameworks.1
In January 2006, the Council of Ministers adopted the Bulgarian Strategy on Integrated
Border Management (IBM) in accordance with the Convention for the Implementation of the
Schengen Agreement of June 14, 1985. The Strategy envisioned improvements to the
operational interaction between border authorities, the establishment of a uniform information
system at the national level, improvements to systems for the collection, processing and
timely distribution of information pertaining to all events at the border, and a provision for the
shared use of the infrastructure and technical equipment between agencies active at border
crossings.
In July 2006, the Government adopted a National Strategy for Integrated Infrastructure
Development for the period 2006–2015. This strategy gave priority to the construction and
modernization of the Trans-European Network-Transport (TEN-T) corridors, which carry the
vast majority of trade and transit within Bulgaria. The main borders along this corridor, such
as the Bulgarian–Turkish border at Kapitan Andreevo and the Bulgarian–Serbian border at
Kalotina had experienced steady traffic growth. The border facilities were outdated and
inadequate, and the border management system was far from efficient such that users endured
lengthy hold-ups and incurred high transaction costs.
Rationale for Bank Involvement: The earlier World Bank Trade and Transport Facilitation
in Southeast Europe Project (TTFSE 1) was a successful undertaking.2 Recognizing the value
added by the Bank, as well as by EU and other financing partners, the Bulgarian government
requested the Bank to continue its support to build on the achievements of the TTSFE 1. The
TTFSE 1 was a regional project covering a number of countries including Albania, Bosnia,
Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and Moldova. Regarding
Bulgaria, the project was brought to completion in September 2005, at which point US$12.7
million had been invested with the goals of reducing non-tariff costs to trade and transport and
reducing smuggling and corruption at the border crossings. Among the outcomes of the
TTFSE 1 project, several Memoranda of Understanding were signed, which significantly
improved regional coordination in terms of trade and transport development among the
Southeastern European countries.

The Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (TTFSE 2) was a scale up from TTFSE
1. Building on lessons learned in TTFSE 1 project, TTFSE 2 was intended to go further and
develop comprehensive solutions to address border delays focusing on Bulgaria only instead
of a regional program. Border management improvements were recognized as being equally
important to physical investment. Additionally, regarding political will, the need for a high-
level government commitment was considered essential.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The Original Project Development Objective (PDO) was to facilitate trade by improving the
capacity, efficiency and quality of services at selected EU border crossings with particular
focus on the Trans-European Transport Network.3
Key Outcome Indicators in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were:
 Average border entry and exit times for freight transport at Kapitan Andreevo and
   Kalotina Border Crossing Points (BCPs)
 Customs productivity measured by the average annual number of processed customs
   declarations per customs staff

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
PDO was maintained as originally defined. During the first restructuring in January 2012
(Level 2, approved by the Country Director), more ambitious targets for the key outcome
indicators of “average border entry and exit times for freight transport at Kapitan Andreevo
BCP and Kalotina BCPs” were adopted. This reflected important early achievements in terms
of reductions in border crossing times and a new higher level objective in Bulgaria to join the
Schengen area. The “Customs productivity” target was lowered to account for a change made
in 2011 when Customs added headquarters staff to the base used to calculate the average
declaration per staff (until this point only regional officers had been included in the
calculation)4. This revision was made in order to reflect the change in methodology and did
not really lower the performance target.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary beneficiaries were BCP users including exporters, traders, trucking companies,
tour bus companies, and passenger travelers. Due to the physical improvement of BCPs, up-
to-date equipment, streamlining procedures and better information exchange and cooperation
among various agencies, the time spent crossing BCPs is reduced, which also lower transport
and trade transaction costs. A number of border agencies, such as the Bulgaria National
Customs Agency (NCA) and the Border Police Directories (BPD) were ALSO beneficiaries.
The project contributed to strengthening multi-agency coordination and establishing a
collaborative environment to resolve issues at the border in a more efficient way.
Due to the construction of a new segment of motorway, which bypasses the Kapitan
Andreevo Village, local residents benefited from less traffic disruption, noise, and pollution in
concert with better access to employment, education, and social opportunities.
Rail passengers and freight transporters benefitted from the improved efficiency at the
Bulgaria Railways thanks to the upgraded telecommunication and data transfer system from
the Border Police. Secondary beneficiaries also included the border employees under various

beneficiaries included a much broader group of Bulgarian citizens and Southeastern European
residents who benefit from lower costs of production as a result of a more competitive trade
sector in Bulgaria.

1.6 Revised Components
Two Level 2 Restructurings were undertaken during the implementation.
A First Restructuring was approved by the Country Director in January 2012. The revised
components included:
1) Dropping the reconstruction of Kalotina BCP (originally in the subcomponent 1.1). At the
   time this BCP reconstruction had not started and required additional detailed preparation
   (more details discussed in Section 2.4). The drop was also intended to free fiscal capacity
   to ensure completion at Kapitan Andreevo BCP (subcomponent 1.1) and access road
   (component 2)
2) Replacing small X-ray equipment (originally in subcomponent 1.2) with larger X-ray
   equipment to be used in subcomponent 1.1 and 1.2, due to revised compliance and needs
   from Customs
3) Reallocating funds from subcomponent 3.1 to subcomponent 3.2 due to increased
   involvement of Bulgaria government in Single Payment Window (originally in
   subcomponent 3.1)
A Second Restructuring was approved by the Regional Vice President in November 2013.
The revised components included dropping activities at four small BCPs (originally in

subcomponent 1.2), which had not started and releasing funds to complete Kapitan Andreevo
BCP (subcomponent 1.1)
In summary, due to the two restructurings, two cancellations of EUR 1.4 million and EUR
2.25 took place. Reallocation in disbursement categories was undertaken, as shown in the

1.7 Other Significant Changes
In order to address implementation delays caused by various factors (details in Section 2.2),
the first restructuring extended the closing date by 18 months and the second restructuring
extended the closing date by six months. As a result, the loan closing date was extended by a
cumulative 24 months from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2014. The first restructuring also
revised targets for outcome indicators, as described in the Section 1.3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Given the success of TTFSE 1 project, the government made a strong commitment to
TTFSE 2. The preparation was comprehensive with a relatively long period (three years).




                                               4
Considerable upfront work6 was done before the Project Concept Note review took place in
January 2006. The reviewers’ comments for the PAD Quality Enhancement Review (QER)
meeting, which took place in September 2006, were thorough and most were reflected in the
revised PAD.7 Board approval was secured in March 2007.
Background analysis was sound. Lessons learnt from TTFSE 1 were incorporated into the
design. For example, inter-agency cooperation was considered essential for accomplishing the
objectives. Therefore, the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for Border Control (ISCBC)
and the National Project Coordinator, at the deputy minister of finance level were retained for
TTFSE 2 to coordinate and support the overall project implementation. Experience from a
pilot project in the Lesovo BCP, done by the government, was taken into consideration when
the information sharing system (subcomponent 3.1) was designed. Many concepts discussed
during TTFSE 1 had been agreed to be included in the layout design at Kapitan Andreevo and
Kalotina BCPs (subcomponent 1.1). For example, the joint area for control by border police
and customs, the nearby secondary control areas, the segregation of traffic by type, and the
raised booth, which meant drivers no longer had to get out of their trucks. These features were
all reflected in the implementation and made a positive contribution to the achievement of
project outcomes.
Assessment of the project objectives: The PDO focused on the outcomes and was
responsive to the country’s circumstances and development priorities, and furthered Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategies both at the time of project preparation and implementation,
which included objectives related to supporting Bulgaria’s accession to EU and more efficient
absorption of EU funds, including in the area of infrastructure. The objectives were clear and
important. The main objective was trade facilitation, which is overall broad. However, under
this project context, the trade facilitation can be interpreted as facilitating particular border
crossings. Intermediate outcomes also included improving capacity, improving efficiency, and
improving the quality of service. The PDO for TTSFE 2 was appropriate for the borrower and
implementing agencies. Details are discussed in Section 3.
Assessment of the project design: Trade facilitation projects are complicated as they often
involve multiple agencies with different needs and interests, and techniques, equipment,
facilities and procedures are quite specialized and change over time. Therefore, a
comprehensive design was taken, combining improvements to the physical infrastructure and
equipment, modernization of communication systems for information exchange among border
agencies, and enhanced coordination among stakeholders. Overall, the design was related to
and adequate for achieving the PDO. Removing bottlenecks at BCPs through the
abovementioned approach contributed to achieving the objectives of facilitating trade through
facilitating border crossing, and improving capacity, efficiency, and quality of service.
Moreover, including a new access road to Kapitan Andreevo BCP was important, because it


6
  The original idea was to prepare a regional trade facilitation program like TTFSE 1, covering multiple countries in South
East Europe (SEE). A regional or “Horizontal” Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was considered. After extensive discussions,
it was deemed unfeasible and country-specific projects were pursued
Focus shifted from the rail sector to the road sector during the preparation. In the early stages of preparation, about EUR 35
million out of a total EUR 55 million was being considered to improve railway performance. However, the government
decided not to focus on rail because of “differences in expectations of the benefits that would have been derived fr om the
investment”. (PAD, 2006)
Private sector involvement was an important component at an early design stage. Much effort was made to engage in
dialogue with the private sector in the early design stage with a EUR 1 million grant being considered to support this
component. However, the fund was not secured and this component was dropped prior to appraisal.
7
  For example, the PDO was tightened, the number of indicators was reduced, the indicators were rendered simpler and more
focused, and the risk assessment was justified. Although the team could have been able to incorporate more of the
suggestions from QER reviewers were it not for compressed time frame (5 months) between QER and board approval.

not only resolved congestion in the summer time when heavy truck traffic coincided with
peak passenger travel between Europe and Turkey, but also served to the needs of anticipated
traffic growth in the long run.
The project design responded to the needs of numerous agencies and the deteriorated status of
many BCPs in the country (two large ones in subcomponent 1.1 and 18 small ones in
subcomponent 1.2). Furthermore, the success of TTFSE 1 and the same Project
Implementation Team (PIT), who had demonstrated an ability to implement World Bank
projects, ensured the quality of implementation. The PIT at the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
mitigated the risk of scattered project implementation responsibilities over various border
agencies.
The results framework was well defined with direct linkages between outcome indicators and
the PDO, although it had some weaknesses. Details are presented in Section 2.3. A sound
economic analysis was completed prior to the appraisal. The components had a high
economic rate of return ranging from 15 to 35 percent.
Assessment of risks: The assessment of major risks identified in the PAD was appropriate,
although the delays in overall project implementation probably should have been rated
Substantial or High, given that some of subcomponents were not fully ready prior to the
appraisal. Also there could have been a potential social safeguard risk on relocation of
business facilities at BCPs, although this did not materialize. The mitigation strategy was
sound. However, given many external factors, some identified risks did materialize and proper
actions were taken during the implementation (see analysis in the table 3).

2.2 Implementation
The project was implemented over a total seven-year period with a 24-month extension
beyond the original closing date. The main factors that affected implementation are analyzed
as follows.
Factors outside of the control of government or implementing agencies
The 2008 global financial crisis had a heavy toll and impacted the ability of Ministry of
Finance to fulfill all project counterpart obligations in a short period of time. Government
adopted a budget ceiling on investment projects starting in 2011 and subsequently the
National Budget Law of 2012 significantly reduced budget for all investment operations in
2013, which affected the entire World Bank portfolio performance. Budget allocation for the
Project in 2013 only amounted to EUR 9.3 million which was one third of the needs8. Also,
the contractors for Kapitan Andreevo BCP and access road faced significant financial
difficulties which led to delays in completion of the civil works in 2013.
Frequent changes emanating from new EU membership requirements and an additional goal
of accession to the Schengen Area: The BCP layout designs took much longer to complete as
design parameters had to change responding to the evolving regulations and requirements
from EU as well as to comply with the country’s accession to the Schengen Area. The
regulations for BCPs were further amended even at construction stage and brought more
changes to the organization at Kapitan Andreevo BCP.
Unexpected technical difficulties on the access road: Initial detailed engineering design of the
access road (completed in 2008) significantly increased the construction costs from EUR 10
million9 in the preliminary study to EUR 20 million. A re-design was needed, which took time,
and turned out to be successful resulting in a cost reduction of 40 percent (EUR 7.5 million),
with less disruption to the residents in Kapitan Andreevo Village, and a simpler land-
acquisition process.
Unforeseen weather conditions and floods in winter 2011 and spring 2012 after work had
begun on the access road resulted in some delays.
Archeological chance finds were made within the construction area of the access road in 2012
and in May 2013, also resulting in some delays. Appropriate actions in compliance with the
safeguard policies were undertaken and significant cultural heritage preserved as a result.
Factors generally subject to government control:
The Amendment to the Law for Duty-free Trade was approved in 2008. Consequently, all
duty-free shops and petrol stations were closed and removed from the borders, which helped
the project to avoid potential social safeguard issues (details are discussed in Section 2.4).
The implementation period spanned three Bulgarian parliamentary elections in 2009, 2013,
and 2014. In particular, the government changes in 2009 were substantial and involved a long
transition period (starting in summer 2009 with the restructuring of the new administration
continuing through 2010). An institutional re-organization took place in almost all ministries
and agencies, including the main beneficiary agencies, i.e., RIA, the Customs, the border
police, and MoF. As a result: (i) the inter-ministerial committee ICSBC meetings were
disrupted, (ii) the Directorate of Capital Investment, within MoF which closely supported the
PIT with technical expertise in the bidding procedures and contracts implementation was

    This resulting action was not entirely outside of the control of government.

    The estimate in the appraisal was based on unit rates (in this case, an estimated EUR 3.4 million per km).

                                                                 7
disbanded, and (iii) approval procedures under various authorities were changed and
processing times became longer, e.g. approval of BCP layout plans and construction permits
for Kapitan Andreevo BCP and the access road.
Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
During the first few years of implementation, as a result of slow progress on civil work
contracts, the Bank team and PIT had to make tremendous efforts to streamline processes in
implementing agencies and improve their performance, all of which significantly contributed
to the achievement of key outcome indicators much earlier than expected.
Despite the unstable political environment, the PIT was maintained with its core staff during
the entire period, which ensured continuity and quality of project implementation. The
national coordinator for this project, the Deputy Minister or Secretary General of MoF,
however, changed seven times.
Some beneficiaries such as Customs did not consistently allocate sufficient personnel to
contribute to and supervise the project implementation and also changed their minds several
times as to the priorities.
Other factors: Given the increased government involvement on the Single Payment Window
(SPW)10, the project activities related to the SPW system (originally in component 3.1) were
reduced. The SPW system was implemented by the government in summer 2008. However, in
practice, significant changes were needed 11 to adapt it to the new circumstances, evolving
from the government’s agenda to join the Schengen area. In particular, the border police were
not able to share their system with the rest of the agencies due to the strict security
requirements of EU. Moreover, due to further adjustments to the legislation and the Schengen
inspection in 2010, the SPW was replaced with a new integrated information system, which
raised an issue with the monitoring and evaluation of the project, because the project outcome
indicators collection was based on the SPW. More details are discussed in Section 2.3.
A Midterm Review was conducted in December 2009, four months after the government
elections. It pointed out some obstacles causing implementation delays and summarized the
progress. The ISR ratings for both PDO and Implementation were satisfactory until the
midterm review.
Project Restructurings: Considering the implementation lessons and the additional emphasis
on joining the Schengen Area, the Bank team and PIT acted proactively to restructure the
project twice, both of which were effective. In both cases, the ISR rating for Implementation
Progress was upgraded after restructuring from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately
Satisfactory. The restructurings were responsive to issues raised in the implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
M&E Design Assessment: Overall, the outcome indicators were adequate for evaluating the
PDO’s achievements. The freight entry and exit times at the Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo
BCPs were used to measure the extent to which the PDO objectives were met: facilitating



10
   Given the successful pilot project in the Lesovo BCP in 2006 (which is beyond the scope of the present project), the
Government decided to expand the pilot and allocated EUR 4 million to roll out the Single Payment Window at 11 BCPs
throughout the country.
11
   The Bank team identified challenges including: (i) the system was not user-friendly, as USB cards were introduced for
transfer of information; (ii) an additional stop was created at the Bank booth for users, especially for passenger traffic, who
were not required to pay; (iii) the Border police were not able to share their system with the rest of the agencies considering
the stringent security requirements of EU.

                                                              8
trade (by facilitating border crossing), improving capacity, improving efficiency, and
improving quality of service at the BCPs. The “Customs productivity measured by the
average annual number of processed customs declarations per customs staff” was designed to
measure improved efficiency. However, this indicator was not defined at the BCP level, but at
the national level, which is less effective in capturing the impact of project’s activities.
Nevertheless, it provided a snapshot of overall Customs’ efficiency.
The intermediate indicators are generally useful in monitoring the progress of implementation.
By design, the PIT was responsible for data collection with input from the Customs, the
border police, and the RIA, which was a sound arrangement.
Some shortcomings should be noted. The methodology for collecting freight entry and exit
times and the estimate of the baseline were not well specified in the PAD (2007). However,
the PAD envisioned that the project should be monitored in an automated way through a
seamless integration into existing border agencies’ systems (such as the proposed SPW). Later
when the SPW system was implemented in 2008, an efficient and accurate way of collecting
data was established and the baseline was updated. However, the value of this updated
baseline was higher than that of the baseline estimated in the PAD. Several possible reasons
include that the estimation method became more accurate and that the measuring points differ,
with the SPW probably covering more area than the PAD did.
In addition, the design of the intermediate indicators associated with the x-rays and detailed
inspection should have been further improved.
M&E Implementation Assessment: The Bank team, PIT, and Customs made considerable
efforts to cope with numerous challenges including some significant changes in implementing
M&E. These efforts included consulting with all the stakeholders, reviewing the
methodologies, validating the calculations made by Customs, and providing advice on
processing the results.
Collecting data on the “Customs productivity” was a straightforward matter. However,
collecting the freight processing times was not easy due to the changes in the BCP layout and
the removal of the SPW. More specifically, two main methodologies were used:12
    First Methodology (mid-2008 to mid-2010): After the SPW System was put in place in
     mid-2008, every vehicle was recorded at the time when a flash drive was received
     (activating the Single Payment Process) upon entering the border area, and when payment
     was made to exit. Therefore, the time each vehicle spent at the BCP was recorded in a
     precise way. The baseline was amended in 2008 based on the first four months of data
     collected under this methodology. While the target kept unchanged compared with the
     PAD, i.e., 20 percent reduction from the baseline.
    Second Methodology (mid-2010 to 2014): After the SPW was removed from practice in
     2010, a similar time recording system was developed to report a representative sample
     (7.5 percent) of vehicle arrival and departure times at points close to the collection booths
     used in the SPW system. The second methodology was estimated to be consistent with the
     first methodology. In addition, both the baseline and the target were revised in 2011,
     which was formalized in the first project restructuring.


12
  However, as of March 2014 (three months before the project close), due to the reconstruction of the Kapitan Andreevo
BCP, the collection points for EXIT traffic were no longer available. Therefore, a third methodology (the freight lanes were
observed and the total number of vehicles traveling on them recorded for a specific time period on a representative basis) was
used for March to September 2014 for the Kapitan Andreevo exit traffic, while the other three indicators for crossing time
continued with the second methodology. Given that this method was applied for only a few months and to only Kapitan
Andreevo exit traffic, its impact on the entire M&E was very limited.

                                                              9
Despite the changes in methodology, the outcome indicators were consistently reported
during the implementation. Both collection methodologies were appropriate and the resulting
data was reasonable. However, some of the intermediate indicators, such as the number of
trainings provided to the stakeholders, were not monitored closely and were dropped in the
second restructuring.
M&E Utilization Assessment: M&E was used to assess project progress and was regarded as
an important resource when making decisions on project restructuring. For example, noticing
the earlier achievement of freight processing times, a more ambitious target was set in 2011 to
encourage further improvement. Moreover, Customs considered the indicator measurement to
be a tool to monitor its own performance and thus improve efficiency.
M&E Sustainability: Before the project closed, the Bank team was informed that a video-
surveillance-based system would be introduced in 2015 to enhance security and efficiency at
BCP which would also be used to monitor border-crossing times. This new arrangement
demonstrated an adaptive mode of the key agencies and showed that border agencies realized
the value of monitoring performance and that they made an effort to improve the effectiveness
of their data collection.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards: The access road (component 2) was rated as Category A according to the Bank’s
operational policy guidelines, OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. This component also
required land acquisition, which triggered the bank’s policy OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement.
Because the final alignment of the road was not ready before appraisal, neither the full
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) nor the Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) was required
by the Bank for appraisal. Instead, a satisfactory preliminary EIA, a Terms of Reference for a
full EIA (based on the detailed design), and a Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF)
were prepared and disclosed, and public consultations were held prior to the appraisal. As
recorded in the appraisal documents, it was agreed that the satisfactory EIA and LAP would
be submitted to the Bank before the construction of the road would commence. In addition ,
OP 4.04 Natural Habitats and OP 4.11 Cultural Property were triggered as a precautionary
measure.
The reconstruction of BCPs (component 1.1) was classified as Category B for environmental
assessment purposes. The Environment Management Plans (EMP) were prepared and
disclosed with public consultations prior to the appraisal.
Overall, project implementation was in compliance with the Bank’s environmental and social
safeguards policies and with due diligence documents such as EMP and Resettlement Action
Plans (RAP), although some temporary issues did arise and they were handled appropriately.
For the access road, satisfactory EIA and LAP were developed, cleared, and disclosed. The
land acquisition followed the Bank’s safeguards procedures and LAP. Temporary safeguard
issues include poor waste management on site (resolved in a timely fashion based on
instructions from the supervising engineer), slow land acquisition due to the fact that many
land parcels were owned by multiple owners, as well as delays to land owners in receiving
payments due to administrative burdens, even after all the compensation was deposited in the
accounts of the owners or the district government. Following the Bank’s suggestion, PIT
worked to document and verified the status of the compensation and hired a consultant to
provide administrative, legal, and support services for the owners in order to ensure that they
received compensation in accordance with LAP.
Information available at the time of appraisal indicated that the land on BCPs was publically
owned and as such, in accordance with legislation, no resettlement was necessary for the
                                              10
reconstruction of the BCPs (component 1.1). Therefore the potential relocation of business
facilities (mainly duty-free shops and petrol stations) at the BCPs was not flagged in the PAD,
nor was it specified in the LAPF. Later, during the implementation in 2008, the Bank team
reviewed the applicability of the Bank’s resettlement policy to these business facilities, 13
concluding that “while it would have been appropriate to provide additional information in the
PAD regarding private activities at BCPs, based on information now available, OP 4.12 and
the LAPF do not need to be extended to cover Component 1.1.” This is because Bulgaria
amended the Duty-free Act in June 2008, which forced all duty-free facilities at the external
EU borders to close. Therefore, no direct relationship was evident between the closure of the
duty-free facilities and this project. As a result, OP 4.12 did not apply to these closures.
Regarding the non-border-related businesses (other than the duty-free shops) found at the
Kalotina BCP,14 according to the review, these activities have varying legal status. In fact,
some of the activities were considered illegal. Addressing the relocation of these businesses
would have required developing a complex resettlement action plan in accordance with Bank
requirements. In addition, the Bank team learned that an appeal against the layout plan had
been submitted to the supreme administrative court by persons claiming to have ownership
rights over a small portion of the land in the Kalotina BCP territory (Later the claim was
rejected by the supreme administrative court). The government took into account the need to
minimize possible adverse impacts, to prevent long delays stemming from the appeal and to
free fiscal space for Kapitan Andreevo BCP and access road. Therefore, the reconstruction at
the Kalotina BCP was dropped in 2012. As of December 2014, the plans to reconstruct this
BCP have still not gone ahead.
Fiduciary: PIT within MoF was responsible for all the procurement activities based on the
inputs and technical contributions of various agencies. An assessment of PIT’s capacity to
implement the procurement plan was carried out by the Bank in July 2006. The assessment
was thorough and identified two main issues in regard to PIT’s limited experience procuring
some specialized equipment and the small number of staff given the size of the loan. During
implementation, these issues were addressed by hiring additional staff with relevant
procurement experience. Overall, PIT maintained a core procurement team with strong
procurement experience.
Procurement performance during the implementation phase was satisfactory for most of the
project’s life in reference to the quality of the procurement documentation and procedures.
The procurement performance was found to be consistent with the Bank’s Procurement
Guidelines and with the Legal Agreements. There was no report of non-compliance with the
Bank’s procurement policies and processes. Project implementation was considered
satisfactory in regard to the procurement of goods. The procurement of civil contracts was


13
   In 2008, a detailed review of the applicability of the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard for the BCP component was
conducted. The Bank team requested PIT to carefully review the situation in terms of land ownership and the entitlements of
the owners of duty-free shops and petrol stations at both the Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCPs. The duty-free facilities
had been set up in 1992 by MoF and had only temporary status. They were expected to close in 2002 and become state
property afterwards. Therefore, neither the shops nor the petrol stations had a legal basis for operating after 2002. However,
World Bank OP 4.12 embodies the principle that a lack of legal land title does not disqualify people from resettlement
assistance. Under relevant Bulgarian legislation, discrepancies with this principle were raised. Due to the Amendment of the
Duty-free Law, all the duty-free shops and fuel stations located at the BCPs were closed by MoF in July 2008. The closure of
these facilities was not related to the Bank project; therefore, the land acquisition framework did not apply.
14
   During the April 2008 mission, the Bank team noticed that a number of business facilities were located in the border area
of Kalotina, which could be impacted by the proposed BCP reconstruction. In the June 2009 mission, PIT confirmed that the
Kalotina layout would be revised to avoid the need to relocate certain commercial activities so that the Land Acquisition
Framework need not be applied to the BCP component. However, in the December 2010 mission, the Bank team learned that
Customs had proposed changes to the layout plan, which would involve the displacement of private businesses, some of
which, however, were illegal.

                                                             11
significantly delayed for the reasons discussed in Section 2.2. These issues were addressed
through regular implementation support with the participation of the procurement specialist
from the Bank, on the basis of the Bank’s review and advice on technical issues, and in accord
with regular reviews of and updates to the procurement plan.
The overall financial management risk for the project was considered moderate to low during
the preparation. The review of the financial management and disbursement capacity at PIT
was considered sufficient.
The financial management was rated Satisfactory during the most of the implementation (only
rated Moderately Satisfactory on a few ISRs). The rating for counterpart funding was reduced
to Moderately Unsatisfactory in December 2012 due to significant constraints encountered in
terms of the adequacy of budgetary ceilings. In some cases, the project allocations have been
supplemented through in-year rectifications. Further, a lack of predictability and limited
financing affected planning and contracting, and caused delays in the performance of work
and the disbursement of proceeds from loans.
The financial management system was procured and installed at the very beginning of the
implementation process. Proper training was provided to relevant staff, and proper internal
controls were applied for the project. Quarterly Interim un-audited Financial Reports (IFRs)
of acceptable quality were sent to the Bank as per the deadlines agreed. The project had been
in compliance with the audit covenant and with unmodified (clean) audited project financial
statements submitted annually as per the due dates agreed. The last audit covering 2014 was
shared with the Bank. The draft report has a clean opinion as well and was finalized by
December 2014.
The total original amount of the loan was EUR 40.90 million, reduced to EUR 37.25 due to
loan cancellations from two restructurings. As of November 12, 2014, when the last
transaction was recorded, a total of EUR 33.37 million was disbursed. The outstanding
Designated Account balance was refunded to the Bank, and the account was closed as of
October 31, 2014. The remaining amount of EUR 3.88 million was cancelled. The loan was
closed on November 12, 2014.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The Kapitan Andreevo BCP is fully operational as a substantially improved facility, despite
the fact that the contract was at 85 percent as of December 2014 with only ancillary works
pending (details are discussed in Annex 2). While the outstanding sites are still expected to be
fully completed, the construction delays have required much attention from the implementing
agency. Considering the government’s commitment on accession to the Schengen area, there
is great certainty that government will continue developing this BCP as well as other key
BCPs in the country to ensure they are in compliance with EU requirements. For example, in
anticipation of further traffic growth, a physical expansion is probably still needed at Kalotina
BCP in order to maintain the reduced freight-processing time.
The achievement of targets in reducing freight processing time at Kapitan Andreevo and
Kalotina BCPs shows that Bulgaria’s border crossing has evolved from a very slow system in
the 1990s to a greatly improved border system. Further improvements are still possible but
now the main challenge is to maintain the improvements with a higher degree of security as
required by EU for accession into Schengen.




                                               12
The new terminal at Svilengrad is fully completed and Customs is in the process of furnishing
the terminal to make it operational. The road has been put into operation15 since August 2014
and its ownership will now be transferred to the RIA including maintenance responsibility.
The equipment purchased under the project by the border agencies is in use. All the related
staff training was completed. The M&E system is likely to be continued based on a new
video-surveillance system, which will be in place in 2015. No follow up operation with the
Bank has been discussed.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
The Assessment of Outcomes is rated as Satisfactory. The original PDO was maintained
but the targets of the outcome indicators, including freight processing times, were changed
during the first restructuring (level 2) in 2012. As a result, a split rating should be applied
when assessing the outcomes. Although it is usual for targets to be lowered, in this project the
targets were actually made more ambitious to reflect early achievement and to further
incentivize project performance. Therefore, when the final measurements reported in this ICR
show that the revised targets were met, this means that the original targets were also met.
Given that the overall outcome against the revised targets is rated as Satisfactory (for details
refer to next Sections 3.1 to 3.4), the overall outcome against the original targets is also rated
as Satisfactory. When the split rating method is applied, the weighted outcome is still
Satisfactory (see table 4).

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The overall Relevance is rated as Substantial.
Relevance of Objectives (Rating: High) TTFSE 2 project supported trade facilitation and
Bulgaria’s integration into EU by enhancing the regional road corridor, removing the
bottlenecks at the BCPs, strengthening border management, facilitating trade and harmonizing
standards and regulations with EU. These objectives were highly consistent and supportive of
national strategies to improve infrastructure for better connectivity with Europe. Bulgaria’s
development strategies gave a high priority to the increased efficiency of road transport,
customs, and trade. These included Bulgaria’s National Strategy for Integrated Infrastructure
Development for 2006–2015 and the Bulgarian Strategy on Integrated Border Management.
The project also contributed to two national priorities: development of key infrastructure for
sustained economic growth and achievement of macroeconomic stability by facilitating

although no flooding occurred during the first spring after completion in 2014.

international trade. Moreover, the project supported ongoing Bulgaria’s efforts to accede to
the Schengen area.
This project also contributed to the second and third pillars of the World Bank’s latest
Country Partnership Strategy for Bulgaria (2011–2013): Strategies and Institutions to
Accelerate EU Funds Absorption and Provide Complementary Financing to the EU Funds. In
particular, EU grants were used to fund an Integrated Border Management (IBM) program,
focusing on passenger control at the border, whereas TTFSE2 project was designated to
supplement the EU funds and improve the flow of goods. The project improved coordination
among various agencies and strengthen the institutions’ capacity with the goal of accelerating
the absorption of EU funds.
Through this operation, the Bank offered assistance that is responsive to changing needs, and
the operation remained important to achieving the country’s and Bank’s development
objectives. Therefore, the rating for relevance of objectives is high.
Relevance of Design and Implementation (Rating: Substantial) The design of the
components was effective in achieving the PDO. Details are discussed in the Section 2.1. The
implementation arrangement is also appropriate. The overall quality of the results framework
was good. Shortcomings regarding incomplete specification of the data collection
methodology in the PAD, were overcome. Also, data collection required change of
methodologies during the implementation. Details are discussed in the Section 2.3. The
linkage between the outcome indicators and the PDO is substantial, which means that the
outcome indicators collected during the implementation were sufficient to evaluate PDO
achievement.
During the implementation, project activities were justified according to the evolving priority
changes and the new requirement for Schengen. With two Level 2 restructurings, the project
remained relevant to the objectives. Therefore, the rating for relevance of design and
implementation is substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The achievement of the PDO (Efficacy) is rated as Substantial.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to facilitate trade by improving the capacity,
efficiency and quality of services at selected EU border crossings with particular focus on the
Trans-European Transport Network.
The main objective to be assessed is “trade facilitation.” There are also three additional
intermediate outcomes: “improving capacity,” “improving efficiency,” and “improving the
quality of services,” that must also be assessed. In addition, achieving the intermediate
outcomes directly contributes to the achievement of the main objective.
Assessment of Trade Facilitation: Trade facilitation is a broad concept. Under this project
context, and inferring from the key outcome targets 16, trade facilitation was interpreted as
facilitating border crossings and assessed by the outcome indicators freight processing times
at Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCPs.
As discussed in Section 2.3, freight processing times were collected mainly under two
methodologies. Despite earlier concerns regarding consistency between the two measuring
methodologies, all targets were met during both periods except one - Kalotina exit time under
the first methodology (details are presented in the table 5). More specifically, under the first

16
     Following approach outlined in the OPCS ICR guideline (July 2014 version), page 33.

                                                             14
methodology (2008-2010), the freight processing times were reduced from 88 minutes to 58
minutes (34 percent reduction) for Kapitan Andreevo entry, from 105 minutes to 69 minutes
(35 percent reduction) for Kapitan Andreevo exit, from 79 minutes to 74 minutes (7 percent
reduction) for Kalotina entry, from 112 minutes to 73 minutes (35 percent reduction) for
Kalotina exit. Such a substantial achievement was mainly due to significant institutional and
capacity-building efforts, including instituting streamlined procedures, inter-agency
cooperation, and information and data sharing through the Single Payment Window system.
This was consistent with experience from other trade facilitation projects: the institutional and
capacity building through improved procedures, cooperation, and information exchange was
equally important as physical improvements made to the infrastructure. Table 7 summarizes
specific outputs associated with Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina BCPs which contributed to
the reduced processing time and to the achievement of outcome indicators during this period
(even before the reconstruction started).
Similarly, under the second methodology (2010-2014), freight processing times were reduced
from 57 minutes to 44 minutes (23 percent reduction) for Kapitan Andreevo entry, from 61
minutes to 13 minutes (78 percent reduction) for Kapitan Andreevo exit, from 61 minutes to
31 minutes (49 percent reduction) for Kalotina entry, from 57 minutes to 24 minutes (58
percent reduction) for Kalotina exit. Given that the reduction target was met in both periods,
the reduction in freight processing time is considered achieved.
It should be noted that at Kalotina BCP the reconstruction was dropped in the first
restructuring in 2012, yet the freight-processing time continued to decrease. This indicates
that the early activities associated with the institutional and capacity building efforts were
sustained at the current traffic and physical capacity level.

  The last measurement (April-September 2014) for exit only at Kapitan Andreevo BCP used a third methodology as
described in Section 2.3. The consistency of this new methodology with the previous ones is not yet confirmed. However,
note that the result is significantly (75 percent) lower than the target. Moreover, the last measurement under the second
methodology (Oct. 2013–Mar. 2014) was 35, below the target of 52.

                                                            15
Overall, this trade facilitation objective was achieved through the following main project
outputs (details discussed in Annex 2): (i) component 1.1 reduced processing times at the two
main BCPs through improved infrastructure (Kapitan Andreevo), and modern equipment (at
both BCPs) such as X-ray scanner, which significantly reduced time for detailed custom
examination, (ii) component 1.2 improved effectiveness of the custom control activities at
small BCPs, (iii) component 2 resulted in reduction of the travel time due to higher speed on
the motorway compared to the previous 2-lane rural road. More importantly, the new road
segregated heavy traffic with passenger cars using the bypass and provided adequate traffic
management entering and exiting the border area, (iv) component 3.1 achieved information
share between various border agencies, which reduced processing times and improved
efficiency and quality of service, (v) component 3.2 communication system enhanced the
efficiency of Border Police when processing international trade and transport documents as
well as improved safety and security control, and (vi) improved coordination and
communication among the border agencies helped decision making to resolve issues raised in
the border operation in a timely and cooperative manner.
Furthermore, there were more “qualitative” outputs such as streamlined procedures at various
border agencies, a reduced number of agencies at borders, and consolidated responsibilities,
which significantly contributed to facilitating border crossings. These “qualitative” outputs
also contributed some directly and others indirectly, to the achievement of the intermediate
outcomes of improved capacity, improved efficiency, and improved quality of service. An
overall evaluation is presented in the table 6.

A new weighting scale was installed at the Kalotina BCP Yes              indirectly Yes      Yes
so that each direction had its own scale. In comparison,
trucks from both directions used to share one scale, which
created a lot of traffic conflict and congestion at the
border. Moreover, with improved technology, only one
stop was needed for the freight vehicles to be weighted.
Given the above quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the objective of trade facilitation,
through facilitating border crossing, is considered achieved.
Assessment of Improved Capacity: Capacity is interpreted in the project as the physical
capacity of the BCPs and as institutional capacity. The physical capacity can be quantitatively
measured as a function of freight processing time and the number of processing lanes. Given
that the number of processing lanes was increased at Kapitan Andreevo BCP and stayed the
same at Kalotina BCP, as long as the processing time was reduced (already confirmed),
capacity was increased (achieved). On the other hand, institutional capacity was strengthened
through enhanced coordination among various agencies, information sharing, improved
communication, and streamlined procedures. Therefore, it is considered that the goal of
improved capacity is achieved.
Assessment of Improved Efficiency: Efficiency can be more or less assessed based on the
outcome indicator of Customs productivity. The result for the last 12 months is only 2%
below the target. It should be noted that this national average indicator should be the lower
bound for the Customs productivity at Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCPs, because large
BCPs are often operated in a much more efficient way than small BCPs are, where traffic is
limited but a certain number of staff members must still be maintained. Therefore, it is
considered that the goal of improved efficiency is achieved.
Assessment of Improved Quality of Service: The reduced processing time at the BCPs and
increased efficiency certainly improved the quality of service. The “qualitative” aspects listed
in the table 5 and 6 also provided evidence that improvements were made in terms of quality

                                              17
of service. Although there is no direct quantitative indicator, improvements in regard to
quality of service is achieved.

3.3 Efficiency
The Efficiency is rated as Substantial.
After the project closed, an ex-post economic analysis was performed in November 2014 to
evaluate the economic return of the project based on the same methodology used at appraisal
stage. A detailed analysis is included in Annex 3.
Considering only the costs and benefits for component 1.1 Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina
BCP, the component 2 access road, and the component 3.2 communication system for the
border police, the resulting economic indicators for the ex-post analysis are: (i) Net Present
Value (NPV) is EUR 24.5 million (evaluated at a discount rate of 12 percent) and (ii)
Economic Internal Rate of Return is 29.7 percent.
The economic analysis provided in the PAD (Table 8) did not report an overall project NPV
or EIRR and instead reported results for each component separately. The comparable NPV
provided in the PAD was EUR 24.16 million.
                      Table 8. Economic Analysis by Component in the PAD
 Economic Analysis in the PAD                       NPV @ 12% (Million EUR)        EIRR
 1.1.Kalotina, Kapitan Andreevo, and 2. access road 21.88                          23.08%
 3.2 Communication system for border police         2.28                           24.3%
                                         Total NPV 24.16
The EIRR in the ex-post analysis (29.7 percent) is higher than the EIRR in the PAD (about 24
percent). The ex-post NPV (24.5 million) is also slightly higher than the NPV calculated in
the PAD (24.16 million). In addition, the actual cost of the access road which was about 15
percent higher, reflecting a normal range of cost contingencies for a road construction project.
Therefore, efficiency is rated as Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Given the Substantial rating on all three criteria (Relevancy, Efficacy, and Efficiency), the
rating of Overall Outcome is Satisfactory. Overall the project achieved more than the stated
PDO. Through this project, the Bank had a very fruitful policy dialogue with government on
trade facilitation and border management, and helped various agencies to develop and
substantially improve institutional capacity, which were essential for Bulgaria to meet high
requirements from EU and Schengen.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project had an indirect positive impact on the poor. Trade facilitation reduced the cost of
goods and thus benefits consumers, especially poor people. The access road benefits local
communities by improving their access to jobs and other social features.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The major institutional strengthening impacts generated by the project were: (i) improved
communication between the border agencies and enhanced inter-agency cooperation for
border management, (ii) streamlined of procedures at the various border agencies, and
reduced number of agencies at border and consolidated responsibilities (iii) transparency of

                                              18
border operations improved due to the data sharing system, and (v) increased Customs’
efficiency through performance monitoring system.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Archeological sites were found within the construction area of access road in 2012 and 2013.
Appropriate actions were taken to preserve the culture and salvage the remains. Good efforts
had been made to highlight historical and national heritage sites such as the remains of the
ancient road Via Diagonalis, which connected the two continents Europe and Asia from
ancient times, is now considered as a symbolic discovery and link at the largest land BCP.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not conducted. Given the construction at Kapitan Andreevo BCP was still ongoing and
summer was also peak travel season, it was decided not to conduct beneficiary surveys for
this ICR. However, it is recommended that such a study should be considered after the full
completion of Kapitan Andreevo BCP in 2015.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The development outcome is expected to be maintained after project completion because most
of the investments, including physical reconstruction of the BCP, procured equipment and
border re-organization will remain after the project closure. The main challenge is to maintain
the processing and operational achievements at an adequate standard including security levels
required to access into Schengen area. Since the PIT was created for the project
implementation, its operation is expected to cease at the end of 2014. A key issue is to ensure
that PIT’s knowledge, records and project experience are passed on to MoF and other
institutions (especially the border agencies).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project preparation was comprehensive, and the Bank team undertook much upfront work
to shape a follow-up regional program, to develop a substantial component in the rail sector,
and to promote private sector involvement. However, the priority shifted to an individual
country program with a focus on the two largest BCPs in the country and an access road. The
change was responsive to client’s urgent needs in upgrading the BCPs to meet requirements
from EU, which was logical at the time of preparation. The PDO that the Bank team
developed was responsive to the country’s needs and contributed to the Bank’s CPS. The
component design was sufficient to achieve the PDO. The risk assessment was appropriate
and mitigation was useful to a certain degree. It was not possible, after all, for the team to
anticipate the evolving border regulation changes, the economic crisis, or the unstable
political environment, which did arise in the implementation.
Some weaknesses in the preparation can be identified. For example, the potential implications
of the relocation of the duty-free shops and petrol stations could have been scoped in greater
detail before the appraisal. The M&E system could have been better prepared and
documented in the PAD. For the three main civil works layout plans for two BCPs were not
completed and only a preliminary study with six alternative alignments for the access road
were available before the appraisal. The team had partial information to assess the total time
                                              19
to complete design finalization, social assessment and the necessary permits that would allow
starting the civil work contracts in Bulgaria. As a result the early procurement plan was
probably optimistic. Nevertheless, these issues were addressed and did not result in
substantial delays in the project implementation, or impacted on the achievement of the PDO.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Supervision was very regular and intensive. During seven years of implementation, 14
supervision missions were conducted. Aide memoires and ISRs were sufficiently detailed.
The two restructuring packages were well prepared and prevented further delays.
The supervision team was proactive in regard to its use of resources and its effort in dealing
with the many disruptions to ensure results and delivery. The coordination between various
border agencies was difficult and implementing such a complex project in an unstable
political and economic environment was challenging. However, the supervision team and PIT
worked closely together to tackle issues raised during implementation. In particular, under the
supervision team’s guidance, the redesign of the access road was successful and significantly
reduced the cost for this component. The careful review of the applicability of Bank’s
resettlement policy for the BCP component was appropriate. The supervision team inclusion
of Sofia based specialists during the last four years, was effective and provided hands-on
assistance to the borrower. Furthermore, the supervision team maintained active policy
dialogue on border management and trade facilitation issues, which had an impact beyond the
investments in infrastructure and goods.
The team could have been more proactive in handling challenges in M&E and been more
careful in M&E reporting in the ISR and restructurings. The team could have explored more
opportunities for dissemination and training for the stakeholders.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In general, the Government and agencies ensured quality of preparation and implementation.
During the project preparation phase, the government demonstrated a strong commitment to
the follow-up trade project. The government established the PIT within MoF to avoid
scattered responsibilities in various agencies and wisely selected the PIT who was
experienced with Bank projects. The project was prepared in response to emerging needs of
EU accessions and the design is highly relevant to the government’s priority.
The most successful element of the government performance was the ability to bring all
stakeholders together, not only in the formalized body of the inter-ministerial committee on
border issues, but also on a working level to ensure their contributions to the achievement of
the project objectives. The government also complied with all legal covenants under the
project and ensured compliance with the Bank safeguards procedures. In response to the fiscal
constraints in 2012, the government was able to prioritize and deliberate shift from several
BCPs to fewer BCPs to increase chance for the undergoing civil contracts to be completed
and the PDO to be achieved, which was a good move.
During the seven-year period of implementation, many changes took place in the political and
economic environment including the new EU membership, the preparation for accession to
Schengen area, the government elections, and the global economic crisis. The substantial

                                              20
government changes and the long transition period due to the 2009 election, and the budget
ceilings in 2012 caused major implementation delays. In addition, during the two
restructurings, the Bank team suggested that a longer period might be needed in order to fully
close the project.19 The Government did not take Bank’s advice. At closing the major contract
at Kapitan Andreevo BCP was substantially operational but, ancillary facilities could not be
fully completed. The government also decided to drop reconstruction of Kalotina and other
small BCPs in order to free fiscal space for Kapitan Andreevo BCP and access road. The
reduced scope of activities did not have a negative impact on the achievement of PDO.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The PIT demonstrated the ability to implement the trade facilitation project in an unstable
political and economic environment. Coordination among the various agencies was
challenging, especially given the frequent changes in their administration and working group.
The National Project Coordinator was also changed many times, which did not allow for
consistent management. The budget ceiling was a significant matter of uncertainty during the
project implementation phase.
Despite all these factors, the PIT manager and core members stayed in the entire seven years,
which ensured consistency and quality of implementation. The PIT handled well contract
implementation, loan management, procurement, disbursement, and quarterly reporting of the
project. In addition, the capacity building and training of the staff were effective.
The PIT was responsive and effective in resolving emerging issues raised during the
implementation. For example, the PIT made extensive information collection efforts to clarify
and support the compliance with the World Bank’s social safeguard policies as part of the
BCP reconstruction component, as well as to provide resettlement assistance to the affected
land owners. When additional expertise was needed, the PIT followed the Bank’s suggestion
to hire specialized consultants, which turned out to be sufficient.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned
Trade and transport facilitation projects require very clear leadership and proactive
coordination between the various agencies on the Borrower’s side as well as with the Bank.
Institutional and capacity building through improved procedures, cooperation, and
information exchange is equally important as physical improvements made to the
infrastructure. As noted in the Borrower’s ICR, TTFSE 2 implementation helped improve
inter-institutional cooperation (building on TTFSE 1) as the project structure created ceaseless
coordination and cooperation with the Border agencies, RIA, and other ministries and
institutions involved with the project.
Upgrading of BCPs requires careful attention to planning of land expropriation during
preparation and design including proper baseline surveys. The project coincided with the
Amendment of the Duty Free Trade Law which forced all duty-free shops and petrol stations
at the border to close in 2008 allowing the project to resolve the legal requirements related to
land acquisition.


19
  For example, instead of 18 months, 24 months might have been a more realistic timeframe for the first restructuring, and
instead of 6 months, 9 to 12 months might have been more appropriate for the second restructuring.


                                                            21
Detailed design is needed during project preparation to better assess the financing and project
requirements. As indicated in TTSFE 1, preparation lead time for civil works is relatively
long in Bulgaria requiring a significant level of coordination among the relevant stakeholders.
This project also shows that the time needed to advance the design to construction and
complete construction can really take long time, especially under difficult political and
economic environment.
Adequate attention to M&E of processing times is essential to evaluate large investments
needed to enhance BCP performance. Also, impact of such investments often requires a
relative long gestation periods. A medium term evaluation is more appropriate.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
Comments received from PIT on December 18, 2014, included
“Thank you for the final draft of ICR. We reviewed the document very carefully and
discussed within the PIT. Conclusions were made. We accept the final draft of the ICR with
minor corrections for more clearness20.
We corrected the amounts in the last tables (part of the Borrower report) to be consistent with
the Auditor’s report after cancellation of undisbursed portion of the Loan and closure of the
Designated Account in the Bulgarian National Bank. We clarified as well that the draft audit
report was finalized by mid December 2014.
Another clarification is made regarding the inter agency cooperation and work of the Inter
ministerial Committee on Border Crossing Issues. Our opinion is that the cooperation between
border agencies during Project Implementation was very good in spite of complex project
design and time consuming coordination of ToRs, designs and other issues requiring common
decisions.
The next point is the assessment of the Bank team regarding challenges in implementing
Single Payment Window. During use of Single Payment Window the Bank team was very
active and helpful in providing advices and ideas how to improve the work. When the
decision for decommissioning of the System was taken by the Government the Bank team
helped the Customs to accommodate available methodology for M&E.”

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Improvement of Physical Capacity and Working Conditions at Selected European
Union External Border Crossings with Particular Focus on the Trans-European Transport Network
Subcomponent 1.1. Upgrading the infrastructure and equipment at Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina
border crossing points; and establishing a new customs terminal at Svilengrad
(i) Infrastructure
  A layout plan for the Kapitan Andreevo BCP was developed and approved by the National Expert
 Council on Spatial Planning at Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works (MRDPW), in
 November 2010. Technical design was completed in February 2012. Construction Permit which was
 issued in October 2012. The layout plan and technical design were amended in 2013 to reflect the
 additional requirements of the Border Agencies due to Schengen requirements. Works started in
 October 2012. Due to different reasons, works were delayed and could not be completed in their full
 scope before the project closing date (June 30, 2014). As of December 2014, the progress with the
 reconstruction is at about 85 percent. The main features of the renovated BCP are listed below in
 summary. Six sites (in italic) are still not completed.

  Parking lots;
  New fence;
As strongly recommended by the World Bank during the November 2013 mission, all efforts of MoF
and PIT were directed at completion of “Phase 1” of the reconstruction, which would allow putting
into operation of the main reconstructed part of the BCP, along with the newly constructed access road.
This would have significant impact on further reducing the border processing times for freight and for
light traffic and allow achievement of the PDO targets. “Phase 1” was completed and operational by
November 2014.
  A layout plan for the Kalotina BCP was developed and approved by the National Expert Council
 on Spatial Planning at MRDPW in February 2011. With the first Project restructuring, Kalotina BCP
 reconstruction was dropped and preparation of design was abolished.
  A layout plan for the Customs Terminal at Svilengrad was approved by the Expert Council at the
 Municipality in 2009. Contract for works was signed in September 2012. Works started in the
 beginning of 2013 and completed in June 2014. A taking over certificate was signed and it is
 expected that the Customs terminal will be put into operation in November 2014.
(ii) Equipment
 Reconstruction and modernization of lighting system for the areas of border checks point at
Kapitan Andreevo BCP was implemented in the end of 2006.
 Systems for border area and traffic video monitoring were put into operation at Kapitan Andreevo
and Kalotina BCPs in July 2007.
 A new Step-down Transformer was built at Kapitan Andreevo BCP and is in operation since 2007.
 Four minivans were delivered at Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina BCPs for the Border Police
mobile control units along corridors IV and VII in November 2008
 Four stationary surveillance thermo vision systems were delivered at Kapitan Andreevo and
Kalotina BCPs in April 2009
 Two sets of large portable X-Ray inspection systems for Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina BCPs
was delivered in December 2012
Subcomponent 1.2. Improving the NCA infrastructure and equipment at selected European Union
external border crossing points and internal NCA terminals
(i) Infrastructure
  Construction of a new warehouse at the Vidin TIR Terminal was completed in May 2010.
  Reconstruction of the Customs building at Port Svishtov was completed in October 2010.
  Between March 2012 and March 2013, feasibility studies and technical designs were prepared for
 four small BCPs, Bregovo, Vryshka Chuka, Zlatarevo and Logodaj. With the second Project
 restructuring, these BCPs were dropped from the project and no further activities were carried out.
(ii) Equipment
  The following equipment was delivered at various BCPs for the needs of Customs:
  Drug testing equipment (96 drug field testing kits) was delivered in September 2009.
  Electronic scales, including 1 electronic weighing bridge up to 50 tons, 12 electronic scales up to
 500 kg and 14 electronic scales up to 10 kg were delivered in November 2009.

 included in each set) were delivered in November 2009.
  Three terminal tractors and 3 semitrailers for containers were delivered at ports Burgas and Varna
 in February 2010.
  Outboard engines (6 pieces) were delivered in November 2010.

                                                 25
  Large relocatable X-Ray inspection systems (2 sets) were delivered at port Burgas and port Varna
 in December 2012.

Component 2: Construction of the Access Road to Kapitan Andreevo Border Crossing Point
(i) Social and environment safeguards aspects
  A Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan were
 carried out prior to appraisal.
  During project implementation, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared. The
 Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was updated. Land Acquisition Policy Framework (LAPF)
 and Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) were prepared.
  From March to August 2013, rescue archaeological survey of site "Hauza" along the roadbed was
 carried out by NIAM and findings from the ancient Roman road “Via Diagonalis” were discovered.
 After series of discussions on the possible and technically viable means for preservation and
 exposition of the findings, the Ministry of Culture agreed that the ancient road “Via Diagonalis” will
 be exhibited on the roadbed of the access road.
  In 2014 small works for construction of a culvert at Kalamitsa River (in the area of the access
 road) were carried out. The culvert was executed on request of the inhabitants and Mayor of Kapitan
 Andreevo village to ensure villagers’ free access to the agricultural lands at the other side of the river.
(ii) Road construction
  A detailed technical design was carried out in 2008. An optimization of the technical design was
 made and final alignment with a different entry in the BCP was selected in 2009, in order to avoid
 expropriation of a number of physical structures (fuel stations) and significantly reduce the cost.21
 The construction of the access road was started in September 2011 and was completed in November
 2013. Taking over certificate was signed in the December 2013. The road was opened for the traffic
 in August 2014.

Component 3. Enhancing Sharing of Relevant Border Crossing Data and Streamlining Operational
Procedures of Border Crossing Agencies
Subcomponent 3.1. Enhancing exchange of information between border agencies at border crossing
points
  With support from the project, a Single Payment Window (SPW) system was implemented by the
 government in mid-2008 at 11 external EU BCPs, which led to better revenue collection and reduced
 corruption at the border. However, since July 2010, the SPW system was replaced by the integrated
 information system. Supply and installation of booths and other supplementary infrastructure required
 for the Single Payment Window was completed in May 2008. Necessary supervision services were
 provided by the selected consultant in 2008 till mid-2009.
Subcomponent 3.2. Extending the TETRA digital trunk communication system to additional border
crossing points
(i) TETRA system
  The extension of the existing TETRA digital trunk communication system of the Ministry of
 Interior was completed in November 2009. The equipment comprised of 8 TETRA Radio Base
 Stations, 1 TETRA Switch, 10 Digital Radio Relay Systems and 15 TETRA Data Radio. The Supply
 and configuration of TETRA radio terminals and licenses (2200 portable, 340 mobile and 10
 stationary radio terminals and 2 600 licenses) was completed in December 2009, which enabled better
 exchange of information between Border Agencies.



21
  This was achieved through: (i) downscaling the road standards between the interchange and the BCP to a four lane road
instead of a motorway; (ii) adjusting the connection with the BCP to avoid resettlement of fuel stations; (iii) potential use of
soil in situ for embankment after treatment after additional technical review of soil characteristics

                                                               26
(ii) Other equipment
  Supply and installation of 4 PABX equipment was completed in March 2010.
  Twenty passenger motor vehicles were delivered for the needs of the Border Police mobile control
 units along corridors IV and VII in November 2008.
  OCR Equipment for passports and other documents checking was delivered in December 2008
  Documents checking equipment (zoom stereo microscopes, digital cameras, criminal suitcases,
 gas detectors, portable kits for documents checking, narcotic identification sets and video spectral
 comparators) was delivered in December 2008.
  Mobile checking equipment (70 mobile PCs, 60 rugged mobile and portable PCs, desktop PCs,
 multifunctional color printers / scanners / copiers, UPS and other) was delivered in April 2009.

Component 4. Capacity Building and Support to Project Implementation
Subcomponent 4.1. Enhancing the capacity of the trade community
  Project Launch Workshop was held in September 2007 in Sofia with representatives of all border
 agencies and beneficiaries. Main topics included the project implementation arrangements,
 procurement, financial management, project performance indicators and environmental impact and
 land acquisition aspects (environmental and social safeguards). Experts from the World Bank and PIT
 members made presentations.
  A seminar on “Customs Agents, Shipping Agents and Warehouse Holders – Approved Economic
 Operators in accordance with the changes in the Customs Legislation” was held at the Park Hotel
 Moscow in December 2007. The seminar was attended by about 70 representatives of NCA, shipping
 companies, economic operators, customs brokers and other representatives.
  In November 2008 and April 2009 representatives of MOF, Ministry of State Administration and
 State Reform, border agencies and designers attended two study tours to foreign BCPs (“Vysne
 nemecke” at Slovakia-Ukraine border and “Obrežje” at Croatian-Slovenian border).
Subcomponent 4.2. Supporting the PIT in connection with Project implementation
  The financial management of the project was implemented through the same accounting software
 (PAIS) which was used for the first TTFSE project. It was upgraded by the software provider in April
 2007 and approved by the World Bank.
  Independent auditors for the Project were selected and appointed in August 2007, i.e. within three
 months after Effective Date. The original auditor was changed and a new contract was awarded in
 June 2012. Auditors carried out their work in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing
 and issued clean (unmodified) audit opinions on the project financial statements for each fiscal year.
 All audit reports were presented to the World Bank and found acceptable.
  An additional procurement specialist and an additional accountant for PIT were appointed, in July
 2007 and October 2008 respectively, to increase the PIT’s capacity in financial management and
 procurement. Due to the big volume of goods to be procured, in April 2009 one more procurement
 specialist joined the PIT.
  During the Project implementation PIT members continuously improved their qualification
 attending: (i) Seminars on Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Selection and
 Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (April 2008 - Sofia, December 2008 and
 October 2010 - Zagreb); and (ii) Joint Financial Management and Disbursement Workshop for World
 Bank financed projects (January 2011 –Tirana).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1. Review of the Economic Analysis Conducted in the Appraisal Stage
1.1 Identified benefits and summary of economic analysis results
The economic evaluation done in 2006 covered components 1, 2 and subcomponent 3.2, which
combined represent 92% of project cost, in accordance to the PAD.
Decrease of the border crossing time for the freight traffic as a result of the investments was expected
in major BCPs at Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo under component 1.1 and 2. In other small BCPs
under component 1.2, most of the benefits came from the reduced processing time for passenger traffic
and/or from saved time for freight vehicles subject to detailed customs examination. In addition, the
link between the trade facilitation, trade expansion, and customs revenue collection was conservatively
assumed at 20% of additional transport benefits.
The implementation of sub-component 3.2 was expected to have immediate impact on the
improvement of the border police safety and security control. The reduction of the border police
checks duration at BCPs covered by the system, i.e. Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina (road), Svilengrad
and Dimitrovgrad SR/Kalotina (rail), were the only possible transport benefit identified in relation to
this component 3.2.
Table 1 shows the economic analysis results included in the PAD. The analysis was done by separate
components and BCPs. There was no overall project EIRR. The EIRR was ranged 14% to 34%. The
overall NPV was EUR 27.12 million.

        other equipment related to the new facilities to be constructed: 100% completion in 2008
      Annual maintenance costs: 5% of investment costs for civil works
      Additional labour costs for BCPs with improved capacity (number of lanes, boots, etc.)
1.3 One more economic analysis carried out during the implementation
The economic analysis for the X-Ray scanning equipment for BCP of Varna, Burgas, Kapitan
Andreevo, and Kalotina was conducted in 201023 separately at each BCP and for all sites as a whole.
The reference period was 10 years according to the life cycle of the X-Ray equipment.
The projected performance of the X-Ray equipment was based on the data collected from the
application of mobile X-Ray scanner installed for one month at Varna BCP. The assumption regarding
the Do Nothing case was that the current situation would persist, i.e. the share of the freight units to
undergo Detailed Custom Examination shall be as follows:

      Kapitan Andreevo BCP – 0.14%
      Kalotina BCP – 0.35%
      Port of Varna West – 1.09%
      Port of Burgas – 1.56%.
Regarding With Project case, it was assumed that only 0.4% of the scanned freight units shall be
checked manually, which corresponds to 0.108% of the total units.
Additional assumptions made were as follows:
      Traffic growth of 8% per annum for all the four BCPs
      The duration of Detailed Custom Examination in Do Nothing case was 8 hours in Varna, 7 hours
       in Kapitan Andreevo, 6 hours in Burgas and 5 hours in Kalotina
      The duration of check with the X-Ray scanned was assumed to be 10 min at all the BCPs
      Average direct legitimate trade costs: € 200 for Varna, € 75 for Kapitan Andreevo, € 275 for
       Burgas and € 120 for Kalotina24.
The economic indicators of proposed activities showed the following results:
       NPV @ 12% EUR 2.9 million
       EIRR 18.3%.
2. Ex-Post Analysis
The loan agreement had been revised through two restructurings in January 2012 and in November
2013. As result the following main interventions were cancelled:
           Reconstruction of Kalotina BCPs (part of C 1.1) and
           Improvement of the Border Crossing Infrastructure for Customs at the four small BCPs
            located on the west border of Bulgaria (Bregovo, Vrashka chuka, Logodazh and Zlatarevo).

The main results of the loan restructuring, which impact the economic performance indicators of
TTFSE 2 project, are the following:
   Reduction of costs allocated to C1 due to drop of Kalotina, and 4 small BCPs
   Increased costs for C2 access road, which is in normal range of civil works
   Reallocation of funds from C3.1 to C3.2 due to increased involvement of Bulgaria government in
    activities C3.1, Single Payment Window

2.1 Expected Benefits
The expected benefits for component 1 are (i) component 1.1 reduced processing time for freight
vehicles at the two main BCPs due to modern infrastructure and equipment; (ii) component 1.2
improved effectiveness of the custom control activities at small BCPs. The immediate result was lower
transportation costs for freight vehicles. Trade expansion resulting from the shorter transportation time
and from the improved quality and security of the customs control was expected as indirect economic
benefit.
The component 2 would result in reduction of the travel time due to higher speed on the motorway
compared to the speed on 2-lane rural road. More importantly, the new road segregates heavy traffic
with passenger cars using bypass, and provides adequate traffic management entering and exiting the
border area. The access road was considered together with component 1 in the ex-ante economic
analysis. The ex-post evaluation adopts the same procedure.
The objective of component 3.2 is to improve the efficiency of Border Police when processing
international trade and transport documents. The reduction of waiting time result from this component
is part of the total reduction of waiting time and shall not be considered separately.
Even though TTFSE 2 project is not focussed on facilitation of passenger mobility, the increase of
BCPs capacity and provision of modern equipment to speed up data transfer and documents checks,
would inevitably result in reduction of passengers’ waiting time at the BCPs.
2.2 Key parameters and assumptions
The ex-post economic analysis was done for the entire project. The scope of the analysis covers:
   Kapitan Andreevo BCP, where over half of the investments were focused; the considered benefits
    are related to: (i) reduced waiting time for the commercial vehicles due to interventions under
    components 1.1, 2 and 3; (ii) reduced time for Detailed Custom Examination of cargo with X-Ray
    scanner (component 1.2) and (iii) reduced waiting time for passengers (1.1, 2, and 3)
   Kalotina BCP: the benefits from reduced waiting time are mainly related to Components 1.2 (X-
    Ray scanner) and 3
   Ports of Varna and Burgas, reduced waiting time for Detailed Custom Examination of cargo with
    X-Ray scanner in the Component 1.2
It is assumed that additional benefits related to other small BCPs (such as Svilengrad terminal, Vidin
warehouse, Svishtov Port) will not be estimated. These, together with the benefits from reduction in
illegal traffic and smuggling are covered by indirect benefits.
The Project reference period is 20 years, except for the X-Ray scanners that have 10-year life cycle.
Reduced waiting time for freight vehicle
Traffic and processing time data was collected at Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina BCPs, starting from
May 2008. These were used to update the freight vehicle traffic forecast and to estimate the waiting
time in Do Nothing and With Project cases. Figure 1 visualise the freight vehicle traffic and weighted
average waiting time at the considered BCPs.

Remark: Due to the reconstruction works and moved weighting scale, starting from March 2014 it was no longer possible to measure border processing times
        at the same check-points as used between 2010 – February 2014. This is why no data on number of outgoing trucks are available for March –
        September 2014 period. The CA implemented an alternative solution by performing measurements of waiting times for specific time periods on
        representative bases.

Remark: In June- September 2010 period no monitoring was possible due to reorganization of the BCP procedures related to implementation of new
        regulations for Schengen accession. This mainly influenced the incoming traffic and to a lesser extent - the outgoing traffic, as presented in the next
        figures.

The data shows that in 2009-2010 the traffic of freight vehicles via Kapitan Andreevo increases
by 11.5%, which is twice more than the forecasted in the ex-ante analysis (5%). In 2011-2013,
however, the annual traffic of freight vehicle decreased by 1.6% per year. In comparison, the
forecasted annual growth was 2%. The reasons for deviation from the forecast could be:
   Financial and economic crisis
   Operation of a new BCP between Bulgaria and Turkey: Lesovo BCP is located about 40 km
    eastwards from Kapitan Andreevo and was opened for traffic in June 2005. During the period
    when TTFSEE 2 was prepared, the traffic of this new BCP was very low; in the next few
    years, however, Lesovo became more popular, especially when Kapitan Andreevo was closed
    for several days due to floods in November 2007, February 2010 and February 2012
   Improvement of customs and border police control diverted part of the illegal traffic
   Delays from the reconstruction in 2013-2014 were perceived by some drivers. Thus part of
    the traffic diverted to alternative routes/BCPs.
The data collected at Kalotina BCP for 2009-2013 showed steady growth in freight vehicles with
7% per year on average, which is significantly higher than the forecasted, i.e. 2% a year for 2008-
2010 period and no growth for 2011 – 2015 period. One main reason is that during forecast, a
new bridge was expected to complete and put into operation in 2010, which would divert much
traffic via Kalotina. In reality, the bridge was not in operation until 2013. The impact of the new
bridge started to show in July 2013 – June 2014 period: almost no growth from June 2012 – June
2013 period.
Based on the above analysis it is assumed that in 2014-2015 the average daily traffic levels BCP
will stay stable: 625 incoming trucks and 615 outgoing trucks at Kapitan Andreevo BCP and 425
incoming trucks and 455 outgoing trucks at Kalotina BCP. For the period of 2016 – 2025 the
forecasted growth rate of 3% per annul is preserved for both BCPs.

* First nine months’ data
The monitoring period does not allow assessing the average waiting time in Do Nothing case, i.e.
before the actual implementation of TTFSEE 2 project. The first data collection was in May 2008.
While according to the procurement report some activities, such as traffic video and
modernisation of the lightening system (C 1.1) at Kapitan Andreevo were implemented in 2006-
2007. Nevertheless, it was assumed that these systems have no direct impact on the waiting time

                                                  38
for freight vehicle traffic. Therefore, the following average times were assumed for both BCPs in
Do Nothing case for the entire referent period (2008-2025): 75 min for incoming truck and 85
min for outgoing truck for both BCPs.
Component 3 has been implemented in 2008-2009 and in 2010 the systems were fully operational.
This correlates with the first significant decrease of waiting times at both BCPs:
   At Kapitan Andreevo BCP the waiting time has been dropped
     from 78 min in 2009 to 56 min in 2010 for the incoming trucks, which saved 22 min
     from 74 min in 2009 to 62 min in 2010 for outgoing trucks, which saved 12 min
   At Kalotina BCP the waiting time has been dropped
     from 76 min in 2009 to 60 min in 2010 for the incoming trucks, which saved 16 min
     from 74 min in 2009 to 57 min in 2010 for the outgoing trucks, which saved 17 min
Time-saving from Detailed Custom Examination
Traffic and Detailed Custom Examination data were collected at Kapitan Andreevo BCP,
Kalotina BCP, Port of Varna West and Port of Burgas centre, staring from the last quarter of 2012,
i.e. after the X-Ray equipment was purchased and installed at these BCPs. Summary of data
collected is presented in the Table 5.

The reason for higher number of Detailed Custom Examination carried out at all the relevant
BCPs was the new requirements from the accession to Schengen. The following assumptions
were made on average Detailed Custom Examination rate in respect to C 1.2 X-Ray scanners:
   Do Nothing case:
     0.5% for Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina BCPs
     1.5% for Port of Varna West and Port of Burgas Centre
   With Project: using average from Table 5.
     0.14% at Kapitan Andreevo
     0.41% at Kalotina
     0.23% at Port of Varna West
     0.33% at Port of Burgas
   The number of Detailed Custom Examination in both Do Nothing and With Project cases in
    2013 according to monitoring data : 1,232 in Varna West, 849 in Kapitan Andreevo, 668 in
    Burgas, and 1,378 in Kalotina
   3% annual growth of freight vehicle traffic for 2016-2021 at Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina
   8% annual growth of freight vehicle traffic for 2016-2021 at port of Varna West and Port of
    Burgas.
Passengers’ time-saving
Savings for passenger traffic were calculated for Kapitan Andreevo BCP only, where passengers
shall benefit from both infrastructure improvements at the BCP itself and the access road.
Assumptions made in the ex-ante stage were retained:
   10 min/passenger saved due to implementation of C1.1 and C2
   1.5 min/passenger due to C3 implementation.
During the preparation phase the total number of passengers crossing Kapitan Andreevo BCP was
assumed constant over the years and equal to 4.2 million, as reported by Border Police for 2005-
2006. The number of passengers by road was not subject of monitoring during the TTFSEE II
project implementation. Data were provided by Border Police for just one week (12-18 May
2014). Based on expert opinion these data could be assumed representative for the annual average
weekly traffic by road. According to these data, the total number of persons that crossed the
border by car, coach, or truck was 67,867. Assuming 1.5 drivers per truck, the benefits for which
are considered in the saved waiting time of goods vehicles, the number of persons to benefit 11.5
min savings was estimated at 2,866,864 min. This figure was assumed constant for the period
after 2014.
No convincing evidences for the decrease in waiting time for rail passengers were found.
Therefore, the benefit from rail passengers is not included in ex-post analysis.
Value of time
The assumptions made in respect to the Value of time were kept the same as ex-ante analysis for
2006 and 2010:
 heavy road traffic estimated at €250/working day (the working day is 16 hours when two
   drivers per truck are assumed)
 maritime container traffic estimated at € 100/day.
Other assumptions
Indirect trade benefits are assumed as 20% of the transportation costs saved.




                                                40
Regarding the X-Ray scanning equipment (C1.2) the average direct legitimate trade costs were
assumed in accordance with the ex-ante economic evaluation: € 200 for Varna, € 75 for Kapitan
Andreevo, € 275 for Burgas and € 120 for Kalotina.
The benefits related to C2 access road to Kapitan Andreevo BCP: this component certainly
contributes to the reduction of road transport externalities (air pollution, accidents, climate
change). However, these benefits are not monetised in the ex-post economic analysis.
Costs
The investment costs were allocated per year according to the actual project implementation.
Annual operation and maintenance costs for project interventions are assumed at 5% of
investment costs for civil works and equipment. The personnel costs (wages and social insurance)
for the Customs staff for Detailed Custom Examination and/or X-Ray equipment were assumed
as in the ex-ante evaluation: EUR 2.33/h in Do Nothing case and EUR 3.34/h in With Project
case
No other operation and maintenance are considered.
Economic analysis results
Considering only the costs and benefits for component 1.1 Kapitan Andreevo and Kalotina BCP,
the component 2 access road, and the component 3.2 communication system for the border
police, the resulting economic indicators for the ex-post analysis are: (i) Net Present Value (NPV)
is EUR 24.5 million (evaluated at a discount rate of 12 percent) and (ii) Economic Internal Rate
of Return is 29.7 percent.
The economic analysis provided in the PAD (Table 6) did not report an overall project NPV or
EIRR and instead reported results for each component separately. The comparable NPV provided
in the PAD was EUR 24.16 million.
                   Table 6. Economic Analysis by Component in the PAD
 Economic Analysis in the PAD                       NPV @ 12% (Million EUR)              EIRR
 1.1.Kalotina, Kapitan Andreevo, and 2. access road 21.88                                23.08%
 3.2 Communication system for border police         2.28                                 24.3%
                                         Total NPV 24.16
The EIRR in the ex-post analysis (29.7 percent) is higher than the EIRR in the PAD (about 24
percent). The ex-post NPV (24.5 million) is also slightly higher than the NPV calculated in the
PAD (24.16 million). In addition, the actual cost of the access road which was about 15 percent
higher, reflecting a normal range of cost contingencies for a road construction project. Therefore,
efficiency is rated as Substantial.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower/PIT submitted “Borrower’s Evaluation Report” to the Bank in October 2014. The
report contains 25 pages. The report consists of several chapters, including Introduction; A.
Assessment of the Operation’s Objective, Design, Implementation and Operational Experience; B.
Assessment of the Outcome of the Operation against the Agreed Objectives; C. Evaluation of the
Borrower’s Own Performance/Implementing Agency Performance; D. Evaluation of the
Performance of the World Bank; E. Lessons Learned, and two attachments.

Given the length requirement of this ICR, and most of context in the Introduction and part of
Chapter A and Chapter B are already discussed in the ICR main context and Annex 2, it was
decided that these will not be enclosed. Therefore the context below starts from page 16 of this
report. The Borrower’s entire report together with its attachments (annexes) is available in the
Project files.

Procurement (page )

For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different procurement methods, the need of pre-
qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame were agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank in the original Procurement Plan at the stage of project preparation. In the
process of project implementation the Procurement Plan was updated annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity.
The various procurement methods, number of procurement packages and respective amounts as
of the end of the Project are described in general below:

  Project Costs – Use Of Funds
  As per the latest estimation, the actual total TTFSE II Project cost amounted to EUR 44.67
  million. The amount of the disbursed Loan proceeds was EUR 33.37 million, which comprises
  90% of the total Loan amount. The remaining not used Loan funds at about EUR 3.88 million
  formed some savings at nearly 10 % of the total Loan amount, resulting mainly from: (i)
  difference of about EUR 502,300 between preliminary estimated budget and price of awarded
  contract for the construction of the 3.4 km access road (part of Maritsa Motorway section) and
  further savings under the contract of about EUR 1.024 million based on the real cost of the
  completed works; and (ii) committed but not fully disbursed amount for execution of works at
  Kapitan Andreevo BCP due to the Contractor’s unsatisfactory performance and non-completion
  of part of the contracted works (about EUR 2.50 million cost of the remaining not executed works
  + EUR 667,810 retention money).

B. Assessment Of The Outcome Of The Operation Against The Agreed Objectives

Achievements (Page 16)
TTFSE II project met its development objective through: (i) physical improvements and
modernization of equipment at border crossing points; (ii) modernization of communication
systems for exchange of information between border agencies; and (iii) enhancing coordination
and cooperation among stakeholders.
The project implementation was satisfactory during its first years, and then deteriorated due to
delays in procuring main contracts and budget constraints imposed nationally across the whole
portfolio. Overall, the TTFSE II Project implementation was moderately satisfactory and with
respect to the separate Project Components it can be rated as follows:
Achievement of Component 1 is moderately satisfactory.
Achievement of Component 2 is satisfactory.
Achievement of Component 3 is satisfactory.
Project performance
Project performance was assessed through a number of qualitative assessments and quantitative
indicators. The monitoring indicators were regularly collated and evaluated by the Project
Implementation Team (PIT) within the Ministry of Finance, based on information provided by the
border agencies.
Several project components and investments which were already completed have led to
streamlining of procedures between agencies and major improvements at the BCPs were
implemented. As a result, most of the PDO indicators are already achieved.
Border agencies have taken a number of significant steps to reduce border processing times. In
the beginning of the Project Implementation the Single Payment Window system was launched
by the Ministry of State Administration and Administrative Reform. For the two years of
operation SPW System provided reliable data on actual processing times showing continuous
improvement through a concerted interagency cooperation. The latest data on the PDO indicators


                                                   48
over the period April-June 2014, measured by the reduction of transit time at the border between
Bulgaria and Serbia at Kalotina and with Turkey at Kapitan Andreevo, show overall improvement
in the transit time by about 46% compared to the revised 2010 baseline and 65 % compared to the
first measurement in 2008.
Physical improvements and modernization of equipment at border crossing points
The reconstruction and modernization of buildings and facilities at selected border crossing points
and inland Customs terminals started in the 90’s, initially performed by the Bulgarian Customs
Agency and then by the Ministry of Finance. The successful practice has continued with the
implementation and successful completion of the First Trade and Transport Facilitation in
Southeast Europe Project. Six selected border crossing points have been either modernized or
new facilities have been built under the Bulgaria TTFSE Project.
In continuation of the good work started with the First TTFSE Project the achievement of the
Second TTFSE project in summary are as follows:
Layout Plan for Kalotina BCP
With the design and approval of this plan the territory of this border crossing point was regulated
and promulgated as a public state property after 20 years efforts of the state agencies.
Layout Plan of Kapitan Andreevo BCP and technical designs
The new layout plan was elaborated under TTFSE II Project in close coordination and
collaboration with Border Agencies and institutions involved in the border control.
During the design a group of experts of Bulgarian border agencies and designers visited border
crossing points of countries recently accessed to the EU in order to exchange opinions and to use
good experience in this regard. Border of Slovakia with Ukraine and border of Slovenia with
Croatia were visited and working meetings were held with local border experts. The newly
renovated Turkish BCP Kapikule was also visited.
All new requirements and modern understanding were reflected during elaboration of the new
plan of Kapitan Andreevo BCP. Good practices and positive experience of foreign BCPs visited
were also taken into consideration.
Modernization of Kapitan Andreevo BCP
A significant increase of throughput capacity was envisaged with the new layout of the biggest
border crossing point at the external EU Border with Republic of Turkey. The outdated type of
border checks of trade traffic was replaced with modern customs processing of each truck from
elevated control booths. A number of new facilities were envisaged in the new plan as medical
center, firefighting building, new facilities for detailed customs inspection, new large X-ray high-
tech equipment for trucks of new generation etc.
Access road to Kapitan Andreevo BCP, last part of Maritsa MM
This last part of 3.4 km of Maritsa Motorway was unique and there was no analogue in Bulgaria
as engineering solution. The designers ensured four separate road beds at the entry/exit of the
BCP. The traffic split by types – passenger and commercial, and by directions – entry and exit
was aimed at increasing of the traffic flows without any bottlenecks and crossing the traffic inside
the BCP.
Other important fact was moving the connection of the access road with the border zone on the
north of the existing entry/exit of the BCP. This decision saved more than 20 million Euro for the
state budget needed for payment of compensations for expropriation of commercial facilities
located along the existing road I-8.

                                                49
There was another remarkable part along the last motorway section and it was exposition and
marking of the ancient road Via Diagonalis which was discovered in the road bed during its
construction.
Supply of specialized equipment for Border Agencies
Under the TTFSE II Project the border agencies were equipped with modern specialized
equipment as X-Rays, detection equipment, TETRA base stations and portable units for easy and
safe communication etc. These contributed to the harmonization and integration of information
flows as well as real-time information exchange at border crossing points among relevant
agencies.
New or extended existing equipment enhanced passenger document checks on trains traveling
along railway Corridor Xc, and reduced substantially the time passenger trains spend at the
borders, thus enhancing the throughput capacity of single-track border crossing rail sections for
both passenger and freight trains.
The total value of the investments under the Second TTFSE Project is approximately EUR 42.00
million, 31.00 million Euro of which are Loan proceeds. The TTFSE II Project has achieved a
high use of the Loan proceeds for investments, namely 83% of the 37.25 million Euro total Loan
amount.
c. Evaluation of the Borrower’s Own Performance / Implementing Agency Performance
Overall, the Borrower performance during the whole Project life, from the Project identification
through the Project completion, was moderately satisfactory.
During the Project preparation and implementation, the Borrower through the Ministry of Finance,
consistently maintained its commitment to the Project. A Project Implementation Team (PIT) was
established within the MOF by an Order of the Minister of Finance and this was the same PIT
that implemented the first TTFSE project.
The PIT consisted of highly committed and competent staff and was capable of dealing with the
Loan management, procurement, disbursement and reporting. In addition, team members attended
the World Bank’s specialized procurement and financial training and constantly improved their
knowledge and skills in Bank procedures. The PIT worked under the leadership of the TTFSE
Project National Coordinator and in close collaboration with the World Bank Project team, taking
necessary implementation measures and solving operational issues.
The Borrower adopted a Project Operational Manual, elaborated by PIT, pursuant to the
provisions of the said Order, describing procedures for implementation of the Project, and
including, inter alia: (i) procedures governing administrative, procurement, accounting, financial
management, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements; (ii) targets to be achieved under the
Project; and (iii) a sample format of Project Reports. A Financial Management System Manual
was adopted for establishing internal controls and financial management of the Project as well.
The PIT prepared quarterly progress reports on Project implementation and furnished to the
World Bank audit reports on the Project financial statements, prepared by an independent auditor
in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. All audit reports were considered
acceptable by the Bank.
Physical improvement and modernization of equipment at border crossing points involved
various border agencies and was implemented keeping the BCPs functioning. This required good
coordination between all participants in the process (Employer, Contractors/ Suppliers,
Consultants and Beneficiaries) which was successfully accomplished by the Borrower.



                                               50
During the Project life there were different factors and constraints which influenced project
implementation, including technical 26 , managerial 27 , organizational 28 and institutional issues 29 .
These caused some delays at different stages of the Project implementation and as a result for
certain periods (June 2011 – June 2012 and March – September 2013) the Project was rated
moderately unsatisfactory. Due to the common measures taken by the World Bank and the
Borrower, agreed action plans and Borrower persistence, the performance was brought back to a
satisfactory level and the project was upgraded to moderately satisfactory. Most of the time the
Development Objective (DO) rating was satisfactory and in the last year was changed to
moderately satisfactory.

D. Evaluation Of The Performance Of The World Bank

The World Bank performance during all stages of TTFSE II Project, including identification,
preparation, appraisal, implementation and completion, was satisfactory.
At preparation stage, a regional TTFSE II program following the example of TTFSE I was
extensively considered. For this purpose, in June 2005 the Bank organized a High Level Meeting
in Zagreb on developing a common framework for regional cooperation in trade and transport in
southeast Europe. The whole spectrum of factors influencing the preparation of such program was
taken into account. Despite the SEE countries readiness to participate as well as prepared and
proposed by the Bank Addendum to the existing TTFSE I MoU and regional or “horizontal”
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) of the Bank lending instrument, it was concluded that preparing
a regional TTFSE II program would be unrealistic. The reasons were: (i) different state of
readiness of the individual SEE countries to join such regional program; (ii) designing such
regional TTFSE II program would have arguably taken longer to prepare than individual TTFSE
II projects and therefore would have delayed project preparation in Bulgaria and FYR
Macedonia; (iii) different status of the SEE countries with respect to the EU accession process
(Bulgaria and Romania were EU Member States since January 1, 2007 while the countries of the
Western Balkans were much less advanced in the EU enlargement process).
Review teams providing flexibility, responsiveness and extensive assistance to the Borrower and
the Project Implementation Team have closely monitored the Project in the course of its
implementation. The supervision of the Project was extensive and carried out through: (i) regular
interactions between Task Team Leader and PIT to prepare and follow up missions; (ii)
supervision missions on average twice every year; (iii) joint monitoring of Government/World
Bank program implementation; (iv)meetings between the World Bank teams, National
Coordinator and PIT; (v) PIT quarterly progress reports.

  Lack of information on property issues for Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCPs; Several amendments to Duty Free Act and other
existing Bulgarian standards and regulations; Frequent changes in the requirements of the border agencies; etc.

  Frequent changes of Deputy Ministers of Finance nominated as National TTFSE Coordinators, of Project Coordinators of “Road
Infrastructure” Agency and National Cu stoms Agency as well as of members of the teams implementing the Project in Beneficiary
Agencies.

  Long restructuring of the new administration after the elections in 2009 (started in June 2009 and continued through 2010; Removal
of the Capital Investments Directorate (ITFC) in the MoF from the MoF organization structure (the ITFC Directorate was important
for the Project as the PIT worked very closely with this Directorate in all phases of bidding procedures and contracts implementation);
Frequently more complicated coordination among agencies because of changes in the Beneficiaries’ management bodies and staff.
29
  Change in the organization structure of administrations of Road Agency, Border Police, Customs Agency in the first two years of
Project implementation; Significant change in almost all ministries, government administrations and agencies after the elections in
June 2009.

As a whole fourteen World Bank Project implementation support visits were carried out during
the project implementation and respective Aide-Memoires were regularly prepared and
transmitted, flagging topical issues and defining follow-up concrete steps and agreed actions.
During the Project life there were several changes of Project Task Team Leaders but they were
made smoothly and had no negative impact on the Project implementation. The Bank has
consistently good working relationships with the Borrower at each one Project stage.

E. Lessons Learned
TTFSE II project development objective is to facilitate trade by improving the capacity,
efficiency and quality of services at selected European Union external border crossings with
particular focus on the Trans-European Transport Network.
After completion of the Project, several conclusions can be outlined as a result of the activities
carried out during the Project implementation and in the course of meeting the Project objective
through (i) physical improvements and modernization of equipment at border crossing points; (ii)
modernization of communication systems for exchange of information between border agencies;
and (iii) enhancing coordination and cooperation among stakeholders.
The process of the TTFSE II Project implementation provided a good example for an inter-
institutional cooperation similarly to the First TTFSE II Project. Complex Project structure
imposed a ceaseless coordination and cooperation with the Border agencies, Road Infrastructure
Agency and other ministries and institutions involved in the Project Implementation.
Increasing of interaction and coordination between border agencies for achieving of common
solutions for modernization of BCPs and high technology management of border control process
aimed at meeting the development objectives for facilitating trade flows across the country and
led to number of positive results.
Notwithstanding various difficulties which encountered in almost all Projects’ aspects and
accumulated delays during Project Implementation, with the constant common efforts of all
parties involved significant achievements have taken place over the past seven years in improving
the infrastructure, capacity, efficiency and quality of services at selected EU BCPs.
The following conclusion can be drawn:
Physical improvements and modernization of equipment at border crossing points
The economic imperatives of trade facilitation call for borders to become increasingly pervious.
In the same time there must be credible controls at the borders to prevent threats to national and
world security. The national economy must have efficient infrastructure to facilitate
competitiveness, expand trade and investment, and thus improve the welfare of citizens.
Transport infrastructure improvements in the Trans-European Transport Network are important in
order to support the economic growth of the individual countries and for facilitating trade in the
regional aspect.
The TTFSE II Project has responded to the above requirements by means of:
   Providing necessary investments for selected border crossing points, thus complementing the
    government efforts (including agreed EU and international donor community funds) towards
    entire rehabilitation of border points;
   Contributing to the initiatives to reduce delays at borders, trough improvement of physical
    infrastructure and supply of specialized equipment that support expedite border processing
    and thus facilitate trade;


                                               52
   Establishing the grounds for next trade facilitation steps at border crossings, such as further
    strengthening of border procedures, improvement of information exchange between the
    border agencies and continuation of the equipment modernization process.
Moreover, some substantial issues, which would require narrow consideration by the respective
government authorities and follow-up measures, came up during the TTFSE II Project
implementation:
   Development of a sound investment program based on national priorities.
   Extension of infrastructure improvement efforts at border crossings in order to further
    diminish their function “to act as bottlenecks”, in combination with institutional changes and
    use of best practices and modern technology; and
   Keeping the quality of infrastructure at border crossing points in line with the traffic volume
    statistics and estimates for future incensement.
Modernization of communication systems for exchange of information between border agencies
and enhancing coordination and cooperation among stakeholders
The TTFSE II Project has complemented the endeavour to meet the aforesaid development
objective through a number of initiatives and practices that proved to be useful during project
implementation:
   Elaboration of draft ToR and requirement for establishing of a common System for traffic
    control, initiated by Customs Agency. This document was created for Kapitan Andreevo BCP
    as a pilot and the intention was after its successful implementation to be applied to all BCPs
    in Bulgaria. The System envisaged streamline processing procedure for trucks and cars
    through common net of video control, special software and traffic signs and lights,
    information boards in order to eliminate in a great extent staff input during processing of the
    traffic.
   One of the feature of this System and agreed set of tools and techniques is creation of an
    effective feedback mechanism to permit analysis and redirection of the traffic flows in a real
    time.
   The other important value of this document is proposal for interagency co-operation
    mechanism for sharing of information among border agencies and authorities both at local
    and central level in order to improve the organization and strengthening of border control
In the context of the above conclusions, to achieve high results for resolving of various difficult
and complex tasks related to Border Crossing Points at external EU Borders is necessary to have:
Synchronization of requirements between Border Control Agencies
Border Crossing Gide
Common understanding in principles for execution of border control by all border agencies for all
BCPs is needed in order identical approach for improvements to be established. Each Border
Agency carries out its duty by separate laws. There are still some small discrepancies between
border processing applied by different Border Control Agency depending on location of the BCP
and its specifics, and in some extent on the local management.
A common document would be useful to be created with the participation of experts of all border
agencies for unifying of border processing at all BCPs. Such document can be Border Crossing
Guide for territory regulation, design, coordination, construction and maintenance of border
crossing points in Bulgaria. This Guide can be based on a special law for border control,
summarizing duties and obligations of each agency applying its special law. In such Guide all

                                                53
details must have places and when an agency needs some new facility, equipment of furniture,
this need to be easily identified in the Guide.
Separate structure responsible for Border Crossing Points in Bulgaria
Historically and based on the experience gained during implementation of TTFSE I and TTFSE II
an important conclusion can be made that the scattered responsibilities for design, construction,
maintenance and territory regulation between all Border Agencies and Ministries are not effective
and do not lead to successful results. At present border agencies do not have budget for
investment projects and they accomplish these within their ministries. As a result there is a great
variety in BCPs’ infrastructure due to the quite multidirectional requirements. Also it is important
to mention that in almost all cases the border agencies do not have qualified experts for all
aspects of investment planning of BCPs as well as maintenance of the infrastructure.
It would be useful one state structure to be responsible for all activities related to the border
control and to synchronize requests of separate agencies in one common goal.
Implementation of both TTFSE I and TTFSE II Projects is a small example in this direction.
Thanks to the efforts of the MoF, implementing both projects, there are good results in
summarizing of various requirements and putting them in one common solution. This was the
case with the designs for Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCP and other four small BCPs
(Bregovo, Vrashka Chuka, Zlatarevo and Logodaj).
Other positive example is work of the Inter ministerial Committee on Border Crossing Point
Issues. In spite of its weak activity during last 2 years due to the political instability, this body did
a very good job with regard to the implementation of TTFSE II Project.
Necessary budget for Projects’ implementation
Priority for securing of budget ceilings and local co-financing is necessary for smooth and
successful implementation of projects financed by international financing institutions.
Negative example can be given with the budget constrains during TTFSE II implementation. Due
to that reason modernization of Kalotina BCP and four small BCPs were dropped by the Project
during the two restructurings.
Political stability
Political stability is important for the successful implementation of the investment projects.
Frequent changes in the management of the implementing institutions always have negative
impact on the Project activities.
