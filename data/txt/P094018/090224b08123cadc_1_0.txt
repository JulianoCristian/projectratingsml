                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to facilitate trade by improving the capacity, efficiency and quality of services at selected European Union border crossings
                         with particular focus on the Trans-European Transport Network.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         delays in the implementation of the physical project components in previous years caused by administrative bottlenecks have been overcome and the implementation is back on
                         track. Disbursement significantly increased and is expected to keep this trend until the end of FY 12, when most of the civil works contracts will be signed and on-going.
                         Consequently, the overall project implementation progress (IP) indicator is up-graded from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory. A project restructuring was finalized
                         in January 2012 which aimed at ensuring sufficient time and resources for completion of all project activities, as well as streamlining the project performance.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project restructuring requested by the Government on September 12, 2011 was finalized in January, 2012. It entails extension of project closing date by 18 months, increased
                         targets for the PDO indicators, cancellation of a small amount of the loan, cancellation of some border crossing construction activities, and re-allocation between disbursement
                         categories to cover the higher than planned cost for the road under component 2.

                         Some activities are dropped from the project scope to cover these costs and due to lack of progress (i.e. design and reconstruction of Kalotina BCP and some small BCPs under
                         subcomponent 1.2).
                         Since the spring of 2011 there has been significant progress in the project development objective monitoring indicators, in terms of reduction of the Border processing times at the two
                         major Border crossing points (BCPs) at Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo. In order to capture this rate ofdeepen this improvement, the project restructuring introduced some
                         adjustments to the targets for the project indicators, reflecting the progress up to date and the expected results from up-coming reconstruction of Kapitan Andreevo Border Crossing
                         Point (BCP) and the installation of new X-Ray equipment at Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo BCPs.
                         Processing of remaining civil works contracts have also shown progress. Contracts under component 2 for the construction of the motorway and for the construction supervision were
                         signed in summer 2011 and the Land acquisition plan (LAP) for component 2 was disclosed in December 2011. The procedure for rehabilitation of Kapitan Andreevo BCP was
                         launched in early January 2012. The two contracts for purchase of large specialized customs equipment (EUR 6 million) were signed in September 2011.
                         As part of the restructuring, the Bank team agreed with the borrower on a revised implementation schedule and a action plan that covered (a) the additional time needed to complete
