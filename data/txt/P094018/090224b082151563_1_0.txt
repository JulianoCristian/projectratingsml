                         The PDO monitoring indicators for the period April -September 2013 continue the trend of notable reduction in border processing times at the two major border crossing points:
                         Kalotina and Kapitan Andreevo, with the exception of the indicator for entry at Kapitan Andreevo BCP which shows significant delays in border processing due to the reconstruction
                         works. The overall improvement in the transit time by about 34% compared to the revised 2010 baseline and 60% compared to the first measurement in 2008.
                         Currently the project implementation it is focused on three major contracts: (i) reconstruction of the main border crossing point between Bulgaria and Turkey - Kapitan Andreevo; (ii)

                         construction of Customs terminal in Svilengrad (rail terminal between Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria); and (iii) construction of the remaining 3.4 km section of the Maritsa highway
                         which provides access to the border crossing at Kapitan Andreevo.
                         While the implementation of the works contract under component 2 (the access road to Kapitan Andreevo BCP) is almost completed, the project continues to be impacted by delays
                         in implementation of the contract for reconstruction of Kapitan Andreevo BCP under component 1. The construction of Svilengrad Customs terminal, which has been on track, has
                         recently also been delayed and its implementation will slip beyond the current closing date with up to 3 months. The four small works contracts under component 1.2 have still not
                         been launched, due to fiscal constraints in the beginning of the fiscal year.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In order to allow completion of the works on the biggest border crossing point in Bulgaria on the external European Union (EU) border with Turkey, as well as to streamline project
                         implementation and to focus on the on-going large civil works contracts, the Borrower requested project restructuring on September 27, 2013. The restructuring involves: (i) an
                         extension of the project closing date of 6 months, (ii) cancellation of small portion of the loan (EUR 2.25 million) and (iii) small adjustment to one baseline value of an intermediate
                         indicator in the results framework. This is the second project restructuring. While the Project was first extended in 2011 with 18 months, the currently proposed restructuring is going
                         to bring to an overall extension of 24 months, expanding the overall implementation period to 8 years.

                         Given the current pace of implementation of the works contract for reconstruction of the Kapitan Andreevo BCP, there is a risk that the reconstruction might not be even completed
                         before the newly revised closing date (June 30, 2014). Therefore, there could be a risk that the PDO indicators for Kapitan Andreevo will not be reached at project closure, unless the
                         implementation of this contract is significantly accelerated or if the government implements a stage approach allowing completion of most significant part of the reconstruction and
                         achieving the PDO targets by project closure.
