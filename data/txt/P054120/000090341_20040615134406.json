the sustainability\n            was highly likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that the\n            strategic focus of the activities in the project served as a\n            catalyst for change, including attracting additional\n            investment, promoting change, and protecting program\n            investments from political influence, particularly at the\n            municipal level. Even though the project collected\n            significant amounts of data on HIV/AIDS and Sexually\n            Transmitted Deseases (STDs), it was not possible to assess\n            trends over time since the use of differing methodologies\n            resulted in inconsistencies that could not be interpreted.\n            An adequate monitoring and evaluation system was not\n            established. If AIDS II had financed administrative costs on\n            a declining basis, the Ministry of Health (MOH) would have\n            had fewer incentives to rely on external consultants. The\n            project significantly underestimated the administrative\n            demands incurred by the evaluation of more than 2,000\n            projects executed by civil society. Decentralization of\n            management responsibilities to states and municipalities\n            implies a change in roles for all players. The current\n            system allows states and municipalities to make better use\n            of resources at the local level, by increasing synergy with\n            other programs and reducing duplication of efforts. The\n            number of hospitalizations per AIDS patient declined from\n            1.6 in 1996, before ART was introduced, to 0.3 in 2001, for\n            an estimated 358,000 hospitalizations prevented during\n            1997-2001. Providing ART free of charge is not enough to\n            make everyone come forward for treatment."}, "docdt": "2004-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
