In\n            1993, the World Bank approved 160 million dollars for the\n            AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) Control Project\n            in Brazil. The program focused on prevention efforts, but\n            also covered treatment and testing. Aided by another 165\n            million dollars World Bank loan in 1998, the Control\n            Project, in its second phase, is helping Brazil's\n            ministry of health reduce the spread of human\n            immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS while making it\n            possible for Brazilians with AIDS to live longer, healthier\n            lives. The program has contributed to a 38 percent drop in\n            the number of AIDS-related deaths since 1993. While\n            supporting 145 specialized AIDS care units, 66\n            hospital-based care units, and 50 home-care teams, the focus\n            of the Second AIDS and STD Project remains prevention. It\n            has helped set up a nationwide network of 141 AIDS testing\n            and counseling centers. Through a partnership with the\n            national business AIDS council, 3,000 companies are now\n            providing AIDS awareness training to 3.5 million workers."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
