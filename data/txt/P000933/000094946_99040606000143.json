Though satisfactory in institutional development\n            and educational quality, it is unsatisfactory in management\n            and expansion of tertiary enrollments, and student loan\n            restructuring; most importantly, it failed to maintain the\n            Government's financial commitment. Sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the slim rise in educational quality will be\n            hampered, unless tertiary enrollment is under government\n            management. Despite the Bank's satisfactory\n            performance, failure to achieve budget support, suggest a\n            barely satisfactory Government's performance. Some key\n            lessons learned from the development objectives show, that\n            broad consultations and institutional participation are\n            essential in project design and implementation. Management\n            expansion of tertiary enrollment is critical in educational\n            quality standards, and should be subject to a continual\n            dialogue with governments. Performance indicators should be\n            identified to effectively monitor project impacts. Some\n            lessons on design and implementation suggest that, when\n            parallel donor funding exists, components should be\n            implemented independently, and, with new experiences in\n            management information systems, essential infrastructure and\n            technology familiarization should be introduced early in the\n            project. Research funds should be committed institutionally,\n            and a continuous management capacity building for higher\n            education projects installed."}, "docdt": "1999-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
