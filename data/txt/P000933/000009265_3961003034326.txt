MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE P1TNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A TERTIARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 31.2 million, the equivalent of US$45.0
milion, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for
teriary education.
2.           aSector BakrMnd. Ghana's economic recovery program stresses the
importance of education to produce people with the knowledge and skldls required for
development; basic education will become an even more imporant focus of the sector strategy
if Ghana tries to accelerate its growth rate in the 1990s, from the 5% p.a. GDP growth of the
1980s. An education sector reform program which started at primary level in 1987 has
covered junior secondary, is now being implemented at the senior secondary level, and with
the proposed project will move into high gear at the tertiary level. A functional literacy
campaign has also just started. Enrollments are rising rapidly at all levels, currently reaching
12,000 at universities and 10,000 at polytechnics. Education's share of the central
Government recurrent budget has risen rapidly to 37%; basic education receives 64% of this
and tertiary education a little over 17%; and allocations for non-wage recurrent inputs have
been increased too. IDA is providing large-scale support (5 operations totaling US$126.6
million, for primary and secondary education and literacy) as is USAID (US$35 million for
primary education).
3.    The Goverment's objectives for its tertiary education reform program are very wide,
but stress quality improvement, efficiency improvement, and expansion to increase access.
The Government will establish an integrated tertiary system managed by the Ministry of
Education (MOE) and made up of all post-secondary pre-service instiutions. Major program
components are: restructuring and upgrading of institutions; review of course offerings and
curricla leading to proper linkage with the reformed secondary system and greater
curriculum relevance to development, revival of research; rehabilitation of facilities;
upgrading of staff, improved management; greater efficiency and control of unit cosu; and
diversification of funding sources. The Governmt plans a measured expansion of
enrollments to handle the four years of double-intake to tertiary education (1994/95-1997/98)
during the reform of the structure of secondary education; to increase access and equity; to
provide more university places as well as socially acceptable alternatives; and to produce the
educated manpower needed by an accelerating economy. The rate of expansion needs to be
kept under review as labor market data improves. Also, the Government will carry out a
study under the project of the scope for private provision of tertiary education, to spread the
burden. The African Development Fund has approved a credit of US$20 million equivalent,
and other donors are suppordng the program.
4. Piect Objectives. The project will support all the Govermment's objectives.
However, in this first phase (1993-96) of the program, the stress will be on (a) quality
improvement in teaching and learning; (b) improved management; (c) establishment of a
system combining autonomy with accountability for the universities; and (given considerable
uncertainty about manpower requirements) (d) a gradual expansion of enrollments.



-2-
S.   1tai  Don. line two components will be:
(a)    A central component for MOE and the proposed new boards for accreditation,
admissions and examinations, consisting of: (i) office equipment, computers, and
vehicles, (II) staff development, (ii) technical assistance, (iv) studies, and (v)
assistance in projeet management (US$5.1 million); and
(b)    An institutional component for erch of the three established universities, the proposed
University College, and the six existing polytechnics, consisting of: (i) civil works,
involving rehabilitation and selected new academic faucilities, and facilides for non-
resident studens, (ii) essential laboratory and workshop equipment and equipment
maintenance, (tii) core textbooks, library journals and reference books, (iv)
computers, (v) vehicles, (vi) staff dwvelopment, (vii) research funding (at the
universities), and (viii) management and technical assistance (US$46.3 million).
6.    Credit funds will be used to fance civil works (US$14.3 million); equipment
(US$14.5 million); books and journals (US$4.3 million); computers (US$2.2 million);
vehicles (US$1.2 million); staff development (US$2.3 million); technical assistance (US$4.8
million); research expenditures (US$1.0 million); studies (US$0.1 million); and incremental
recurrent costs (US$0.3 million). Retroactive financing of up to SDR 0.7 million is provided
of payments made for expenditures after July 1, 1992. A mid-term review of project
achievement wIll be undertaken to determine project effectiveness and serve as a basis for any
necessay redesign. Schedule A summarizes project costs and financing; Schedule B presents
tables on procrement and disbursements; Schedule C presents a timetable of the project's key
Proesing ovents, and Schedule D lists Bank Group operations in Ghana. A map is also
aached. lTe Staff Appraisal Report No. 10869-OH is being distributed separately.
7.    hWo eqt  emenhptaflon. MOE plans to implement the project largely through a new
Coordinatng Unit for Managing External Funding (CU). This will combine exisifng staff and
units, thus capitalizing on implementation experience gained already for new projects, and
recruit additional personnel as needed. A suitable coordinator for tertiary education has been
designated and is on the job. New personnel will receive appropriate training. MOE staff
will be supplemented by local consultants, some funded by ADF and others by IDA. To
assist the CU, MOE will also make extensive use of specialized agents or consultants for
architectual, pwoement, training management and auditing services. Other MOE divisions
involved will include those for Higher Education and for Planning, Budgeting, Monitoing
and Evaluation. Each participating educational institution will designate a project coordinator.
8.    Prje  S=inabiliq. The Government's program requires both policy sustainability
and financial sustainability for the long term. To address policy sustainabiity, the
Government is involving the educational institutions increasingly in program development and
implementation; improvig comumnications with academics; and bringing them the academic
input they require. The project contributes especially to this last strategy. It also directly
addresses finmcial sustainabiity, through proposed conditionality designed to help contain
presures for expansion of enrollments and expenditures, and to increase cost recovery.
9.    Lessons fom Preiou  lA   n m. While past experience in several projects
with MOE generally speaking has been good, these were mainly for other areas of the
education systcm and with other parts of MOE. The major lessons from the implementtion



-3-
of agrewi past tertiary reforms and the limite1 IDA fiancing for tertiary education In Ghana
are that 0) reforming the universities is difficult, especially when attempted in an overly
prescriptive mmer, and (ii) MOE's present staffing and implemenation capacity in higher
education needs reinforcement to handle the proposed program and fiancial flows. Tbe
project design reflects these lessons: it involves policy reforms already negotiated between the
Government and the institutions (especially the universities), the strengthening of MOE's
implementation capacity, and various means to simplify project Implementtion.
10.    atae for MI A       mn. IDA supports Ghana's education sector strategy,
which will contime to emphasize basic education, combined with selective expansion of
highr education, to acilitate accelerated ;.onomic growth. Within that strategy, IDA should
support the tertiary education progrm, which will produce needed economic and other
leadership groups for economic growth with greater quality and efficiency than in the past.
Only through IDA involvement has the Government addressed squarely the implications of its
proposed expansion of tertiary education, especially the implemenation capacity and financing
required, and therefore its sustainability. IDA is also the only donor likely to commit the
substantial additional resources required for Ghana to implement the program successfully.
11.   A.ed Actions (a) The Government has provided IDA with a Letter of Higher
Education Development Policy (Schedule E), and entered into memoranda of understanding
with each university, setting out key actions under its program. (b) Projct conditionality
covers: Q) specific annual limits during 1992/93-1997/98 on university intakes and on total
enollments at all project institutions; (i) limit of 18.3% on terdary education's share of the
recurrent budget for education through 1996; (iii) cost-recovery measures (application,
registration, and hostel fees) to reach the equivalent of 5% of tertary academic recusrent costs
in 1995/96; (iv) adjusted ratioslof students to academic staff; (v) annual reviews of and
agreement on public expenditure for tertiary education through 1996, with actual expenditures
wthin 10% of budgets (except for unanticipated salary increases); (vi) implementation of an
action plan for increased student loans within a sustainable fiancial scenario for the scheme;
(vii) annual reviews of project budgets with IDA and quarterly deposits of counterpart funds;
and (viii) a mid-tern review with IDA by March 31, 1995. Under the program, the
insuions' will also limit junior staff to 30% of student numbers by 1995/96; intensifyt he
utlization of libraries, classrooms, laboratories and workshops; and increase their library
acquisitions and maltenance budgets to 5% c .otal recurrent expenditures each in 1995.
Project conditionality also covers: (c) For effiveness, (i) establishment of the CU with
sufficient competent staff for project implemention; (ii) deposit of US$70,000 equivalent in
counterpt funds needed in first quarter of 1993; and (iii) appointment of architectu  and
engineerng consultants and of procurement agents for equipment and for books; and (d) for
dWrs=ements for Oi the proposed University College, passage of its establishment law (or
equivalent executive action), appoinment of the principal, and satisfactory memorandum of
undersanding wih Government, and for (ii) the research component, agreed arrangements for
managing a research fund and criteria for selecting research proposals for funding.
12.   Emdrayirorunetal Sects. lhe prnject is rated "B" because it will include new
buildings and extension of sanitary facilities. 'here is a satisfactory process in place in Ghana
for environmental review of the building plans and monitoring of construction.
13.   Prgm.   1jective Cagore. The project's major contribution to Bank POCs is in
human resource development Expanding ternary education may also improve educationa



-4-
opporunities for presny under-represented groups. The project includes a stdy to help the
Government realize its targets for increasing women's share of enrollments.
14.   Proect Befits. There will be benefits in terms of all areas of the Government's
tertiary education reform program, but the most Important ones will be in terms of quality,
management and expansion. Academic program overhaul, staff development, and the
rehabilitation or provision of the most important physical inputs are aimed at producing
substantial improvement in the quality of both teaching and learning. Management assistance
and training will increase efficiency and help contain unit costs. The provision of enough
academic spaces and of facilities for more non-resident students will enable the Government
and the educational institutions to meet better the needs of an accelerating economy and
expand access.
15.   RIsk. Tbere is a risk that the political transition and possible personnel changes In
Ghana at the end of 1992 could change the Government's tertiary education program, but
substantial change is considered unlikely. The sector risks are that MOE could lose control of
tertiary enrollments, especially during the years 1994195-1997/98 when graduates from both
old and new secondary school systems will converge on tertiary education; that intended
efficiency gains in tertiary education will not be achieved; and therefore that there will be a
budgetary explosion in tertiary education. The first wiUl be mitigated by campaigns of public
and political education, but remains a cause for concern. The second is being addressed by
the agreements already negotiated between the Government and the universities to implement
adjusted staffing norms, and by project and other actions to accommodate larger mbers of
non-resident students; but faculty resistance and student unrest remain significant risks. The
budget risk will be mitigated by the Government's strategy, and donor encouragement, to
promote and safeguard apropriate levels of education. The project risk is that MOE's
implementation capacity will be insufficient. It is being addressed through capitalizing on
MOE's implementation experience through a combined project management unit; covenants
on initial project implementation staffing; use of personnel from educational institutions; and
extensive use of consultants and procurement and other agents to assist MOE.
16.   KqggMM=dation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

GHANA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES                    Page 3 of 3
While Ghana's overall diLbursement performance continues to compare favorably with other countries
in th- Region, disbursements on investment lending have been declining since FY89. An increased focus on
implementation, complemented with actions to address generic as well as project issues, resulted in a reversal
of the trend in FY91. Key actions taken to improve performance included a Country Implementation 1 view
in May 1991, which led to a breakthrough in the simplification of procurement procedures and the approval
process, and follow-on sector implementation reviews. The Resident Mission's supervision capacity was
strengthened, and its portfolio monitoring activities increased. Intensive supervision and mid-term reviews
were used to redesign slow-moving projects in accordance with Bank policy. The impending political
changes in the country have, however, deflected attention from implementation issues, especially in
procurement-related activities, resulting in a slowdown of disbursements in FY92. Notwithstanding,
discussions continue at both project and higher levels of government to resolve the problems. Current plans
include a CIR next year. The status of projects which are particularly slow-disbursing is discussed below.
Cocoa Rehabilitation (FY88). To address the administrative problems that had led to slow
implementation, project administration has been tightened, clear working relationships between implementing
agencies have been established, and mechanisms have been put in place to monitor progress. However,
difficulties with procurement procedures and cost increases in the roads component have caused continued
delays in implementation. Following a mid-term review in March 1992, action has been taken to redesign
the project and reallocate credit funds.
Mining Sector Rehabilitation (FY88). The SGMC rehabilitation component has been lagging
substantially owing to slow decision making on joint venturing and rehabilitation of the mines. Efforts are
continuing to downsize SGMC and to activate the joint venturing of the mines. Furthermore, the urgency
for divestiture action is being stressed to improve SGMC's operations.
Forestry (FY89). Implementation problems included weak project management, shortage of
professional staff, and Government uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of the technical assistance
program. Actions have been taken to enhance staff training, seek approval for an increase in incentive
packages, and restructure the technical assistance program. As a result of the mid-term review in January
1992, implementation procedures have been simplified and action taken to reallocate proceeds.
Rural Financ (FY89). Although disbursements improved in FY92, drawdown on the credit line is
sdll slower than expected owing to problems of high interest rates, high credit risk perception by both lenders
and borrowers, and significant delays by the project implementation unit. The June 1992 mid-term review
proposed several actions to accelerate disbursements including ways to eliminate delays in the processing of
claims from participating financial institutions.
Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90). There has been significant progress in resolving financial issues
(tariff rates were increased in February 1992), and steps have been taken to address institutional problems.
The key issue of shortage of qualified senior management staff, however, remains unresolved: Technical
recommendations have been submitted to the Provisional National Defence Council but a decision is not
expected until after the elections in November 1992. After a two-year delay, physical implementation of the
project is now on track and disbursements are expected to pick up at the end of the engineering design stage
in May 1993 when the rehabilitation process begins.

TERTIARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Letter of Higber Education Development Policy
Ministry of Finance and Economic

P.O. Box M.40
Accra, Ghana
16th September, 1992
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President, the World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washingtn, D.C. 20433, USA
Dear Mr. Preston:
GANA - TERTIARY EDUCATION PROJECT
LE7TER OF HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY
I am writing to you with regard to the proposed Terdary Education Project, to inibrm
the International Development Association of the reforms that have taken place in the tertiary
education subsector since the start of our education reform program in 1987, and to outline the
furiher adjustments that will take place in this area over the coming years to ensure that terty
education will become a vibrant, multi-faceted system serving both the needs of a rapidly
expanding economy, and the aspirations of Ghanaians.
The reforms of the tertiary system were started under the first Education Sector
Adjustment Credit, supported through the Second Education Sector Adjustment Credit and were
further elaborated in the 1991 White Paper on Tertiary Education.
Education has been central to Ghanas development effbrt. It has therefore been a key
beneficiary of the assistance under the Economic Recovery Program which has been implemented
with support from World Bank and the IMF. The implementation of the ERP has led to
improvement in the balance of payments, sustained and substantial GDP growths, an
improvement in the private sector environment, and substantial increases in the budgetary
allocations for the social sectors, particularly for education.
The achievements in the educational system over the past five years have been
extardinary. The structure of the system has been chmged from a 6:4:5:2 (17 years) to a 6:3:3
(12 years); curricula and teaching materials have been revised and made more relevant;
educational input has been more readily available especially at the basic and secondary levels.

A new cost-sharing system has been put in place to ensure continuous supply of books
and Journals and educational materials, while freeing the institutions of non-educational concerns;
also considerable increase in efficiency has been brought about through an increase in student
staff ratio and reduction in non-teaching staff numbers, and rapid increases in intakes and
enrollments at all levels of education.
More specifically at the tertiary education level:
*     feeding subsidies were removed in 1988;
*     an innovative student loan system was introduced at the end of 1988;
*     and the semester system was implemented in all universities, polytechnics and
other tertiary institutions;
*     intakes into undergraduate courses have increased by 34.6 percent, from 3,344
in 1989 to 4,500 in 1991;
3     the number of non-resident university students increased from virually none in
1989 to 2,651 in the 1991/92 academic year;
e     overall student:academic staff ratio increased from 6:1 in 1987 to 10:1 in 1991;
and 2,800 out of 8,000 non-teaching staff have been redeployed since 1987; and
*     most importantly of all, a university rationalization study was completed, which
recommended the recognition of all post-secondary institutions as tertiary and
further recommended that these should constitute a unified system with
appropriate linkages to optimize services offered. These include the three
universities, six polytechnics, seven diploma-awarding colleges (to be merged as
a new university college at Winneba) and around (60) post-secondary teacher
training, nursing training, and agricultural training colleges (which wil be
merged into (10) regional colleges of applied arts, science and technology-
RECAAST).
The study also recommended the creation of apex organizations to deal with tertiary-level
admissions, accreditation and the conduct of technical and professional examinations. It finally
recommended the revamping of selected facilities to support the reform program. All these
recommendations were accepted by Government and embodied in the 1991 White Paper.
Though much has been done, much still remains to be done if the tertiary education
system is to become an engine for accelerated growth. Special efforts will have to be made to
protect the improved system to ensure a balanced development over the coming five or six years.
We realize that quality educational program offerings can only be achieved if enrollments do not
exceed the capacity of both existing academic and technical staff, as well as that of the existing
physical facilities. in fulfillment of the national policy of ensuring social justice through
education the opporunity of a particular age group to tertiary education must not fall to a level
lower than existed at the beginning of the reform. Ibis is particularly important in the next four
years when there will be an intake from traditional and the new senior secondary school systems.
Enrollments and intakes during this difficult period are reflected in Table 1.

One of the biggest potential problems to be faced by the education sector in the coming
five years will be the tremendous pressure on government resources, from the successes of the
reform program and the demand that thus generates for access to further education especially at
the terdary level. While recognizing this demand for larger numbers, Government will continue
to observe the proportional budgeted share of educational resources reaching 18.30% in 1996 and
20.61 percent by the year 2000, based on present projections. However, in order to remain
within these projections of educational recurrent expenditures, Government will:
*     ensure that both universities and polytechnics comply with the approved student
staff ratio norms at the latest by the 1995/96 academic year, namely, 8 for
medicine, 12 for other science based subjects, 15 for education, and 18 for the
humanities;
*     ensure that hostel fees will cover the full cost of running the hostel by the
1993/94 academic year. These fees will also include the annualized capital cost
of a hostel place; and
*     ensure that through a range of application, registration, and other charges, 5
percent of the tertiary academic recurrent costs will be borne by students by the
1995/96 academic year.
In order to mitigate some of these additional costs that will have to be financed by
students, Government plans to extend the student loan scheme, while at the same time ensuring
its long-term sustainability. Government has made an advance payment of ¢1.08 billion to the
Social Security and National Insurance Trust as a subsidy toward interest payments of studen

loans. lbis is not likely to be exhausted until 1997 on present projections. A new injection of
an advance will be made between 1996 and 1998 when and if required.
It is also agreed that the bulk of the investment budgets to be made available over the
period for tertiary education will be devoted to the rehabilitation of existing facilities in the
tertiary institutions and that priority will be attached to projects which complement the capital
investments made under this funding proposal. In addition over the periods 1992 to 1995
inclusive, not more than US$4 million equivalent of Government's own investment resources (or
US$1.5 million in any one year) will be devoted to the new University of the North.
The main efficiency and quality improvement in the tertiary education subsystem will take
place through specific concrete actions at each of the 10 institutions covered by this first phase
of the reform program. The Government has thus reached agreement with all 10 institutions
(reflected in memoranda of understanding with the three autonomous universities) that:
(a)    by the beginning of the 1995196 academic year all grades and types of junior
staff will not exceed 30 percent of full-time equivalent student enrollments;
(b)   in the 1992/93 academic year all libraries will be open for at least 90 hours per
week; and all classrooms, laboratories and workshops will be open at least 75
hours a week. In addition by the 1993/94 academic year centralized utilization
of all teaching spaces would have started;
(c)    by 1995 expenditures for library acquisitions (books and journals) will not be less
than 5 percent of total recurrent budgets or subventions for each tertiary
institutions; and
(d)    by 1995 expenditure on maintenance of buildings, plant and equipment at each
project institution will nt be less than 5 percent of total recurrent budgets or
subventions for each tertiary institution.
Planning is under way to ensure that tertiary institutions, especially universities, have
adjusted their curriculum to enable them to take the graduates of the new senior secondary school
system in 1994. In all cases it will involve a complete overhaul of existing courses to bring them
in line with the development potential of the country and with new trends in the SSS system.
During the period steps will be taken to thoroughly examine innovative schemes for education
delivery such as Distance Education and to set up pilot schemes which will enable Government
to improve the capacity of the system even further in succeeding years. During the four years
(1994-97), there will also be increased intakes into degree courses at the new university college,
and into diploma programs in polytechnics.
In order to ensure rapid and effective project implementation and et' ursements,
Government is committed to providing adequate staffing to the Higher Education Division, and
support the creation of a common Project Management Unit to provide effective coordination for
all credits and grants to education in Ghana. Government is also committed to providing the
necessary counterpart funds.
