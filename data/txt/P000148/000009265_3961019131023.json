The Bank's\n            performance in project identification, preparation and\n            appraisal was highly satisfactory. The Bank took an active\n            role in advising the Government that the project should not\n            only deal with immediate emergency issues, but also with the\n            medium to long-term prospects of making the transition from\n            mining to other activities in Selebi-Phikwe feasible. The\n            Government's performance in project identification,\n            preparation, and appraisal was satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned from the implementation of the project are: to\n            effectively monitor completion of any activity, clear\n            performance targets need to be set at appraisal; to assess\n            the success or failure of any program, the expected output\n            need to be established at project appraisal; recommendations\n            made by project evaluation study should be evaluated and the\n            relevant recommendations taken into consideration in order\n            to correct any impediment to project implementation and\n            sustainability; and Government's full commitment is a\n            key element in the successful implementation and\n            sustainability of any project component."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
