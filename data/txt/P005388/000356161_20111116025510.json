The project would include: (i) construction of\n            about 1,250 km of 22-kV and 995 km of 380/220-volt\n            distribution lines and installation of related equipment;\n            (ii) provision of about 45 MVA of 22/0.4-kV distribution\n            transformer capacity and street lighting equipment; and\n            (iii) provision of consultant services to assist in detailed\n            engineering and project management. The project would be an\n            essential part of the Government's newly emphasized\n            policy aimed at slowing down rural out migration by\n            concentrating activities and amenities in well selected\n            rural centers. The project would contribute to increasing\n            productivity in the agricultural sector, creating employment\n            and improving living conditions in rural areas. No special\n            risks are foreseen in the implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "1979-06-25T15:31:05Z"}
