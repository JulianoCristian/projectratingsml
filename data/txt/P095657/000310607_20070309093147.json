support\n            credit (PRSC-5) would be the second in a series of five\n            annual operations supporting the implementation of\n            Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction o\n            f Poverty (NSGRP or MKUKUTA in Kiswahili). PRSC-4, which was\n            approved by the World Bank's Board on May 9, 2006,\n            presented the five year PRSC program in support of the\n            MKUKUTA. The Bank's PRSC support to Tanzania is\n            provided within a framework for general budget support\n            (GBS), comprising a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF),\n            a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM) for GBS for the\n            implementation o f MKUKUTA, and a streamlined review\n            process. Discussion of the country context in Section Two\n            focuses on progress in realizing key outcomes targeted by\n            the MKUKUTA and supported by the PRSC, namely (1) sustained\n            high economic growth and accelerated reduction o f income\n            poverty, (2) improvements in non-income dimensions of\n            poverty, especially education, health, and water, and (3)\n            strengthened governance. Section Three outlines the\n            government's Program followed by the discussion of the\n            Bank's support to the government strategy in Section\n            Four. Section Five then provides details of the program\n            supported by the PRSC, highlighting specific reforms\n            implemented by government and progress towards specific\n            MKUKUTA objectives."}, "docdt": "2007-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
