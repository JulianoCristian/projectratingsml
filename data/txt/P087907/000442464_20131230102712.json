  Construction and Rehabilitation Project for Iraq were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Grantee performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            development progress in conflict-affected environments is\n            rarely predictable or linear and cannot be fully mitigated\n            through design. In fragile situations where conventional\n            supervision missions are not possible a Fiduciary Management\n            Agent (FMA) can help provide implementation support. In\n            fragile states, the World Bank should always assume low\n            institutional capacity and high turnover, and the design of\n            emergency projects in conflict affected situations should be\n            very simple, manageable in scope, and suitable to context,\n            with a primary focus on outputs. An early restructuring may\n            be advisable whenever a project implementation is faced with\n            major and persistent difficulties that seem to resist all\n            attempts to remedy. While the World Development Report (WDR)\n            2011 notes that institutional development is a generational\n            proposition, emergency responses can successfully develop\n            pockets of institutional capacity over the short-term. In\n            civil works projects, disbursement mechanisms need to be\n            designed in ways that facilitate project implementation and\n            that do not expose contractors to cash flow problems."}, "docdt": "2013-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
