1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background

1.1.1 Iraq was recovering from two decades of conflict and economic sanctions. In 2003
there was a change in Iraq’s ruling regime. The Project was approved in October 2004 at
a time of guarded optimism regarding post-war rehabilitation. Although there were
security issues, it could not have been foreseen that the situation would not improve
quickly enough to allow this emergency project to be completed in the original short time
period. However, shortly after the beginning of project implementation, the security
situation deteriorated with an insurgency that became widespread and set in motion a
nationwide epidemic of violence.

1.1.2 Abundant natural and human resources had enabled Iraq to attain the status of a
middle-income country in the 1970s. The country had developed good infrastructure and
well-performing education and health systems. Income per capita rose to over US$3,600
in the early 1980s. Since that time, successive wars and a repressive, state-dominated
economic system had stifled growth and development and debilitated basic infrastructure
and social services. Iraq's human development indicators were then among the lowest in
the region, and income per capita dropped to about US$770-1,020 by 2001, with
continued decline thereafter.

1.1.3 A Needs Assessment covering fourteen sectors, prepared jointly in 2003 by the
World Bank and United Nations Development Group (UNDG), estimated that Iraq
required about US$36.0 billion over four years. At an International Donors' Conference
for Iraq in Madrid on October 23-24, 2003, donors expressed support for the Needs
Assessment and pledged about US$32.0 billion for the four-year period covered by the
Needs Assessment. Donors also asked the World Bank and UNDG to set up an
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq to ensure swift, flexible, and
coordinated donor financing for priority investments consistent with the Needs
Assessment. The Facility consists of two trust funds—a World Bank Iraq Trust Fund
(ITF) and a UNDG Trust Fund—each with its own internal governance procedures and a
management structure that ensures close coordination. Donors in a follow-up meeting in
Abu Dhabi (February 18-29, 2004) allocated US$100 million for the education sector to
finance the Emergency Textbook Provision Project (ETPP) and the Emergency School
Construction and Rehabilitation Project (ESCRP) under review.

Education Sector

1.1.4 The education system in Iraq was widely regarded as one of the best in the Middle
East region until the 1980s, with near universal primary enrollment by 1980. During the
last decade of the twentieth century, the system deteriorated dramatically. Primary school
enrollment fell to 93 percent in 2000, while secondary school enrollment dropped from



                                            1
47 percent to 38 percent. More serious, however, was the large drop in attendance. In
2000, as many as 23 percent of primary school-aged children were not attending school,
with significantly higher rates among girls and in rural areas. This deterioration created or
exacerbated existing gender, urban/rural and regional inequities. Quality also declined at
all levels of the education system: teaching and learning conditions deteriorated, and
teacher quality eroded. Behind these developments was a substantial collapse in public
expenditure in the education system.

1.1.5 The need for repair and rehabilitation of schools and for new schools was
substantial. The Ministry of Education (MOE) identified almost US$700 million in
urgent repair and reconstruction needs over the next three years (2004 to 2006), and
US$80.0 million per year in textbook requirements. In 2004, there was a need for over
4,000 new buildings; more than 30 percent of schools were operating in double or triple
shifts in shared premises.

1.1.6 The priorities identified in the UNDG/World Bank Joint Needs Assessment were
endorsed by the Minister of Education at a meeting in Amman in October 2003 attended
by senior officials from the MOE, the World Bank, UNICEF, UNESCO, USAID and the
Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). In the Amman consultation, agreement was
reached on the following priorities: (i) capacity building for the development of a
strategic framework for the education sector, (ii) providing emergency school
reconstruction and supplies (including textbooks), (iii) initiating a curriculum reform
process, (iv) addressing immediate needs in teacher training, and (v) initiating a policy
dialogue on technical/vocational education and training (TVET).

Bank Response and Strategy

1.1.7 In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an
Interim Strategy Note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to act
as administrator of the World Bank ITF. The World Bank Group's interim strategy, which
initially covered the period February-October 2004, focused on: (i) building Iraqi
capacity which is urgently needed for the reconstruction program; (ii) preparing and
implementing emergency operations to generate employment and restore essential
infrastructure and services; and (iii) laying the foundation for the medium-term program,
through studies and policy advice. The strategy relied on the World Bank ITF to finance
projects, and on Bank budget for economic and sector work and policy advice.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 According to the World Bank ITF Grant Agreement (GA) for the original project
dated October 14, 2004, the objective of the Project was to improve conditions of
learning (of) students in primary and secondary schools in the Recipient’s territory
through the construction of new schools and rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent




                                             2
repair. The wording in the Technical Annex dated October 7, 2004 is slightly different. 1
It does not mention the construction of new schools, although it is clear from the
document that new schools are included. It does, however, refer to “new buildings for
existing schools;” if that wording had been retained for the GA, a Level One restructuring
in 2010 (when the PDO was amended to include the “extension of existing schools”)
would not have been required.

1.2.2 The Technical Annex dated October 7, 2004 does not mention monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) 2 and does not list any key performance indicators. The World Bank
ITF Grant Agreement (GA) dated October 14, 2004 indicates that the Project
Management Team (PMT) was responsible for the M&E of Project activities and that the
Project Advisory Committee (PAC) was responsible for monitoring key project indicators
which are stated in Schedule 5 of the GA. The indicators are output indicators: the
number of existing schools to be rehabilitated (144) and the number of new schools to be
constructed (117) in the 18 governorates.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

1.3.1 The original project was restructured in 2010 and the PDO was revised to read:
“The objective of the Project is to improve conditions of learning (of) students in primary
and secondary schools in the Recipient’s territory through the construction of new
schools, extension of existing schools and rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent
repair.”

1.3.2 The reason for the change was to include in the original project the “extension of
existing schools,” namely the construction of approximately 20 six-classroom blocks
(including toilets) in selected primary and secondary schools in Baghdad. In the
Restructuring Paper dated September 10, 2010, a new indicator was introduced for the
number of six-classroom blocks (target: 20), and the targets were revised for the number
of schools rehabilitated (133, down from 144) and the number of schools constructed (48,
down from 117). Targets were also revised accordingly for the numbers of students
benefiting from improved conditions of learning. The 2010 amendment to the GA deleted
Schedule 5 on Performance Indicators, which was replaced by a Supplemental Letter on
“Performance Monitoring Indicators” dated September 20, 2010 although it was signed
by the Recipient only on December 9, 2010.

through the construction of new buildings for existing schools in unsafe or shared facilities, and the

    At the time, the template for a Technical Annex did not include a section, chapter or paragraph on M&E.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 For the original project, the construction of new buildings would provide spaces for
about 56,000 students in primary and secondary schools, and the rehabilitation of schools
would benefit approximately 46,000 primary and secondary students. The project would
construct and rehabilitate schools in all 18 governorates of Iraq. The school buildings to
be constructed under the project (117) would address less than 3 percent of the backlog,
and the number of schools to be rehabilitated (144) was quite small compared to the
needs of the country. There were approximately 9,400 schools needing major
rehabilitation or reconstruction (85 percent of the total schools). Project schools
represented less than 3 percent of the total number of schools that needed to be
rehabilitated.

1.4.2 The Additional financing (AF) approved in 2006 was for constructing 36 small
primary schools in the marshland areas of Basrah, Thiqar and Missan and would create
6,000-8,000 additional student places and help stabilize the resettlement of approximately
36 communities in existing villages. The construction would be done using local labor. It
would strengthen the capacity of local MOE governorate staff since they would be
involved in site identification, procurement of local civil works and project monitoring,
under the supervision of the PMT. It would also strengthen the MOE’s capacity to
involve a wide range of local stakeholders, including local communities and local
authorities in the identification of school sites, monitoring of construction, and
maintenance of school buildings. The MOE would work with non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) contracted to mobilize local stakeholders and involve communities
in site improvement small works.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 There was no Project Appraisal Document (PAD), but a Technical Annex 3 for the
original project. According to the Technical Annex, the original project had two
components:

    1) Component 1: Construction and Rehabilitation of Primary and Secondary Schools
       (US$58.57 million). The grant would finance the construction of new buildings
       for about 110 primary and secondary schools in unsafe or overcrowded facilities,
       and the rehabilitation of about 140 schools.
    2) Component 2: Project Management and Capacity Building (US$1.43 million).
       The grant would finance the basic costs of the PMT to manage the project (but
       excluding salaries of the civil servants), together with the technical assistance and
       capacity building to ensure transfer of skills to the MOE staff as well as the audit
       costs.




3
 The ESCRP was processed under the Bank Emergency Recovery Assistance Procedures (OP 8.50) which
did not require the preparation of a PAD.


                                               4
1.5.2 It should be noted that the World Bank ITF GA dated October 14, 2004 had the
same number of schools to be constructed (approximately 110) and rehabilitated
(approximately 140) in its Schedule 2 on the “Description of the Project.” However,
Schedule 5 on “Performance Indicators” listed more specific numbers: 117 new schools
to be constructed and 144 existing schools to be rehabilitated. In the ICR, these numbers
(117 and 144) are the original targets for the project.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The 2006 Additional Financing added: (i) the construction of approximately 36 new
primary school buildings (US$5.7 million) in the marshland areas of the Governorates of
Basrah, Thiqar and Missan; (ii) site improvement small works (US$0.2 million)
involving NGOs to mobilize local community labor and monitor construction; and (iii)
support to project management and capacity building (US$0.1 million).

1.6.2 With the September 2010 Restructuring, the description of the original project
dealing with the construction and rehabilitation of primary and secondary schools was
modified as follows: (i) the construction of approximately 48 schools in all of the
Governorates in Iraq (down from the original 117); (ii) the rehabilitation of
approximately 133 primary and secondary schools in all of the Governorates in Iraq
which had been rehabilitated as early as the end of 2006 (down from the original 144);
and (iii) the construction of approximately 20 six-classroom blocks (including toilets) in
selected primary and secondary schools in Baghdad (a new activity).

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Major changes were the 2006 AF and the September 2010 Level One restructuring
changing the PDO. Other changes included amendments of the Grant Agreement for the
original project, particularly for extensions of the closing date and reallocations of the
proceeds of the Grant.

1.7.2 Additional Financing. On October 31, 2006, an AF Grant of US$6 million 4
(P087907, Grant Number TF053545) was provided to finance the costs associated with
construction of an additional 36 small primary schools in the marshland areas of three
governorates in southern Iraq (Basrah, Missan and Thi Qar). This AF, to be implemented
within twelve months, would contribute to the ESCRP’s development impact through
focusing on one of the most underserved areas in the country. The AF had the same PDO
and the same implementation arrangements as the original project. The AF closing date
was September 30, 2007; on July 5, 2007, it was extended to June 30, 2009 (the AF
closed on that date).



4
 Initially, the amount allocated for the AF was US$5.0 million. However, when the Emergency Textbook
Provision Project (ETPP) closed with an undisbursed amount of about US$1.0 million, the MOE and the
Bank Team recommended that the US$1.0 million, to be canceled from the ETPP Grant and returned to the
ITF, be allocated to the ESCRP AF (Marshland Schools).



                                                 5
1.7.3 Restructuring. The original project was restructured in September 2010. 5 The main
reason for the restructuring was the considerable delays in the construction of new
schools after six years of project implementation, and the increased cost of construction
that made meeting the project targets impossible. It is worth noting that restructuring
discussions were started in mid-2009, though the formal MOE request was received later
in 2010. This Level One restructuring (i) revised the PDO by adding to the construction
and rehabilitation of schools the extension of existing schools (see paragraph 1.3.1), (ii)
extended the closing date to June 30, 2012, (iii) reallocated grant proceeds, (iv) revised
the definition of the project (see paragraph 1.6.2), and (v) deleted Schedule 5 on
“Performance Indicators” with a corresponding rewording of a small paragraph in
Schedule 4 on M&E and a Supplemental Letter on “Performance Monitoring Indicators.”
New construction for primary and secondary schools was reduced from the original 117
to 48 schools, the rehabilitation of primary and secondary schools was reduced from 144
to 133 schools, and funding was provided for the construction of 20 additional six-
classroom blocks (including toilets) to alleviate overcrowding in selected primary and
secondary schools in five District Office of Education (DOE) areas in the Baghdad region.
The uncommitted balance of US$8.8 million would be used to finance these additional
constructions which were aligned with the Project’s objective to improve student learning
conditions. According to Bank documents, these changes were necessary for the
following main reasons: (i) security and/or ownerships issues which had resulted in
potential project sites being dropped from the project; (ii) changing priorities of the
MOE; and (iii) significant increases in construction costs since project effectiveness.

1.7.4 Extension of closing date of the original project. The closing date was extended
four times: (i) on June 21, 2007, the closing date was extended from June 30, 2007 to
June 30, 2009; (ii) on June 9, 2009, the closing date was extended from June 30, 2009 to
December 31, 2010; (iii) on November 3, 2010, as part of the Level Two Restructuring,
the closing date was extended from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2012; and (iv) on
June 18, 2012 the closing date was extended from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. In all
cases, the extension was to allow sufficient time for completion of all ongoing project
activities.

1.7.5 Reallocation of the Proceeds of the Grant. There were four reallocations of grant
proceeds for the original project, as follows:




5
 All documents refer to the September 20, 2010 restructuring because that is the date of the Bank letter
amending the Grant Agreement for the original project. However, the Restructuring became effective on
November 3, 2010, which is the date the Bank letter had been executed by all parties.

1.7.6 Compared to the original allocation of October 14, 2004, the amount allocated to
“civil works” remained about the same. There was a slight reduction in the amount
allocated to “goods”, and increases in the allocations for “Consultants’ services”,
“training” and “operating costs”.

1.7.7 Other amendments to the Grant Agreement. There were two other amendments to
the World Bank ITF GA for the original project:

    1) On January 22, 2007, the GA was amended to change the deadline for audit report
       submission from two months to six months after the end of the fiscal year (six
       months is the standard deadline for submission of audit reports).
    2) On March 19, 2008, the GA was amended to allow the use of a Special Account
       in Iraqi Dinars for the purposes of the Project. A new Schedule 6 – Special
       Account was added to the Grant Agreement. The Special Account was to be
       opened in a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, with an
       authorized allocation or IQD 1,210,000,000.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 During the project preparation and appraisal, the Bank was under considerable
pressure from external and internal stakeholders to move quickly and, as such, there was
limited time and available information to prepare an emergency project. As stated in the
Independent Review of the Iraq Trust Fund 6, “providing assistance to countries in crisis,

Orbit Consultants and Management Development - December 21, 2011



                                                 7
especially crises as extreme as the one in Iraq, is challenging. Intervening in these
turbulent circumstances cannot be held to the same rigorous account as intervening in
more peaceable circumstances where the complexities may be significant but insecurity
and extreme social tension are less pervasive”.

Soundness of the Background Analysis

2.1.1 The Project was designed to address one of the priorities identified in the
UNDG/World Bank Joint Needs Assessment and endorsed by the Minister of Education:
“providing emergency reconstruction and supplies (including textbooks)”. Initially, the
project included both school rehabilitation and textbooks, but it was split into two
separate projects. The education sector’s capacity-building needs would be addressed
through an education component of the Multi-Sectoral Institutional Capacity Building
Project. An MOE Situation Analysis identified almost US$700 million in urgent repair
and reconstruction needs over the next three years (2004 to 2006). Of the 12,000 schools
requiring repairs, over 4,600 required major repair and reconstruction and around 1,300
needed to be demolished and rebuilt.

Assessment of Project Design

2.1.2 According to the Technical Annex, the project design applied one of the lessons
from post conflict experience, namely the value of early and visible impact, and the
importance of rapid resumption of normal schooling operations to permit the education
authorities to focus energy on wider system reform. Rehabilitating or constructing school
buildings is not in itself complicated, but the target for the construction of new schools
turned out to be unrealistic because of the deterioration in the security situation and the
generally weak implementation capacity in the country. This illustrates the difficulty of
designing a project in the Iraq context.

2.1.3 The Technical Annex included detailed information on implementation
arrangements and risks. As for all projects financed by the ITF, the Bank would rely on
the Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to monitor project implementation, particularly
physical delivery/progress, and the recipients’ compliance with financial management
and procurement procedures.

2.1.4 The Project was prepared in accordance with Emergency Recovery Assistance
Procedures - Operational Policy 8.50. 7 The Bank Task Team was required to use a
template for the Technical Annex (TA) which did not include a section on M&E, so there
is no description of M&E arrangements in the TA. According to the GA (dated October
14, 2004), the PAC would be responsible for monitoring key project indicators, and the
PMT would be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of project activities.
Performance indicators, included in Schedule 5 of the GA, were output indicators—the



7
    OP 8.50 was replaced in March 2007 by OP 8.00 on “Rapid Responses to Crises and Emergencies.”




                                                   8
number of schools to be rehabilitated and constructed in different phases—and the PDO
was based on outputs. This focus on outputs was appropriate, given the emergency nature
of the operation. Conditions in the country were difficult; the Project addressed the most
urgent needs (albeit a very small part of those needs) to improve educational services,
and the main concern was to obtain concrete results and to obtain them quickly. The
Bank was prudent to limit the commitments to output results because so much else was
outside of the scope of influence of the Bank and the MOE.

2.1.5 Unfortunately the project design included an extremely short deadline of two
months for the submission of audits reports (whereas the norm had always been six
months), and did not include a Special/Designated Account. Direct payments to
contractors, consultants and suppliers for contracts above the threshold of US$10,000
turned out to be difficult with long delays for the transfer of funds, and the MOE had
difficulty providing funds from its own resources to cover expenditures below
US$10,000. Those two shortcomings in implementation arrangements had to be corrected
during project implementation.

Government Commitment

2.1.6 Although government commitment is not discussed in the Technical Annex, it is
clear that Government was fully committed to the Project. The ESCRP addressed one of
the priorities endorsed by the MOE, it was prepared through extensive consultations with
the MOE, and in January 2004 the Minister of Education made a special trip to
Washington, D.C. to discuss World Bank support to Iraq’s education sector. There was a
strong government ownership as evidenced by the establishment of the Project Advisory
Committee (PAC) chaired by the Minister of Education to oversee and guide the project
and facilitate coordination with key ministries.

Assessment of Risk

2.1.7 The Project would be undertaken in an uncertain and highly risky environment. One
of the risks identified in the TA was that the security conditions might deteriorate,
making access by contractors to sites and supervision difficult, so that the MOE would be
unable to complete project activities on time. Financial management, procurement and
overall project risks were also appropriately rated as high in a detailed and candid section
of the Technical Annex which listed the measures being taken to mitigate these risks.
Generally, the mitigation measures proposed appeared appropriate at the design stage

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 When the Project was approved in October 2004, there was hope that Iraq would
graduate from being an in-conflict country to a post-conflict country. However, within six
months of approval, security conditions in the country deteriorated dramatically.
Although there were some improvements after about two years, the political situation
remained volatile and extremely fragile for most of the project period—with deterioration
in the security situation even in the last few months of the Project.



                                             9
2.2.2 The main factors beyond the Government’s or implementing agency’s control that
influenced project implementation and ultimately the project outcomes were as follows:

   1)     The critical security situation in many parts of the country which made it
          difficult for MOE staff and contractors to travel within the country and carry
          out their assignments. Some school constructions were canceled because of
          security issues.
   2)     The weak implementation capacity generally in Iraq. Contract management
          capacity was low; MOE and PMT staffs were not knowledgeable with Bank
          Procedures and Guidelines; and the capacity of the private sector was also
          weak due to years of isolation, wars and the poor security environment. Some
          payment delays emanated from problems in the preparation by contractors of
          complete and accurate payment requests submitted to the PMT.
   3)     Delays in the carrying out of soil tests for all civil works sites, because of the
          limited number of qualified laboratories.
   4)     The appreciation of the Iraqi Dinar which contributed to project cost increases.
   5)     Direct payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants were delayed in part
          because of serious delays in the transfer, through the Iraqi banking system, of
          IQD from the Bank to the beneficiaries’ accounts.
   6)     Tribal problems and lack of interest by contractors, which caused six schools
          in the marshland areas to be canceled.
   7)     The NGOs’ lack of knowledge and experience of development activities in
          Iraq, which made it difficult to implement the site improvement small works
          for the primary schools in the marshland areas.
   8)     The inability of the Bank Task Team to visit Iraq and of the PMT to visit
          project sites. However, this shortcoming was offset somewhat by the work of
          the FMA.

2.2.3 The factors under Government control that influenced project implementation were
as follows:

   1)     Capacity limits of the PMT, and their difficulty at times to establish effective
          working relationships with the education authorities in some governorates.
   2)     Changes in management in the MOE and PMT (which led to deterioration in
          team work and productivity) and a high staff turnover. However, staffing
          issues improved in the last two years of the Project.
   3)     Procurement delays, particularly in the selection of design and supervision
          consultants (it was difficult to recruit good consultants) for the construction of
          new schools and delays in the review and approval of designs for preparation
          of bidding documents.
   4)     Cost escalation, due in part to deviations from MOE standard plans. Standard
          designs were not used for project schools. The designs produced by the
          consultants for individual schools not only deviated from the Ministry
          standards in terms of scope and specifications with the inclusion of additional
          facilities, but also suffered from excessive architectural treatments and
          decorative embellishments affecting the cost of these schools.



                                           10
   5)      The practice of contractors subcontracting the entirety of their contract to
           subcontractors against a commission, which affected project cost and progress
           of works.
   6)      Cash flow problems of contractors because of huge differences between
           physical progress and payments to contractors. These differences were due to
           the fact that contractors were often late in submitting invoices, but were also
           due to lengthy payment processes, including prolonged internal procedures
           (such as the requirement of more than 15 signatures to pay one invoice) and at
           times redundant internal controls. The Bank Task Team worked closely with
           the MOE/PMT to streamline procedures and cut back redundant procedures in
           order to reduce payment delays.
   7)      The Project benefitted from an excellent Master Implementation Manual
           (MIM) developed by the Bank to be used by Iraqi Ministries for all ITF-
           financed projects. The MIM captured the best practices in procurement, FM
           and management, and included standard bidding documents in Arabic and
           English that were used throughout the project life for the contracts financed by
           the Bank. Section A (a) of Schedule 4 of the GA required that a draft Project
           Implementation Manual (PIM) be also prepared and approved by MOE. A
           PIM was prepared by Bank staff and discussed with the MOE/PMT, but it was
           never approved by MOE. However, the Project adopted a manual dealing with
           financial management and disbursements.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

2.3.1 The arrangements for monitoring and evaluation were not described in the
Technical Annex but, according to the Grant Agreement (GA), the PMT would be
responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. The key performance
indicators included in an annex to the GA were the numbers of schools to be rehabilitated
or constructed, with separate figures for the various implementation phases. The focus
on outputs was in line with the PDO wording; it was very appropriate for an emergency
project that aimed to address some of the most urgent needs and obtain concrete results
quickly.

M&E Implementation

2.3.2 In the project’s early years, the World Bank and the MOE/PMT monitored as “PDO
Outcome Indicators” the number of schools rehabilitated and the number of schools
constructed, listing as “Intermediate Outcome Indicators” the numbers of schools
rehabilitated or constructed under each phase. The 2006 Additional Financing monitored
as an indicator the number of schools completed in the marshland areas, but added
indicators on enrollment by sex and governorate and on local stakeholder involvement.
However, these new indicators on gender had no baseline and targets and applied only to
the schools in the marshland areas. When the project was restructured towards the end of
2010, the focus was shifted to the numbers of students benefiting from the schools



                                            11
rehabilitated and constructed, which became the new “PDO Outcome Indicators,”
whereas the numbers of schools were monitored as “Intermediate Outcome Indicators.”
The number of students was used as a proxy to follow up on whether the schools are
operational.

2.3.3 Right from the beginning efforts were made by the World Bank to develop an M&E
capacity within the MOE/PMT. In 2005, an MOE officer (MOE official) was assigned to
the PMT. Because there is a lack of knowledge even on the most basic aspects of MOE
and practical experience is limited in Iraq, progress has been very slow; PMT M&E
capacity remained weak during most of the project implementation. In 2011, the PMT
recruited an M&E consultant with a six-month contract which was not renewed because
the MOE/PMT decided to give the responsibility for M&E to one of its staff members.
Since the M&E concept was not clear for many Iraqi, in October 2011 a presentation on
results-based M&E was given by the World Bank team, covering the importance of M&E,
the role of M&E in World Bank-supported projects, and the elements of an M&E system,
including the development of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and
Timely) indicators. The critical role of data and regular reporting of indicator progress
was highlighted. The development of a detailed protocol for data collection, management
and reporting (including definitions and responsible staff) was discussed and a sample
form was provided. The PMT managed to overcome the obstacles in obtaining data on
student enrollments which were due to: (i) the lack of an adequate national education
management information system, including student data; and (ii) the need to request the
data from many sources due to data quality issues and/or response times. For example,
due to discrepancies between student numbers for each school provided by the central
MOE, DOEs and/or schools, it was sometimes necessary to obtain the data directly from
the DOEs or schools. In addition, the lack of connection between the central MOE and
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) MOE resulted in significant difficulties in
obtaining the student numbers for the KRG schools. In order to obtain data from the
MOEs, DOEs or schools, in many cases direct follow-up was required which was often
hindered by the difficult security conditions in parts of the country.

2.3.4 With the World Bank’s close support, considerable progress was made in the last
two years of the Project when a PMT staff member was responsible for M&E, which is a
good example of the importance of developing in-house capacity. By the project’s end,
the PMT was able to obtain satisfactory student data from the vast majority of schools
and to submit acceptable quarterly progress reports. This was a considerable achievement.

M&E Utilization

2.3.5 With its increased capacity towards the project end, the PMT was able to respond to
ad hoc requests for information updates. Monitoring tables were prepared and used
satisfactorily8 by the PMT to monitor the progress of rehabilitation and construction. It

8
  In 2008, however, M&E was downgraded to “unsatisfactory” because it failed to notice that two schools
in the Anbar governorate were not built on the designated sites. In addition, when the M & E Officer
visited Anbar Governorate on a "fact-finding mission", he failed to go to the sites himself.



                                                  12
seems, however, that the PMT’s M&E data were not evaluated and used to inform
decision-making and resource allocation at the ministry level.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary Monitoring Agent

2.4.1 When the ITF was created in 2003, the ITF donors required that the World Bank, as
Administrator of the ITF, engage an FMA. The main purpose of the FMA was to help the
Bank monitor physical delivery/progress, and the recipients’ compliance with financial
management and procurement procedures. As part of this function, the FMA provided
on-the-job training to the PMTs. The FMA visited all ESCRP sites throughout Iraq every
quarter and carried out physical verification with digital photographs of ongoing works,
alerting the Bank to deficiencies in quality and implementation. The Bank Task Team for
the ESCRP kept close communication with the FMA during implementation, and invited
the FMA to participate in all supervision missions.

2.4.2 The work of the FMA has been very beneficial to the Project. The FMA
performance demonstrates that, in contexts where the Bank cannot carry out normal
supervision missions, the Bank can mitigate risks for its program by employing an agent
to monitor physical implementation of projects and verify that funds are spent for the
purpose intended and in accordance with Bank rules.

Financial Management and Disbursements

2.4.3 According to the Technical Annex, for the rehabilitation/construction component
disbursements for contracts above a threshold of US$10,000 would be made by direct
payments by the World Bank to the contractors, consultants and vendors directly into
their accounts in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the
international banking system. For the project management component and other
payments below the threshold of US$10,000, payments would be made by the Recipient
from its own resources. These payments made from the Recipient's own resources would
be reimbursed, on a periodical basis, by the World Bank to the MOE upon presentation of
proof of payment. There would be no special/designated account. The MOE-PMT and
the main financial counterparts from the MOE would be subject to intensive training in
Bank disbursement procedures. The financial management risk was considered as “high.”
The control environment and accounting systems would require strengthening and close
monitoring to be able to generate timely project reports for project management and
monitoring purposes. The FMA would review Project expenditures. The audit report
along with the related financial statements would be submitted to the World Bank not
later than two months after the end of the fiscal year.

2.4.4 The main issue was the delays in payments to contractors, consultants and suppliers.
There were serious delays (up to three months, on average 60 days, which is more than
twice the time stated in the contract - 28 days) in the transfer of Iraqi Dinar (IQD)
payments from the World Bank through the banking system in Iraq to the beneficiaries’



                                           13
accounts. Contractors were often late in submitting invoices, but payment delays were
also due to lengthy PMT internal review and approval processes. The World Bank Task
Team and the MOE/PMT worked together to streamline procedures and eliminate
redundant steps, and the PMT M&E Unit developed a system to keep track of time spent
on each step in the process.

2.4.5 For a few years, financial management was rated in the unsatisfactory range
because of the payment delays, but also because of weak internal controls which resulted
in the discovery of ineligible expenditures. Audit reports for 2008 and 2009 were
qualified because of ineligible expenditures. The MOE had to reimburse to the Bank: (i)
US$1.5 million for the two schools in Anbar Governorates that were built on sites that
were not the sites designated in the contracts; and (ii) US$61,519 for fraudulent invoicing
by a procurement consulting firm.

2.4.6 The World Bank and the FMA assisted the PMT to improve financial management
performance, particularly with tracing payments and providing monitoring sheets and
other kinds of support. The Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs) and accounting
records have been generally satisfactory. Some audits were delayed because of security
conditions, and because of the unrealistic deadline (two months) to submit audit reports.
On January 22, 2007, the GA was amended to increase to six months the deadline for
submission. On March 19, 2008, the GA was amended to allow the use of a
Special/Designated Account in Iraqi Dinars, and a new Schedule 6 was added to the GA.
The Project was a pilot for the introduction of a Designated Account (DA), and the
successful use of the DA played a role in the decision made in 2010 to generalize its use
to the entire Bank portfolio in Iraq. The final audit for 2013 up to the end of the grace
period (October 31, 2013) is due by December 31, 2013.

Procurement

2.4.7 According to the Technical Annex, all procurement of works would follow National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) or Shopping. Procurement based on the NCB procedure
would be done using the Bank's Standard Bidding Document for small works until an
NCB bidding document for works is prepared and found satisfactory by the Bank. The
procurement of goods would also be done using NCB, Shopping Procedures, and in
exceptional cases, Direct Contracting for procurement of goods of small values such as
office supplies and equipment as described in the procurement plan. The operating costs
financed by the grant would be procured using the MOE administrative procedures for
shopping satisfactory to the World Bank.

2.4.8 The overall project risk for procurement was rated as “high.” Mitigating measures
included the recruitment of an international procurement consulting firm to build MOE
capacities to carry out and manage procurement activities. Because of security issues, the
MOE had great difficulty in hiring an international firm. The firm that was finally
recruited did not perform well and was investigated following allegations of fraudulent
practices. A review by the Bank Integrity Vice-Presidency identified two types of issues:
(i) fraudulent invoicing (in accordance with assessments made by the FMA and the



                                            14
Bank’s INT, US$61,519 in ineligible expenditures was reimbursed by the MOE to the
Bank); and (ii) unsatisfactory performance of contracting services.

2.4.9 Contract management of both consultancy and works contracts was a major issue
during the whole project period. Despite all the efforts, and success stories for some
contracts, there were long delays in implementation of the works. The implementation
schedules were not being updated on a monthly or even bi-monthly basis as required in
the contracts, and delays were being addressed in an ad-hoc reactionary method instead
of a proactive one to prevent delays before occurrence. The financial progress in most
packages was far behind physical progress, having a negative effect on the cash flow of
the contractors. Additionally as the result of delays, some of which could be attributed to
the cash flow problem, a large number of contracts faced sudden deduction of liquidated
damages 9 which further constrained the cash flows. Finally, the project experience shows
that, considering the relative small size of the contracts involved and the scattered nature
of school buildings being located in different social-ethnical- religious areas, it is better to
rely on local DOE’s Committees to supervise construction activities where they have
sufficient capacity rather than on consulting firms.

Safeguards

2.4.10 The Project was rated category "B" for environment. According to the Technical
Annex, impacts would be those associated mainly with: (i) construction works (e.g.
safety, dust, noise, pesticides, waste material, traffic); (ii) provision of sanitary services,
water supply and waste management; and (iii) maintenance of facilities. New
construction would be limited only to vacant sites that are on public property assigned by
the relevant authorities for the use of the MOE. OP 4.12 was not expected to be triggered.

2.4.11 As ESCRP was an emergency operation its safeguards were governed by the 2003
ESSAF as well as the revised ESSAF, issued in April 2006. The ESSAF provided a
safeguard compliance approach to ensure due diligence in managing potential
environmental and social risks, as well as general principles, guidelines and code of
practices and procedures for all stages of the operation. The ESSAF was properly
disclosed on the MOE website. In the Project’s early years, the MOE/PMT had some
difficulty in properly monitoring the ESSAF. However, with Bank support, the situation
improved and, in recent years, the implementing agency complied with evaluating all
ESCRP sites according to the "Checklist of Likely Environmental and Social Impacts of
Sub-projects,” and suggesting appropriate mitigation measures. There was a considerable
amount of time during project implementation when the PMT did not have a safeguards
specialist on-board. However, the FMA, through their construction monitoring and
documentation Factsheets captured, visually and otherwise, all issues relating to the


9
 The application of liquidated damages was done systematically as soon as the intended completion date
was reached, as required under the contact. The problem is that, because of poor contract management
practice, contract completion dates were not always extended in cases where delays were not caused by the
contractors.



                                                   15
"Codes of Practice for Prevention and Mitigation of Environmental Impacts - Checklist
of Likely Environmental and Social Impacts of Subprojects" as appended to construction
contracts. Safeguards-specific Quarterly Progress Reporting started in 2012 and has been
of an adequate quality, supplementing the monitoring information from the FMA
Factsheets. Additionally, Third-Party Monitoring reports have also identified systemic
safeguards issues in the education sector. Historical and current safeguards
documentation is now up-to-date, with aggregate safeguards reporting which is clear and
consistent with design, construction, and post-construction on-site assessments at each
site.

2.4.12 The PMT has invested in and trained a junior engineer and included safeguards
supervision in her work program; this is a more sustainable solution than employing an
outside consultant. The quality of the Quarterly Progress Reports improved incrementally
with each quarter, and the PMT was quite responsive to suggested opportunities for
increased quality in safeguards monitoring and reporting. As there were only moderate
shortcomings (in client capacity and quality of supervision reporting) which did not have
a material impact on compliance with policy requirements or achievement of
development objectives or implementation progress, overall safeguards performance was
rated “Moderately Satisfactory” in the last ISR.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 The delivery of educational services by the MOE is a continuous operation
independent of the duration of any project, so explicit transition arrangements are not
required.

2.5.2 Some existing schools have been rehabilitated and new facilities have been
completed. Teachers are available, and the schools are operational. Recurrent costs are
met from the MOE operational budget.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

3.1.1 The objectives, design and implementation of the Project were and remain highly
relevant to Iraq’s priorities to rebuild its essential infrastructure and services. One of the
goals of the Iraq National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014 is to reduce poverty by
30 percent from 2007 levels by focusing on, inter alia, the provision of basic services
such as education and health care services, particularly for vulnerable groups such as
youths and women. The objectives are also consistent with the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for the period FY13-FY16; one of the outcome areas of the CPS is
improved delivery of health, education and water supply services.




                                             16
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Given that the Project was formally restructured (first order restructuring), this
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) will assess the project’s outcome
“before” and “after” restructuring, in accordance with World Bank ICR Guidelines.

Achievement of PDO before restructuring
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.2.2 When the Project was restructured in September 2010, it was six years old.
Implementation had been hampered by: (i) the critical security situation in many parts of
the country; (ii) weak capacity in MOE/PMT and consultants and contractors; (iii) cost
escalation due to the appreciation of the Iraqi Dinar, but also to building designs for
individual schools that deviated from the MOE standards (standard MOE designs were
not used for project schools); and (iv) procurement and payment delays.

3.2.3. Not counting the additional financing which was closed with 86 percent of the
amount disbursed, about 85 percent of the funds for the original project had been
committed (approximately US$51.0 million) and 67 percent (approximately US$45.3
million) had been disbursed at the time of the restructuring. Achievements compared to
the original targets were as follows:

     1) Schools rehabilitated in 18 governorates: 133 schools rehabilitated, or 92 percent
        of the 144 target. All those 133 rehabilitations were completed by the end of 2006.
        Number of students benefiting: 44,848 10, or 98 percent of the 45,700 target.
     2) New schools constructed in 18 governorates: 31 new schools completed, or 26
        percent of the 117 target (with 17 schools still under construction). Number of
        students benefiting: 12,480, or 22 percent of the 56,160 target.
     3) Primary schools constructed in Marshland areas: 30, or 83 percent of the 36 target.
        These schools benefit 5,400 students, or 68-90 percent of the 6,000-8,000 target.

3.2.4 No target was met, but the main shortcoming was for school construction in 18
governorates. Since the Project was three years behind schedule and the closing date had
already been extended twice, the restructuring opted for completing the 17 schools under
construction but not starting new schools that could take too long, and using the
uncommitted balance to add six-classroom block extensions (with toilets) to 20 existing
Baghdad schools that could presumably be carried out relatively quickly.




10
  The figure of 44,848 was the best estimate at the time of restructuring of the number of students
benefiting from the 133 rehabilitated schools in 2009. It is most likely underestimated, because a recent
report by the MOE/PMT indicates that the number of beneficiary students was 59,194 in 2007 when all 133
rehabilitations were already completed; unfortunately, that recent report does not give updated figures for
2009.



                                                    17
3.2.5 In view of the serious shortcomings in new constructions the first six years of
project implementation, the achievement of the PDO before restructuring is rated
“Moderately Unsatisfactory.” This is in line with the ISR ratings from December 2006 to
July 2011: 10 out of the 11 ratings were “Moderately Unsatisfactory’ for both PDO and
Implementation Progress (see Data Sheet).

Achievement of PDO after restructuring
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.2.6 After restructuring in September 2010, with the school rehabilitations in 18
governorates and the schools in the marshland areas already done, and 31 new schools in
18 governorates already constructed, the focus was on completing the 17 new schools
under construction in 18 governorates and adding six-classroom blocks in 20 Baghdad
schools.

3.2.7 The lack of security, capacity limits and payment delays, among other problems,
continued to hinder project implementation. However, with the strong support of the
Bank Task Team, the MOE/PMT was able to bring the Project to a satisfactory
conclusion, although it took longer than anticipated (two-and-a-half years, instead of one-
and-a-half , with a fourth extension of the closing date). Results are as follows:


   (i) The revised target of 48 was met for the construction of new schools in 18
       governorates, and two more schools under construction could be finished with
       financing under the Third Emergency Education Project (TEEP). Of the 48 new
       schools that have been completed, 46 are now operational, benefiting 30,623
       children, of which 14,282 (or 47 percent) are boys and 16,341 (or 53 percent), are
       girls. Although only 46 schools are operational, the number of students is well
       above the revised target of 23,040 students, but below the initial target of 56,160.

   (ii) Although the MOE/PMT started work on 21 six-classroom block extensions (with
        toilets), the target of 20 extensions was not reached. The number of completed
        six-classroom blocks is 18 for 12 primary and 6 secondary schools. The slow
        implementation progress and the fact that the target was not reached have been
        due in part to a legal issue with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
        Research (MOHESR) involving a contractor who was selected to build nine of the
        21 six-classroom blocks (completion of the three remaining blocks could be
        financed under the TEEP). Although the 18 six-classroom blocks extensions (with
        toilet) created 4,320 new available seats, the extensions are now benefiting 4,028
        children (2,235 boys and 1,793 girls, based on the proportion between boys and
        girls for the whole schools), compared to the target of 4,800 children.

   (iii) Obviously, the revised target of 133 rehabilitated schools was met because those
        rehabilitations were already completed by the end of 2006. The 133 rehabilitated
        schools are now benefiting 80,576 students, which is 176 percent of the original
        target and 180 percent of the revised target. From 2007 on, the project did not
        intervene any more in those 133 schools so increases in the number of students


                                            18
       since 2007 cannot reasonably be attributed to the Project. It seems that the
       increase in the number of students in rehabilitated schools since 2007 is due to a
       number of factors, including the introduction of double shifts and in certain cases
       some overcrowding.

3.2.8 The achievement of the PDO after restructuring is rated “Moderately Satisfactory,”
which is in line with the ISRs ratings since December 2011 for both the PDO and
Implementation Progress (see Data Sheet).

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 During preparation and appraisal, limited attention was given to economic aspects,
given the emergency nature of the operation and taking into account the country context.
The Project was prepared as part of the interim strategy of the World Bank in addressing
the pressing needs of the sector and according to the emergency recovery assistance
procedures (OP 8.50). The lack of reliable statistics, the limited economic information,
and the speed with which the Project was prepared have prevented more detailed analysis,
a familiar constraint in such operations.

3.3.2 The only relevant information in the Technical Annex is the statement that “the
benefits of the Project’s investment are expected to be substantial compared to its costs,
as it addresses urgent needs in an environment of devastated infrastructure, deteriorating
quality, and escalating needs. The Project will support the construction of 117 school
buildings and will create 42,000 spaces for primary and secondary students at an average
cost of US$1,150 per student space and will rehabilitate 144 schools with 45,700 students
at an average cost of US$181 per student. This will expand the capacity, reduce double
and triple shift schools, improve the conditions of learning, and enhance the quality of
education. Recurrent costs of the project schools will be met from the MOE operational
budget. The MOE budget provides for furniture and equipment for the new school
buildings. Future maintenance costs of the new school buildings and the rehabilitated
schools will be a relatively small share of the overall MOE budget and do not constitute a
sustainability problem.”

3.3.3 No economic evaluation of the Project has been carried out upon its completion,
and none is planned. This is an area where Iraqi expertise is not strong, so that if such an
evaluation were to be carried out, it would have to be done by Bank staff or an external
specialist; this is not possible for the time being because of the continuing security
situation. Unfortunately, the ICR mission could not compare the costs of the project
schools with the costs of similar schools contracted by the DOEs. Some existing schools
were built in the 1960s and are very primitive with small classrooms with no laboratories
and libraries. When new architects were hired to adapt existing plans, the standards were
improved, areas got larger and construction methods were improved for stability and
durability. Basically, the ESCRP designs were more modern and offered additional
services and facilities, including car parks, canteens, guardrooms, electrical rooms, and
walkways. Also, the ESCRP designs used soil investigations that have reduced the risks
of construction. In summary, the ESCRP schools were more modern in terms of design



                                            19
   and facilities, and of better quality than schools contracted by the DOEs. Under the
   ESCRP, construction costs varied across governorates due to differences in cost of labor
   and security conditions. But on average ESCRP project schools were at least 20 percent
   more expensive than DOEs schools. However, because of the better quality of project

   3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

   3.4.2 In terms of the number of schools, no target was reached, but the main problem was
   with the construction of new schools in the 18 governorates. Regarding the number of
   students benefiting from improved learning conditions, the substantial increase for the
   rehabilitated schools stands out in contrast to the rather low results for the other school
   facilities. However, the rehabilitation of the 133 schools was completed by the end of
   2006. From 2007 on, the Project did not intervene any more in those schools, so that the
   increase in the number of students since 2007 cannot be reasonably attributed to the
   Project 11.



   11
     It seems that the increase in the number of students in rehabilitated schools since 2007 is due to a number
   of factors, including the introduction of double shifts and in certain cases some overcrowding.

3.4.3 The additional financing for Marshland schools mobilized in 2006 is cited in a
comprehensive review of projects financed by the Iraq Trust Fund 12 . It assesses the
design and implementation of this aspect of ESCRP at 81 percent (treated in the review
as a separate activity from ESCRP) and the 6th best performing project of the 20
operations funded by the ITF. The additional financing was specifically recognized for
being completed without the delays that affected almost all other operations in Iraq. This
was due in large part to the Team’s emphasis on community consultations with a wide
range of stakeholders (including local leaders, and community groups), to reduce local
concerns, build ownership and facilitate timely implementation.
3.4.4 Since the PDO was formally revised (first order restructuring), project outcome
must be assessed against both the original and revised project objectives. Separate
outcome ratings (against original and revised project objectives) must be weighted in
proportion to the share of actual grant disbursements made before and after restructuring,
as shown in the table below. 13

                                                 Against     Against           Overall

      Unsatisfactory = 3; Unsatisfactory = 2; and Highly Unsatisfactory = 1.
      **% disbursed before/after PDO change

3.4.5 The achievement of the PDO is rated “Moderately Unsatisfactory” before
restructuring and “Moderately Satisfactory” after restructuring. At restructuring,
US$45.28 million (approximately 69 percent of the revised US$65.17 million grant
amount, including the additional financing) was disbursed. In the above table, the
weighted value of 3.31 corresponds to a rating between “Moderately Satisfactory” and
“Moderately Unsatisfactory,” but closer to “Moderately Unsatisfactory” so that, through
a mechanical application of the ICR Guidelines, the overall rating could be rounded to
“Moderately Unsatisfactory.” Such an unfavorable rating would be due in great part to
the fact that the restructuring was delayed for too long. A lesson to be drawn from this
unfavorable outcome rating is that an early restructuring may be advisable whenever a
project implementation is faced with major and persistent difficulties that seem to resist
all attempts to remedy. However, as explained in the Independent Review of the Iraq

Trust Fund 14 carried out in 2011, “reviews of Iraqi operations need to adapt evaluative
practices to circumstances in Iraq recognizing the unavoidable limitations on project
performance. Expectations for meeting original expectations must be tempered with the
numerous impediments for doing so. Judging performance must be contextualized within
what is possible under the circumstances.” The Project remains highly relevant, and
through it Iraq received good value for money. The project was implemented under
conditions of insecurity and violence that were not envisaged when the activities and
targets were set. Yet, revised targets have been met, substantially met, or in some
instances exceeded. This, together with evidence of M&E capacity development and
progress in improving gender balance, provides adequate justification for an Overall
Outcome Rating of “Moderately Satisfactory.”

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The project schools increased access to education for school-age girls. Based on the
latest information available, the percentage of female students is 43 percent in the
rehabilitated schools in the 18 governorates, 53 percent in the newly constructed schools
in the 18 governorates, 44 percent in the six-classroom block (and toilet) extensions, and
45 percent in the primary schools in the marshland areas. Regarding the marshland
schools, 47 percent of parents surveyed in the target areas indicated that their school-age
girls would have stayed home if the project schools had not been built.

3.5.2 The AF included a very small amount (US$200,000) to finance the recruitment of
NGOs to mobilize local communities and to undertake site improvement small works
using community labor. Results of that experiment are mixed, because of the lack of
experience of Iraqi NGOs at the time with development activities, and a lack of clarity
regarding their terms of reference (TOR) and the way their activities should be managed.
Two local NGOs were recruited, and 30 committees were constituted at the local
community level. The two NGOs played a role in project planning. However, council
members and community leaders surveyed, who reported that they were consulted in the
planning phase of the project, indicated that they did not observe NGOs perform any
work after the planning phase.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3 The Project included technical assistance and capacity building to ensure transfer of
skills to the MOE staff. MOE capacity was built in several areas including: (i) managing
the implementation of a donor-financed project and using lessons-learned from project
implementation in post-conflict countries; (ii) utilizing World Bank procedures and
procurement methods that meet international standards; and (iii) building financial

management capacity including accounting, disbursements, budgeting, internal controls,
and flow of funds. Under the Iraq Capacity Building Projects I and II, many training
activities on procurement, FM, disbursements, contract management, dispute resolution,
red flags and integrity in public procurement were organized by the World Bank for all
PMTs/PMUs of ITF and IDA projects. The MOE/PMT staff participated in all workshops
that took place in Baghdad, Amman and Beirut. These training activities were in addition
to the FMA training sessions and to the on-the- job training on procurement and contract
management provided to the MOE/PMT staff during implementation support missions
for the ESCRP. During project implementation, 158 MOE staff received training (88 in
financial management and auditing 15 and 70 in contract and construction management) to
develop their capacity and improve their skills.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.4 Based on the ESCRP experience, under the Third Emergency Education Project
(TEEP) prototype designs were developed for each type of schools 16 and have been used
for the schools included in that project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Two beneficiary surveys, or social assessments, were carried out for this project by
the Iraqi Research Foundation for Analysis and Development (IRFAD). IRFAD reports
were issued in January 2010 for the primary schools in the Marshland areas financed by
the additional financing, and in October 2013 for schools in the original project. The
main objective of those surveys was to assess the extent to which the construction of new
schools contributed to improving the learning conditions of students and to increasing
enrolment for both girls and boys. Annex 5 presents the results of those beneficiary
surveys.

3.6.2 Regarding the primary schools in the Marshland areas, the original enrollment
targets (creation of 6,000 to 8,000 school places) have not been met. Many headmasters
reported that classrooms were too small, and that their schools would not be able to
handle increased enrollment. However, the co-educational schools did increase access to
education for school-age girls in the target areas. Regarding the appropriateness of the
sites selected for school construction, most parents approved the school sites, but there
was no consensus among council members and community leaders. Parents, local council
members, and community leaders in all three provinces largely expressed approval of the
project planning process, and most of them were aware of the NGO role in project


15
  Training programs covered different topics related to financial management, accounting and auditing,
including but not limited to: i) preparation & presentation of financial reports, ii) techniques for the
discovery of violations and financial fraud, iii) modern techniques in auditing and control, and iv)
budgeting and forecasting.

planning. However, all respondents indicated that they had not observed any NGO
performing improvement work on the school. Most of the parents, local council members
and community leaders said that the new schools, where they are operational, were
“beneficial” for the community. The involvement of local communities and civil society
in the process appears to have enhanced community sense of ownership of the project
schools.

3.6.3 Regarding the schools in the original project, the social assessment highlighted that
there is a great demand in Iraq for new school construction. Even when respondents are
not entirely satisfied with the physical building or services (such as water, electricity or
sanitation) at the project site, most are very supportive of the new project in their
community, and nearly all stakeholders report that their community needs even more
school construction. A large majority of respondents report strong improvements in
school physical building compared to previous school conditions in their community.
There is less of a consensus for school equipment with about one third of the respondents
reporting a shortage of desks or classroom furniture. Respondents in all sites report that
the ESCRP project alleviated crowding and helped increase school enrollment in their
area. Girls’ access to education appears to have been enhanced by each project school
where data are available, with quite dramatic increases in some sites.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1 A reduced number of schools compared to the original targets have been rehabilitated
or built under the project. The project schools are now operational or will shortly become
operational benefitting an increased number of students. Generally, the MOE does not
have difficulty to meet the recurrent costs of schools, which are also considered a priority
by the communities. Although the situation in Iraq remains fragile, and the risk of
collapse for lack of security cannot be completely ignored, the ICR rates the overall risk
to development outcome (the risk that development outcomes will not be maintained) as
“Moderate.”

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 In assessing the performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry, it is important
to keep in mind the generic constraints that the Project faced, particularly the critical
security situation and the generally weak capacity in the country. Project preparation was
more difficult than usual. Not only was the security situation in Iraq poor at the time of
project development, the project was prepared in the Bank Headquarters with a team of
five MOE staff who were able to travel to Washington. The improvements that had been
expected at that time did not materialize, so that the Project was implemented under
conditions that were not envisaged when the activities and targets were set. While this


                                            24
was an emergency project at the outset, it could not have been foreseen that the situation
would not improve quickly enough to allow it to be completed in the original short time
period.

5.1.2 In a conflict, or post-conflict, fragile situation, it is prudent to assume low
institutional capacity. Therefore, with the wisdom of insight, it would have been better to
have lower targets, particularly for the number of schools to be constructed (in any event,
the Project addressed only a very small part of the country needs). MOE’s standard
designs were not used for the new schools to be constructed; however, project schools
were of better quality than other DOEs schools, and it seems that through the Project Iraq
received good value for money. The focus on outputs for both the PDO and the
performance indicators was appropriate given the emergency nature of the project. Most
disbursements were to be made through direct payments to contractors, suppliers and
consultants, but the fact that the project design did not include a special/designated
account was a problem for smaller expenditures that were to be pre-financed by the MOE.
Finally, the two-month deadline for the submission of audit reports was far too short.

5.1.3 The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated “Moderately
Satisfactory.”

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank’s quality of supervision is rated “Moderately Satisfactory.” As was the
case for many other ITF-financed projects in Iraq, the project performance was not fully
within the control of World Bank staff. Nevertheless, over the years all Bank task team
members made great efforts to improve the project performance. Bank management gave
high priority to this Project, and invested a great deal of time in assisting the Task Team.
The budget was appropriately large for this difficult project (about US$266,000 for
lending and about US$1,789,000 for the nine years of supervision – see Annex 4). It is
not clear why the Project was not restructured earlier, albeit restructuring discussions
lasted for over a year since mid-2009 till it was approved in September 2010.
Unfortunately, there were many changes in staffing, with five TTLs and the involvement
of different procurement, FM, M&E and Safeguards specialists over the years. In aide
memoires and ISRs, the reporting of project progress, or lack thereof, was of high quality.
However, the World Bank in effect considered the AF as a separate project, whereas it
was part of the ESCRP. Implementation of the AF was covered in the aide memoires, but
is not discussed at all in the ISRs. 17

5.1.5 To substitute for the lack of on-site supervision, the Bank Task Team made good
use of the FMA, by maintaining close contact communication with the FMA personnel
during implementation and inviting them to participate in all supervision missions.


17
  Because the AF is part of the ESCRP, there are no separate ISRs for the AF, but all the ISRs for the
ESCRP do not deal with the AF.



                                                 25
5.1.6 There were many problems during project implementation, and the Bank Task
Team was right to focus on contract management which was the main issue. In particular,
the Bank Task Team worked closely with the MOE/PMT to streamline procedures and
cut back redundant procedures in order to reduce payment delays to contractors.

5.1.7 The training on procurement, FM and management provided to MOE/PMT staff
under this Project and under the Iraq Capacity Building Projects points to the Bank
proactive approach in trying to cope with the capacity challenges of implementing
projects in Iraq. Also, the introduction of a Special/Designated Account is a good
example of the efforts made by the Bank to improve project performance. Originally, the
Project had only two allowed methods of payments: direct payments and reimbursements.
The designated Account (DA) was introduced in August 2008, on a pilot basis, with a
ceiling of IQD1.2 billion. This payment method was introduced as a potential problem
solver for the delays that the PMT faced with payments reaching the beneficiaries. The
introduction of the DA improved significantly processing of payments to beneficiaries,
although the ceiling was low compared to the volume of payments. The other two
methods continued to operate besides the DA. To enhance the project control procedures
over the DA, the World Bank FM team together with the PMT developed specific control
tasks over the DA documented in additional procedures documents. Also, the FMA TOR
were revised to include measures to mitigate relevant risks of DA operations, such as:
assisting the PMTs with pre-screening of withdrawing applications; reviewing the bank
reconciliation statements for the DA; monitoring, on a sample basis, payment
transactions from DA; performing, on a sample basis, SOE review of payments made
from DA; and be present on payment days, on a sample basis, to check if signatures of
payment requests are the same as those appearing on the contracts, as well as verifying
other payment documentation. The successful use of the DA during the pilot period
played an instrumental role in introducing DAs for all projects in Iraq. Related to this, the
World Bank team invested great effort in building the capacity of PMTs to ensure proper
management of DAs. Many workshops were delivered in relation to FM and
disbursement and specifically, the 2010 FM workshop provided detailed training on
managing DAs, updating FM manuals with specific policies and procedures for DA
operations, and introducing e-disbursement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.8 Since both the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and the quality of
supervision are rated “Moderately Satisfactory,” the Overall Bank Performance is also
rated “Moderately Satisfactory.”




                                             26
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 When evaluating the performance of the Government for this project, one has to
keep in mind that for project design the MOE relied to a great extent on the knowledge
and expertise of the Bank, and that project implementation was influenced very strongly
by the lack of security in many parts of the country and the generally weak
implementation capacity in both the private and public sector in Iraq.

5.2.2 Because of the weak capacity generally in Iraq, the main problem was contract
management which has been a challenge during the whole project period. All too often,
contractual issues have been addressed by the MOE/PMT through a reactionary approach
rather than through a proactive one to prevent implementation delays. Because of these
implementation delays, US$4.83 million remained undisbursed by the end of the grace
period of October 31, 2013.

5.2.3 Contract management issues included the following:

          a. Identifying experienced consulting firms to be contracted for school
             design and construction supervision has been difficult. This was
             particularly critical because a standard school design was not used for the
             construction of new schools, but instead each individual school had its
             own design prepared by the consulting firm.

          b. The performance of many contractors has not been satisfactory: contracts
             have not been implemented as planned with long implementation delays
             for some of the work contracts, and implementation schedules have not
             been monitored and updated by contractors on monthly or even bi-
             monthly basis as stipulated in the contracts.

          c. There have been substantial payment delays due in part to contractors not
             submitting all the required supporting documents, but due also to
             cumbersome administrative procedures.

          d. There have been extensive differences between physical progress and
             payments to contractors due mostly to lengthy gaps between payment
             requests submitted by contractors and insufficient follow up by the PMT.
             The fact that payments to contractors lagged behind work progress had a
             negative effect on the cash flow of contractors. Many contractors failed to
             submit invoices in a timely manner, even when they faced cash flow
             problems.

5.2.4 In the last two years, with the commitment and strong support of the Minister of
Education to resolve issues and the greater engagement of PMT, efforts have been made



                                          27
to improve contract management, including shortening the payment cycle, and entrusting
construction supervision to DOE supervision committees instead of to consulting firms.

5.2.5 Although the project started without any monitoring framework, the MOE/PMT
was able, with some Bank support, to establish a monitoring system and produce good
quarterly progress reports, demonstrating the importance of developing such capacity in
house. This is quite an achievement.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.6 The implementing agency was the MOE. Since the MOE is part of the Government,
the assessment of its performance is included in 5.2 (a) above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower/Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.7 The MOE/PMT for this project worked under difficult conditions with great stress.
Because of the very fragile political and security context, Government performance was
rather poor in the project’s early years, but improved significantly during the last two
years of the project. On balance, the Overall Recipient Performance is rated “Moderately
Satisfactory.”

6. Lessons Learned

(1) Development progress in conflict-affected environments is rarely predictable or
linear and cannot be fully mitigated through design. The imperative to respond
rapidly in such situations precludes considered project preparation. To the extent
possible, Teams must monitor progress continuously and be prepared to make frequent
course corrections. In this context, project restructuring – even when done in a timely
fashion – cannot always keep pace with a rapidly changing operating environment. In
these circumstances, project design should emphasize both simplicity and flexibility.
 (2) In fragile situations where conventional supervision missions are not possible a
Fiduciary Management Agent (FMA) can help provide implementation support.
Rapid emergency responses in conflict-affected situations typically require sustained and
intensive implementation support. However, in Iraq the security conditions did not allow
for the level of Bank support during preparation or implementation needed. In this
context, the use of an FMA was both necessary and effective in providing oversight and
in ensuring that funding was used for the purposes intended – an issue of fundamental
importance in a fluid governance environment. An FMA cannot substitute for
conventional implementation support, however, and care needs to be taken to ensure that,
in trying to assist the client, the FMA does not inadvertently undermine the objectives of
developing recipient capacity.

 (3) In fragile states, the World Bank should always assume low institutional
capacity and high turnover, and the design of emergency projects in conflict-


                                           28
affected situations should be very simple, manageable in scope and suitable to
context, with a primary focus on outputs. In this project, both the PDO and the key
performance indicators were focused on outputs. However, the targets turned out to be
unrealistic considering the context in Iraq, particularly the weak capacity of the private
sector as well as the public sector.

(4) An early restructuring may be advisable whenever a project implementation is
faced with major and persistent difficulties that seem to resist all attempts to
remedy. The rehabilitation part of the project was implemented rather smoothly, but
there were always problems and delays with the new constructions despite the efforts of
World Bank task team members who struggled to improve the project performance. That
part of the project was too ambitious and could have been scaled down earlier.

(5) While the WDR 2011 notes that institutional development is a generational
proposition, emergency responses can successfully develop pockets of institutional
capacity over the short-term. One example is the development of in-house monitoring
and evaluation capacity in the Ministry of Education which, in this context, was a
particularly notable achievement. Despite considerable initial difficulties in data
collection and project monitoring, the MOE/PMT was ultimately able to obtain
satisfactory student data from the vast majority of schools and to generate acceptable
quarterly progress reports on a consistent basis.
(6) In civil works projects, disbursement mechanisms need to be designed in ways
that facilitate project implementation and that do not expose contractors to cash
flow problems. While in this project disbursements were made primarily through direct
payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants, a designated account can be
particularly helpful in processing smaller expenditures. To mitigate the effects of
exchange rate volatility, contracts should be denominated in US Dollars rather than Iraqi
Dinars. This approach, adopted in the TEEP project, would have reduced delays in
making payments to contractors and resultant cash flow issues.

* Appraisal estimates for new constructions under the original project are based on the
figures for the construction contracts listed on pages 28 to 30 of the Technical Annex,
plus the amounts for consultant services for the design and supervision of new schools as
shown on page 31 of the Technical Annex. Actual figures include the cost of the civil
works contracts, plus the amounts spent for consultant services.
** The appraisal estimate includes the US$200,000 for site improvement and small
works.
Note: When the original project was restructured in 2010, the number of primary and
secondary schools to be rehabilitated in all Governorates was reduced from 144 to 133
and the number of schools to be constructed in all Governorates was reduced from 117 to
48. However, the restructuring added the construction of 20 six-classroom blocks
including toilets in selected existing primary and secondary schools in Baghdad.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Rehabilitation of 133 existing schools

The original target of 144 existing schools rehabilitated (as per Schedule 5 of the original
Grant Agreement) was revised to 133 existing schools rehabilitated as part of project
restructuring in September 2010.

This sub-component was completed by the end of 2006. It included a range of
interventions, such as the addition of new classrooms, upgrading of electrical and
plumbing systems, painting, roof repairs and new toilets.

The 133 rehabilitated schools are now benefiting 80,576 students, which is well above
both the initial target of 45,700 students and the revised target of 44,848. Among the
80,576 students, 57% are boys and 43% are girls.

Of the 133 rehabilitated schools, 97 are primary schools and 36 are secondary schools.

Construction of 48 new schools

The original target of 117 new schools (as per Schedule 5 of the original Grant
Agreement) was revised to 48 new schools as part of project restructuring in September
2010.

Construction started on 50 schools (32 primary and 18 secondary schools) which are all
12-classroom schools with a design capacity of 480. Forty-eight schools have been
completed, meeting the revised target (Completion of the two unfinished schools could
be financed under the TEEP).

Of the 48 new schools that have been completed, 46 are now operational, benefiting
approximately 30,623 children, of which 14,282 (or 47%) are boys and 16,341 (or 53%),
are girls. Although only 46 schools are operational, the number of students is well above
the revised target of 23,040 students, but below the initial target of 56,160.

Additional Financing for 30 six-classroom schools

The US$6.00 million additional financing (AF) was to finance the construction of 36
small primary schools in the marshland areas of three governorates in southern Iraq
(Basrah, Missan and Thi Qar), focusing on one of the most underserved areas in the
country.

Out of the initial target of 36 schools, 30 6-classroom schools were constructed; 25 of
these schools are co-educational. Three schools in Thi Qar Governorate were canceled
because of the difficulty of transporting materials to the remote sites and the lack of
interest by contractors. Two schools in Missan Governorate and one school in Basrah
Governorate were canceled because of tribal disputes.



                                            33
All the 30 schools are operational and are now benefiting 5,400 children (2,969 boys and
2,431 girls), compared to a target of 6,000 to 8,000 students.

Six-classroom blocks extensions (with toilet) for 18 schools

The project added this sub-component when it was restructured in September 2010. The
objective of this additional sub-component was to reduce overcrowding at existing
Baghdad schools that use multiple shifts by increasing the capacity of each school by 240
students.

Although the target was 20 block extensions, the MOE/PMT prepared 21 school sites.
The number of completed six-classroom blocks is 18 for 12 primary and 6 secondary
schools. The slow implementation progress and the fact that the target was not reached
have been due in part to a legal issue with the MOHESR involving a contractor who was
selected to build nine of the 21 six-classroom blocks (completion of the three remaining
blocks could be financed under the TEEP).

Although the 18 six-classroom blocks extensions (with toilets) created 4,320 new
available seats, the extensions are now benefiting 4,028 children (2,235 boys and 1,793
girls, based on the proportion between boys and girls for the whole schools), compared to
the target of 4,800 children.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Two beneficiary surveys, or social assessments, were carried out for this project by the
Iraqi Research Foundation for Analysis and Development (IRFAD). The main objective
of those surveys was to assess the extent to which the construction of new schools
contributed to improving the learning conditions of students and to increasing enrolment
for both girls and boys:

   (i)     In 2009, IRFAD carried out a beneficiary survey for primary schools in the
           marshland areas of three governorates in southern Iraq (Basrah, Missan and
           Thi Qar) financed by the US$6.0 million AF of the ESCRP. The IRFAD
           report was issued in January 2010.
   (ii)    In 2013, IRFAD carried out Social Assessment Task 2 which covered 17 sites
           of the ESCRP. The IRFAD report was issued in October 2013.

Additional Financing – Primary Schools in the Marshland areas – Assessment
Report.
IRFAD researchers performed 240 interviews and visited 30 school sites. They
interviewed local council members, community leaders (usually prominent tribal
elements in the community), school headmasters, parents and students in all- three
provinces to assess the appropriateness of the sites selected for school construction, and
collect data on enrollment and information on the planning process and the involvement
of civil society and NGOs. The study also assessed the impact of the schools on three
populations who were considered underserved in the Iraqi context: displaced persons,
school-age girls and disabled students.
Of the targeted 36 schools in the Marshland Areas, 27 schools were constructed and
operational at the time of the study (a further three were constructed but not operational).
The 27 operational schools had a total enrollment of 3,503 students, according to data
obtained from school headmasters, data that were confirmed current as of the time of
IRFAD’s research in October 2009. The schools as built have not met the original
enrollment targets (creation of 6,000 to 8,000 school places). Due to the widely reported
constraints on space at the schools (see below) it appears that this target is unlikely to be
met without further construction of new schools or expansion of the newly built facilities.
For the 27 schools which have been built and are in use as schools, the average
percentage of female students is 36.8 percent. Two active schools have no female
students; among the remaining 25 mixed-gender schools, the average percentage of
female students is 38.7 percent, but individual school percentages range from 24.8
percent to 63.5 percent. The 25 co-educational schools did increase access to education
for school-age girls in the target areas. In fact, 47 percent of parents surveyed in the
areas where schools were built indicated that their school-age girls would have stayed
home if the project schools had not been built. The project schools also increased access
to education for displaced persons and disabled students.




                                             38
On the other hand, 16 out of 25 headmasters interviewed in the survey reported that
classrooms were too small, which is indeed the case 18 (most likely, because of the limited
financing available, although the number of schools could have been reduced instead of
reducing the size of schools). Also, 10 out of 25 headmasters reported that their schools
would not be able to handle increased enrollment.
To assess the appropriateness of the sites selected for school construction, IRFAD
researchers asked local council members, community leaders, and parents to give their
views on the location of the school. Results were mixed, with the strongest disapproval of
school site location voiced by local council members in Thi Qar province, where six of
ten council members expressed the view that the school site was inappropriate. However,
all community leaders and all parents surveyed in Thi Qar Province expressed approval
of the school sites in their areas. Most parents surveyed in Thi Qar province said that they
were consulted during the project planning process. In Basra province, all local council
members, all parents and most community leaders surveyed expressed approval of the
school site. All local council members and most community leaders and parents surveyed
in Missan province expressed approval of the school locations in their area.
Role of NGOs in Project Planning and Implementation. The ESCRP-MS program called
for NGOs “to mobilize local communities, undertake site improvement small works using
community labor, and monitor construction”. Although they were not all consulted,
parents, local council members, and community leaders in all three provinces largely
expressed approval of the project planning process, and most of them were aware of the
NGO role in project planning and facilities site improvements. However, in every case,
regarding all schools without exception, parents, local council members, community
leaders and school headmasters all responded that they had not observed any NGO
performing improvement work on the school. No respondent contacted during the course
of the survey reported observing NGO improvement work on the schools in any province
after the planning phase. Since some improvement work has been implemented by
NGOs, the above impressions may result from poor communication to the local
communities regarding the NGO role in the project after the planning phase.
Most of the parents, local council members and community leaders also said that the new
schools, where they are operational, were “beneficial” for the community.
Conclusions
The involvement of local communities and civil society in the process appears to have
enhanced community sense of ownership of the project schools. Based on the generally
positive feedback from respondents, community outreach in the project planning process
seems to have been a key to securing broad local support for the built project schools.
The rural nature of the project areas has meant that much of the involvement of local
communities involves obtaining support from tribal leaders who might hold influence in
the provincial areas. With the difficulties that some schools faced where local disputes

     Classrooms in all project schools measure 4.25m X 4.25m, or 18.06m2.

have stalled the construction or opening of schools, it seems likely that tribal support of
the local building projects might muster tribal resources to resolving local disputes and
allowing the project to go forward. Nevertheless, it also stands to witness that the tribal
community’s basis of authority is not the same as the Ministry of Education or the NGOs
implementing the project, and can therefore also provide sources of difficulty especially
if powerful tribal elements are themselves divided in such a way that might impede the
development of a local consensus and community ownership of the project.
The ESCRP-MS additional financing has met with qualified success. Community leaders
and students largely voice support for the schools, although some respondents criticized
various project elements. By expanding access to education in 27 underserved remote
communities of the southern Iraqi marshlands, the project has largely garnered the
support of the local populations in those communities. However, unfulfilled construction,
design, equipment and maintenance commitments on the part of NGOs and the Iraqi
education authorities leaves the project with lower-than-anticipated enrollment and
schools whose future operations may be jeopardized if corrective measures are not taken.

Social Assessment – Task 2 (October 2013)

Overall, a total of 17 sites were visited by IRFAD researchers, who performed a total of
85 interviews and focus groups in seven Iraqi governorates. The survey assesses
respondents’ views on the following topics:

    1) Is the physical building of the project school an improvement over the conditions
       in the community before the ESCRP project?
    2) Are major services (water, electricity and sewers) at the project school an
       improvement over the conditions in the community’s school before the ESCRP
       project?
    3) How crowded are the completed project schools?
    4) Is the project school sufficiently equipped with basic equipment (furniture, desks,
       etc.)?
    5) Has the project school contributed to increased enrollment in the area?
    6) Do the respondents believe that the community has need of further school
       construction?

Findings

Survey findings may be summarized as follows (see also table below):

   i.   Fifteen (15) sites reported strong improvement over the previous school
        conditions in their community in the topic of the physical building of the school.
 ii.    Even those respondents who recommend improvements to enhance the safety and
        utility of the school site are broadly supportive of the ESCRP project in their
        community.
 iii.   In the area of basic services and equipment, four sites out of 17 reported major
        concerns about water, electricity, or sewage infrastructures, while 10 sites
        reported that the situation was strongly improved over what was in place before,


                                            40
       and three reporting some improvement. Respondents at several sites reported that
       they had faced difficulties with these services initially when the school opened but
       that working with the Ministry of Education they were able to address them. It
       should be noted that difficulties with key services (such as water, electricity or
       sewer) are a widespread problem in Iraq, and are not exclusive to project schools.
 iv.   On the matter of equipping the schools, there is less of a consensus. Six of 17 sites
       report that basic equipment or furnishing is insufficient, with a shortage of desks
       or other classroom furniture frequently cited.

Improvement            0       Improvement           4         Insufficient         6

Respondents in all sites reported that the ESCRP project alleviated crowding and helped
increase school enrollment in their area, and similarly all but one respondent reported that
more school construction was required in the local area. Girls’ access to education has
been enhanced by each project school where data are available. In fact, girls’ uptake of
the new educational opportunities at the schools appears quite dramatic at some sites. In
most sites where data is available, girls’ enrollment at the project schools exceeds the
reported enrollment of girls in the target community for the same age level.

Conclusions

1) There is a great demand in Iraq for new school construction. Communities welcome
the construction of new schools. Even when respondents were not entirely satisfied with
the physical building or services at the project site, most were very supportive of the new
project in their community, and nearly all stakeholders reported that their community
needed even more school construction.

2) Several completed schools were not sufficiently served by the water, electricity, or
sanitation services that stakeholders expected the project to enjoy. Other sites lacked
enough desks for students or furniture and equipment that teachers may use in their work.
Taking stock of these needs will vastly enhance the value of the project to the end user.

3) Although the design of the schools was largely similar across sites, the quality of
construction was reported to vary from site to site. While nearly all sites represented a
strong improvement over what existed before, it may be the case that an investment in
monitoring construction quality in the building phase could enhance the long-term value
of the project by reducing maintenance and repair costs in the long term and increasing
value to end users.

Recommendations

1) Review ESCRP sites in all project governorates for adequacy of service provision,
especially water, electricity, and sewer service.

2) Review ESCRP sites in all project governorates for sufficient furnishings and
equipment, especially student desks.

1. Context at Appraisal. The project was approved in October, 2004, at a time when
there was a substantial collapse in the education system, like most of Iraq’s institutions,
after the Gulf War and regime change in 2003. Despite Iraq having the good fortune of
resources, there were huge needs to improve the quality of the infrastructure—Iraq faces
enormous challenges and the situation is still evolving. In addition to a complicated
political transition, a Needs Assessment covering fourteen sectors, prepared jointly in
2003 by the World Bank and United Nations Development Group (UNDG) and with the
participation of the International Monetary Fund, estimated that Iraq required about
US$36.0 billion over four years. Donors in a follow-up meeting in Abu Dhabi (February
18-29, 2004) allocated US$100 million for the education sector to finance the Emergency
Textbook Provision Project (ETPP) and the recently closed Emergency School
Construction and Rehabilitation Project (ESCRP). This report covers only the ESCRP,
which had an allocated amount of US$60 million.
2. ESCRP Closing Date. The World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (the "Administrator"), has
established September 30, 2007 as project closing date, During the project life there was


                                            45
a relative slowdown in progress of construction due to the political and security situation
in the country, in addition to the lack of capacity within the both public and private local
sectors. in accordance to the request of ministry of education the project had extended
for three times as shown:-

Original                        Revision-1         Revision-2          Revision-3
September 30,2007       December 31,2010   June 30,2012       June 30,2013

These extensions were necessary to allow sufficient time for use of uncommitted funds
and completion of all project activities. Because of delays in the construction program

3. Main Beneficiaries. The main beneficiaries of the project were the local population in
areas supported by the project where the students and teachers benefit from schools close
to their houses. In addition, the Local Governments and educational directorates in the
MOE benefitted through.
4. Main Output and Outcomes. The rehabilitation of 133 schools was completed by the
end of 2006. As a result of these rehabilitations, and according to the last data for
academic year 2012-2013, more than 82,000 students are currently benefiting from
improved conditions of learning in these schools. This is well above the target figure of
44,848. The main reason was because of moving students from other schools within same
area due to reconstruction under ministry projects. The number of schools built under the
project was 48, meeting the end of project target, though below the planned 50 schools.
All are 12-classroom schools with a design capacity of 480 students each. These provided
23,040 new seats for students. Of the 48 completed schools, 46 schools were occupied
and operational (benefiting more than 30,000 students). The remaining 2 schools are
under initial handover and occupation process. The total number of completed six-
classroom blocks reached 18 out of the planned 21 by the end of June, 2013—less than
the target of 20. The completed six-classroom block extensions include 12 primary and 6
secondary schools to increase the capacity of each school by 240 students—the total
number of additional seats is therefore 4,320. The actual number of students directly
benefiting from the classrooms in the 18 completed extensions is 4,028. However, the
total number of students benefiting from these extensions, through the easing of
overcrowding in the relevant schools, is more than 11,000. The remaining 3 six-
classroom blocks (with 85 percent of physical progress for each) did not complete due to
reasons beyond the control of the PMT (security conditions and a legal issue).
In addition, one of the greatest project advantages was the experience and knowledge of
World Bank guidelines and sound international practices that the Ministry of Education
(MOE) and the Project Management Team (PMT) gained, the project provided
opportunities for 158 MOE staff to receive training for capacity building to develop and
improve their skills.
The total disbursement reached US$52.75 million by the end of September, 2013, which
equals 88 percent of the total Grant amount of US$60 million.it is expected to reach
US$54.85 of total disbursement by end of October, 2013. The remaining (US$5.15)
could not be disbursing due to uncompleted work in some contracts.

 5. Project Development Objectives (PDO), Components and Key Indicators
(Original and Revised).The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the project was to
improve conditions of learning in primary and secondary schools through the
construction of new buildings for existing schools in unsafe or shared facilities and the
rehabilitation of schools in need of urgent repair. The project was restructured in
September 2010 with revised targets. The original could not be met due to the increase in
construction costs since project effectiveness Project targets. The average construction
cost per square meter increased from US$364 to US$547. This 50 percent increase was
due to: (i) higher than expected inflation in 2005-2006; and (ii) appreciation of the Iraqi
Dinar (IQD) by 20 percent against the US Dollar between 2006 and 2008.the project was
implemented under two components:

Component 1: Construction and Rehabilitation of Primary and Secondary Schools
(US$58.57 million) revised as follows:

   i.   new construction for primary and secondary schools reduced from the original
        117 to 48 schools;
  ii.   rehabilitation of primary and secondary schools reduced from 140 to 133 schools;
 iii.   funding provided for construction of 20 additional six-classroom blocks
        (including toilets) to alleviate overcrowding in selected primary and secondary
        schools in six Directorates of Education Offices (DOEs) in the Baghdad area.

Component 2: Project Management and Capacity Building (US$1.43 million)The
grant should finance the basic costs of the Project Management Team (MOE-PMT) to
manage the project, together with the technical assistance and capacity building to ensure
transfer of skills to the MOE staff. The MOE should cover the costs of the staff of the
MOE-PMT, except for up to five consultants employed from project funds to fill key
capacity gaps (remained unchanged).

actual figures).

    1- The total number of completed schools is 48, the remaining two schools did not
       complete and it would be possible to finance the unfinished works under TEEP.
    2- Three six-classroom block extensions (with toilets) did not complete and it would
       be possible to finance the unfinished works under TEEP.

6. Implementation. The MOE-PMT had responsibility for day-to-day implementation of
the ESCRP, and they exerted every effort to ensure satisfactory implementation while
working in a changeable and risky environment. The construction of new schools and
additional six-classroom blocks included all the necessary steps starting from selecting
sites, surveying works, preparing designs and plans, procurement and financial
management, in addition to supervision and contract management. All this work was
done by the PMT in cooperation with the DOEs’ staff and consultants. There was a
relative slowdown in progress of construction work due to a number of factors that had a
negative effect on project implementation include:

    (i) The MOE’s lack of experience with World Bank guidelines and sound
         international practices, plus cases in which the Bank and GOI guidelines were
         conflicted.
    (ii) The poor performance of consultants and contractors due to lack of planning and
         lack of experience of Bank procedures.
    (iii)Delay with laboratory test activities due to a limited number of qualified
         laboratories.
    (iv) Payment delays due to time taken to process payments from the DOEs through
         the MOE.




                                           48
- Due to reasons beyond the control of the PMT (security conditions and a legal issue) two
new schools and 3 six-classroom block extensions (with toilets) could not be completed
before the closing date of June 30, 2013. Due to the consistency of ESCRP’s PDO with that
of TEEP (another project financing by World Bank), it would be possible to finance the
unfinished works under TEEP.

7. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and Safeguard Compliance
During the life of the project the PMT succeeded to improve the overall M&E and
environmental capabilities of the PMT members. This was evident by the PMT taking the
overall responsibility for all the data gathering, checking and production and timely
submission of the Quarterly Progress Reports (QPRs).
8. MOE Performance: Rating – Satisfactory. The MOE demonstrated strong
ownership of the project, as evidenced by the establishment of the Project Advisory
Committee chaired by the Minister of Education to oversee and guide the project and
facilitate coordination with key ministries, as well as direct support to the PMT and
provision of all the facilities required. This level of ownership also reflected substantial
support from the Bank.
9. PMT Performance: Rating –Moderately Satisfactory. The PMT had overall
responsibility for the coordination and execution of all project activities, contract
management, financial management (accounting and disbursements), procurement of
works, goods and consulting services, environmental analysis, and monitoring and
evaluation. the PMT has succeeded in achieving most of PDOs, and this has been due to
the significant efforts and the cumulative experience.
10. DOEs Performance: Rating – Moderately Satisfactory. MOE Directorates of
Education (DOE) at the governorate level fully engaged in the implementation of the
project and provided information and assistance to the MOE-PMT. Where those
directorates were the major beneficiaries, the main factor that influenced the performance
of the DOEs’ staff and caused project delay was lack of experience with World Bank
guidelines and sound international practices and conflicting guidelines between the Bank
and GOI.
11. Consultants Performance: Rating – Moderately Unsatisfactory. The MOE-PMT
hired consulting firms for design and supervision services for the construction of new
schools. The performance of local consulting firms was poor and this reflected on works
progress and workmanship. The MOE decided to replace the supervision consultant with
supervision committees from (SBS – DOEs).
12. Bank Performance: Rating – Satisfactory. The World Bank has been one of the
government’s key partners in stabilizing the fiscal situation and improving fiscal
management through its efforts to assist the MOE and PMT to improve its management
performance, implement an interim commitment control system to prevent the
accumulation of domestic arrears, and introduce better financial controls in key state-
owned enterprises.



                                            49
 13. FMA Performance: Rating Moderately Satisfactory. The FMA-EMCS worked
closely with Bank Offices in Baghdad, the PMT, DOEs and consultants. They extended
all assistance help resolving the encountered issues. EMCS visited all implemented sites
and the PMT office regularly and reported its detailed recommendations to the Bank,
sharing them with the PMT, in addition to regular participation in the weekly audio-
conference meetings and supervision missions.

14. Lessons Learned
a. Site selection. A number of elements need to be considered while planning for a school
construction site including: timing of the selection vis-à-vis the contract award; the
timing and the time taken to conduct the soil investigation; the familiarity of the
contractor with the region/school site; security conditions of the region and the possibility
to access school site.
b. Contractors’ capacity. should be ensured The contractor’s capacity to mobilize
adequate financial and human resources to complete school construction within the
contracted time-line; ensuring that in cases that contractors’ are awarded more than one
site/school that the contractor has the financial and technical/logistical capability to fulfill
his contractual commitments and that sites are within reasonable geographic proximity.
This would enable adequate contract management and would minimize the contractors’
tendency to sub-contract.
c. Supervision consultants vis-à-vis DOEs’ supervision committee. The overall
performance of the supervision consultants under ESCRP were rated from "poor" to
"marginally satisfactory", as the performance of the consultants should be closely
monitored and managed by the MOE/PMT to ensure that they perform in accordance
with their contracts. It was found to be preferable to give the supervision task to the
DOEs for the following reasons: (i) to give the DOEs more ownership and involvement
with Bank projects; (ii) to decrease the management sequence of supervision; and (iii) to
save on the cost of consultants.
d. Smaller contractors. Though smaller contractors may be in effect “sub-contracted”
and not qualify for entering into MOE’s bids, it may be worthwhile to identify ways to
facilitate the formal registration of those smaller contractors that may have the capability
of acceptable performance, especially in smaller scale works such as the six-classroom
block extension (with toilets).
e. New schools vis-à-vis six-classroom blocks. In ESCRP, the project design included
six-classroom blocks in addition to complete new schools. For MOE’s future plan, it
would be highly recommended to conduct stakeholders’ consultation and to assess
beneficiaries’ assessment of these alternatives. The outcome of such participative
approaches would be taken into consideration for MOE’s action plans.
f. Financial management. There are a number of lessons learnt to be drawn from ESCRP
within the financial management domain, including: the use of designated account,
revolving account, the currency of the account, and the payment cycle.

Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

Context at Appraisal
Since the 1980s due to three major wars, over a decade of sanctions and in excess of
thirty years of isolation from the world,1980s war, 1990s sanctions created decline in
education system also Population growth increased :13 to 32 million people and due to no
investment in education infrastructure during last 25 years and since 2003, investment in
education with help of world community: reconstruction and building of new schools,
High unemployment; lack of income generating opportunities and War continues to have
a negative effect: disruption of community, loss of teachers and students, 3-4 million
refugees left Iraq. Though some displaced people will be returning, there may be a drain
on technical experts not coming back, the Ministry of Education (MOE) faced a new
challenge which was that the actual need for more than 5000 new schools around the
country, additions and rehabilitation to existing schools, capacity-building with school
management

 Original Project/Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicator (as
approved)
According to the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) Grant Agreement for the Additional
financing grant in the amount of US$6 million to the Iraq Emergency School
Construction and Rehabilitation Project ESCRP dated October 31, 2006, the original
objective of the Project was to improve conditions of learning for students in primary and
secondary schools in Iraq through the construction of new schools and rehabilitation of
schools in need of urgent repair.

Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification: N/A
Main Beneficiaries
The primary target group for the additional financing was Iraqi students at the primary
level in the underserved marshland governorates of Basra, Thiqar, and Missan. The
project was expected to create 6000 to 8000 additional school places to help stabilize the
resettlement of approximately 36 communities in existing villages across the three
Governorates. Other beneficiaries included: MOE governorate staff involved in site
identification, procurement of local civil works and project monitoring under the PMT;
PMT and MOE staff involved in various capacity building efforts and supervision
workshops; local communities and local authorities across the three governorates; NGOs
contracted to mobilize local stakeholders and perform site improvement small works; and
any staff appointed to the new project schools.
Original Components
The ESCRP-MS had two new Components and additional financing for Project
Management and Capacity Building. According to the project’s Grant Agreement, they
are as follows:

Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry (soundness of the background
analysis and assessment of the project design)
The Project design was simplified in response to the difficult implementation conditions
in the country due to security conditions. The project was built on experience gained in
ESCRP and utilized ESCRP’s implementation arrangements including the MOE’s Project
Management Team (PMT) and adapted them to ESCRP-MS; adding one innovation of
local stakeholder participation. This allowed for the transmission of lessons learned
through ESCRP and combined supervision missions for the two projects.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment (stakeholder involvement and
participatory process)
The project design was participatory in nature to strengthen the capacity of the MOE
governorate staff and MOE capacity as well as its involvement with a wide range of local
stakeholders, NGOs, communities and authorities in the identification of school sites,
monitoring of construction and maintenance of school buildings.
Assessment of Risks: It had been taking into consideration that the implementation of
such a project in these regions will suffer from many risks, including, for example, the
tribal problems that have occurred for some schools and caused to terminate those
schools in Basra and Missan governorate.

Implementation. For the implementation of the project MOE used the same team for
ESCRP project consisting of a team leader, procurement officer, financial officer,
monitoring officer and group of engineers with full time basis, the MOE provided the
necessary resources to commence working. During the implementation period, many
problems emerged, including, for example, the security problem and tribal disputes ,such
kind of construction needs a dedicated staff who know how to construct such schools also
the contractor involvement of the people from the nearby area led to the continuity of the
work and securing the site and creating jobs. As for the administrative and financial
problems that emerged during the implementation of the project with the support and
experience of the World Bank team these were solved. The World Bank team provided
basic training to the main staff of the project and the main staff trained the remain staff
of the project so as to be able to deal with the problems and find the best solution. The
PMT took the responsibility also to train the focal point in order for them to have the
ability to be able in charge of the supervision of construction of schools. Regarding the
financial issues, at the start of the work and due to the fact that the MOE/PMT staff had
no previous experience on World Bank procedures, some delay occurred on payments to
the contractors, this issue was treated by training the staff on World Bank payment
procedures with the cooperation of the World Bank staff in addition there were delays in
the payments cycle due to the need for Intermediate Banks for the transfer payments to
Iraq.



                                            53
The total number of completed schools was (30) out of the planned (36). The reasons for
the cancelled schools which represented (3) schools in Thiqar Governorate due to
mixture of inflation, tribal disputes, and a problem of awarding 3 contracts/schools in
Thiqar specifically because there was no interest by contractors in that area and the
Thiqar province/location of the would-be schools was too remote for mobilizing
materials (this led to the 3 schools in Thiqar being canceled) , the remaining cancelled
schools included (2) in Missan Governorate and (1) in Basra Governorate ,which were
cancelled due to tribal disputes. Regarding Site improvement small works, the proposed
component was intended to involve NGOs to mobilize local committees, and the
assignment of the NGOs was not clear, this was the first time in dealing with contracts to
NGOs (first time for PMT/ MOE/Marshlands area) so it was not fully clear how to
manage the NGOs’ TOR. The NGOs themselves did not have a good understanding of
their TOR and took incorrect actions (without the knowledge of the PMT). For example,
the TOR states that steps need to be defined and the approval of the PMT must be sought
before starting works. But the NGOs went on to perform certain works without
consulting the PMT or Directorate of Education. Many works were rejected at the time
of payment request as a result taking into consideration it was the first experience.
Regarding project management and capacity building, which was implemented by the
PMT by hiring supervising consultant firms to assist in supervision, two contracts were
issued to supervise the building of the schools in the three southern governorates. The
contracts were with consulting firms- Bureau of Al-Mustansiriyah University and Al-
Ebdaa Engineering Bureau and they submitted their supervision reports regularly and
completed their supervising of the work.
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
M&E Design: The PMT of ESCRP-MS was responsible for monitoring and evaluation
to ensure timely implementation and coordination of all project activities. The PMT
prepared Monthly Progress Reports and Quarterly Progress Reports (QPR) and submitted
them to the WB team.
M&E implementation: MT capacity for M&E was weak due to the lack of training staff
for this purpose on the basis related WB requirement at that time, and in fact such
training was very necessary for the development of the project performance for
PMT&MOE staff.
M&E utilization: M&E was utilized but not to the ideal extent to monitor outcomes due
to the lack of experience in this field and the lack of adequate training. However, it
should be taken into consideration that this project was the first project that was being
implemented in areas not reached by traditional construction method.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
No major issue was recorded at that time and this project did not change the
environmental category for ESCRP (B). The focal point was responsible for updating and
monitoring the environmental issues related to the construction of the schools. They were
involved in site selection of the suitable lands. It should be taken into consideration that
all schools were built on sites where no resettlement was required and on public property
assigned by the relevant authorities for the use of the MOE.

Assessment of outcomes
Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation/ Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The objectives, design and implementation of the Project were and remain highly
relevant to Iraq’s priorities to rebuild essential infrastructure and services in the critical
Education sector.

Achievement of Project/Program Development Objectives/ Rating: Satisfactory
Out of an initial target of 36 schools, 30 6-classroom schools were constructed under the
Project across the governorates of Basra, Missan and Thiqar. All schools were
operational after completed
The operational project schools have enrolled 5398 total students, including 2965 boys
and 2433 girls as of January 2013 According to the project documents, ESCRP-MS
initially aimed to enroll 6000 to 8000 students across 36 schools. However, the reduced
number of schools constructed caused the lower enrollment numbers.

Efficiency/Rating: Satisfactory
In calculating construction costs that have been spent for this project, it can been seen
that the cost per square meter was approximately USD400$ at that time. Taking into
consideration that the capacity of each of the 6-CLS each classroom in the schools was
30 students, the total number of students for each school was 180 students and we
calculate the cost per student at USD670$. When we compared to these costs at that time,
we find it less than other projects of the MOE.

Justification of Overall Outcome Rating /Rating: Satisfactory

Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome/Rating: Satisfactory

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank Performance/ Rating: Good
The Bank’s performance during preparation is rated good .The Bank’s identification,
preparation and appraisal of the project counted on the participation of an adequate range
and number of professionals, who provided hands-on technical assistance to the
Borrower. Project design and objectives were in line with the education reform priorities
as set in the technical annex. Risks and mitigating measures were adequately assessed in
the technical annex. The Bank’s team conscientiously worked with the MOE staff during
preparation, contributing to define scope and content. The Bank team provided good
assessment and advice to the Borrower during the mid-term review on how to improve
the management and reporting of the financial and procurement aspects of the project.
The overall Bank performance is rated as good due to:
       -   Thorough job in preparing the project.
       -   Good team work and excellent communications with the Borrower.
       -   Flexible and timely response to the country’s needs.
       -   Good project supervision, adequately responding to Borrower’s needs.




                                             55
   Borrower Performance/ Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
   -  The Borrower led the preparation process, including preparing the draft appraisal
      document, fostered coordination with the WB and promoted participation of its
      staff in providing inputs to the project design. The Borrower, through its Minister
      of Education, provided a clear vision of the sector priorities and policies for which
      it required Bank support .The MOE requested that its staff participated in project
      preparation, which made preparation successful and enhanced ownership of the
      project development objectives and lines of activities. During the implementation
      period and despite changes in administration, the Borrower maintained its
      commitment to the project’s development objectives, ensuring that the Ministry of
      Education maintained an adequate staffing within the MOE, to carry out
      implementation. The overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory due to
      the following reasons:
   -   Government’s vision and leadership during preparation.
   -   Overall Government’s commitment to the education sector reform strategy.
   -   Achievement of project targets and objectives in all components, despite major
       adjustments needed during the life of the project.

Lessons Learned
This project has a different privacy from the rest of the projects being financed or funded
by the World Bank in the field of building schools due to the privacy built areas schools,
therefore the project can consider a special case of in situ conditions and lessons learned
from this project can be summarized as follows:
       -   Site selection: the site that is chosen insured from all the practical aspects of
           the implementation of the school in terms of both security and in terms of
           access to the site and the possibility of continuously implementation of the
           work until complete the whole work in order to benefit from the construction
           of the schools.
       -   PMT Staff: the PMT staff should be qualified to manage the implementation
           of the project so as to solve the problems that arise during the implementation
           of the work, which requires continuously developing its ability to be able to
           find appropriate solutions in a timely manner.
       -   Engaging Ministry units: the need for engaging the needed ministry units in
           solving the problems that arise during the implementation of the work and the
           development of staff portability of these units.
       -   NGOs: as mentioned above, this was the first time in dealing with contracts to
           NGOs (first time for PMT/ MOE/Marshlands area) so it was not fully clear
           how to manage the NGOs’ TOR, and it was supposed to be holding regular
           meeting between the project staff and those organizations (before the
           implementation of the project begin) to find up the appropriate mechanism for
           the implementation of the project taking into consideration the tribal nature of
           that region and how to handle them.



                                            56
       -      Focal point roles: the focal point should be full-time for the project and
              observer of all the details and the coordination all relevant parties and write
              periodic reports to the project management team.
       -      Supervision committee: the supervision of the project includes a contract with
              consulting firms under the contractual terms of the World Bank to supervise
              the works taking into consideration the nature of those sites. Also, it was the
              first experience for those firms in dealing those conditions, but after that the
              PMT found that the use of supervision committees established in the
              directorates - is better than those consultant firms.

Conclusion
The Emergency School Construction and rehabilitation Project (Additional Financing for
Marshland Schools) can justifiably be described as a success .The objective of the main
component was achieved and exceeded against a background of unique difficulties. The
initial planned of component -1- (Construction of approximately (36) new schools
buildings) was successfully procured and new buildings were completed at that time.
This is notable because it was the first time building schools in the marshlands area in the
southern part of Iraq due to many issues, some of them related to security conditions,
tribal dispute and the nature of the marshlands area. For the related component -2- (Site
Improvement Small Works), due to this being the first time in Iraq and in the Ministry of
Education to apply such experience (shared NGOs to mobilize local communities and to
undertake site improvement small works using community labor on schools to be
constructed under the project), many works were rejected at the time of payment request.
For component -3-(Project Management and Capacity Building),this provided much-
needed capacity in the Ministry of Education which now has a core of trained staff with
experience of managing the implementation of projects and which had been trained in
World Bank procedures.
