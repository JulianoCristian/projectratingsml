The\n            reallocation is necessary to make use of the cost savings\n            made under the 'works' expenditure category to\n            finance training and to cover operational expenses arising\n            from the closing date extension of one year, from June 30,\n            2012 to June 30, 2013. Previously, the training was funded\n            through two expenditure categories: 'consultants'\n            services' to finance the cost of the training service\n            providers, and 'training' to finance all costs\n            related to the participants. To better account for funds\n            allocated to training activities, it was agreed to\n            reallocate relevant funds from the 'consultants'\n            services' category to the 'training'\n            category; this will fund all training related costs,\n            including costs of trainers, training material, training\n            venue, participants' travel, accommodations and per\n            diem, as well as the cost of printing and translation as\n            follows: category (one): reallocate US$600,000 to category\n            (four) and (five), category (two): no change. Category\n            (three) reallocates US$489,000 to category (four) and\n            (five). Category (four) US$839,000 through adding US$600,000\n            from category (one), and US$239,000 from category (three);\n            category (five) US$250,000 through adding same from category\n            (three); category (four) will finance all training related\n            costs; whereby expenditures, inter alia, per diem, travel,\n            and visas will not be included in the procurement plan."}, "docdt": "2012-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
