                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project closed on June 30, 2013, and has largely achieved its objectives as follows.

                         Rehabilitation of 133 existing schools. This sub-component was completed by the end of 2006. It included a range of interventions (such as the addition of new classrooms,
                         upgrading of electrical and plumbing systems, painting, roof repairs and new toilets) that benefited more than 82,000, which is well above the initial target of 44,848 students.

                         Construction of 50 new schools (target was revised to 48 new schools as part of project restructuring): This includes 32 primary and 18 secondary schools (which are all 12-
                         classroom schools). Of the 50 planned new schools, 48 have now been completed, with 42 operational, benefiting approximately 28,000 children. This is well above the target figure
                         of 23,040 students. Meanwhile, the additional two planned schools (beyond end of project targets) will be completed under TEEP.

                         Six-classroom blocks (and toilet extensions) at 20 schools: The project added this sub-component when it was restructured in September 2010. Of the 21 planned blocks, 18 were
                         completed. More than 3,000 students are currently benefiting from an improved school learning environment. This is below the target figure of 4,800 students as not all blocks are yet
                         operational, and there have been delays in completing 3 six-class blocks due to legal issue between contractor and MOHESR (including one planned block beyond the end of project
                         target of 20). Now that this issue is resolved, the remaining blocks are at 85 percent average physical progress, and will be completed under TEEP.
