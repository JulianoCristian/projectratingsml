implementation of substantial policy measures undertaken by\n            the Government of Indonesia (GOI) during 1989 and 1990; (b)\n            assisting GOI to maintain a satisfactory pace of economic\n            growth that is consistent with external and internal\n            financial stability; and (c) maintaining the policy dialogue\n            on further reforms to promote the efficiency and longer-term\n            viability of the economy.  The loan of US$250 million\n            equivalent would finance general imports of goods to meet\n            part of Indonesia's near-term foreign exchange\n            requirements, and play a catalytic role in mobilizing a\n            targeted level of US$1.2 billion new commitment of\n            fast-disbursing assistance from other donors."}, "docdt": "1990-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
