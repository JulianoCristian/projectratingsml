stabilization\n            during 1995; and 2) to support an agreed program of\n            structural reform including trade policies, oil export\n            procedures, pricing and pro-competition measures, and other\n            actions. The proceeds of the loan will be used to finance\n            imports at the market exchange rate by public sector and\n            private enterprises. The Central Bank will transfer local\n            counterpart funds in an amount equivalent to the loan to the\n            Ministry of Finance to be used as non-inflationary budgetary finance."}, "docdt": "1995-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
