Development project was satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            likely, the institutional development impact was modest, and\n            the Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            The project found that the lessons learned during the\n            implementation combined with flexibility in reallocation of\n            the credit, and very thorough supervision can make a\n            substantial contribution to expanding the development impact\n            of an initial investment operation with pilot features.\n            Either technical assistance is seen as critical to the\n            success of components that the Bank is financing or\n            implementing agencies should have assurance of financing and\n            continuance throughout the project. There is a substantial\n            demand for medium-term credit by private enterprise in\n            Armenia and there is a potential for these enterprises to\n            make a major contribution to economic and social development\n            by significant job creation and expansion of exports. New\n            private banks generally tended to perform better than state\n            banks. A change in the culture of lending, from client\n            relationships to analytical techniques of the banking system\n            may take more than one project and require a plan of support\n            that will gradually phase out external foreign assistance in\n            coordination with sector work in the financial sector."}, "docdt": "2002-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
