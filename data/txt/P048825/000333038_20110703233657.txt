                         Extension of Closing
         REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA – CULTURAL HERITAGE PROJECT

                               Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for the Cultural Heritage Project, Loan No. 7059 TUN will be
   extended from June 30, 2011 until December 31, 2011. In addition, a reallocation of
   funds among Project categories from “goods” and “consultant services, overestimated
   at the time of appraisal, to “works” will also be made. This will allow for completion
   of works on the main remaining sites.

2. The Project will be able to achieve its objective to assist the Government of Tunisia
   in the sustainable management of the country’s cultural heritage with a view to
   developing cultural tourism. Despite long delays and current difficulties in Tunisia,
   much has been accomplished through the Project: the most important museums have
   been renovated and extended according to international standards. The first-class
   museums will attract visitors and enhance cultural tourism.

3. Both Project Development Objective (PDO) and Implementation Performance (IP)
   are rated “Moderately Satisfactory”. Performance indicators are rated moderately
   satisfactory. Safeguard compliance with BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and
   BP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources) have been satisfactory. Project audit
   compliance has been satisfactory throughout the Project.

4. This will be the third extension of the project. A first extension of the Loan, from
   June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2010 was granted in 2007 to compensate for the
   accumulated delays in the launching of works. A second extension of the Loan, from
   June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011 was granted in 2010 due to specific delays at the main
   sites.
