                         It is expected that the renovation/extension of the two large museums of the Bardo and Sousse will be completed by June 30, 2011, the Project's closing date. Public works will be
                         completed over the next few months and the contracts for the collection displays have been awarded. These museums, along with earlier accomplishments in Djerba and Kairouan,

                         contribute fully to the appeal of Tunisia's cultural heritage. The Bardo National Museum will be a world-class museum; its location is a considerable asset for cultural tourism. The
                         Bank highly recommends taking advantage of the last phase of the Project to boost its promotion (along with Sousse) andplace it at the core of the tourism development strategy.
