Investment projects\n            should not be allowed to go for Board approval without\n            advanced preparation or completion of the final design\n            studies and cost estimates for all components, in agreement\n            with the relevant country authorities. Investment in\n            cultural heritage is a complex process that requires a\n            combination of lending instruments and technical support. As\n            evidenced in similar operations worldwide, museum and art\n            center projects are always difficult and require a\n            preparation that is both time consuming and\n            resource-intensive. Ownership and commitment to key reforms\n            should play a central role in risk evaluation. Economic\n            benefits can be very high for cultural heritage investments.\n            Especially in the cultural heritage sector, even low cost\n            investments that are strategically selected and positioned\n            can have a decisive impact.
