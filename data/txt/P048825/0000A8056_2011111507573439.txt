                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following significant delays, accomplishments observed on the two main Project sites (Bardo National Museum and Sousse Archeological Museum) indicate that both museums will
                         be world-class achievements, likely to attract large numbers of visitors, diversify and boost overall tourism, and bring additional revenues.
