                         revenues, through: (i) enhancement of the legal framework, development of policies, and strengthening of cultural institutions capacity to enable efficient
                         management of the country's cultural assets; (ii) development and marketing of cultural products, including promotion and communication programs; and (iii)
                         improving infrastructure and management of a representative sample of six archaeological and historic sites to increase their appeal and tourism potential.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The events that took place in Tunisia over the last few months make it impossible for the Project to be completed by the closing date of June 30, 2011. An extension of the Project
                         closing date is considered in order to achieve the remaining works on the sites.

                         The impressive accomplishments observed to date on the two main Project sites (Bardo National Museum and Sousse Archeological Museum) indicate that both museums will be
                         world-class achievements, likely to attract large numbers of visitors, diversify and boost overall tourism, and bring additional revenues.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The fully remodeled Sousse Museum will reopen to the public. The National Bardo Museum (which remained open during construction) will present a much extended collection in the
                         traditional renovated wing and the added new construction. Both museums are expected to be international attractions.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
