To\n            achieve this objective the project will consist of two\n            components: (1) development of a fire fighting program which\n            will provide for a detailed survey of the fires and the\n            preparation of a program that will indicate the most\n            cost-effective approach for dealing with these fires taking\n            into account economic as well as social and environmental\n            concerns; (2) preparation of an environmental management\n            plan in view of the considerable adverse effects of these\n            fires on the environment and the people in this area, this\n            project will provide funds for the preparation of a program\n            that will identify measures to mitigate the adverse\n            environmental and social effects of these fires."}, "docdt": "1992-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
