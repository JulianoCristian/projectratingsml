       Development Project are: 1) establishment of a housing\n            finance facility (Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement and\n            Compte de Mobilisation - CAA/CdM), which will provide long\n            term social housing finance by refinancing housing loans\n            made by commercial banks. This will consequently encourage\n            shifting the main responsibility for housing finance to the\n            private sector. It is anticipated that 7,000 households\n            would purchase dwellings through the CAA/CdM facility; 2)\n            provision of basic infrastructure to rehabilitate about 750\n            ha of land for housing development. Some 150 ha will be\n            developed annually, mostly in Abidjan Nord and in the Djibi\n            area, providing about 18,500 new plots to be sold through\n            private real estate developers. Funds required for land\n            servicing and obtained from plot sales will be channelled\n            through CAA and Compte des Terrains Urbains; 3) continuation\n            of transport improvement programs focusing on rehabilitation\n            and maintenance of streets and pedestrian facilities in high\n            density communities, and selected improvements to road\n            infrastructure and traffic management systems throughout\n            Abidjan; and, 4) studies, training, and a pilot program to\n            stimulate access of the informal sector to commercial bank\n            credit with assistance from Non Governmental Organizations."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
