F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective
The overall objective of the three phase INCAGRO Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was
to contribute to the sustainable development of a pluralistic, decentralized, rural-agrarian
system of technological innovation, guided by demand, and led and disseminated by the
private sector, with the purpose of increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the
agricultural sector through the generation and adoption of environmentally sound
technologies.

The objective of the INCAGRO Phase II Project, as per the PAD, was to contribute to the
expansion, strengthening, and institutional development of the rural agricultural
technology and innovation system, so it is pluralistic, decentralized, demand driven, and
led by the private sector.

Revised Project Development Objective (as approved by original approving authority):
(the system displays entries in Section 6)

The Project Development Objective was not formally revised.

     AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION APL PHASE 2 PROJECT

            IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT


1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1       Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 The INCAGRO1 Phase II Project was the second phase of a three phase
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) aiming to increase the productivity and
competitiveness of the agricultural sector in Peru through the adoption of
environmentally sound technologies generated and disseminated by a pluralistic,
decentralized, rural-agrarian system of technological innovation, guided by demand, and
led by the private-sector. The APL Program was designed to be implemented in three
phases: (1) Phase I (IBRD loan of US$ 9.6 million) of three years‟ duration, for the
establishment of a National Agricultural Innovation System (NAIS), (2) Phase II (IBRD
loan of US$ 25.0 million) of four years‟ duration, for the scaling up of the System to
cover all regions of Peru, and (3) Phase III (projected IBRD loan of US$ 56.1 million) of
five years‟ duration, for the consolidation of the System.

1.1.2 At the time of APL preparation in 1999, Peru had taken several important steps
towards the liberalization of the economy. In the agricultural sector, while liberalization
had helped to raise investment in the sector and boost exports, smallholder agriculture
remained marginalized. Public expenditure on agricultural research represented only
0.2% of agricultural GDP. The National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA) had been
weakened by a poorly planned concession of its agricultural research stations, flight of
qualified personnel, poor governance and reduced budget. Private sector research was ad-
hoc and uncoordinated. Against this background, the INCAGRO APL was expected to
contribute to introducing institutional change and pluralism in the agricultural research
and extension, and increase the role of the private sector broadly, so that Peru could
strengthen its position as a competitive producer and exporter of agricultural
commodities.

1.1.3 This Phase II Project followed upon a satisfactory completion of the first
phase2. Phase I had shown that the installation of a pluralistic, decentralized and co-
financed agricultural innovation system was achieved, but that more institutional
development was required to consolidate the system. The failed adoption during Phase I
of a strategic plan for INIA, which would have defined its role as a publicly financed
institution in a pluralistic innovation system, was seen as a setback. It called for working

                                                                                                  1
towards a reform of INIA during Phase II so that INIA would concentrate its resources in
a number of strategic programs of a strong public good nature, as outlined in the
Government‟s Policy Letter accompanying the Phase II of the APL3. The Phase I, which
was concentrated initially in three regions and later expanded to five, adopted a gradual
process of decentralization, supporting the Government of Peru‟s (GOP) efforts to
decentralize the agricultural service sector in the country, and was extended to the whole
country under Phase II4.

1.1.4 The Project strongly backed the 2002-2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
objective of supporting the GOP‟s efforts to achieve a sustained, continuous reduction of
poverty. Thirty percent of Peru‟s population lives in rural areas, three quarters of which
are characterized as poor, and one half of which is characterized as extremely poor (2003
estimates). By improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the agricultural innovation
system, the Project would increase agricultural productivity and farmers‟ incomes, and
reduce natural resources degradation. At the time of appraisal, due to the high
indebtedness of the Peruvian public and private sectors, the GOP, through World Bank
assistance, was attempting to strengthen the fiscal balances through controls on
expenditure, improved debt management, increased tax collection, and initiation of a
national competitiveness program to address barriers to private sector growth and
increasing exports. The Bank‟s assistance under the Project was directed at moderating
the overall decline in public funding of agricultural research, stimulating private sector
funding of the transfer of agricultural technology, and strengthening institutions.


1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO) of Phase II as set out in the project
appraisal document (PAD) was: “to contribute to the expansion, strengthening, and
institutional development of the rural agricultural technology and innovation system so it
is pluralistic, decentralized, demand-driven and led by the private sector”. The PDO
formulation in the initial loan agreement was to some extent different and referred to
higher-level objectives5 (i.e. poverty alleviation), but was eventually made consistent
with the PAD through an amendment to the loan agreement which was signed in July
2009.

1.2.2 Seven PDO indicators were set out in the Results Framework of the PAD and
referred to: (i) number of producers participating directly and indirectly in extension and

  Peru is divided in twenty-four regions (first-level administrative sub-divisions). Phase II covered all
    regions thanks to nine decentralized multi-region project management units, in addition to PMU
    headquarters in Lima.
5
  The PDO formulation in the initial loan agreement stated: “to alleviate poverty by contributing to the
sustainable development of an integrated, pluralistic, private sector-led, decentralized, agrarian system of
technological innovation in order to increase the productivity, profitability and competitiveness of the
agricultural sector through the generation and adoption of environmentally sound technologies”.

                                                                                                          2
adaptive research sub-projects with at least 25% of co-financing, (ii) percent of business
plans fully functional, (iii) percent client satisfaction with new technologies, (iv) number
of macro-regional programs of extension and adaptive research established, (v) adoption
of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system of the NAIS, (vi) total number of Project
beneficiaries, and (vii) establishment of a Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point.

1.2.3 However, the performance indicators in the Loan Agreement only partially
corresponded to those indicators. It included the above-mentioned (iv), (v) and (vii), and
additionally defined: (viii) number of producers participating in extension and adaptive
research sub-project with at least 25% of co-financing, (ix) number of extension and
adaptive research sub-projects co-financed, (x) number of sub-projects co-financed with
female and indigenous organizations, (xi) number of established strategic research
programs, and (xii) number of co-financed sub-projects in strategic research.

1.2.4 Intermediate outcome indicators that were included in the PAD are presented in
section F of this report.


1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators

1.3.1 The development objective and key indicators were not changed during
implementation. Although there was discussion and agreement at the mid-term review
(MTR) to refine the key indicators to make them more results-oriented rather than output-
based, the key indicators were not formally changed. The end of Project target values of
three of the indicators of the Loan Agreement were modified in the Amendment signed in
July 2009, to reflect a revised allocation to project components as well as the Project
implementation progress.


1.4    Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The Project‟s primary target groups remained unchanged and consisted of rural
producers whose organizations and business plans (sub-projects) benefited from co-
financing through Project funds. The PAD estimated that 46,000 producers would
participate directly in extension sub-projects and adaptive research sub-projects. These
and other rural producers would also benefit indirectly from the generation of
innovations under the strategic research sub-projects. By improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the agricultural technology system, the Project would increase
agricultural productivity and farmers‟ incomes, and reduce natural resources degradation.
The Phase II Project was expected to give greater attention to targeting vulnerable
groups, in particular the inclusion of indigenous populations and rural women
organizations as direct participants of the Project.

1.4.2 The Project explicitly sought to foster the development of a pluralistic,
competitive, and demand-based market for services in agricultural extension and
research. Secondary beneficiaries included producers’ organizations, service providers

                                                                                          3
in research and extension (NGOs, INIA and other research organizations, universities,
private enterprises, etc.) and other potential participants of sub-projects (e.g. local
governments).


1.5    Original Components

Component 1: Strengthening the Market for Innovation Services (US$ 20.94
             million)

1.5.1 The aim of Component 1 was to advance the development of a decentralized
market for professional services for agricultural innovation. This was to be achieved by
establishing and managing a Competitive Fund “Agricultural Technology Fund” (FTA)
for co-financing agricultural extension sub-projects and adaptive research sub-projects
based on business plans that reflect demands of producers‟ organizations. Component 1
also planned to co-finance local forums, internships, trainings and workshops, aiming at
improving the capacity of producers‟ organizations and agribusiness service suppliers.

Component 2: Strengthening the National Agricultural Research and Development
             System (US$ 14.0 million)

1.5.2 The aim of Component 2 was to strengthen agricultural research and
technological development for innovation in areas of strategic importance and to
enhance the institutional and individual professional competencies in the field of
agricultural extension. This was to be achieved by establishing and managing the
Competitive Fund “Strategic Services Development Fund” (FDSE) for co-financing
strategic research sub-projects and capacity strengthening of extension agents sub-
projects. It was also expected that the FDSE would support the strengthening of public
sector capacity to generate scientific and technological information and to develop new
products and processes for smallholder agriculture in a number of priority and strategic
sub-projects of value and delivery of public goods.

Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Information Sharing, and
             Policy for Innovation (US$ 5.53 million)

1.5.3 The aim of Component 3 was to develop the institutional capacity of the public
sector to formulate and implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with
the private sector, and regulate the quality of the NAIS. An important expected
outcome was the establishment of a Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point in a
modernized MINAG that would be responsible for defining policies, and which would
coordinate investments in this sector. The expected outputs included: (a)
institutionalization of processes; (b) validation of an M&E system; and (c) a modernized
and systematized information system.




                                                                                      4
Component 4: Project Implementation (US$ 2.51 million)

1.5.4 The aim of Component 4 was to finance the INCAGRO-Project Management
Unit (PMU) to continue to be the Implementing Agency for Phase II, established directly
under the Ministry of Agriculture and thus financially and administratively independent
of INIA.


1.6     Revised Components

1.6.1 Component 1 underwent some slight modification during the implementation of
the Project, which is described in Section 1.7.


1.7     Other Changes

1.7.1 The Project underwent a restructuring6 in July 2009, related to: (i) revising the
PDO in the Loan Agreement to make it consistent with the PDO formulation in the PAD;
(ii) revise the location of the Project Management Unit, which was moved from MINAG
to INIA; and (iii) extend the closing date of the Loan Agreement by 18 months to
December 31, 2010. The Mid-Term Review that preceded the restructuring was
undertaken in February 2008, sixteen months ahead of the initial Project closing date.

1.7.2 Some changes in the design of Component 1 were discussed and implemented
in 2006, as a result of which no competitive funds were allocated under the FTA that
year. Firstly, the decision was made that the strategic alliances 7 set up for the execution
of extension sub-projects under Component 1 would be led by producers‟ organizations
rather than NGOs as was the case under INCAGRO Phase 1. Secondly, instead of a
special funding window for indigenous peoples and women as foreseen in the PAD, the
decision was made to divide up the funds available for agricultural extension under the
FTA into three types of sub-projects (extension sub-projects types I, II and III). Different
amounts and co-financing percentages were set for each sub-project type, with a view to
facilitate the participation of vulnerable groups (indigenous communities and women
organizations) through smaller sub-project size, lower co-financing requirements
(minimum of 15% for type III, 25% for type II and 35% for type I) and more intensive
support by the Project for preparation of sub-projects type III. The latter sub-projects
targeted specifically indigenous communities and women organizations (see Annex 9).



6
  The restructuring was classified as a third-order restructuring.
7
  Strategic Alliance: Under the INCAGRO Competitive Funds (FTA and FDSE), a strategic alliance refers
to a formal cooperation agreement between the sub-project implementing entity, one or more entities
demanding services or products, and one or more partners that contribute to the sustainability of the
business plan, or in the implementation of the extension services plan, the capacity building plan, or the
research plan of the sub-project. The sub-project implementing entity assumes the leadership of the
strategic alliance.


                                                                                                        5
1.7.3 Implementation schedule and closing date. The Project closing date was extended
with eighteen months from June 30, 2009 originally to December 31, 2010.

1.7.4 Reallocation of loan proceeds. A reallocation of loan proceeds took place on
July 1, 2009. The category of “works” was cancelled and expenditures for “goods” and
“sub-projects” decreased, against increases in other categories (consulting services,
training, operating costs).


2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 The project quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. The background analysis
confirmed the adherence of the PDO to the Peru CAS 2002-2006 as well as to the MDGs.
The design of the Project (PDO and selection of components) was solid and based on the
lessons learned from the initial Phase I. Particularly the design of Components 1 and 2
took account of the recommendations of the ICR of Phase I8. However, the design of
Phase II underestimated the risk of the development of a parallel system of research and
innovation (see 2.1.10). It did not sufficiently address the question of the institutional
and financial sustainability of the INCAGRO model and the exploration of different
options for this with the GoP early on during the APL (see 2.1.8).

2.1.2 Important changes to the design of Component 1 (from Phase I to Phase II) were
to make its competitive fund (FTA) more demand driven and responsive to producers.
The most significant changes that strengthened the design of Component 1 included:
a) Deepening the demand-driven approach, by having producers‟ groups as the
    originator of the sub-projects (as opposed to extension service providers or NGOs);
b) Enhancing the focus on vulnerable groups, by having separate funding categories;
c) Promoting the role of coaches or brokers to the producers‟ groups, by introducing the
    concept of “strategic alliances”;
d) Introducing flexibility, by having an open window for the funding rounds rather than
    a single funding date.

2.1.3 For Component 2, the revised project design (vis-a-vis Phase I) included the
following changes to its competitive fund (FDSE):
a) Gradual execution of the fund over the lifetime of the Project, by beginning with a
    limited number of strategic program areas for focused research and progressively
    expanding these;
b) Promoting participation and ownership, by having the major agricultural research
    institutions and stakeholders take an active role in the initial identification of the
    priority areas, research agenda within each area;

     Extension Program (INCAGRO). Report 34521.


                                                                                                6
c) Strengthening competition, by allowing the major agricultural research institutions to
   participate in the competitive research funding rounds; and
d) Professionalizing the career of service of extension agents, by requesting their input
   and that of major agricultural research institutions and stakeholders for the design of
   capacity strengthening and training programs.

2.1.4 These strategies proved sound and led to a widely supported research agenda with
broad participation in the research undertakings, particularly by those institutions capable
of implementing a research agenda.

2.1.5 At the Project level, the coverage of the competitive funds (FTA and FDSE) was
expanded from a few regions under Phase I to the entire country under Phase II.

2.1.6 The most challenging to design was Component 3, as this component touched on
politically delicate issues. The overall APL as originally designed aimed at separating the
functions of agricultural innovation policy (in MINAG), financing (first INCAGRO, then
by an entity to be agreed upon during the initially foreseen consolidation Phase III of the
APL) and implementation (INIA for strategic „public domain‟ innovations and the private
sector for the rest). In principle, this strategy was supported by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance (MEF) and MINAG, but in practice the anticipated consequences created
resistance from the entities to be affected most (particularly INIA).

2.1.7 The initial idea of creating a Directorate of Innovation in MINAG had to be
dropped following an intensive debate at the time of the preparation of the PAD for
Phase II. The compromise achieved at the time of Project preparation was the
establishment of a „Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point‟ in MINAG, responsible
for policy formulation and coordination of public investments, contributing to the
sustainability of the agricultural innovation system, as expected outcome of
Component 3.

2.1.8 Some weaknesses in the design:

a)   Importance of Policy Dialogue not sufficiently incorporated in Project activities.
     The volatility of the political debate at the time of Project preparation most likely did
     not permit a more thorough design of concrete options for the institutionalization of
     INCAGRO‟s competitive funds for agricultural research, technology and innovation
     and approach to managing them (design, evaluation, implementation and
     monitoring). Some may argue that the Project should have foreseen more concrete
     activities to pursue the institutionalization of the INCAGRO model, such as studies
     on the required future institutional design of the NAIS; debates on this topic (later
     strongly promoted by MEF and its National Competitiveness Council), etc. Though
     the design did not exclude this, it did also not specifically indicate that these would
     be important measures to be pursued to safeguard the institutional sustainability of
     the Project‟s impacts.




                                                                                            7
b) Mix of the Competitive Funds not convincing. The mix of the two funds (FTA
   including both agricultural extension and adaptive research sub-projects; FDSE
   including both capacity strengthening of extension agents and strategic research sub-
   projects) was done with the purpose of maximizing the interaction between research
   and extension. However, with hindsight, it seems that this rather weakened the focus
   on extension and research, respectively. It may also partly explain the rather limited
   response to the calls for proposals on adaptive research. In fact, for the proposed
   Phase III, realigning the two funds to have a more comprehensive approach to
   extension and research, respectively, was planned.

c)   Institutional strengthening of other actors not sufficiently planned and designed,
     INIA being the most critical case. Resentment over the amount of resources under
     the PMU‟s control and the perceived lack of support from the Project to INIA to
     build the public sector framework needed for agricultural innovation led to INIA‟s
     resistance to pursuing the foreseen consolidation Phase III of INCAGRO even
     though in theory INIA stood to gain the most. The already tense relation between
     INIA and INCAGRO at Project design exacerbated with the Supreme Decree 014-
     2008-AG (June 20, 2008) which merged the INCAGRO Project Management Unit
     with the National Agricultural Innovation Institute (INIA) (see section 2.2.1).

2.1.9 Government commitment and stakeholder involvement were adequate at the
start. MEF and initially MINAG supported the Project, in spite of their differing views
about how to institutionalize the INCAGRO model once the external financing would
come to an end. The adequacy of producers‟ and other stakeholders‟ involvement, the
soundness of participatory processes, the high level of transparency and the well selected
co-financing arrangements clearly belong to the strengths of the project design.

2.1.10 Overall, the assessment of risks was adequate. But the risk rating of ‘developing
a parallel system’ as ‘low’ underestimated the potential threats. The PAD identified
three major risks: (i) the development of a parallel system of research and innovation by
leaving the INCAGRO PMU outside MINAG and INIA (low); (ii) the weak capacity of
the newly formed regional governments to participate effectively in the decentralized
implementation of the Project (medium); and (iii) the weak procurement capacity (high).
While those risks were well identified, the rating „low‟ for the development of a parallel
system is surprising, especially given the lack of coordination and consultation between
INIA and INCAGRO that was already apparent during Phase I; a higher risk rating would
have been more realistic. Also, the potential impact of the proposed risk mitigation
measures (policy dialogue of the Bank; Policy letter of the GOP; and sub-projects co-
financed by the FDSE) seems overrated. The risk assessment regarding the new
decentralized regional governments was accurate. Here, more than the foreseen
mitigation measures (inclusion and strengthening of the regional governments) the
strategy of opening nine decentralized multi-region Project management units and
conducting local priority setting forums for research and innovation was sufficient to
operate effective and efficient funding rounds.




                                                                                        8
2.2        Implementation

2.2.1 The expeditive merger of the INCAGRO Project Management Unit into INIA9
in 2008 undermined the plans of sustainably separating the policy, financing and
implementation functions in the field of agricultural innovation. The merger of the
INCAGRO PMU into INIA was part of a broader process of restructuring undertaken by
the GoP which aimed to simplify the administrative structure of MINAG and its affiliated
agencies, i.e., to reduce complexity, duplication and resulting high transaction costs in the
agricultural sector. While this might have been the right decision in the productive sector
(e.g. several internationally funded projects promoting increased productivity in the
Sierra region were merged into a single government entity AGRORURAL), it is
questionable in the field of agricultural innovation with the merger of INCAGRO into
INIA. This merger took place at the same time when INIA was being assigned the
mandate of national regulating authority of the National Agricultural Innovation System
(NAIS)10. In practice, from 2008 onward, INIA was executing research sub-projects
financed through INCAGRO competitive funds, while at the same time receiving the
responsibility to develop competitive funds to promote research, capacity strengthening
and technology transfer in agriculture, and to formulate the policy of agricultural
innovation. To avoid this perceived conflict of interest, and to merge successfully two
different visions and work cultures such as those of INIA and INCAGRO, would have
required more in-depth preliminary consultations (e.g. between MEF, MINAG, INIA,
INCAGRO, etc.) and conceptual debate, including on the future of INIA and how to
consolidate the INCAGRO model.

2.2.2 A volatile political environment (four different Ministers and Vice-Ministers of
MINAG in four years) affected Project implementation. Not only did the frequent
changes in the administration make it difficult for the Project to enter into a political
discussion on the NAIS (status, potential, vision) but it also made it very difficult to work
out concrete strategies for the financial and institutional sustainability of the INCAGRO
model at Project completion, as it was not clear to what extent the decisions taken under
one administration (in particular the Legislative Decree 1060 creating the NAIS in 2008)
were interpreted and supported in the same way by the following administrations.

2.2.3 The design and implementation of a sound and rigorous Competitive Funds
management model that was the core of the Project proved to be crucial for the
successful implementation of Phase II of INCAGRO. In hindsight, one might even argue
that the „conservative approach‟ taken by the Project to concentrate most efforts on the
expansion and fine-tuning of the Competitive Funds, while isolating them from external
interference, safeguarded the development impacts of INCAGRO Phase II. The sound
management model and principles of the Competitive Funds (design, evaluation,
transparency) supported by the integrated and efficient M&E system, effectively
inhibited external interference, even after the merger of INCAGRO into INIA.

2.2.4 Although INCAGRO Phase II launched calls for proposals on a country-wide
basis, the regional distribution of approved sub-projects (a total of 487 sub-projects was
approved under Phase II) was uneven among the twenty-four regions, with about one
third of sub-projects concentrated in three of the twenty-four regions11, in contrast to a
quarter of the regions who benefited little from the Project12. Although no targets were
set for the Project in terms of sub-projects per region, and while this result may reflect
different capacity and needs among regions, some may argue that this uneven distribution
may have contributed to the lack of support for a third Phase of the INCAGRO APL
among some GOP officials.


2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Overall the results framework was considered reasonably adequate, with
specific indicators established attributable to the Project. However, indicators could
have been chosen that were clearer in measuring the demand driven, pluralistic,
decentralized, and private sector led characteristics of the innovation system. This would
have allowed the collection of more relevant baseline data to describe ex-ante and ex-post
the agricultural innovation system. Intermediate indicators for pluralism of the market
for services were only defined at the demand side (service users or clients), that is, none
measured pluralism at the supply side (service providers). The indicator of „the
establishment of a Technological Innovation Policy Focal Point in MINAG‟ was
erroneously formulated and only partially reflected the institutionalization of the policy
function of the NAIS under MINAG aimed for under the Project. The mid-term review
suggested adjusting the formulation of this and some other indicators.

2.3.2 INCAGRO Phase II established an effective system for monitoring results at
sub-project and Project levels. Based on the lessons learned from Phase I, the Project set
up two inter-connected web-based systems for improving sub-projects management
(SIGES – Sub-project Information Management System) and overall Project progress
monitoring (SIGER – Project Management Information System). The monitoring system
is based on monthly reports submitted by sub-project implementing entities to the
decentralized INCAGRO offices (on-line through SIGES). INCAGRO‟s technical team
at the PMU headquarters in Lima reviewed this information on a monthly basis, while
SIGER captures the information from the SIGES database to generate the progress
reports submitted to MINAG (on a quarterly basis); the Bank (every six months); and
MEF (annual).

2.3.3 The development of the SIGES and SIGER databases provided a sound basis
for reaching conclusions on the pre-project context, Project activities and results. As
this system improved and strengthened, it provided a good basis for making decisions e.g.
the changes made to the bases of the calls for proposals of the FTA and FDSE, the

11
     Junin (67 sub-projects), Puno (52) and Huancavelica (33).
12
     Regions as Ica (only 1 sub-project), Madre de Dios (3), Moquegua (3), Tumbes (3), Ancash (4), Pasco
      (5) benefited much less from the Project. The remaining fifteen regions benefited on average from
      twenty-one sub-projects each.

                                                                                                     10
introduction and design of the FTA extension sub-projects types I, II and III etc. The
system facilitated reporting on overall Project results, including at national seminars,
news reports, impact evaluation study, and the various systematization studies that were
undertaken on INCAGRO Phases I and II13. The database also provided INCAGRO with
the necessary evidence to argue the value and strength of competitive funding for science,
technology and innovation in the agricultural sector, and to promote the ability of local
groups to design, implement and be accountable for their innovation sub-projects.
Finally, the availability of great part of the information to the public was important in
ensuring the transparency of the use of funds and strengthening ties with the regional
governments and supporting their emergent regional research agendas.

2.3.4 The question arises however as to whether the SIGES and SIGER databases will
be sustained beyond Phase II, especially since no real hand-over could be made from
INCAGRO to INIA and MINAG staff during the last months of Phase II.


2.4        Fiduciary and Safeguard Compliance

Procurement

2.4.1 The management of procurement processes by INCAGRO was satisfactory. Four
ex-post procurement reviews were conducted during Project implementation. The ex-post
reports and the Bank‟s supervision mission aide-memoires included recommendations
that helped improve the management of procurement processes, including: (i) preparation
of a procurement plan, with a complete systematized information base for follow-up
action (the Project‟s procurement plan was approved and managed through SEPA); (ii)
implementation of a system of filing and archiving at PMU headquarters and at each
decentralized unit; and (iii) continuous training of the Project‟s procurement staff. These
recommendations were included in the action plans of the ex-post reports which were
complied with during Project implementation. INCAGRO submitted in a timely manner
the Project‟s procurement audit reports.

Financial Management

2.4.2 The Financial Management (FM) performance of the Project was satisfactory.
The INCAGRO PMU had adequate internal control procedures, very competent staff, a
robust financial information system, and submitted financial reports including audit
reports on time. The PMU undertook overall responsibility for management of Project
funds. The Project design included transfer of funds to the beneficiaries‟ bank accounts to
implement the sub-projects under Project Components 1 and 2. Those features required
highly qualified staff and a robust FM system to be designed and maintained throughout
the life of the Project.

2.4.3 The Bank provided advice to improve the FM performance of the PMU at the
start of Project implementation and INCAGRO followed those recommendations. To
13
     Annex 10 provides a full list of systematization studies on INCAGRO Phase II.

                                                                                        11
manage the sub-projects, the INCAGRO PMU implemented adequate accounting policies
to record transaction of funds transferred to sub-projects. It set up adequate internal
control procedures to monitor the funds transferred to the beneficiaries. It also developed
an information system (SIGES and SIGER, which are considered by the Bank as best
practices for the implementation of decentralized projects in Peru, see 2.3.2 and 2.3.3)
allowing the Project to follow the physical progress of sub-project implementation and
the corresponding disbursements previously agreed with the sub-project beneficiaries.

Environmental safeguards

2.4.4 The environmental safeguards performance of the Project was satisfactory.
Phase II allowed the expansion of a decentralized system of technological innovation,
substantially contributing to the generation and dissemination of sustainable and
environmentally safe technologies. This included the design and implementation of a
strategy of sustainable use of natural resources in all the activities related to technological
changes in the improvement of yield and competitiveness of farming and forest-based
activities.   In order to comply with Operational Policies 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment) and 4.09 (Pest Management) triggered by the Project and with the purpose
of mitigating potential adverse impacts, two key instruments were developed and
implemented: (i) Environmental Mitigation Action Plan and (ii) Pest Management Plan.

2.4.5 The objective of the Environmental Mitigation Action Plan (EMAP) was to
incorporate environmental aspects in all relevant activities and technologies proposed
and financed by the Project and determine the potential impact on the environment prior
to and at time of sub-project formulation to continue during implementation and post-
impact analysis. The EMAP included a set of operational indicators that were applied to
the selection of sub-projects and were incorporated into the Project‟s monitoring system.
Based on the results of the implementation of the Plan over the first two years of the
Project, the need to develop additional indicators to better link the design and
implementation of sub-projects to good environmental management practices and provide
additional criteria for project screening was identified. These indicators also helped to
reduce environmental risks through specific actions such as contingency plans to
minimize risks at the production, post-production, processing and marketing phases of
the rural agro-businesses, secure a rational use of natural resources, including key
elements of biodiversity, bio-safety and good and improved agricultural practices.

2.4.6 The EMAP has proven to be an adequate instrument to secure the
incorporation of environmental practices to the activities developed by the Project. At
Project closing, about 73% of the sub-projects substantially contribute to the conservation
of natural resources, particularly in those cases where rates of return directly depend on
the quality of the products and the applications of practices and technologies friendly
with the environment.

2.4.7 To complement the actions of the EMAP, the Pest Management Plan (PMP) was
deemed necessary due to Project interventions within Components 1 and 2 that would: (i)
change cultivation and management practices and use of newly improved cultivars and

                                                                                            12
crops that may have better pest tolerance; and (ii) potentially increase the use of pesticide
with agricultural intensification. The Project has been successful in: (i) developing a
detailed inventory of pest problems and their contexts (ecological, agricultural, public
health, economic, and institutional); (ii) preparing and disseminating the list of pest
control products authorized for procurement; (iii) development of integrated pest
management (IPM) approaches (biological control, cultural practices in habitat
management, use of resistant or tolerant varieties, replacement of pesticide use to the
minimum with other environmentally safe practices); (iv) creating capacity at the level of
end users to adequately manage pesticides and incorporate IPM practices; and (v)
monitoring changes in agricultural practices where different IPM measures were taken.


2.5    Post-completion Operation and Next Phase

2.5.1 At the time of Phase II Project closure, there was no commitment from INIA or
MINAG to continue with the originally planned Phase III of the INCAGRO APL,
which aimed to consolidate the pluralistic, decentralized, demand-driven and private
sector led characteristics of the National Agricultural Innovation System (NAIS) and to
institutionalize the INCAGRO model. They requested greater attention to the objective of
strengthening INIA (and its decentralized units), so that it would take on its new mandate
as regulating authority of the NAIS, while repositioning itself as executor of agricultural
research and extension.

2.5.2 The discontinuation of the APL resulted in a rather hasty closure of the
INCAGRO PMU headquarters and its nine decentralized units during the last months
of Phase II. Transition arrangements at Project closure have been limited mostly to a
transfer of office equipment, budget, archives and administrative tools from INCAGRO
to INIA. Little or no transfer of know-how from INCAGRO to INIA staff was done
during this transition. Hence, the institutional arrangements in the agricultural sector
were not in place to guarantee the sustainability of impacts and capacity strengthening
achieved. This is especially true at the regional level where INCAGRO‟s decentralized
units had reached out to regional governments and supported the development of regional
agricultural innovation systems, and where a clear demand for strengthening those
existed. However, the GOP has indicated its intention to find a solution for this in the
near future.

2.5.3 Outside the agricultural sector, however, the INCAGRO model of Competitive
Funds has left its mark on other institutions, many of which have followed on the use of
competitive funds and adapted the INCAGRO model to their context. Those include
several funding schemes (e.g. PROTEC and FINCYT) by the National Science and
Technology Innovation Council (CONCYTEC), some of which were also accessible to
agricultural producers‟ organizations. INCAGRO‟s tools and procedures, recruitment of
staff trained by INCAGRO, strengthened service providers and research institutes, and
the prepared producers‟ organizations all provided the new funding schemes with
opportunities for success. Hence, while the INCAGRO APL has not been expanded in a
Phase III, the widespread use of its Competitive Funding model represents a clear sign of

                                                                                          13
uptake and expansion of the Project approach. The question arises however as to whether
those schemes designed outside of the sector are sufficient to achieve the objectives of
science, technology and innovation and competitiveness of the agricultural sector.

2.5.4 At the level of producers’ groups, innovations generated and disseminated by
the Project are expected to be financially sustainable through the generation of
additional income. The producers‟ organizations strengthened by the Project are likely to
continue to operate with increased self-sufficiency. They have also demonstrated the
willingness and capacity to co-finance agricultural extension sub-projects under the FTA.
However, in the absence of a Phase III and/or pending the effective establishment of an
alternative mechanism to provide public funds for co-financing agricultural science,
technology and innovation sub-projects in rural areas, it is expected that the innovation
process for rural producers would largely be stalled.

2.5.5 Despite the interruption of the APL at the end of Phase II, there is wide
recognition by key stakeholders in and outside the agricultural sector that INCAGRO
has greatly contributed to diversifying and modernizing the national agricultural
innovation system, and that the tools and procedures developed during the two phases of
the APL should be institutionalized. The INCAGRO experience provides Peru the
opportunity to reflect on the institutional architecture required to finance, and execute, the
science, technology and innovation necessary to remain globally competitive in the
agricultural sector; and on the actions needed to strengthen the public and the private
dimensions of the pluralistic agricultural innovation system.


3.         Assessment of Outcomes

3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The objective of the Project remains highly relevant in the present context in Peru
where the need to improve competitiveness of the agricultural sector and to fill the gap of
Peru in terms of innovation compared to other LAC countries is clear. This is recognized
by the GOP – innovation is high on the agenda of MINAG (as reflected in the Legislative
Decree 1060), the usefulness and role of competitive grant funds are now recognized both
in agriculture and other economic sectors in Peru.


3.2        Achievement of PDO14

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

3.2.1 Although the INCAGRO Phase II achieved the targets of most of the PDO and
other performance indicators (see Tables 1 and 2, and Section F), it must be admitted that
the Project could not demonstrate properly the expansion, strengthening and institutional
development of the rural agricultural technology and innovation system, which were

     A more detailed description of the Project achievements by Component is presented in Annex 2.

                                                                                                     14
major ideas of the PDO. This is partly because the Project could not spend sufficient
efforts and time on the systematization of the AIS at different levels (national, regional,
key value chains etc.) and identification of required institutional capacity strengthening,
but also because of GOP‟s revocation of the originally planned Phase III, which intended
to guarantee the sustainability of the market for agricultural innovation services.

Component One, Strengthening the Market for Innovation Services
Rating: Satisfactory

3.2.2 Component 1 (FTA) has achieved its aim of advancing the development of a
decentralized market for professional services for agricultural innovation and to do this
on a country-wide basis (all macro-regions covered). Overall, the Component
accomplished the targets that had been set for the intermediate outcome indicators
defined at Project design. On the demand side, the total number of sub-projects on
extension and adaptive research was satisfactory, as well as their grounding in business
plans that reflected demands of producers‟ organizations, particularly indigenous
population and women. High levels of co-financing were achieved. On the supply side,
service providers were evaluated as highly satisfactory by the producers in terms of
responsiveness to their needs.

3.2.3 The model developed by INCAGRO, most notably the approach and tools used
for rigorous and transparent funding rounds, the organization and training of producers‟
groups to effectively plan for and demand extension services, the use of business plans
that reflect demands of producers‟ organizations, the use of coaches (aliados),
introducing innovation brokers from the Project‟s regional offices, and a strong database
management system account for much of this success.

3.2.4 The adaptive research sub-projects were effective in increasing the linkages to
research and extension, were demand driven, and resulted in solutions to practical
problems and their uptake by producers. They also strengthened regionalization efforts
and tied the field level research stations much more concretely to the concerns of local
producers. One limitation, however, was the blurring between extension actions
(demonstrations, training) with adaptive research – at times those sub-projects included
more extension outreach than adaptive research.


Component Two, Strengthening the National Agriculture Research and Development
System
Rating: Satisfactory

3.2.5 Component 2 (FDSE) has achieved its aim of strengthening agricultural research
and development for innovation in areas of strategic importance, and to enhance the
institutional and individual professional competencies in the field of agricultural
extension. Overall, the Component accomplished the targets that had been set for the
intermediate outcome indicators defined at Project design.

3.2.6 The Project exceeded the targets that had been set in terms of number of sub-
projects of strategic research approved; the number of peer reviewed publications and
research in priority research areas at national level; and the number of full-time
researchers in with MSc and PhD degrees in priority research areas. The FDSE
contributed to the development of competitive research funding models including the
setting of national strategic priorities and a research agenda within these priorities,

                                                                                      16
strengthened capacities for researchers, better prepared research institutions, and
important impacts from the research itself. The model was also efficient in reaching most
regions in the country with research and increased research capacity.

3.2.7 The Project also met its target for strengthening the technical and managerial
capacity of service providers to effectively provide services in response to the demand of
producers‟ organizations. The total number of certified service providers during Phase II
exceeded the target. An important result achieved by the Project under this Component
was the development of competency profiles for different types of service providers and
the subsequent design of the training and capacity strengthening programs based on those
profiles.

3.2.8 However, in general, much of the training was for technicians of producers‟
organizations (e.g. coffee graders) and much less for individual service providers, and
there was little training in extension methods.


Component Three, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Information Sharing, and
Policy for Innovation
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.2.9 Although Component 3 achieved most of the targets for its intermediate
indicators, those indicators were probably not the most adequate to measure the main
objective of Component 3, namely, to develop the institutional capacity of the public
sector to formulate and implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with the
private sector, and regulate the quality of the National Agricultural Innovation System
(NAIS).

3.2.10 Its main expected outcome of “establishing a Technological Innovation Policy
Focal Point within MINAG (this was later changed in the amended loan agreement to
INIA) that will be responsible for policy formulation and coordination of public
investments, which will contribute to the sustainability of the agricultural innovation
system” was not achieved. This was mainly due to external factors not under the control
of the Project and described above under 2.2, although it must be said that this indicator
was erroneously formulated at design (see 2.3.1).

3.2.11 Component 3, however, achieved different results that have contributed to
achieving its objective, most notably: (i) the establishment of a comprehensive M&E
system for the INCAGRO sub-projects, which could potentially be extended to the whole
NAIS, (ii) the implementation and successful operation of nine decentralized INCAGRO
offices (critical to strengthen the responsiveness of INCAGRO and the quality of the
services provided at regional and local level); and (iii) establishment of an effective and
web-based Project management and monitoring system (SIGER and SIGES); and (iv)
the design, dissemination and updating of a user-friendly Operational Manual for Sub-
project Management that can be considered as best practice for projects of competitive
funds.

                                                                                        17
3.2.12 Furthermore, the Project has – though mostly in the last year of implementation –
intensified its efforts related to the information sharing of its successful activities by
publishing high quality documents on its lessons learned (for a full list of
systematization studies published by the Project refer to Annex 10), which represent an
importance reference for the sector in terms of agricultural research and extension.


3.3       Efficiency

3.3.1 Good practice for economic analysis of agricultural research and extension
projects emphasizes that the calculation of a single summary measure such as net present
value (NPV)/ internal rate of return (IRR) for the whole project is usually of little value,
in particular for projects that are largely focused on institutional development and
capacity building. Instead, it is common to assess the financial and economic viability of
specific investments or sub-projects, while endeavoring to mainstream such analysis in
the regular operations of the research and extension system. In line with this
recommendation, INCAGRO has made increased efforts under Phase II to collect data on
costs and benefits of individual sub-projects as part of its M&E strategy.

3.3.2 Based on data assembled by INCAGRO in its SIGES database, an ex-post cost-
benefit analysis was carried out on a sample of 171 agricultural extension sub-projects
financed under INCAGRO Phase II. This analysis estimates the internal rate of return
(IRR) at 54%. This is higher than the PAD estimate of 34%, which was carried out
with the same methodology based on ex-ante analysis of a sample of 29 sub-projects
financed under INCAGRO Phase I. This difference may be due to higher profitability of
the sub-projects financed by INCAGRO under Phase II, compared to the expectations
under Phase I. However, this may also be due to other differences in basic assumptions,
which are not all clearly documented in the PAD analysis.

3.3.3 A separate cost-benefit analysis of investments made by INCAGRO since the
beginning of Phase I was done with a different methodology by a team of researchers
who carried out an impact study of INCAGRO in 200916. This analysis is based on
information collected on a sample of 44 sub-projects funded under the FTA (33 sub-
projects in extension and 11 in adaptive research) under Phases I and II of the INCAGRO
APL. Information on incremental revenues and operating costs is based on the
producers‟ perception of the changes that took place and their attribution of only part of
these changes to the INCAGRO Project, which leads to a more conservative estimate of
the IRR. The resulting IRR is estimated at 23%, which is still quite favorable. The
substantial difference with the methodology used at appraisal lies mainly in the relatively
low attribution of benefits to INCAGRO by rural producers, which is a very subjective
factor; other chapters of the impact study note that the producers‟ perception of the
influence of INCAGRO is often lower than the perception of other stakeholders
(including heads of producers‟ associations, extension agents and researchers). The

sensitivity analysis indicates that this IRR is quite robust to adverse changes in costs
and/or benefits, i.e. the IRR would still be acceptable (11%) with a 25% increase in costs
and 25% decrease in benefits. This sensitivity analysis is particularly interesting to assess
the viability of the Project as a whole, i.e. including the administrative costs of sub-
projects, which are estimated at 20% additional.

3.3.4 Very high and non-declining rates of returns on agricultural research and
extension worldwide, together with very low spending in Peru compared to other LAC
countries and the rest of the world, suggest that there are important investment
opportunities in this area that are not being fully exploited. Therefore it is worthwhile
for government to invest in activities such as those performed by INCAGRO. Actual
expenditures under the INCAGRO Phase II have reached an average of about US$ 9.1
million annually, of which over one-third (34.1%) is contributed by beneficiaries and
other members of strategic alliances. This brings the average additional public spending
to less than US$ 6 million annually or about 0.07% of Peru‟s agricultural GDP (2009
estimates17). Although this represents a significant increase (about + 35%) over the level
of pre-project public spending on agricultural R&D estimated at 0.2% of agricultural
GDP in Peru, it is still small in comparison with the LAC regional average of about 1%
of agricultural GDP18.

3.3.5 However, not only the level but also the quality of spending is an important
consideration, especially as fiscal constraints limit the amount that government is ready
to invest in agricultural research and extension. The organization, procedures and
implementation arrangements adopted under INCAGRO Phase II project are conducive
to effective and efficient use of public funds. In particular, a major contribution of the
INCAGRO Project has been to follow a stringent and effective selection process, thereby
assigning the scarce project resources to the most promising sub-project proposals. It
also provides incentives to the beneficiaries and sub-project implementing entities to
make efficient use of such resources and achieve the best possible outputs, as they make a
significant financial contribution in co-financing. Leveraging of public funds through
private sector participation increases the quality and quantity of the market of agricultural
innovation services and products.


3.4        Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

3.4.1 The Project results represent good evidence that its major objectives (as reflected
by the Project indicators and targets in the PAD) were achieved. The analysis of the
outcomes achieved in the individual Project components (described in section 3.2 and
Annex 2) takes account of this. However, it has to be acknowledged that some indicators

defined in the PAD were not the most appropriate measures of progress towards the PDO
(see 2.3.1). In addition to this, INCAGRO carried out different systematization studies
(see Annex 10), as well as an independent impact evaluation study19 that confirmed its
significant contribution to the achievement of the higher-level objectives such as
increased productivity and competitiveness.

3.4.2 It is however not evident that a sustainable or mature market for agriculture
innovation services is already in place. This was the aim of the originally planned
Phase III of INCAGRO. The number of strengthened service providers, and producer
groups strengthened in their abilities to demand services is still very limited. Also, many
new competitive funding schemes exist to tap into this demand. However, the services
are not financially sustainable without public funds and most critical, the regional support
for innovation services has been eliminated with the closure of the INCAGRO Program.
Similarly, research capacities have been strengthened and individual findings have been
useful in increasing productivity goals within the sub-projects. However, no long term
plan is in place or being supported by national or international funds to further strengthen
the agricultural research and development system or INIA more specifically as the
regulating entity of the NAIS.


3.5       Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1 By improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the agricultural technology
system, the Project has contributed to increase agricultural productivity and farmers’
income. The level of revenue increases as documented by the impact evaluation study of
INCAGRO20 is greatly related to the increased market access achieved by the sub-project
implementing entities. This depends on factors such as the type of product and the market
(local, regional, national, export). Instruments such as trademarks, registration and
certification are a contributing factor to revenue increases. The capacity strengthening
generated by participating in INCAGRO sub-projects increased the employability of
young men and women. In addition, a major social benefit of the Project has been the
strengthening of producers’ organizations, especially as they have been explicitly
designated under Phase II to take the leadership of the strategic alliances in which NGOs
played previously a dominant role under Phase I.

3.5.2 Although the Project implementation arrangements did not explicitly target the
rural poor, its expansion nationwide has included the poorest regions of the country.
Specific measures have also been designed during Phase II to facilitate the

participation of vulnerable and traditionally marginalized groups21 (in particular
indigenous communities and women organizations) in agricultural extension sub-
projects (FTA), through the introduction of sub-projects type III of smaller size and lower
co-financing requirements compared to types I and II, as well as more intensive support
by the Project for sub-project preparation, and simplified negotiation processes. This
worked well as 156 out of a total of 334 sub-projects in agricultural extension benefited
those groups (116 for indigenous communities and 40 for women organizations).
Participation in INCAGRO extension sub-projects has positively impacted the economic
and personal lives of the indigenous people and women‟s organizations involved in the
156 sub-projects.


(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

3.5.3 Major institutional challenges of the Project have already been discussed in
sections 2.1 and 2.2. In summary, it can be noted that in spite of the resistance to the
approach to establish the competitive funding mechanism outside of INIA and in spite of
the subsequent lack of support for a government led institutionalization of the successful
INCAGRO model, INCAGRO has managed to create significant institutional
capacities in the regions in the form of producer organizations and also public-private
alliances ready to apply for funding at the multiple cross-sectoral competitive innovation
funds that have been established in recent years by the Government of Peru. The largest
of the funds, is completely based on the INCAGRO model and was designed by ex-
INCAGRO staff trained over many years in the planning, implementation, monitoring
and evaluation of competitive funding processes. At present, the Peruvian government is
considering a significant increase in the use of competitive funding – including in
agriculture – based on the positive experience of INCAGRO.

3.5.4 Also, the recently enacted DL 1060 requires INIA to promote the establishment
of a country-wide pluralistic, demand-driven agricultural innovation system. Though
many of the practical aspects of these institutional innovations are yet to be worked out,
and the future of the institutionally still weak INIA is uncertain, the sustainability of the
competitive funding model to promote agricultural innovations is out of question and
will continue into the future (in its present form or in other, "copy-cat" forms) - as its
viability and utility have been clearly demonstrated.


(c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.5 The INCAGRO Phase II Project has demonstrated the validity of its model of
intervention, characterized by competitive grant funds for agricultural research and
extension open to a variety of institutions and co-financed by the sub-project
implementing entities and strategic alliances. The INCAGRO model has been replicated

by other projects or interventions in various sectors in Peru (e.g. FINCYT, FIDECOM,
etc.).

3.5.6 Under Phase II, INCAGRO has considerably improved its computerized
databases and management information system. A web-based application for the
monitoring and evaluation of sub-projects (SIGES) has been developed, which was
accessible directly by the decentralized INCAGRO offices that could use the information
in addition to reporting it. Steps have also been taken to link SIGES to the overall
information management system developed by INCAGRO (SIGER). The SIGER has
been fully documented and considered as best practice by GOP for the agricultural sector,
and has been replicated for the management of several other public sector projects
including the MARENASS project funded by IFAD, and the Irrigation Sub-sector Project
(PSI) funded by the World Bank.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome


Component One, Strengthening the Market for Innovation Services
Rating: Moderate to Substantial

4.1     The risk that the strengthening of the decentralized market for professional
services for agricultural innovation will not be sustained is considered moderate to
significant, mainly for two reasons. First, because most of Phase I and II was focused on
providing effective and efficient models for competitive funding for the provision of
extension services, leaving insufficient time to properly systematize the experience
acquired; to understand the characteristics of the market for innovation services at
different levels (national, sub-national, level of specific value chains); and to develop
supporting policies that would lead to more sustainable models. Secondly, because
MINAG has chosen to suspend the INCAGRO APL at the end of Phase II, in the absence
of any viable alternative as of the Project closing date to consolidate the achievements of
the FTA.

4.2    This risk could be mitigated by the fact that other competitive funds have been
created by GOP some of which are accessible to agricultural producers‟ organizations
and which may lead to enhanced coordination between those organizations and service
providers.




                                                                                        22
Component Two, Strengthening the National Agriculture Research and Development
System
Rating: Substantial

4.3     The risk that the achievements related to the strengthening of the NAIS will not
be further consolidated is considered significant, mainly because the institutional
arrangements are not in place to consolidate the System at the national and sub-national
levels. The Project contributed to developing a national agricultural research agenda,
increasing the capacity of researchers and their institutions to develop, implement, and
transfer the results of strategic agricultural research activities. Competitive funding
models such as the FDSE are now recognized as the norm for the funding of research.
The Project also strengthened the abilities of researchers and their institutions to team up,
and assisted in the formation of regional research agendas thereby strengthening the
decentralization efforts. However, the model proposed by MINAG as of the Project
closing date to consolidate the NAIS is based to a great extent on the strengthening of
INIA and its network of research stations to implement agricultural research activities.
While these reform efforts may help INIA as a main executor of agricultural research,
they do not necessarily lead to a stronger, decentralized, pluralistic, and demand driven
agricultural innovation system.

4.4     This risk could be mitigated if the GOP engages the different entities composing
the NAIS as established by the Legislative Decree 1060 (INIA, MINAG, and others), as
well as other relevant stakeholders, on how to operationalize said Decree, including on
the issue of separating the policy, funding and implementation functions of
agricultural innovation; formulating the national policy and plan for agricultural
innovation; and supporting INIA transformation so it takes up its foreseen role as
regulating entity of the NAIS.


Component Three, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Information Sharing, and
Policy for Innovation
Rating: Substantial

4.5     The risk that the comprehensive M&E system and databases achieved by the
Project for its sub-projects (SIGES and SIGER) will not be expanded to cover the whole
NAIS is considered significant, especially because no real hand-over could be made from
INCAGRO to INIA and MINAG staff during the last months of Phase II. Also,
arrangements are not in place to realize the capacity of the public sector to formulate and
implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with the private sector, and
regulate the quality of the NAIS (see 4.3 above). The same risk mitigation as described
above applies, including the policy dialogue between the GOP and the Bank on a possible
follow-up operation to the APL in support of the strengthening of the NAIS.




                                                                                          23
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank

(a) Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.1 As noted in section 2.1 the quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. The
background work for preparation was sound and the lessons learned from Phase I of the
APL were adequately taken into consideration. Criticism on the design was mainly
related to: (i) underestimating the risks associated with the development of a parallel
system of agricultural research and innovation, (ii) insufficiently incorporating
institutional strengthening of key actors in the public sector (e.g. INIA, MINAG), policy
dialogue, and developing a sound institutional exit strategy as risk mitigation measures.
However, the ex-post analysis of the preparation process showed that these issues were
intensively discussed during preparation, but that political sensitivities did not allow
including major parts of these discussions in the PAD.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.2 Bank supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank team supported
effective implementation through regular and appropriate supervision missions towards
the achievement of development outcomes. The supervision missions tried in particular
to improve the policy dialogue, including by: (i) suggesting Project activities to help the
articulation among the different actors of the NAIS, e.g. workshops at the regional level
to assess innovation systems and elaborate innovation strategies, and at the national level
to support the elaboration of INIA‟s Strategic Plan, (ii) raising the need to clarify the
institutional and operational arrangements of the merger of INCAGRO into INIA, (iii)
supporting the creation of joint INCAGRO-INIA committees to help INIA define its
strategic needs to assume its new mandate of regulating authority of the NAIS, and (iv)
raising the importance of the institutional arrangements for the management of
competitive funds after Phase II of the APL. In doing so, the Bank team could probably
have engaged more intensely with key actors of the public sector (mainly MINAG and
INIA), including on their needs for strengthening. However, most of the external impacts
on the Project implementation related to the higher level political and institutional
changes discussed in section 2.2 that were outside the Bank‟s control.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory




                                                                                        24
5.1.3 The overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, in line with the
same ratings for quality at entry and supervision.


5.2    Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

5.2.1 The Government Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory, even though
MEF and MINAG initially strongly supported the Project and the chosen approach to
establish the competitive funding process outside of INIA, given the lack of trust in INIA
to establish and manage the competitive funds in an efficient and transparent way. The
frequent changes at high level in MINAG (see section 2.2) and INIA, and the expeditive
merger of INCAGRO into INIA in 2008, seriously affected Project implementation, in
particular by hampering the dialogue on the perspectives of institutionalization and
consolidation of the INCAGRO model by the agricultural sector.


(b) Implementing Agency (or Agencies) Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.2.2 The Implementing Agency (IA) Performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.
On the one hand, the PMU did a very satisfactory job in the implementation of the two
competitive funds (FTA and FDSE), especially in the last three years of the Project, with
the development and establishment of an effective overall management and M&E system
of the sub-projects, and the systematization of the experience of the Phases I and II of the
APL. On the other hand, the performance of the Implementing Agency has been deficient
on the policy front, as it did not, or insufficiently, engage the political dialogue between
INCAGRO, INIA and MINAG. This exacerbated since the merger of INCAGRO into
INIA in 2008, and jeopardized the preparation of the initially planned Phase III of the
APL as well as the foreseen institutionalization and consolidation of the INCAGRO
model by the agricultural sector.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.2.3 The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory.
Notwithstanding the limitations noted above, the Borrower showed commitment to the
Project objectives during the preparation phase, and followed through during
implementation, including through strong counterpart funding.




                                                                                         25
6.     Lessons Learned

Overall

6.1.1 Given the high rates of return on agricultural research and extension worldwide,
and confirmed in Peru by this Project, it is worthwhile for governments to invest in
activities such as those performed by INCAGRO. Bringing together the various actors of
the innovation system in the form of “strategic alliances” – to promote innovation, i.e.
generation and adoption of technological as well as organizational improvements in the
supply chain – is efficient in the short term (increased incomes) as well as in the longer
term (change in attitudes fostering continuous generation and adoption of innovations).

Competitive Funds

6.1.2 The organization, procedures and implementation arrangements of the
competitive funds (FTA and FDSE) adopted under INCAGRO Phase II have been
conducive to effective and efficient use of public funds. In particular, a major
contribution of INCAGRO has been to follow a stringent and effective selection process,
thereby assigning the scarce Project resources to the most promising sub-project
proposals. Based on the success of the INCAGRO model, Peru has created several
competitive funding schemes to promote science, technology and innovation based in
diverse sectors of the economy.

6.1.3 Reliance on competitive funds to manage technology generation and
dissemination has its limits, as there is also a need to ensure the provision of essential
public goods such as basic long term research programs. Investment in generating
demand-driven research alone is insufficient to address long-term problems (e.g. human
and physical capacity) where the allocation of funds to strategic research issues is
essential for the viability of a comprehensive program.

Institutional Approach and Sustainability

6.1.4 The main lessons learned from the institutional development approach pursued
are the following: (i) the institutional success of this project did not depend on designing
an institutional model for agricultural innovation for the country, but on the institutional
impacts of the sound implementation of the innovative competitive funds themselves
(power of a successful model, institutional capacities created on the demand side); (ii)
transparent policies and rigorous selection and monitoring procedures are the keys to the
success of competitive funds. INCAGRO‟s operating procedures, information systems,
and communication strategies were important to implementing the program effectively;
(iii) the INCAGRO staff was in decentralized offices throughout the country, which
supported national decentralization goals. Other competitive funding programs in Peru
noted the strength of such a decentralized approach.

6.1.5 There are significant risks involved in promoting innovative approaches from
outside the predominant institutional structures (i.e. national research institutes),

                                                                                         26
however, specific circumstances can justify such an „outside‟ approach – although they
do not eliminate the risk of possible lack of success and ownership. Therefore, care
should be taken to ensure a broad based public-private partnership as well as long term
institutional and financial sustainability of the model after Project closure.

6.1.6 While it is important to focus on the establishment of the funding cycles and
tools, eventually focus must turn to the development of sustainability through private cost
recovery, funding partners, and ongoing government support.

Monitoring and Evaluation

6.1.7 The establishment of an effective system for monitoring results at sub-project and
Project levels (SIGER and SIGES) provided the necessary evidence to argue the value
and strength of competitive funding for science, technology and innovation in the
agricultural sector, and to promote the ability of local groups to design, implement and
monitor innovation sub-projects. However, more deliberate care is needed to document
the ex-post impacts and the careful and limited use of control groups to reach clearer
conclusions on the Project impact.

6.1.8 Project leadership must make efforts to communicate the value of the project, the
model, and the impacts, in ways that policy makers will be able to use it to make
decisions. INCAGRO was relatively slow in communicating on its successes and at least
in the first years of Phase II did not have a strong communication and outreach plan to
major stakeholders (e.g. MINAG, INIA) and wider audience.

Agricultural extension approach

6.1.9 It is possible to have farmers become authentic drivers of agriculture extension
systems, but it does require professional backstopping support by “allies.” Co-financing
is a useful mechanism to leverage public funds in agricultural extension, and provides
incentives to the beneficiaries and sub-project implementing entities to make efficient use
of such resources and achieve the best possible outputs. However, there is a need for
continuous support with public funds especially for more vulnerable groups. The impact
of those sub-projects greatly depends on the capacity of the producers‟ organizations and
the investment made by the Project to strengthen them.

6.1.10 The long-term sustainability of individual extension service providers is not
guaranteed through competitive funding schemes; however, it may represent a
sustainable model for extension provision. It is possible that the future of agriculture
innovation service markets will include multiple competitive funding schemes which
seek efficiency and responsiveness on the part of the extension providers and effective
demand by farmers. This model or market may grow, shrink, or change focus based on
funders and demands by producers.




                                                                                        27
Environmental practices

6.1.11 Environmental safeguards compliance, in particular the incorporation of
environmental practices by local agricultural producers, including integrated pest
management, has been a rather long and complicated process. It implied a change of
attitude based on the understanding that such practices generate direct benefits such as
the improved access to local and international markets and the reduction of investments
costs particularly associated to the reduced use of pesticides. These achievements linked
to the Environmental and Pest Management Plans were, in a way, unintended outcomes
of the Project. Capacity building at the local level has been crucial to secure improved
agricultural production while effectively conserving natural resources.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies and Partners

The Borrower provided comments on the ICR (Annex 7), acknowledging the success of
the INCAGRO APL and the milestone it has represented for the development of
innovation and scientific research in the Peruvian agricultural sector. The Borrower also
indicated its commitment to the formulation of a Program to implement and strengthen
the National Agricultural Innovation System (NAIS). This would consist of supporting
the policy and strategy functions of the public sector, as well as its execution of research
in nationally prioritized areas; and continuing to promote the implementation of research,
technology and innovation by the private sector, based on the demand-driven approach
initiated by the INCAGRO Program.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The implementation of the Phase II of INCAGRO started in July 2005. The following
four components have been implemented:

Component 1. Strengthening the Market for Innovation Services

1.   The aim of Component 1 was to advance the development of a decentralized market
     for professional services for agricultural innovation. During Phase II, a total of 381
     sub-projects (versus a target of 593) were financed through the “Agrarian
     Technology Fund” (FTA) which supported extension service sub-projects and
     adaptive research sub-projects. Extension service represented the biggest share of
     the FTA with 334 approved sub-projects versus 47 on adaptive research. The FTA
     reached a total of 36,864 direct beneficiaries (29,139 individuals benefited from
     extension services and 4,725 from adaptive research). FTA expenditures amounted
     to a total of PEN 53,484,881 broken down in Project funds (PEN 35,373,034,
     equivalent to 66%) and co-financing by strategic alliances (PEN 18,111,847,
     equivalent to 34%). The average value of a FTA sub-project reached PEN 140,380.

2.   To allow for the participation of low-income groups, three types of extension service
     sub-projects were put in place (Types I, II and III), corresponding to different size
     (maximum amount of Project co-financing) and minimum percentage of co-
     financing by the beneficiaries. Type III targeted low-income groups and from 2008
     onwards explicitly indigenous groups and women groups. The involvement of
     indigenous groups and women in the FTA was satisfactory with 156 sub-projects
     (116 of indigenous groups and 40 sub-projects of women‟s groups) compared to a
     target established in the PAD of 330 and later revised in the first amendment to the
     loan agreement to 210. The sub-projects for indigenous peoples involved 4,718
     participants of whom 44% women and 56% men and covered 16 departments of the
     Sierra, 55 provinces and 117 districts. The sub-projects for women organizations
     involved 1,411 participants of whom 70% women and 30% men, and covered 13
     departments of the Sierra and the Selva, 25 provinces and 38 districts. Hence, on
     average, the participation of men and women in the Type III sub-projects was 50%-
     50%.


Component 2. Strengthening the National Agricultural Research and Development
System

3.   The aim of Component 2 was to strengthen agricultural research and technological
     development for innovation in strategic areas of national importance, and to
     strengthen institutional and professional competence. The implementation of the
     “Strategic Services Development Fund” (FDSE) supported a total of 106 sub-
     projects. The largest part of the FDSE went to strategic research (72 sub-projects
     compared to a target of 47) and the rest to capacity development of extension agents
     (34 sub-projects, no target established in the PAD). The FDSE sub-projects reached

                                                                                        31
     a total of 6,625 direct beneficiaries, of which 5,202 in strategic research and 1,422 in
     capacity development of extension agents.

4.   FDSE expenditures amounted to a total of PEN 57,056,263 of which Project co-
     financing represented about 44% (PEN 25,182,058) and financial contribution by
     beneficiaries 56% (PEN 31,874,205). Public institutions, producers‟ organizations,
     universities, NGOs, private companies and international entities were the main
     implementing and financing partners of INCAGRO within the FDSE.

5.   The average value of FDSE sub-projects (PEN 538,266) is significantly higher than
     the FTA ones (PEN 140,380) and reflects the inherent nature of strategic research,
     which requires more substantial investments.

6.   Regarding strategic research, the areas that mostly attracted investments were
     Genetic Resources Conservation and Use (46 sub-projects) and Natural Resource
     Management (9 sub-projects). Capacity development of extension agents was
     mostly demanded in the value chains of cacao, coffee, Andean camelids (llama and
     alpaca) and meat products. Tangible impacts are the “organic” and “fair trade”
     certifications obtained by a total of 2,325 producers, resulting in decreased
     production costs reduction and increased business opportunities, especially for the
     coffee and cacao value chains.

7.   Under Component 2, INCAGRO has promoted the establishment and strengthening
     of national and international networks for research and innovation, contributed to
     developing the quality of agricultural extension services, improved research
     facilities, mobilized external resources and strengthened the demand driven side of
     research and extension. On the other hand, INCAGRO‟s contribution in promoting
     the establishment of “centers of excellence” in emerging areas of science and
     technology, as planned in the PAD, was not or not sufficiently prioritized.
     INCAGRO supported the strengthening of both public and private research
     institutions, including the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute (IIAP) (public
     research institution), the Cayetano Heredia University (private university), the
     Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa (private university), the National
     Agrarian University in Lima (UNALM) (public university), and the National
     Institute for Agricultural Innovation (public entity), among others.


Component 3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), Information Sharing, and Policy
for Innovation

8.   The aim of Component 3 was to develop the institutional capacity of the public
     sector to formulate and implement agricultural innovation policy in conjunction with
     the private sector, and regulate the quality of the National Agricultural Innovation
     System (NAIS). Most relevant outputs achieved during Phase II and contributing to
     this objective are: (i) implementation of 8 decentralized offices (critical to
     strengthen the responsiveness of INCAGRO and the quality of the services provided

                                                                                          32
     at local level); (ii) establishment of an effective Monitoring System (SIGER and
     SIGES); (iii) launch of the web based INCAGRO sub-project database; (iv)
     publishing and dissemination of the Operational Manual for sub-project
     management. These achievements represent major investments which resulted in
     replicable good practices.

9.   With reference to the INCAGRO monitoring system, following the
     recommendations made by the World Bank mid-term review (February 2008), both
     the SIGER and SIGES have been further developed improving their main functions.
     In particular, the SIGES external access functionalities have been improved,
     enabling: (i) online management of grants and sub-project proposals; (ii) capturing
     results based budget at sub-project level; (iii) identifying critical steps (milestones)
     for monitoring progress towards sub-projects results; (iv) on line-submission of sub-
     project progress and financial reporting and purchase orders; (v) electronic
     processing of sub-projects reports and purchase orders by INCAGRO decentralized
     units; (vi) provision of feedback by the INCAGRO decentralized units to sub-project
     implementing entities on administrative and substantial aspects; (vii) monitoring the
     satisfaction of sub-projects implementing entities with the services provided by
     INCAGRO. As of today, both SIGER and SIGES are efficient and reliable tools and
     represent important achievements made by INCAGRO. These types of tools are not
     common in the Peruvian public sector context and represent replicable good
     practices, as they promote results based management, transparent and efficient use
     of resources, systematization of results and learning from experience. Currently,
     both the SIGER and SIGES are being utilized by three additional projects financed
     by the World Bank.

10. Regarding the decentralization of INCAGRO, the participation of regional
    governments has been very limited, mainly due to weak capacities of these emerging
    institutions. The regionalization of Peru, the process of political and administrative
    decentralization and the establishment of macro regions was inaugurated when
    Phase II was being designed. As of today, the targeted macro regions are being
    established and regional governments did not set up strong partnership with
    INCAGRO. This is mainly due to the regional political agenda, where innovation in
    the agricultural sector is currently not a priority.

11. INCAGRO contributed to developing capacities at Municipality level in formulating
    and implementing sub-projects, achieving a significant participation in co-financing.
    This resulted in FTA coverage of the 25 regions of the country. The establishment of
    9 decentralized INCAGRO offices undoubtedly supported these achievements.


Component 4. Project Implementation

12. The aim of Component 4 was to finance the INCAGRO-Project Management Unit
    (PMU), as the Implementing Agency for Phase II. INCAGRO has fully achieved its
    strengthening as an efficient and recognized public entity responsible for the

                                                                                          33
promotion of innovation and technology in the agricultural sector. Focus was given
to the improvement of efficiency and transparency in the management of the two
competitive funds (FTA and FDSE). At the same time, INCAGRO has shown
flexibility in managing the two funds, being capable of designing calls for proposals
tailored to specific contexts (national, regional, local), subjects and partners
(Municipalities, Research Institutions, Private Companies, Vulnerable Groups, etc).
Examples can be found in the calls for proposals designed in partnership with
Municipal governments, or in the segmentation by niche of the extension service
calls (Tipo I, Tipo II, Tipo III) which enabled access of vulnerable groups to the
extension service grants.

                        Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Methodological considerations and data sources

1.     The economic and financial analysis carried out in the PAD for Phase II of the
       Agricultural Research and Extension APL (INCAGRO II) followed good practices
       in the World Bank. The Good Practice Note, “Ex Ante Economic Analysis in AKIS
       Projects – Methods and Guidelines” (March 2000)22 emphasizes that the calculation
       of a single summary measure should not be the major objective of the economic
       analysis of Research and Extension (R&E) because it is usually subject to a wide
       range of assumptions. Rather, the priority should be mainstreaming economic
       analysis into a process of evaluating costs and benefits for more efficient resource
       allocation within the R&E system itself. Because Bank-funded R&E projects
       allocate considerable resources to institutional development and capacity building,
       attempting an economic analysis for such projects per se is of little value. Instead,
       the mainstreaming of economic analysis during project implementation and beyond
       should provide a framework for R&E managers to think about the impact of their
       actions in terms of costs and benefits, thereby leading to a more efficient allocation
       of scarce resources.

2.     Given the demand-driven nature of Competitive Grant Funds that are the main
       instruments of INCAGRO, type and size of sub-project investments were not known
       precisely at Project preparation stage. Implementation procedures of the
       INCAGRO Phase II Project require presentation of a sustainable business plan for
       sub-projects applications in adaptive research and extension (Agricultural
       Technology Fund or Fondo de Tecnología Agraria – FTA) under Component 1.
       These business plans include information on cash flow (investment and operating
       costs, expected annual incomes) both before and with the project, which enables to
       assess the expected (ex-ante) viability and financial profitability of individual sub-
       projects. As part of its M&E system, INCAGRO also records actual achievements
       of each sub-project which can be used for ex-post financial and economic analysis.

3.     Priority setting for sub-projects in strategic research and in training of extension
       agents under Component 2 (Strategic Services Development Fund or Fondo de
       Desarrollo de Servicios Estratégicos – FDSE) is done through consultations and
       discussions respectively at the national and regional levels. Sub-project proposals
       include information on expected physical and economic impacts (change in yields or
       costs per hectare resulting from the research) and/or diffusion potential (estimated
       number of farmers to be reached). However, it is usually considered that these types
       of sub-projects do not lend themselves to a quantified economic and financial
       analysis in the traditional way (cost-benefit analysis), as this would require many
       assumptions and/or excessive efforts in data collection.

4.   In addition to the information recorded systematically in its sub-projects database as
     part of its M&E system, INCAGRO commissioned an impact study carried out in
     the field in 2009 by a team of researchers from Brazil23. This study conducted
     extensive surveys of direct and indirect beneficiaries of the project that showed high
     level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries for the services and technologies
     implemented by INCAGRO. It also includes a cost-benefit analysis of project
     investments.

Lessons learnt from analyses of investments and public spending in agricultural
research and extension (R&E)

5.   Many ex-post analyses of investments in agricultural research and extension
     (R&E) have shown high returns to these investments in most countries, ranging
     between 40-75 %. The most powerful international review of literature was
     conducted by IFPRI in 2000.24 This study reviewed 294 benefit-cost studies,
     reporting 1,858 estimates of rates of return to R&E investments. It shows average
     returns to research investments alone of 88%, extension alone averaging 79%, and
     research and extension combined averaging 45%. The lower estimate for research
     and extension combined might be due to these studies capturing more of the total
     cost of the technology generation and dissemination process. The study found no
     evidence of decline in rates of return over time and little consistent difference
     among regions of the world. The estimated rates of return tend to be higher in
     developed countries whilst among developing countries, they tend to be higher in
     Asia and Pacific and, to a lesser extent, in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
     than in Africa or in West Asia.

6.   Several publications from IFPRI also demonstrate positive growth and poverty
     reduction effects from public expenditure on agriculture,25 with particularly high
     returns associated with public spending in research and development. Of all
     types of public expenditures in rural areas, there is considerable literature suggesting
     that spending on agricultural research and development has greatest impact. For
     instance, when ranking Government expenditures according to their effectiveness in
     rural India,26 it was found that Government expenditure on roads has by far the
     largest impact on rural poverty, but investment in agricultural research and extension
     has the second largest impact on rural poverty as well as the largest impact of any
     investment on productivity growth. Other types of government spending (education,
     rural development, irrigation, rural electrification, soil and water conservation,
     health) rank lower on both counts. Similar results have been obtained in rural

     China,27 and other case studies in Asia (Thailand, Vietnam) and Africa28 also
     confirm that agricultural research, education, and rural infrastructure are generally
     the three most effective public spending items in promoting agricultural growth and
     rural poverty reduction. These studies also show that the trade-off between
     agricultural growth and poverty reduction is generally small among different types
     of investments and between regions. The most effective investments such as
     agricultural research and development have large growth impact as well as large
     poverty reduction impact. Regional analysis conducted for China and India suggests
     that more investments in many less-developed areas not only offer the largest
     poverty reduction per unit of spending, but also lead to the highest economic returns.

7.   Most of these studies on relative returns of various types of public investment in
     rural areas relate to Asia and, to a lesser extent, Africa. In the LAC region, analysis
     has been made on the comparative effectiveness of rural public expenditures on
     private goods (subsidies) vs. public goods.29 This analysis shows that spending on
     public goods (which include public research and development) is largely preferable
     in terms of economic efficiency as well as social equity and the environment. Little
     information is available to compare returns on different types of public goods in
     rural areas of the LAC region. Since social, economic, political and cultural
     conditions are very different, the results from Asian studies by IFPRI cannot be
     generalized into Latin America and there is a need to conduct similar studies in the
     LAC region.30 However, there is no reason to believe that comparative returns to
     public investment in R&E would be significantly different from other regions in the
     world.

Agricultural R&D spending in Peru and under INCAGRO II project

8.   Investment in Research and Development (R&D) in Peru – including public and
     private spending in all economic sectors – is among the lowest in Latin America and
     the Caribbean (LAC) region. As of 2004, it represents only 0.15% of GDP, against a
     regional average of 0.52%. Expenditure per capita is equally small (USD 3.69 vs.
     regional average USD 21.87 in 2004).31 The same applies to other indicators such as
     scientific personnel, number of publications and patents. Over the period 1997-2004,
     Peru has been catching up to some extent with its neighbors, as its R&D expenditure
     increased relatively fast (from 0.08% in 1997 to 0.15% of GDP in 2004) while the
     regional average was basically stagnant. However, this growth in Peru was from a
     very low base. Since 2004, overall R&D spending in LAC has increased

      significantly (reaching 0.62 % of regional GDP in 2008) but there is no specific data
      for Peru.32 During the period 1997-2004, over a third of all R&D in Peru was
      executed by government, against a regional average closer to only one fourth.

9.    Specifically in the agricultural sector, data on R&D are collected under the
      Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) Initiative facilitated by
      IFPRI. However, the ASTI database does not include any information on Peru due
      to a lack of available time-series data.33 As a whole, the LAC region is characterized
      by an average agricultural research intensity ratio (measured by the ratio of total
      public agricultural R&D spending as a percentage of agricultural GDP) estimated at
      1.14% in 2006. This regional average is high compared with other developing
      regions of the world, such as Africa (0.65%) and the Asia-Pacific (0.42%). There
      are, however, very wide fluctuations among LAC countries34, where the agricultural
      research intensity ratio ranges from as little as 0.2% to as high as 2.0% (which is
      close to ratios reported in the developed world)35.

10. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for INCAGRO II project states that the
    level of public investment in agricultural research in Peru was extremely low at the
    time of APL design, about 0.2% of agricultural GDP during 1997-99. This would
    place Peru at the bottom of the scale for LAC countries, which is consistent with its
    documented low overall investment in R&D for all sectors. Actual expenditures
    under the INCAGRO II project have reached an average of about USD 9.1 million
    annually,36 which is equivalent to about 0.1% of agricultural GDP.37 Of this amount,
    however, over one-third (34.1%) was contributed by beneficiaries and other
    members of strategic alliances, which brings down the average additional annual
    public spending to less than USD 6 million or about 0.07% of agricultural GDP.
    This represents a significant increase in comparison with pre-project public spending
    on agricultural R&D (0.2% of agricultural GDP), but it is still small in comparison
    to the LAC regional average of about 1% of agricultural GDP.

11. The very high and non-declining rates of returns on agricultural R&E worldwide,
    together with very low spending in Peru compared to other LAC countries and the
    rest of the world, suggest that there are important investment opportunities in this
    domain that are not being fully exploited. This means that it is worthwhile, in

   Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico spend a relatively large share of their agricultural GDP on

     principle, for the government to invest in activities such as those performed by
     INCAGRO.

12. However, not only the level but also the quality of spending is an important
    consideration. The key issue is not so much how much money is spent by
    government on agricultural R&E but rather how effectively and efficiently public
    monies are being spent. Agricultural innovation processes require long term political
    commitment, financial stability and institutional strength. A poor performance of
    the national agricultural research and extension system can place the efficiency of
    agricultural R&E investments in doubt by compromising the achievement and
    sustainability of high rates of returns. Fiscal constraints also limit the amount that
    government is ready to invest in agricultural R&E. Therefore attention should be
    focused on efficient targeting of investment resources to achieve growth, poverty
    and environmental goals, together with improved efficiency in the use of these
    resources by agencies providing public goods and services such as agricultural R&E.

13. The organization, procedures and implementation arrangements adopted under the
    INCAGRO II project are conducive to effective and efficient use of public funds. In
    particular, a main contribution of the INCAGRO project is (i) to follow a stringent
    and effective selection process, thereby assigning the scarce project resources to
    the most promising proposals, and (ii) to provide incentives to the implementing
    agencies to make efficient use of such resources and achieve the most outputs as
    possible. Direct beneficiaries and other stakeholders forming the strategic alliances
    who implement the selected sub-projects also make a substantial financial
    contribution in the form of co-financing. In this way, public funds are leveraged
    through private sector participation, which increases the quality as well as quantity
    of the market of agricultural services and products.

Estimates of IRR and NPV for investments in INCAGRO II project

14. At appraisal, a standard financial and economic analysis (cost-benefit analysis) was
    carried out for a sample of 29 sub-projects approved by INCAGRO during the first
    phase of the APL (INCAGRO I). These sub-projects dealt with agricultural
    extension and adaptive research (corresponding to the Agricultural Technology
    Fund or FTA). The sample selection (29 sub-projects out of a total of 75 funded
    under the FTA in INCAGRO I at the time of the analysis) was based on data
    availability and therefore not a formally randomized selection of all sub-projects.
    However, the sample size was considered as sufficient, represented the different
    regions and sub-project types, and was not biased towards successful projects. The
    information used for the financial and economic analysis was based on ex-ante
    estimates of costs and benefits for this sample of Phase I sub-projects, as
    documented in the sub-project applications files kept by INCAGRO. At the time, no
    baseline information was available for sub-projects approved and implemented by
    INCAGRO. A main assumption was, therefore, that the net benefit “before project”
    would be equal to zero, i.e. the economic and financial analysis was basically done
    on the total (and not incremental) net benefit. As a result, estimates of Internal Rate

                                                                                        39
        of Return (IRR) and Net Present Value (NPV) were on the high side and possibly
        overestimated.

15. The PAD estimated the financial IRR of the aggregated sample of sub-projects at
    36.5%. Since price distortions in Peru are limited and affect only a few products
    (mainly sugar, cotton, corn, milk and rice), the differences between the results of the
    financial and economic analysis are small. The economic IRR was estimated at
    34% (with a NPV of about USD 7 million calculated at a 12% discount rate for the
    aggregated sample of 29 sub-projects). Sensitivity analysis indicated that a 20%
    reduction in sub-project benefits would lead to an IRR of 14%.

16. At project completion, a similar analysis has been undertaken on a sample of 171
    sub-projects funded from the FTA under INCAGRO II. As a result of improvements
    made by INCAGRO in the collection of information about its sub-projects (which
    now include baseline information on the “pre-project” situation, as well as
    information on actual costs and benefits at sub-project closing) and its
    computerization (with development of the SIGES database of sub-projects on a web
    platform), the revised economic and financial analysis includes the following
    improvements compared to appraisal stage: (i) larger sample size;38 (ii) ex-post
    analysis (based on actual costs and benefits executed by each sub-project) rather
    than ex-ante analysis (which was based on estimated costs and benefits at time of
    sub-project approval); and (iii) analysis based on the incremental net benefits, i.e.
    increments over and above the net benefits that were already achieved before (or
    without) the project. As was the case already at appraisal stage, the analysis has been
    carried out for a 15-year period and the benefit flow patterns have been estimated
    based on experience and assumptions by the INCAGRO technical staff. No attempt
    has been made to adjust financial prices into economic values, given the diversity of
    sub-projects and corresponding products and the fact that the difference between
    economic and financial profitability would be small.

17. On the above bases, the revised economic IRR of the aggregated sample of sub-
    projects is estimated at 54%. This figure is higher than the PAD estimates, despite
    the fact that baseline benefits (before and without project) are taken into account.
    This may be due to higher profitability of the sub-projects financed by INCAGRO
    under Phase II, compared to the expectations under Phase I. However, this may also
    be due to other differences in basic assumptions, as these assumptions are not all
    clearly documented in the PAD analysis.




38
     Under INCAGRO II, a total of 381 sub-projects (334 agricultural extension and 47 adaptive research)
      have been funded from the FTA. However, only about 50% of these sub-projects were included in the
      SIGES database at the time of the ICR mission, since this new computerized platform was developed
      only since 2007 and INCAGRO was still in the process of reconstructing information retroactively.

18. No attempt was made in the PAD to estimate the IRR for the overall project for
    the reasons stated above in the first section (difficulties in quantifying the benefits
    from institutional and capacity building, and/or in anticipating returns from basic
    strategic research).

19. A cost-benefit analysis of investments made by INCAGRO since the beginning of
    the first phase was done with a different methodology by the team of researchers
    who carried out the study on the impact of INCAGRO in 2009. This analysis
    covers both Phase I (2001-2005) and Phase II (since 2006) of the project. It is based
    on information collected from a stratified sample of 44 sub-projects funded under
    the FTA in different regions of the country (including 33 sub-projects in extension
    and 11 in adaptive research). The sub-projects investment costs were collected from
    INCAGRO. Information on incremental revenues and operating costs, on the other
    hand, is based on producers‟ perception of the changes that took place and their
    attribution of part of these changes to the INCAGRO project. The analysis is carried
    out for a 15-year period. The resulting IRR is estimated at 23%, i.e. lower than
    previous estimates detailed above, though still quite favorable. The difference is due
    mainly to a more conservative estimate of benefits, which is based on producers‟
    perception of the specific contribution of INCAGRO to improvement in their
    incomes. Other chapters of the impact study note that the producers‟ own perception
    of the influence of INCAGRO is often lower than the perception of other
    stakeholders (including heads of producers associations, extension agents and
    researchers).

20. The sensitivity analysis carried out in the impact study also indicates that the IRR is
    quite robust to adverse changes in costs and/or benefits, i.e. the IRR would still be
    acceptable (11%) under the assumption of a 25% increase in costs jointly with a
    25% decrease in benefits. This sensitivity analysis is particularly interesting to

                                                                                                 41
    assess the viability of the project as a whole, i.e. including the cost of administration
    of the sub-projects by INCAGRO, which are estimated at 20% additional.

21. Other main benefits of the INCAGRO II Project, which are not specifically
    accounted for in the above estimates of IRR and NPV, mainly relate to institutional
    strengthening and capacity building, for which benefits are difficult to quantify.
    They include:
             Positive social impact: this has been achieved mainly through the
              empowerment of producers‟ organizations, as well as special measures
              (window for type III sub-projects) to facilitate access by disadvantaged
              groups including indigenous communities and women.
             Positive impact on capacity building: the project has contributed to
              increasing the interest and capacity of rural producers to adopt
              innovations, as well as improving the capacity of providers of agricultural
              innovation services (extensionists, researchers and research organizations).
             Demonstration effect: the INCAGRO II project has demonstrated the
              validity of the proposed model of intervention, characterized by
              competitive grant funds open to a variety of institutions and co-financed
              by users, and the possibility to upscale the successful experience gained
              under INCAGRO I and extend it gradually to the whole country. The
              INCAGRO model has also been replicated by other project or
              interventions in various sectors (FINCYT, FIDECOM, etc.).

 Annex 7. Summary of the Borrower’s Completion Report and Comments on the
                                Draft ICR

1. The Borrower provided the following comments on the draft ICR:

   a) The INCAGRO experience has been an important milestone for the
      development of innovation and scientific research in the Peruvian agricultural
      sector. INCAGRO has proven that a demand-driven approach can be
      implemented to execute innovation programs in the agricultural sector, when
      there are clear objectives and permanent counseling for the private sector
      involved. Lessons learned from this experience are relevant in a time when the
      Government of Peru is making important efforts in order to design a consistent
      strategy for agricultural innovation.

   b) The final outcome of the INCAGRO program is considered a successful one, as
      important effects have been found in terms of positive results for rural producers.
      INCAGRO is an experience to strengthen in the future, even though Phase III
      won't be executed as it was originally designed. In this matter, it has to be taken
      into account that when the INCAGRO program was designed, some assumptions
      were made on how the sector would adopt the demand driven innovation model,
      that didn't hold the following years. This situation doesn't invalidate the efforts
      made by the Program.

   c) Currently, the Government of Peru is committed in a process of formulating a
      Program to implement and strengthen the NAIS, with INIA as its governing
      body, in charge of promoting and coordinating the scope and execution of
      agricultural innovation throughout the country. This design won't imply a turning
      back to a model where INIA is the main executor of agricultural innovation, on
      the contrary, the demand driven approach will be the crucial center of the NAIS,
      where innovation is carried out by the private sector, while the public sector
      defines the national policies and strategies and executes research in strategic and
      nationally prioritized subjects.

2. Although the Borrower did not provide a Project Completion Report as such, it must
   be noted that the INCAGRO PMU and INIA published about a dozen of well-
   documented systematization reports on the Project, which are listed in Annex 10, and
   include: (i) main outputs of the Project, (ii) report on the most innovative research
   and extension sub-projects, (iii) impact evaluation study, (iv) evaluation of the
   adaptive research sub-project, (v) evaluation of the agricultural extension sub-
   projects, (vi) evaluation of the capacity strengthening of service providers, (vii) the
   experience of INCAGRO with women groups and indigenous peoples, and (viii) three
   evaluation reports of the contribution of INCAGRO to the value chains of special
   coffees, legumes, and alpaca wool, respectively.

Annex 9. Fostering inclusive rural innovation: the experience of INCAGRO with
women’s groups and indigenous peoples

1. Both women and Indigenous peoples face key barriers that limit their capacity to
   access and benefit from development projects. In a country like Peru where women
   and Indigenous peoples represent a large share of the rural poor, integrating proactive
   measures into project design is crucial to reach these populations. The Peru
   Agricultural Research and Extension Program (“INCAGRO”) gave great emphasis to
   designing financing instruments that would give equitable opportunities to Indigenous
   peoples and women‟s organizations. This Annex describes how INCAGRO integrated
   Indigenous peoples and women‟s organizations into its activities to strengthen the
   market for agricultural services.

2. Agriculture plays a dominant role in the Peruvian economy: about 80 percent of the
   rural poor are employed in agriculture and fishing. Over the past several years,
   government policies have led to an opening of the economy, thereby increasing
   pressure on the agricultural sector to be more competitive. The INCAGRO Project
   (2005-2010) aimed at contributing to the expansion, strengthening and institutional
   development of the rural innovation system to make it pluralistic, decentralized and
   demand driven. INCAGRO focused on two main issues: strengthening the market for
   agricultural services, and consolidating the national agricultural research system by
   co-financing collaborative research activities and capacity building.

INCAGRO’s Competitive Fund

3. INCAGRO established a Competitive Fund in order to strengthen both the
   agricultural services supplied as well as the articulation of the demand for these
   services. The Competitive Fund provided co-financing to research and extension sub-
   projects as well as to training workshops, pre-professional internships and local
   forums. It brought together small producers and service providers to ensure that
   services offered responded to producer demands. The Project benefits included
   agricultural services to provide training, advisory and networking services to farmers
   on production, commercialization, marketing, organizational and leadership issues.
   To make the Competitive Fund more accessible to the Indigenous peoples and women
   organizations, INCAGRO set up specific financing terms, eligibility criteria and
   selection processes.

Financing terms

4. The Competitive Fund adopted proactive measures to overcome common access
   barriers for Indigenous and women producers. Flexibility was introduced in the size
   of subprojects financed, where women and indigenous producers often presented sub-
   projects smaller than other producers. Sliding scales were allowed for co-financing
   percentage requirements – where women and indigenous projects were only required
   to co-finance a minimum of 15% of the total amount of the sub-project in contrast to
   25%- 35% for other producers. In addition, more intensive support was offered for

                                                                                       48
        project preparation in subprojects presented by women‟s organizations and/or
        indigenous producers (see below). And finally, if indigenous communities and/or
        women‟s organizations wished to apply to larger sub-projects with larger co-
        financing requirements, their proposals were allocated extra points during the
        selection process.

Eligibility criteria

5. The Project established eligibility criteria to target Indigenous peoples by ensuring
   that beneficiary producers who applied to the special funding scale were active
   members of peasant or native (respectively Andean or Amazonian indigenous)
   communities or of women‟s organizations. Eligible service providers could be
   individuals or institutions (public or private, national or international) that were
   actively engaged in providing capacity building and technical assistance services.
   Producers could then select their desired service producers who supported them in the
   formulation and execution of projects. Other public or private entities with an interest
   in contributing to the success of the sub-projects were also given the possibility of
   collaborating with time, funding or advice.

Selection process

6. To overcome economic, social and cultural barriers related to participating in a
   competitive selection process, a differentiated process was designed for indigenous
   communities and women‟s organizations. Simplified competition and negotiation
   processes included: local demands identification fora, capacity building workshops
   for putting together project concepts, personalized advice for proposal preparation
   and direct negotiation of financial terms with the selection committee. Unlike for the
   regular sub-projects, indigenous communities had the option to reformulate their
   project concepts and proposals as needed before the final deadline.

Impacts

7. These proactive measures led to the creation of 156 business plans from these groups,
   of which 116 agricultural extension projects came from indigenous producers and 40
   from women‟s organizations39. For the vast majority of participants this was their
   first time elaborating a business plan or in managing public sector grants and
   handling their related requirements.

8. For women and indigenous peoples to take advantage of new consumer demands for
   agricultural products they require access to organizational, technical and management
   skills in order to be able to compete with other producers40. Learning to create and
   manage a small project helped to build capacities amongst women‟s organizations
   ranging from crafts, commodities like coffee, milk and meat to medicinal plants and
   gastronomy.

9. Creating a culture for payment for agricultural services like training and technical
   advice is known to help make services more client-oriented and to better identify
   demand and manage quality control of services41. INCAGRO showed that poor rural
   communities are willing to pay for services. Indeed, 77% of the producers surveyed
   said they are likelier to pay for services since their participation in INCAGRO.
   Through INCAGRO, 37% of producers observed changes in the numbers of women
   hired in productive activities with a convergence between remuneration for men and
   women.

10. For both indigenous communities and women‟s organizations about 80% of the
    demand for innovation and agriculture services was geared towards training
    workshops on commercialization and organizational capacity issues. Beyond
    productive and commercial gains field interviews indicated that the increase of self-
    esteem gained through learning to manage a project was priceless. The confidence
    that this created among women‟s groups and indigenous communities is key to
    strengthening entrepreneurship. Most projects focused on how to develop capacity,
    gather existing knowledge and access it – not on technology development. A study on
    Indigenous peoples and women in INCAGRO (see below) showed that INCAGRO‟s
    support to livestock, agribusiness, and handicrafts proved to be a successful strategy.
    For instance, handicrafts in the regions of Huancavelica and Puno have offered an
    important alternative in the face of decreasing alpaca fiber prices and became the only
    activity sustaining family income.

11. However, training is not sufficient to foster sustainable changes. In order to be
    sustainable, women and indigenous entrepreneurs need to have access to
    comprehensive agricultural services packages that include training, technical
    assistance, monitoring and coaching. Nevertheless, very few agricultural services
    providers offer this complete range of services. In this sense, creating linkages and
    partnerships between different agricultural service providers through the form of
    business incubators would help increase the sustainability of rural entrepreneurship.

Lessons learned and challenges

 Elsa Laureano de La Cruz
  “We are 115 partners grouped in 9 committees in the districts of Satipo, Rio Negro
 and Rio Tambo. We have an executive committee organized by women in each
 committee. We produce coffee. Through the feminine coffee project co-financed by
 INCAGRO we received technical training achieving production from 10 to 15
 quintiles. We learned to manage our productive units‟ agronomy and administration.
 Our commercial production is important because there is great demand from the
 market of coffee produced by women. With INCAGRO‟s financing we were trained
 and learned how to manage a business, leadership and accounting. We feel like
 business women because we manage our own farms. The training workshops are
 attended by men and women because we all need to be trained.”

12. Three factors play a role in securing access to project resources and successfully
    managing them: ownership, self-esteem and cultural identity. Ownership of the
    project proposals contributed to the success of the projects. Indeed, applicants who
    formulated their proposals without involving women organizations were less
    successful than the ones who had. Indeed, sub-project implementation was easier in
    the cases where women had participated in the sub-project design. Self-esteem
    consists of valuing one‟s self image which generates self-confidence that is crucial to
    personal and professional growth. This is very relevant for rural and indigenous
    women, especially illiterate women who have expressed their lack of self-esteem was
    a considerable barrier for being able to compete in equal terms with men. INCAGRO
    integrated the gender approach in its training sessions which included the issue of
    self-esteem and leadership. Cultural identity is a prevalent reality in a multi-cultural
    country like Peru. The richness and variety of the regional customs and practices has
    strong potential for creating associative strength between producers, generating local
    development and overcoming poverty.

13. A study on Indigenous peoples and women in INCAGRO showed that the majority of
    Indigenous peoples and women organizations demands focused on improving
    capacity development, accessing knowledge and building collaborative environment
    (creating producer associations and partnerships with public or private entities). In
    addition, a survey showed that projects that targeted a greater population managed
    resources more efficiently and reduced transaction costs. For follow-up projects the
    challenge will be to overcome the mistrust that hinders most producers to organize on
    a larger scale. In this sense, mechanisms should be established to encourage larger-
    scale association of Indigenous groups and women organizations.

14. Defining indicators that can show whether women and indigenous peoples‟ needs
    were addressed by the project is important to measure the level of inclusion achieved
    by a project. To achieve this, project design should differentiate between target
    beneficiaries, i.e. women, Indigenous peoples, other beneficiaries, from early stages
    and thus allow for improved tracking of inclusion and benefits.
