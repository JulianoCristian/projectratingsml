The project has the following four\n            components: Component 1) will advance the development of a\n            decentralized market for professional services for\n            agricultural innovation. It will strengthen producer\n            organizations as beneficiaries of quality services, and\n            improve entrepreneurial capacity of private service\n            providers. Component 2) will strengthen agricultural\n            research and technological development for innovation in\n            strategic areas of national importance, and to strengthen\n            institutional and professional competence. Component 3) will\n            develop the institutional capacity of the public sector to\n            formulate and implement agricultural innovation policy in\n            conjunction with the private sector, and regulate the\n            quality of the National Agricultural Innovation System\n            (NAIS). Component 4) will finance the present Research and\n            Extension Project for Innovation and Competitiveness in\n            Peruvian Agriculture (INCAGRO)-Project Management Unit\n            (PMU), which would continue to be the implementing agency\n            for Phase II."}, "docdt": "2005-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
