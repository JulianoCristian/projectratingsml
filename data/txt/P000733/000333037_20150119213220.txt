Agriculture Research and Training Project                                                             June 11, 2004
                    The Agricultural Research and Training Project will make the Ethiopian agricultural research
                          system more efficient and sustainable by: i) building institutional capacity to manage the entire
                          agricultural research system; ii) rationalizing the way the programs are identified, designed, and
                          prioritized according to an acceptable economic criteria; iii) improving their relevance through
                          decentralization; iv) drawing on the relevant pool of knowledge available internationally; v)
                          consolidating and strengthening the existing research centers; vi) expanding research



facilities into less favorable agroecological settings; and vii) building human resource capacity in collaboration with the
Alemaya University of Agriculture (AUA). There are three components in this project. First, agricultural research management
will assist in operationalizing the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization (EARO); designing and implementing a
decentralized research system; implementing new systems and procedures for efficient agricultural research management;
and developing a strong program of research-extension-farmer linkages. Second, strengthening of the agricultural research
system will rehabilitate and expand the existing research system to make its operation more efficient and its work
environment more conducive to research work. Third, human resource development will provide technical assistance and
training for the researchers in the research system and those at the AUA.
