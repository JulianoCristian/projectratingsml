Mid Term Review (MTR) for\n            ARTP was undertaken in May and July of 2002. The MTR\n            confirmed that implementation has been satisfactory and\n            recommended several amendments to the Development Credit\n            Agreement D C A In response to the MTR, the DCA was amended\n            (in March, 2003) to reflect a reallocation among expenditure\n            categories and changes to certain disbursement percentages,\n            Special Account limits, and one dated covenant. The proposed\n            amendments here represent the remaining MTR recommendations.\n            The proposed The proposed amendments would be: to modify the\n            Project's Development Objective in order to focus more\n            directly on objectives of the investment activities under\n            the Project; to modify the Project description for clarity\n            in the activities carried out under the first and second\n            component of the Project; and to  amendments, though\n            substantive, would not fundamentally alter the purpose of\n            the Project and are intended to facilitate successful\n            implementation of the Project; and to  amend the expenditure\n            categories with respect to operating costs."}, "docdt": "2003-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
