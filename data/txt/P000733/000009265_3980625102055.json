identified,\n            designed, and prioritized according to an acceptable\n            economic criteria; iii) improving their relevance through\n            decentralization; iv) drawing on the relevant pool of\n            knowledge available internationally; v) consolidating and\n            strengthening the existing research centers; vi) expanding\n            research facilities into less favorable agroecological\n            settings; and vii) building human resource capacity in\n            collaboration with the Alemaya University of Agriculture\n            (AUA).  There are three components in this project.  First,\n            agricultural research management will assist in\n            operationalizing the Ethiopian Agricultural Research\n            Organization (EARO); designing and implementing a\n            decentralized research system; implementing new systems and\n            procedures for efficient agricultural research management;\n            and developing a strong program of research-extension-farmer\n            linkages.  Second, strengthening of the agricultural\n            research system will rehabilitate and expand the existing\n            research system to make its operation more efficient and its\n            work environment more conducive to research work.  Third,\n            human resource development will provide technical assistance\n            and training for the researchers in the research system and\n            those at the AUA."}, "docdt": "1998-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
