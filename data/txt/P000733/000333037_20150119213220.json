There are three components in this project. First,\n            agricultural research management will assist in\n            operationalizing the Ethiopian Agricultural Research\n            Organization (EARO); designing and implementing a\n            decentralized research system; implementing new systems and\n            procedures for efficient agricultural research management;\n            and developing a strong program of research-extension-farmer\n            linkages. Second, strengthening of the agricultural research\n            system will rehabilitate and expand the existing research\n            system to make its operation more efficient and its work\n            environment more conducive to research work. Third, human\n            resource development will provide technical assistance and\n            training for the researchers in the research system and\n            those at the AUA."}, "docdt": "2004-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
