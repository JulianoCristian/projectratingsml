outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: using\n            south-south collaboration in human resource development can\n            be very relevant, effective and efficient. The relationship\n            between the federal system and regional agricultural\n            research systems needs to be carefully worked out and\n            nurtured. Well-designed competitive grants can successfully\n            mobilize additional national capacity and resources.\n            However, such a mechanism should be prepared up-front to\n            avoid delays in implementation and be managed by an\n            independent entity limiting possible conflicts of interest.\n            A functional strategy can successfully strengthen research\n            extension farmer linkages in a demand-driven manner, but\n            there is a need to find modalities to make this happen on a\n            larger scale and sustainable in the long term. Project legal\n            agreements need to refer not only to the status at Project\n            appraisal but also to the continued existence of the\n            pre-conditions for successful implementation, even if\n            already put in place during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
