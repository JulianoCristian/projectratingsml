                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to assist the Government of Senegal in setting up an effective framework for participatory local development,
                         decentralization, resource mobilization and transfer to local governments and communities, to deliver services in rural areas and targeted poorest cities
                         efficiently. The project will assist the country#s comprehensive National Local Development Program by: (i) supporting the Government and its agencies in
                         developing and implementing appropriate policies, strategies and arrangements for efficient decentralization; (ii) updating and improving the regulatory and
                         fiscal framework necessary for efficient decentralization; (iii) strengthening capacity of local stakeholders (local governments, communities, regional
                         development agencies, NGOs and the private sector) for efficient participatory local development; and (iv) mainstreaming the transfer system for public funds
                         from the central government to local governments.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A six-month extension of the closing date of the project may be necessary as the official closing date of the project is in three months (August 31, 2011). The government has
                         submitted an extension of the project to February 29, 2012.
