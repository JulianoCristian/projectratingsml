                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to assist the Government of Senegal in setting up an effective framework for participatory local development, decentralization,
                         resource mobilization and transfer to local governments and communities, to deliver services in rural areas and targeted poorest cities efficiently. The project will assist
                         the country#s comprehensive National Local Development Program by: (i) supporting the Government and its agencies in developing and implementing appropriate
                         policies, strategies and arrangements for efficient decentralization; (ii) updating and improving the regulatory and fiscal framework necessary for efficient
                         decentralization; (iii) strengthening capacity of local stakeholders (local governments, communities, regional development agencies, NGOs and the private sector) for
                         efficient participatory local development; and (iv) mainstreaming the transfer system for public funds from the central government to local governments.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Based on the team assessment, this project is closing with a satisfactory rating. In the absence of a follow up project, the team urges the government counterparts particularly, at the
                         regional level (ARD) and communities to reinforce the conditions for sustainability of sub-projects at the local level (maintenance). It is hoped that national government will continue
                         the momentum of transferring financial resources to LGs in the framework of poverty redaction at the local level. A future operation in this sector may target increase of transfers from
                         national government to LGs to reach 15 % of national revenues as well as fiscal reforms in coherence with the transfer of functions in decentralization.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
