                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to assist the Government of Senegal in setting up an effective framework for participatory local development,
                         decentralization, resource mobilization and transfer to local governments and communities, to deliver services in rural areas and targeted poorest cities
                         efficiently. The project will assist the country#s comprehensive National Local Development Program by: (i) supporting the Government and its agencies in
                         developing and implementing appropriate policies, strategies and arrangements for efficient decentralization; (ii) updating and improving the regulatory and
                         fiscal framework necessary for efficient decentralization; (iii) strengthening capacity of local stakeholders (local governments, communities, regional
                         development agencies, NGOs and the private sector) for efficient participatory local development; and (iv) mainstreaming the transfer system for public funds
                         from the central government to local governments.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the implementation of the project is satisfactory. Four out of the five PDO indicators have been met. The Government has fully taken in charge the operating costs of the
                         Regional Development Agencies which serve as implementation units at the local level. The disbursement rate of the project to date is 96.65 percent. However, at the local level, the
                         disbursement rate for community sub-projects is still lagging behind the overall disbursement rate of the project due to low performance in the regions of Matam and Tambacounda.
