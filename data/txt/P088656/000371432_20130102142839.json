Local\n            Development Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. There were eight lessons\n            learned: 1) Local governments can develop capacity to plan\n            their local development and implement infrastructure for\n            basic social and economic services. 2) Combining policy\n            reforms and investment activities is always risky, as the\n            two follow different logics and time paths. 3) Institutional\n            instability is a fact of life and has to be factored into\n            project design, even while it is impossible to predict when\n            it will happen and how lengthy it will be. 4) Participatory\n            local development is highly people intensive and requires a\n            considerable amount of training of local actors in all\n            aspects of the project cycle to ensure that they play their\n            role effectively. 5) Effective relationships among\n            development partners and good donor collaboration and\n            harmonization are paramount to the successful implementation\n            of participatory local development projects. 6)\n            Micro-projects alone cannot develop a village or locality.\n            7) Communication is an essential element in the success of a\n            community development program. 8) In designing the results\n            framework care has to be exercised not to define project\n            development objectives or outcomes/impact as outputs."}, "docdt": "2012-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
