                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the implementation of the project is moderately satisfactory due to delays in sub-projects planning and implementation at the community level which is indicated by a
                         relatively low disbursement rate of 57 %.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         An extension of the closing date of the project may be necessary as the official closing date is scheduled for august 2011. But, anextension will be justified only under the condition
                         that disbursement is significantly improved from now till february 2011, particularly at the community level for sub-projects.
