proposed project is aimed at\n            enhancing Portugal's prospects for discovering\n            petroleum by improving PETROGAL's current exploration\n            strategy and strengthening its overall technical\n            capabilities in petroleum exploration; it would also assist\n            the country in evaluating its known heavy oil deposits. The\n            project includes: (a) two seismic surveys, totalling about\n            850 km and provision for some 3-D seismic work to better\n            resolve structural complexities, and reprocessing of seismic\n            data; (b) drilling three exploratory wells to an average\n            depth of about 2,500 to 3,000 meters; (c) technical\n            assistance to PETROGAL, consisting of a senior\n            explorationist, petroleum geophysicist, together with\n            drilling management services, to help implement its\n            exploration program; (d) laboratory services for analyzing\n            existing and new source rock data and reservoir\n            characteristics; (e) a screening study of existing data\n            concerning heavy oil development; and (f) a planning study\n            for PETROGAL. The combined seismic and well drilling program\n            has been designed to provide an important first step in\n            evaluating the petroleum potential of PETROGAL's\n            license areas."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
