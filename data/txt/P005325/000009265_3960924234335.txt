(LOAN 877-LE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
Thig is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Education
Project in Lebanon (Loan 877-LE), for which a loan of US$6.6 million was
extended to the Government of Lebanon in January, 1973. The Project was
substantially amended in July 1977. The Loan closing date was September 30,
1985. At the request of the Government, the Loan Account was kept open until
July 12, 1986, to permit disbursements for contracts signed prior to the
closing date. About US$5.0 million was disbursed and the undisbursed ba.lance
of about US$1.6 million was cancelled and the Loan Account closed with effect
from July 12, 1986, the date of last disbursement under the Loan.
The PCR is based on a review of the Bank files including appraisal,
supervision and progress reports and other available documents as a field
mission could not be scheduled due to the current security situation in
Lebanon.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
auditing, this project completion report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft PCR
was sent to the Borrower for comments in July 1986.  No comments have been
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LEBANON
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 877-LE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project was prepared by the Government with Unesco assistance
and appraised in. February 1972. A loan of US$6.6 million became effective on
May 24, 1974. Later developments in the country made a complete project
reformulation necessary. This amended project was approved by the Board in
July 1977 and the restructured loan became effective in September 1977.
Because of an adverse political development affecting an already tight
implementation plan, a series of Closing Date extensions became necessary.
Actual Closing Date was September 30, 1985. The loan account was closed on
July 12, 1986 after an amount of about US$5.0 million had been disbursed:
the undisbursed balance of US$1,586,347.91 was cancelled as of that date.
Objectives and Project Content
The project was orginally intended to be the first phase of the
Government's program to provide equal educational opportunities through
upgrading and nationalization of Lebanon's education system. Specifically,
it provided for the construction and equipping of 39 primary and 24 lower
secondary schools and of 3 primary teacher training institutes and of facili-
ties improvement and equipment for one lower secondary teacher training
institute. This physical investment was to be complemented by a technical
assistance component (para. 1.01).
Implementation Experience
After Board approval in December 1972, effectiveness was delayed
until May 1974 because of difficulties in assembling the PIU team. Subse-
quent initial project implementation, however, proceeded well, with construc-
tion bids for all schools received by mid-1975. By that time, however, the
worsening security situation made the realization of a building program dis-
persed throughout the country an unattainable goal. In late 1975, project
activities were suspended with no disbursements made (para. 1.02).
The 1975/76 hostilities had led to extensive damage to and looting
of, vocational and technical schools in the country's cities. Because of the
anticipated urgent demand for skilled manpower to cope with Lebanon's recon-
struction needs, the Government requested that the loan amount be used to
repair and re-equip three technical/vocational schools (located in Dekwaneh,
Tripoli and Zahle). The amended project was approved in July 1977 and the
loan became effective in September 1977 (para. 1.03). Complementary to this
physical investment was a UNDP-financed technical assistance project for,
inter alia program/curriculum development and instructor training (paras.
2.13, 3.04-3.06).



-v -
The recurring outbreaks of hostilities during implementation caused
repeated delays and interruptions, but the PIU persisted in its work with
admirable dedication (para. 3.12). The Bank, on the other hand, showed
understanding for the extraordinary difficulties the PIU was facing and
permitted a total of six Closing Date extensions (para. 1.04).
In viewing these extensions, it should be realized that the initial
implementation estimate of less than two years would have been optimistic
even unier more favorable circumstances. These remarks, however, should not
detract from the achievement of completing this project successfully.
Results
Civil works (reconstruction of the Tripoli school which had sus-
tained severe damages, and repairs to the other two schools) were completed
by early 1980. The workshops had special security features (strong steel
grilles for the windows and reinforced doors) to make a repetition of the
1975/76 looting more difficult (para. 3.07). The first batch of equipment
was purchased in 1982 and installed with the assistance of the experts pro-
vided under the UNDP project who then proceeded with staff training at the
three schools (para. 3.08).
Procurement of the second batch of remaining equipment items was
planned for 1982 but had to be postponed to 1984 due to a worsening of
security. However, the equipment was purchased, received and installed in
1985 by the UNDP-trained school staff. By mid-year, the project was
essentially completed (para. 3.09).
Sustainability
In a merely technical sense, the sustainability of the project does
not seem to present major problems, provided that adequate recurrent funds
are available. However, in this case, the volatile political situation
overshadows every other aspect of project sustainability.
Findings and Lessons
Because of the uniqueness of this project experience, there are no
findings that would have direct relevance for the implementation of projects
elsewhere.  It can only be hoped that the project and its staff will remain
intact to serve Lebanon once peace returns to the country, and provide a
basis for the reconstruction efforts in the education sector that will be
needed.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
LEBANON
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 877-LE)
Summary and Conclusions
Summary
1.       The First Education Project, approved in January 1973, was intended
to be the first phase of the Government's plan aimed at providing equal
education opportunities to all population groups through upgrading and
nationalization of the education system. The project included provisions to
build and equip 66 schools. Due to delays construction had not started by
late 1975 and proj'ct implementation was postponed due to the commencement of
hostilities. No disbursements were made from the Loan.
2.       In 1977, the Government requested that it be allowed to use the
entire loan amount (US$6.6 million) to replace equipment which had been looted
from three technical/vocational schools (at Dekwaneh, Tripoli and Zahle). The
Bank agreed to the Government's request and the First Education Project
(amended) became effective on September 13, 1977, with an estimated
implementation period of 15 months.
3.       The amended project immediately encountered delays.  The three
project schools had been damaged during the hostilities of the 1975/76 period
and when repairs commenced it was discovrered that the Tripoli school was
beeyond repair and had to be entirely rebuilt. Repairs and rebuilding were
completed by 1980.
4.       A teclnical assistance componeint, funded by UNDP, commenced in
October 1980, with an estimated duration of 24 months. Additional disruptions
due to hostilities resulted in the technical assistance component taking 34
months to complete. However, much was accomplished. New programs and
curriculum material (French and Arabic) were prepared for vocational and
technical education, as well as for instructor training. Equipment lists and
bidding documents were finalized. A computerized management system was
designed and installed irn the DGETP.
5.       International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for equipment commenced in
late 1980 but sv-ifered frequent disruptions and delays due to hostilities with
the result that the final contracts were not awarded until July 1984. The
final shipment of equipment was received in mid-1985. All equipment procured
under the project has been installed in the three project schools.
Conclusion
6.       The project was substantially completed in 1985 due largely to the
strength and tenacity of the DGETP staff, whose enthusiasm and commitment to
the project was maintained despite experiencing prolonged and extreme
difficulties in project implementation. It is important to note that the



- 2 -
education and training needs which the First and proposed Second Education
Project, and the proposed Second Reconstruction Project would have met still
remain. They are even more pronounced today than before the war.
7.       The DGETP has amply demonstrated its capability for implementation of
large-scale technical/vocational education projects when political stability
returns to Lebanon and Bank lending resumes.

FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 877-LE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The First Education Project, for which a Bank Loan of US$6.6 million
was approved in January 1973, was intended to be the first phase of the
Government's plan aimed at providing equal education opportunities to all
population groups through upgrading and nationalization of the public
education system in Lebanon. Specifically, the project, as appraised in
February 1972, included provisions for new construction, equipment and
furniture for 39 primary schools, 24 lower secondary schools and 3 primary
teacher training institutes as well as facilities improvement, equipment and
furniture for one lower secondary teacher training institute. A technical
assistance component was also included.
1.02     Due to delays in appointing staff to the project implementation unit,
the loan did not become effective until May 1974. Considerable progress was
made in the subsequent 15 months to August 1975, when construction bids had
been obtained for all primary and secondary schools and negotiations were
proceeding with the lowest bidder. However, construction did not start due to
the worsening war situation at that time. Project activities were suspended
in late 1975 and no disbursements were made.
1.03     During the l'75/76 phase of hostilities, vocational and technical
schools, particularly in large cities, were looted and damaged. As a result,
the Government of Lebanon requested that it be allowed to use the entire
US$6.6 million of the Loan to re-equip three technical/vocational schools (at
Dekwaneh, Tripoli and Zahle). This was to allow Lebanon to prepare skilled
manpower most urgently needed for reconstruction in the shortest possible
time. Negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. in May 1977. The
Government's request was approved by the Bank in July 1977 and the First
Education Project (anmended) became effective on September 12, 1977.
1.04     The continuing hostilities during the implementation period of the
amended project caused delays in procurement and delivery of project
equipment. As a result, the closing date of June 30, 1979 was extended six
times. The actual closing date was September 30, 1985.

II. THE PROJECT
The Socio-Economic Setting
2.01     The protracted warfare in Lebanon since 1975 has had a devastating
impact on economic and social development. It has left deep scars on the
population. Casualties have been very high. An unknown number of people left
the country, including skilled workers and technicians, and the number that
will return is currently unpredictable. There have also been massive internal
migrations, resulting in the withering of some economic centers and the
creation of a number of squatter settlements. The efficiency of public
institutions has beer, seriously impaired by the loss of talented personnel and
the disruption of activities over an extended period of time.
2.02     The physical damage wrought by host}lities has also been very
extensive. A number of cities, including Beirut, Sidon, Tyre and Tripoli, and
many towns and villages throughout the country have been seriously affected.
Destruction has been considerable in all sectors, but especially in housing,
education, health, industry and public services. The country's production
capacity was significantly reduced, and some of it totally destroyed.
2.03     No precise and reliable estimate of total damage to physical assets
sustained by Lebanon over the past ten years is available. A Bank
reconstruction assessment mission visited Lebanon in November 1982 to assess
data available on war damage and to advise the Government on formulation of a
reconstruction program. The mission prepared a Reconstruction Assessment
Report 1I which stated that the Government's estimate of a reconstruction
cost of about LL70 billion (in 1982 prices) was reasonable. The report, which
was discussed with the Government in February 1983, also described a
reconstruction program for the period 1983-85, which would have required a
minimum of LL26 billion (close to US$6.5 billion at 1982 rates). However, the
Government was unable to mobilize the required resources for the proposed
1983-85 reconstruction program and implement it because of renewed outbreaks
of hostilities.
Educational Issues and Development Strategy
2.04     Starting from a small base in the 1960's, the Lebanese education
system expanded rapidly during the decade before the civil war and was
quantitatively well developed when hostilities commenced in 1975. There was
almost universal primary education and the majority of the 11-17 age group
were enrolled in secondary education. The country relied heavily on private
schools, which accounted for some 62% of all enrollments, including that of
the universities. Many private schools were of good quality but tuition costs
were generally beyond the reach of the less affluent sections of the
community. The quality of the public schools was often less than desirable
due to frequent use of unsuitable rental premises and a large proportion of
unqualified teachers.

March 25, 1983.                                                  a



-5-
2.05     Only about 122 of secondary level students followed any form of
technical (including commercial) or vocational training programs and about 80%
of these were enrolled in technical programs of varying duration in private
institutions, of which less than half led to an official diploma. Examination
statistics do not distinguish between private and public candidates in passing
levels and little is known about the quality of private technical education
programs.
2.06     Higher education is characterized by a proliferation of institutions
cocering for some 79,000 students, of which about 44,000 were Lebanese in
1981/82. The public University of Lebanon (29,000 students, of which 27,000
were Lebanese) has a number of constituent colleges established under wartime
conditions with denominational affiliations, and pressures exist for further
proliferation and expansion. There is a high proportion of students over 22
years of age enrolled in the universities--about 65% in the Universitv of
Lebanon in 1979/80. This situation is a result of late age of entry, high
repetition rates, unemployment and interruptions in schooling since the
beginning of civil strife in 1975.
2.07     Education opportunities vary considerably between rural and urban
areas and among socio-economic groups. There was a growing realization by the
Dre-war Government that the public sector must assume a larger responsibility
for education and training. In order to begin the reform of the education
system the Ministry of Education (MOE) decided to focus in the 1970's on
reforming and rationalizing primary and secondary education and to
increasingly assume a larger share of education from the private sector at
these levels. As an initial step, the MOE adopted a program in 1973/74 to
ccnstruct a network of primary and lower secondary schools in accordance with
a 1972 "plan de regroupement." A first phase of 63 schools for the new school
network was originally included in the First Education Project (para. 1.01).
A second phase, of 120 schools, was included in a proposed Bank-assisted
Seccnd Education Project which was appraired in 1975. The Loan for the latter
project was not made because of the outbreak of hostilities.
2.08     A Second Reconstruction Project was identified by the Bank
Reconstruction Assessment mission which visited Lebanon in November 1982. The
project was appraised in February 1983 and included an education component
intended to provide for the repair, rehabilitation and re-equipping of 85
prinary and lower secondary schools and for the development and expansion of
the vocational training system to prepare skilled manpower for
reconstruction. New outbreaks in hostilities, however, prevented any further
processing of the proposed project.
2.09     The Government's development priorities for the education and
training sector, which will be re-addressed with the return of political
stability, include:
(a) establishment of a project planning and coordinating unit in MOE;
(b)  reparation and rehabilitation of primary and secondary schools;
(c)  rehabilitation and expansion of the technical/vocational
training system to meet critical skilled manpower needs for
reconstruction;



- 6 -
(d) implementation of the 1972 "plan de regroupement" based on a new
school mapping study;
(e)  in-service teacher training programs;
(f)  institution building for MOE, and
(g)  reform of the higher education system.
Formulation of the Project
2.10     The project was identified by a UNESCO mission which visited Lebanon
in May 1971 to identify education projects suitable for Bank financing. The
recommendations of the UNESCO mission were reviewed with the Government by a
Bank education mission in September 1971 and agreement was reached on the
project items that would be submitted by the Government for Bank financing.
The project was appraised in February 1972 and included provisions for the
establishment of 63 new primary and lower secondary schools, and three primary
teacher training institutes, and upgrading of one existing lower secondary
teacher training institute (para. 1.01).
2.11     Delays were experienced during the start-up phase of the project with
the result that, at the outbreak of hostilities in 1975, no disbursements had
been made and project activities were suspended (para. 1.02). During the
1975/76 period of hostilities the MOE's techriical/vocational schools at
Dekwaneh, Tripoli and Zahle were looted and consequently, the Government
requested that 1973 Loan Agreement be amended to apply the proceeds of the
Loan to re-equip the three schools. The Government's request fag approved by
the Bank in July 1977 and became effective on September 12, 1977.
2.12     Preliminary equipment lists for the Dekwaneh, Tripoli and Zahle
schools were prepared by the MOE's Direction G6n4rale de l'Enseignement
Technique et Professionnel (DGETP) in 1978 with assistance from UNESCO/ILO.
2.13     In early 1980, the Government reached agreement with UNDP on a
technical assistance project "Relaunching and Development of Technical
Education and Vocational Training" (LEB/77/002). The long term objective of
the project was to strengthen the DGETP and to assist it in the implementation
of its six-year (1975-81) development plan. The project's immediate
objectives included:
(a)  assisting DGETP to resume operations following the disruptipns
and damage suffered during earlier hostilities;
(b)  installation and commissioning of equipment procured under World
Bank Loan 877-LE (Education I) and related staff training;
(c)  upgrading of vocational training programs including related
instructor training;
(d)  coordination of public and private sector trsining programs;
(e)  upgrading of curricula in line with the new equipment procured
under World Bank Loan 877-LE;



(f) coordination of institutional arrangements between MOE and the
Ministry of Labor for vocational training programs; and
(g) establishment of a management information system for the DGETP.
The UNDP project document was signed in February 1980 and the project was
implemented by UNESCO, in association with the ILO, during the period October
1980 to July 1983. The UNDP contribution amounted to US$1,611,844.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     The estimated implementation period of 15 months for the project
forseen when the project was substaptially amended in mid-1977 proved to be
unrealistic, particularly in view of the fact that the technical school at
Tripoli could not be repaired and had to be entirely rebuilt. Furthermore,
the technical assistance component estimated at 24-month duration did not
commence until October 1980, and due to disruptions resulting from
hostilities, actually took 34 months to complete. In addition, the project
experienced delays directly resulting from hostitities as well as bureaucratic
delays arising indirectly from hostilities. Therefore, the actual period of
project implementation was about 84 months rather than the 15 months
originally estimated.
Educational Aspects
3.02     The amended project supported an important initiative by the
Government to commence the modernization and restructuring of the technical
education and vocational training system. The programs and methodologies of
the DGETP dated back to the early 1960's, had limited practical training
content and were badly in need of modernization.
3.03     When it became obvious, after the events of 1975/76, that a major
effort would be required to replace looted equipment in the
technical/vocational institutes, the MOE decided that the timing was
appropriate to initiate major reforms being contemplated for the system.
Consequently, the Government arranged for a UNDP-funded technical assistance
project which included provisions for upgrading programs and curricula,
including instructor training programs, to complement the new equipment to be
received under the Bank-funded project 877-LE (para. 2.13). The UNDP project
was to be the first phase of technical assistance for the reform and
modernization of the technical/vocational training system. A second phase of
technical assistance was included in the Bank's proposed Second Reconstruction
Project which was not implemented due to hostilities (para. 2.08).
3.04     The UNDP-funded technical assistance project accomplished the
following in the area of curriculum development:
(a) For the new accelerated vocational training program (formatiors
professionnelle acceleree - FPA) - 1 to 2 years duration:
modular instructional materials packages were prepared for
twelve trades - electrical installation, industrial electricity,
welding, farmwork, reinforced iron work, painting, structural
metal work, auto body repair, carpentry, central heating,
plumbing, and tiling.
(b)  For the new Baccalaureat Technique (BT) program - a k.,ree-years
post preparatory program: modular instructional mater.als
packages were prepared for seventeen specializations - machine
shop, printing, building construction, civil works, commerce,
hotel management, hotel operations, electricity, e:lectronics,
automotive, telecommunications, industrial chemistry, air
conditioning, computer science, structural metal work and
foundry.



(c) For the new Technicien Superieur diploma (TS) - a two-year post-
secondary program: modular instructional materials packages were
prepared (in French and Arabic) for two specializations:
electronics and business management.
Each of the above packages were prepared in French and Arabic
editions and include well illustrated, written instructional materials in
modular format for trainees, and instructor's guide with performance tests,
and lists of required equipment and consuiable materials for course
implementation.
3.05     In addition to the above, the tecb'ical assistance project prepared:
(a) training materials to train vocational and technical instructors
in the new training principles and methodologies (i.e. the
implementation of a performance-based, modularized curriculum);
(b) orientation materials to orient school principals and staff to
the new training system;
(c) a plan for the introduction of the new technical/vocational
training system in all public technical and vocational schools
together with a plan for system evaluation; and
(d) a plan for the reorganization and expansion of the DGETP which
will be implemented when conditions permit.
3M06     The technical assistance project also assisted the DGETl  in
establishing a computerized management information system and a computer
center. A computer, procured through ICB in December 1980, was installe! at
DGETP in January 1981. In mid-1984, the computer system was expanided from six
to fourteen terminals. The computerized system is used for processing of
staff and student data including examinations, management of equipment and
consumable supplies, knd will be used in the future for conducting follow-up
studies of DGETP graduates. The computer center provides courses in computer
programming and data processing for students in the BT and TS programs. The
system has greatly enhanced the operational efficiency of the Directorate.
Processing of annual examination data for DGETP students, which formerly took
DGETP administration staff three weeks to complete, is now completed in three
days. The technical assistance project was substantially completed in July
1983.
Physicial Aspects and Procurement
3.07     During the 1975/76 phase of hostilities, the school buildings at
Dekwaneh and Zahle were damaged and looted. The Tripoli technical school was
destroyed. During the period 1977-80, the buildings at Dekwaneh and Zahle
were repaired and the technical school at Tripoli was entirely rebuilt. The
workshops in repaired and rebuilt buildings had special protection added to
prevent looting: all possible access to the workshops, such as windows, were
equipped with strong iron grids and all doors were protected with heavy,
plate-iron internal coverings. All three schools were ready to receive
equipment by early 1980.
?A



- 10 -
3.08     Preliminary equipment lists and bidding documents were approved by
the Bank in early 1980. Detailed technical specifications were added to the
preliminary lists with the assistance of the ILO and UNESCO experts under the
UNDP-funded technical assistance project (para. 2.13) and the first
international competitive bidding (ICB) for four packages of equipment for the
Dekwaneh, Tripoli and Zahle schools was conducted in late 1980. By September
1981 contracts amounting to about US$2.8 million had been awarded for all four
packages representing about 40% of the equipment to be procured under the Bank
Loan. This equipment was received by mid-1982 and installed in the three
schools under the supervision of the ILO/UNESCO experts. At this time, the
ILO/UNESCO experts conducted training programs for technical staff at all
three schools in workshop and laboratory layout, and in installation and
commissioning of equipment so that local staff would have the experience and
expertise required for the installation and commissioning of the remainder of
the equipment to be procured under the Bank loan.
3.09     The second ICB for the remaining equipment was scheduled for May 1982
but was aborted due to severe hostilities at that time and was eventually
conducted in early 1983. Award of contracts was again delayed by hostilities
and the final contracts were not awarded until July 1984, by which time some
of the bidders had exercised their rights to withdraw bids due to expiration
of the bid validity period. By the end of July 1984, contracts amounting to
about US$1.2 million had been awarded under the second ICB. This equipment
was all received by mid-1985 and installed in project schools by DGETP
technical staff who were trained by the ILO/UNESCO experts (para. 3.08).
3.10     In addition to the Government, Bank and UNDP inputs described above,
bilateral donors contributed significantly to the overall project objectives.
During the period 1978-1982, the Government of France provided 360 months of
expert services and 48 months of fellowships, as well as equipment, (total
estimate: US$3.0 million) for the DGETP's Institut Pedagogique National de
l'Ensignement Technique (IPNET). During the same period USAID provided
equipment and staff training for IPNET estimated at US$1.5 million. The
Federal Republic of Germany provided support estimated at US$1.5 million for
the establishment of a technician training institute for marine sciences at
Batroun and the Government of Great Britain provided equipment and technical
assistance, estimated at US$1.0 million, for the technician program in
aviation mechanics at the Dekwaneh school. The total amount of bilateral
assistance provided is estimated at US$7.0 million.
Bank and Borrower Performance
3.11     The Bank fielded supervision missions whenever it was possible to do
so. Technical advice provided the by supervision and appraisal missions to
the DGFTP enhanced its capacity for project formulation and implementation.
The last supervision mission was in July 1983. During periods when Bank
supervision missions could not be fielded for security reasons, Bank staff
monitored project progress through telephone and telex communications with the
DGETP.  It was not possible to field a Bank completion mission due to the
current security situation in the country.
3.12     Given that this was the first experience with a Bank-assisted
education project, and that the project was implemented during a most adverse
period in Lebanese history, the performance of the MOE'S DGETP staff was
exceptional. The project was completed due largely to the strength and



- 11. -
tenacity of the DGETP staff, whose enthusiasm and commitment to the project
never lagged despite frequent disruptions as well as prolong,d and extreme
difficulties during project implementation. The director of the DGETP was
killed during hostilities in September 1982, and the project was subsequently
completed by his deputy and staff. Successive Bank missions through July 1983
commented favorably on the competence and enthusiasm of the DGETP staff.
Project Costs and Disbursements
3.13     Accurate data on total project costs is not currently available.  No
appraisal report was prepared for the amended project and the agreement of
July 12, 1977 amending the original loan agreement of January 24, 1973, does
not incude detailed cost estimates. However, a Bank mission in early 1977
estimated the essential equipment needs for the three project schools at
approximately US$6.6 million and the cost of repairing the three schools was
estimated at US$1.5 million. The Government agreet. to carry out the necessa.:y
repairs to the three schools (para. 3.07) and to arrange a technical
assistance project with Unesco (para. 2.13). Total project costs have been
estimated as follows:
Item                                   US$ million
Civil Works (para. 3.07)                          2.5
Equipment                                         6.1
Technical Assistance (UNDP)                       1.6
Bilateral Assistance (para, 3.10)                 7.0
Total:                              17.2
3.14     Estimated and actual disbursements are shown under Key Project Data
(p.iv,D). Disbursements lagged considerably behind original estimates because
of frequent disruptions and delays in project implementation and also because
of suspension of administrative activities during periods of armed conflicts.
No disbursements were made during the first four years. Payment to suppliers
was made from local funds and applications for reimbursement were then
prepared and forwarded to the Bank. Local processing of the applications for
disbursement was considerably delayed due to complicated bureaucratic
procedures compounded by hostilities. At the request of the Government, the
Loan Account was kept open until July 12, 1986, to permit disbursements for
contracts signed prior to the closing date. About US$5.0 million was
disbursed and the undisbursed balance of about US$1.6 million was cancelled
and the Loan Account closed with effect from July 12, 1986, the date of last
disbursement under the Loan.
Covenants
3.15     Seven of the eight covenants (Annex) are considered to have been
met. However, the covenant requiring the Borrower to ensure that about
two-thirds of the capacity of the technical/vocational schools at Dekwaneh,
Tripoli and Zahle be utilized for vocational training programs has not been
fully met. It is estimated that current enrollment is about 152 in vocational
and about 85% in technical education programs. This matter was discussed in
detail with the DGETP authorities during the November 1982 project supervision
mission. The DGETP authorities explained to the mission that there was a



- 12 -
strong demand for places in the tecianical education program (for example,
during the 1982/83 school year there were 30,000 applicants for the 9,000
available places) and technical students were employed immediately after
graduation from the program. The solution proposed by the DGETP was to
establish new vocational training centers in the major cities in order to
expand enrollment. Therefore, two new vocational training centers (at
Dekwaneh and Bir Hassan) were included in the proposed Second Reconstruction
Project which was appraised by a Bank multi-sectoral mission in February
1983. However, this proposed project did not materialize (para. 2.08).

Iv. CONCLUSIONS
4.01     The First Education Project, for which the Bank Loan of US$6.6
million was approved in January 1973, was intended to be the first phase of a
Government program aimed at providing equal education opportunities to all
population groups through upgrading and nationalization of the education
system in Lebanon. At the request of the Government, the Bank agreed in 1977
to the utilization of the entire loan amount for the replacement of looted
equipment in three technical vocational schools, so that skilled manpower
required for reconstruction could be quickly prepared. The re-equipping of
the three schools has been successfully completed and, in addition, new
technical/vocational programs and curricula have been prepared which will be
implemented in all public technical/vocational schools in Lebanon. However,
the Government's plan for the provision of equal education opportunities to
all population groups has not been addressed and this need has intensified as
a result of events in Lebanon during the past decade.
4.02     The DGETP has amply demonstrated its capability for implementation of
large scale technical/vocational education projects-a capability which will
be badly needed-when political stability returns to Lebanon and Bank lending
to the country resumes.
