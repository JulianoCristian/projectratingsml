Control Project\n            for Algeria initial broad objective was to assist the\n            Government of Algeria (GOA) in reducing pollution, which was\n            causing health problems and serious ecological degradation.\n            Although the project was revised three times, the original\n            objectives were not modified. The project ratings are as\n            follows: project outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is\n            likely; institutional development impact is substantial;\n            Bank performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            is satisfactory. The report cites the following as lessons\n            learned: a) quality of project preparation led the client to\n            continue the project using its own resources thus ensuring\n            the sustainability of the action started under the project;\n            b) several institutional and administrative changes\n            undermined responsibility and accountability for project\n            implementation; c) project implementation has resulted in\n            shaping industry responses to environmental policy\n            incentives and stronger enforcement; d) the Environmental\n            Pollution Abatement Fund (FEDEP)  requires further\n            improvements in terms of its governance, financial capacity,\n            financing mechanism and environmental cleanup strategy. It\n            is hoped these lessons will be learned by both the Bank and\n            its Borrowers."}, "docdt": "2005-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
