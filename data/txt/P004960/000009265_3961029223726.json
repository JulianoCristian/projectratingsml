Its\n            specific objectives are to: 1) strengthen the institutional\n            and legal framework; and 2) initiate an investment program\n            in the industrial sector of Annaba for mitigating the\n            adverse environmental and health effects of pollution. The\n            project will consist of two main components: 1)\n            strengthening of the institutional and legal framework,\n            including: (a) institution building; (b) enhancement of the\n            legal and regulatory framework; (c) design and\n            implementation of a system for monitoring and enforcement;\n            and (d) activating of the National Environmental Fund; and\n            2) pilot investments comprising: (a) Entreprise Nationale\n            des Engrais et Produits Phytosanitaires-Annaba; and (b)\n            Entreprise Nationale de Siderurgie-Annaba."}, "docdt": "1996-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
