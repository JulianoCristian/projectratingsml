accelerated economic growth and rapid human resource\n            development. Accordingly, it will assist the Government to\n            achieve a number of key objectives. First, it will support\n            further deregulation of the economy involving the removal of\n            the ramaining barriers to trade and investment in the coffee\n            subsector and liberalization of the cotton industry. Second,\n            the credit will support actions aimed at completing the\n            divestiture of the Custodian Board properties. Third, it\n            will assist the Government to step up domestic revenue\n            generation which is still only around 8 percent of GDP.\n            Fourth, the credit will help to deepen the Government's\n            efforts aimed at prioritizing both recurrent expenditure and\n            development expenditure. Fifth, it will support further\n            measures directed at downsizing the civil service and\n            raising its efficiency."}, "docdt": "1994-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
