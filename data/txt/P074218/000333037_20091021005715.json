risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation was strengthened when there was clear\n            leadership, participation and empowerment by the Ministry of\n            Economy and Finance (MEF) authorities and the main users of\n            the financial management processes were present. Empowering\n            authorities and users to define the reforms they needed was\n            a key aspect of successful implementation. A key lesson is\n            that reform ownership by the Government creates a solid\n            basis for project success, even over the medium-term. The\n            preparation of solid analytical work by the Bank provided\n            important elements to encourage the Government to take\n            decisions on the implementation of the new systems and the\n            reform of Project Financial Management (PFM) practices, such\n            as the introduction of the single treasury account. Ongoing\n            technical support from the Bank, particularly in the phase\n            when the new Financial Management Integrated System\n            (e-SIGEF) system was launched (January 2008), provided\n            Government an opportunity to see the Bank's commitment\n            to make the project successful. This lesson is particularly\n            important considering that this was the time when the\n            Government was evaluating and reviewing the role of the Bank\n            in the country and when other projects were canceled.\n            Leveraging cross-regional best practices was a key success\n            factor and the Bank played a key role in bringing together\n            regional government authorities and technical experts as a\n            means to maintain reform momentum."}, "docdt": "2009-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
