"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The development objective of the Public\n            Sector Financial Management Project for Ecuador is to\n            improve effectiveness and transparency in financial\n            management in the general government sector; and to\n            contribute to better governance through greater transparency\n            attained by the independent verification of the integrity of\n            government financial reporting. There are six project\n            components. The first finances the completion of the\n            programming, testing, and implementation of the Integrated\n            System of Management and Financial Information (SIGEF\n            GLOBAL); completion of implementation support in Central\n            Ministries for all modules and the provincial offices of the\n            line ministries. The second component expands coverage of\n            SIGEF throughout the public sector, including public\n            universities and municipalities. The third component\n            upgrades SIGEF's technological base by establishing a\n            public data network and converting selected SIGEF services\n            to web-based technology. Component 4 builds external\n            financial audit capacity. Component 5 ensures organizational\n            and functional support for the Integrated Financial\n            Management System (IFMS) approach, which comprises\n            macroeconomic forecasting and management, budget\n            preparation, and tax administration. The sixth component\n            supports project management, monitoring, supervision, and\n            impact evaluation at the different levels of the system."}, "docdt": "2002-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
