MARSYANGDI HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
Credit and Proiect Summary
Borrower:            Kingdom of Nepal
Beneficiary:         Nepal Electricity Corporation
Amount:              SDR 100.6 million (US$107.0 million equivalent)
Terms:               Standard
Terms to
Beneficiary:         30 years with interest at 12 percent per annum
Project              The project seeks to meet the forecasted demand for
Description:         electricity in Nepal for the medium term and to
strengthen the Borrower's power sector. This would be
a run-of-river hydroelectric power project, with an
installed capacity of 69 MW, located on the Marsyangdi
River. Major project components include diversion
works and diversion weir, headrace and tailrace tunnels,
powerhouse, transmission lines, substations and
equipment. The project also provides for consulting
engineers, technical assistance and training. A
primary benefit would be derived from the generation
of additional electricity for industrial, commercial and
domestic consumption, and for irrigation purposes.
Benefit would also be received through improvement of
the distribution system, enhancement of maintenance
capacity and the training of manpower. Some risk
relates to possible deficient project design and
construction, poor management and cost overruns.
Appointment of a panel of experts to review design and
construction, adequate provision for supervision in
close cooperation with the consulting engineer, and
assignment of a claims advisor should help minimize
these risks.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 100.6 MILLION
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A MARSYANGDI HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECT
1.      1 submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Kingdom of Nepal in an amount of SDR 100.6 million (US$107.0 milLion
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Marsyangdi Hydroelectric
Power Project. The part of the credit proceeds used for financing the
Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Power Plant would be relent to the Nepal Electricity
Corporation for 30 years with interest at 12 percent per annum. Cofinaiacing
arrangements have been made with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (Kuwait Fund) for 6.0 million Kuwaiti dinars (US$21.0 million
equivalent) repayable over 25 years, including 5 years grace, at 2.5 percent
interest and 0.5 percent administrative charge per annum; the Saudi Fund for
Development (Saudi -ind) for 86.0 million Saudi riyals (US$25.0 million
equivalent) repayable over 25 years, including 5 years grace, at 2 percent
interest per annum; and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the
Federal Republic of Germany for Deutsche Mark 186.3 million (US$74.5 million
equivalent) all on a grant basis.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      The most recent economic report, Nepal:  Recent Developments aDd
Selected Issues in Trade Promotion (Report No. 4663-NEP), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on October 19, 1983. The principal features and
recent performance of the economy are described below. Country data are
shown in Annex I.
3.      Nepal is one of the least-developed countries in the world.  Per
capita income is estimated at US$170 (1982) and health and education
standards are below the average for South Asia:  life expectancy at birth is
only about 45 years; infant mortality, about 148 per thousand; and adult
literacy, only 19 percent. The population, estimated to be 15.4 million
(1982), grew at a rate of albout 2.6 percent per year between 1971 and 1981.
About 95 percent of the population live in rural areas.
4.      Population density with respect to arable land (356 per sq km) has
reached very high levels, and cultivation has been extended onto marginal
lands and forests. Forests have been denuded further to meet the growing
demand for fuelwood, on which Nepal depends for over 90 percent of its energy
consumption, mostly for household cooking and heating. Because of deforesta-
tion and excessive grazing on the hills and mountains, with high rainfall,
1/ Substantially unchanged from Karnali Preparation Project - Phase I
(Report No. P-3737-NEP), of March 1, 1984.



--2-
there is accelerated soil erosion leading to silting of rivers, downstream
flooding; and loss of agricultural productivity all along.
D Agriculture, largely rainfed, still accounts for nearly 60 percent
of Nepal's GDP and 80 percent of merchandise exports, and provides the main
source O:L livelihood to over 90 percent of the population. Crop production
accounts for about 60 percent of agricultural output, livestock for 30
pereent, and forestry for 10 percent. Paddy is t:he principal food crop
Oplante6 on about half of the total cropped area), followed by maize, wheat,
millet and barley. Cash crops (oilseeds, jute, sugarcane and tobacco) are
grownn on about 10 percent of the cropped area. About 15 percent of total
rural incomes rise from non-agricultural activities, of which cottage
industries are one of the more important andL engage over one million people
on a part-time basis.
6l.     Apart from agricultural land, Nepal's only other important
exploitable resources are hydropower and tourist attractions.  The exploita-
tion of the vast hydropower resources beyond that required to satisfy the
country's own power demand, however, will depend crucially on Nepal's ability
to enter complex financial, exploitation and export agreements with neighbor-
ing cou ntries. The tourism sector, based primarily on Nepal's mountain
envirowment and its rich cultural heritage, has been dynamic, though it
accounts for only about 1 percent of GDP. Tourismn now provides about 20
pezcent of the country's foreign exchange earnings. About 60 percent of
earningE from tourism are retained in Nepal.
Following centuries of self-imLposed isolation, efforts to develop the
economy of Nepal began in the mid-1950s against extremely heavy odds.  The
country had virtually no physical infrastructure, an ancient administrative
system, and very limited educational and health services. The resource base
is relatively narrow and its development hindered by the difficult topography
and landlocked position. Against this background, Nepal's primary develop-
ment objective for 20 years, between 1955 and 1975, was to build basic
infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future economic growth. The
country hdas made good progress in pursuit of that objective. It now has a
basic road network linking many economic centers.  Kathmandu and a few other
towns have basic utilities and public transport.  Schools have been built for
almost half of the primary school age children and there are a number of high
schools and a national university. A rudimentary hospital system, including
rural health posts, has been built.  Some progress has also been made in
establizhinng the institutional framework for agricultural and industrial
development, including extension and research activities, financial institu-
Lions and industrial enterprises. Yet in all these areas, the country has a
long way to go to achieve a level of development comparable to other develop-
ing countries; for example, public and private institutions in Nepal must
continue to expand and upgrade essential physical facilities, acquire the
necessary expertise in handling economic and financial affairs, build up
adequate technical and managerial cadres, and establish merit-based systems
of parsonrnel management.



-3-
8.      The Fifth Plan (1975/76-:L979/80) marked a shift in development
objectives, with increased emphasis being placed on acceleration of economic
growth, employment creation, and raising the living standards of the
population. These objectives have been reiterated in the Sixth Plan
(1980/81-1984/85). Moreover, the stated strategy of the Sixth Plan
appropriately (a) accords high priority to developing agriculture, small-
scale industries and Nepal's abundant water resources; (b) stresses soil
conservation and population control; and (c) emphasizes full utilization of
existing infrastructure and alleviation of absorptive capacity constra:ints,
including human resource development. The development strategy also calls
for increased involvement of the private sector in agriculture,
manufacturing, trade, tourism, construction and transport operations.
Investment expenditures, supported by growing foreign assistance, have
increased rapidly over the last two Plans, from US$146 million (9 percent of
GDP) in 1974/75 to about US$390 imillion (15 percent of GDP' in 1981/82, and
there have been substantial shifts in the composition of spending away from
transport to agriculture, power and social services. GDP growth, however,
has barely kept up with that of population.
9.      Part of the explanation for this stagnation lies in factors beyond
Nepal's control such as the difficult topography and the poor resource base.
But factors within Nepal's control have also contributed. Severe project
implementation problems have been encountered by Government and donors alike
in most sectors of the economy, thereby lowering the rate of growth of
capital formation. In addition, the expected returns on investments which
took place often did not materialize largely because necessary complementary
investments or current spending were lacking, and because of managerial
deficiencies. A good example is the agriculture sector. In the past, insuf-
ficient attention was paid to bringing water down to the farm level and this
was compounded by inadequate support services such as extension and research,
by the lack of timely supplies of improved seed, fertilizer and other inputs
such as credit, by the lack of farm-to-market roads, and by low producer
margins. Future development of irrigation and agriculture would therefore
need to emphasize complemenLtary investments, improvements in agricultural
input supplies and adequate producer margins.
10.     The shortage of funds for current spending needs to be addressed by
further efforts at domestic resource mobilization. In recent years, Nepal's
efforts to mobilize resources have focused on tightening income tax assess-
ment and collection; on discretionary measures largely in the area of
indirect taxes; and on reducing subsidies to public enterprises. While there
has been, as a result, a steady increase in revenues, the tax structure
remains inelastic. Some scope exists for increasing Nepal's tax elast:icity
by shifting items on the indirect tax schedules from a specific to an ad
valorem basis. There also seems to be scope for increasing yields from the
land tax, urban property taxes and income taxes.



-4-
11.     Over the past two years, several positive steps have been taken to
strengthen public sector management.  These steps have included increases in
the traditionally low civil service salaries, establishment of public service
training facilities, simplification of budgetary procedures accompanied by
stricter enforcement of expenditure accounting, and granting of more autonomy
to public enterprises in matters concerning personnel and pricing policies.
The implementation of these administrative reforms would have to be pursued
by high-level monitoring of important administrative issues such as appoint-
ment of competent staff, job security and decision-making authority.  Also,
public enterprise reform needs to be pursued by measures aimed at reducing
costs and increasing efficiency.  In this regard, the Government has taken
initial steps, subjecting public ernterprises to increased competition from
the private sector through liberalization of licensing in industry, transport
and small-scale hydropower generation.  At the same time, in September 1983,
the Government announced its intention to involve the private sector in the
ownership and control of public enterprises through the sale of some public
enterprise shares to private investors.
12.     Because of slow economic growth, Nepal's balance of payments has been
characterized by widening trade deficits, partly offset by surpluses from
invisibles. The current account deficit (averaging US$100 million annually
during 1979/80-1981/82) has traditionaally been more than matched by inflows
of official grants and concessional Loans (averaging US$128 million annually
during 1979/80-1981/82), leading to surpluses in the overall balance of
payments in most years.  Nevertheless, fore ign exchange reserves have
declined from being equivalent to about one year of imports in the early
1970s to six months in 1982, and four months in mid-1983.
13.     To sustain and further develop its economy, Nepal must mobilize
additional free foreign exchange through export promotion and efficient
import substitution. Improving agricultural production, rural incomes and
food distribution within the country is a major way of doing so, if only to
avoid the need to import and distribute large quantities of foodgrains in the
future. Agricultural development also remains the key to a gradual expansion
of Nepal's traditional merchandise exports. In addition, development of
energy resources is a major means to strengthening the balance of payments by
reducing the need to import fuel and opening up an export potential.
Recently, Nepal has legislated a wide range of fiscal and administrative
incentives for industrial investors aLnd exporters, particularly in the
private sector. The implementation of these incentives, and the alleviation
of the severe transport and transit constraints facing the country's trade
sector, must constitute essential elements of a trade promotion strategy for
Nepal.
14.     Nepal is faced with highly challenging prospects and tasks in
addressing its multiple long-term development problems. While it attempts
to mobilize domestic resources to finLance about 40-50 percent of development
expenditures, external assistance, at concessional terms, will continue to be
a vital factor in financing investment and effecting economic growth. In the



-5-
last three years, aid commitments to Nepal have averaged about US$250 million
per year, almost entirely in the form of grants and concessional credits with
grant elements in excess of 70 percent. Aid disbursements have grown from
about US$110 million in 1979/80 to an estimated US$175 million in 1982t83.
Nearly 70 percent of total aid disbursements have come from members of the
Nepal Aid Group, formed in 1976 and now comprising eight DAC countries and
four multilateral agencies.
15.     As of December 31, 1982, Nepal's official foreign debt outstanding
was US$297 million, of which US$251 million was due to multilateral agesncies.
As virtually all loans have been concessional, debt-service payments, includ-
ing payments to the IMF, have remained small in relation to exports of goods
and services. In 1982/83, debt-service payments were about US$15 million,
equivalent to 7 percent of exports of goods and services. Over the medium
term, these payments are projected to remain at less than 10 percent of
Nepal's exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.     Bank Group operations in Nepal began in 1969 with an IDA credit of
US$1.7 million equivalent for a telecommunications project. Since then, 33
additional credits have been approved, bringing total IDA assistance to Nepal
to US$380.5 million equivalent, net of cancellations. In view of Nepal's
many development needs, this assistance has been for projects in a wide
variety of sectors. Six of these sectors account for about 86 percen1: of
IDA credits by amount:  irrigation/agriculture (US$170.0 million for 14
projects); water supply and sewerage (US$46.8 million for three projects);
power (US$51.8 million for two projects); telecommunications (US$21.7 million
for three projects); highways (US$19.2 million for two projects); and rural
development (US$19.0 million for two projects). The proposed credit Would be
the fourth approved in FY84. No Bank loans have been made to Nepal. IFC
made its first investment in Nepal (US$3.1 million) in a hotel project in
Kathmandu in 1975. In addition, IFC approved a loan of US$6.2 million equiv-
alent to Nepal Orind Magnesite (Private) Limited (i.e., a private company) in
March 1982. The loan will help finance a US$24.9 million project to mine and
process magnesite ore. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC operations as of March 31, 1984.
17.     Bank Group lending to Nepal so far has been modest compared to the
country's need for external assistance. The international community has
shown considerable interest in Nepal's economic development and, to date, a
shortage of funds has not been a major bottleneck. The main constrai.nt on
the utilization of increased aid has been Nepal's limited absorptive
capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation and implementation. The
Bank Group has provided assistance to the Government in project preparation
through a Technical Assistance Credit (Cr. 659-NEP) and by acting as
Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance projects financed by
UNDP. Furthermore, the present Resident Representative in Kathmandu has had



-6-
a significant impact in improving project implementation performance. As a
result, the rate of disbursements is improving: during FY82 and FY83,
US$28.5 and US$37.4 million equivalent, respectively, was disbursed compared
to an annual average disbursement of about US$17 million during the previous
five fiscal years. Project completion reports 'have been prepared for five
projects: First Telecommunications (Cr. 166-NEP), First Highways
(Cr. 223-NEP), Tourism (Cr. 291-NEP), Birganj Irrigation (Cr. 373-NEP) and
Settlement Project (Cr. 505-NEP). All five projects experienced delays in
implementation, and institutional improvements wiere less than anticipated;
however, all five generated acceptable rates of return.
18.     The Bank Group's current lending strategy places emphasis on assist-
ing the Government in its efforts to contain the high level of population
growth, address major constraints in the country's development of human
resources and promote agricultural development. Selected infrastructure
investments, mostly in transport, telecommunications and power, will also be
undertaken to alleviate serious development constraints.  In population, a
project is being prepared by the Government and there is donor interest to
cofinance various components. For the development of human resources,
projects under preparation include agricultural manpower, engineering
education, vocational and primary and secondary education projects. For
agriculture, the basic strategy is to assist Nepal maintain overall foodgrain
self-sufficiency and, where possible, promote exports of agricultural
products and encourage afforestation efforts. Projects under preparation
would extend the assistance provided so far by building irrigation
infrastructure mainly in the Terai to increase paddy production and help
reduce the food deficits in the Hills. Both would be accomplished through
irrigation and rural development projects which would emphasize increased
food production and through specific Hill food projects.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
19.     Principal sources of energy in Nepal are forests and rivers.
Fuelvood provides for about 92 percent of the total energy needs of the
country. Commercial sources such as coal, petroleum and electricity provide
about 6 percent of the total energy consumed; the remainder being provided by
charcoal, crop and animal waste. There are no known reserves of fossil fuels
in Nepal. The country has vast potential hydropower resources which are
estimated to be around 83,000 MW, and of which only 25,000 MW have so far
been investigated. Fast depletion of the forests has led to the realization
of an urgent necessity to develop the only alternative indigenous source of
energy: hydropower.
20.     A plan for hydroelectric power development was first prepared in 1974
under Japanese technical assistance, followed by a detailed study of the
Gandaki river basin in 1979 under UNDP assistance. Other sites are also
being studied including the Karnali and Kosi basins. The Water and Energy
Commission intends to carry out detailed studies of the major rivers with



-7-
funds to be provided by donors. The studies will assist the Government in
properly ranking the various projects on a countrywide basis.
The Power Subsector
21.     In Nepal, only about 5 percent of the population is served by elec-
tricity and the annual per capita consumption is about 16 kWh compared. with
26 kWh in Bangladesh, 164 kWh in India, and 307 kWh in China. About 97
percent of the consumers registered in 1983 were residential and used 52
percent of electricity whereas iindustry used 32 percent and commerce and
others 16 percent. Electrification now extends to 39 of the 75 district
headquarters, 28 of the 29 town panchayats and 137 of the 2,905 village
panchayats.  EMG has plans to electrify 21 additional district headquarters,
1 town panchayat and 241 village panchayats within next five years. TShis
would imply that by the end of this period a total of about 3.6 million
persons would be expected to be living in towns and villages with
electricity. HMG intends to carry out this rural electrification program
mainly with assistance from ADB.
22.     The present firm power generating capacity in Nepal is 133 MW, of
which 111 MW is hydro and the rest is thermal (diesel). Total energy gener-
ated in Nepal in 1983 was 292 GWh of which 279 GWh was hydro, 5 GWh diesel,
and 8 GWh was generated from captive plant. In addition, 63 GWh were
imported from India. Of the five administrative regions of Nepal, the
Central region has most of the hydro and thermal stations built there because
of the concentration of the major loads in the Kathmandu Valley. This region
also accounted for the largest amount of sales (72 percent) of electricity in
1983.
23.     Difficult topography, inaccessibility to most of the mountainous
areas, and consequent high cost of transmission lines have forced HMG to
develop small hydropower generating units in suitable areas. The size of
these generating units vary from 25 kW to 500 kW. So far 11 such power
stations with a total installed capacity of 2,179 kW have been commissioned.
Another 21 stations with an installed capacity of 9,750 kW are under
construction, and 16 schemies with a potential of 1,786 kW are under
investigation. Currently USAID is providing assistance to 1MG in developing
a cost-effective methodology for collection of data on stream flow and rain-
fall for the sites, improvement: in load factors, and in reduction of capital
and maintenance cost of the small hydro schemes. HMG hopes that small hydros
will play a significant role in the future power development of Nepal.
24.     The grid system is presently confined to the Central region and parts
of the Western region and consists of 239 km of 132 kV lines and 227 km of
66 kV lines, respectively. The firm plant capacity in the grid is 130 MW, of
which 111 MW is hydro. The maximum demand of the grid system was 69.1 MW in
FY83, compared to the total Nepal demand of 83.2 MW. The Eastern region,
which had a maximum demand of 11.0 MW in FY83, does not form a part of the
grid system, and depends heavily on electricity imported from India. In



-8-
1983, 96 percent of the required electricity in the region was imported frc.M
India. The network in this area is connected by 188 km of 33 kV and 76 T1i of
11 kV lines. The other two regions, Mid Western and Far Western, had a
combined demand of only 3.1 MW in 1983. This isolated network consists of
85 km of 33 kV lines and 52 km of 11 kV lines connected to small hydros,
diesels and supply from India. The grid system is being extended to inter-
connect the Eastern region with ADB financing (completion is scheduled for
1986). There are also plans to extent the grid westward under French and ADB
assistance, which may be completed by 1987.
25.     The losses in the distribution system are high; in 1983, they
amounted to 30.5 percent of generation.  A study was conducted on. system
losses by a consultant with ADB assistance. The study recommended various
steps to check pilferage of electricity, to meter unmetered supply and to
recalibrate old and defective meters. During negotiations, it was agreed
that these recommendations would be implemented in order to reduce system
losses to a level of 24 percent by 1986 and 18 percent by 1991. It was
further agreed that the ADB-financed study would be extended under this
project so that the Borrower could develop a comprehensive loss-reduction
program; a copy of which would be furnished to the Association by July 15,
1985 (Section 4.11, Development Credit Agreement).
26.     Inadequate maintenance of the existing hydropower generating units
and delay in their repair have been causing serious problems in Nepal.  One
hydropower station (Trisuli) was reconmaended for closure by the manufacturers
to facilitate urgent repair and maintenance. HMG is now aware of these
problems and has directed the concerned agencies to acquire essential spare
parts and maintenance equipment. The Borrower would submit to the
Association by March 31, 1985, a proposal for establishing a plant main-
tenance program for rehabilitating existing hydroelectric power plants in
Nepal (Section 4.03(b), Development Credit Agreement).
27.     In spite of the underutilization of hydro-generating stations due to
operational problems and absence of an interconnecting grid system for the
whole of the country, total electricity sales in Nepal grew at an average
annual rate of 18.2 percent during 1971-78, and 11.7 percent during 1976-83.
From 1978 onwards, load shedding was introduced and growth rates were there-
fore affected. A load forecast was prepared in 1981 by the Water and Energy
Commission (WEC) based on estimated sales required for each major category of
load in each region (industry, domestic, commercial, etc.) and reviewed
during appraisal of the proposed project and updated. The forecast indicates
an increase in demand by an average of 12.8 percent per annum up to 1992.
This would imply a total demand of 198 MW and 868 GWh for the integrated
system in FY92.
Institutional Aspects
28.     Electricity planning and development in Nepal are the responsibility
of the Ministry of Water Resources. Electricity development programs are



-9-
integrated into the five-year plans through the Planning Commission. HMG
created WEC in 1976 withirL the Ministry of Water Resources to investigate and
prepare plans for development of water and energy resources. However, power
sector planning is in its early stages in Nepal and has been limited during
the past years to the preparation of demand forecasts and to the identifica-
tion and ranking of potential hydropower projects. Preparation of a long-
term power expansion program is planned as a next step.
29.     There are two principle authorities involved in the management of the
power sector in Nepal:
(a) Electricity Depart:ment (ED) of the Ministry of Water Resources; and
(b) Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC).
30.     The ED, under a Chief Engineer, is responsible for investigating,
engineering, constructing and commissioning new power facilities which upon
completion are turned over to NEC for operation. However, the construction
of major power projects like Kulekhani and the proposed Marsyangdi
Hydroelectric Power Project, is managed by separate development boards which
are chaired by the Minister of Water Resources. Another agency, Small
Hydropower Development Board (SHDB), constructs and manages small hydropower
generating units.
31.     NEC is a government-ownied corporation responsible for generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity throughout most of the country.
It is the largest entity in the power sector. NEC also takes care of routine
minor distribution expansions, extends supply to new customers and is respon-
sible for metering, billing and collections.
32.     Currently, the Government is carrying out, with the assistancte of
consultants, an institutional study financed by ADB. Phase I of the study
has been completed. Based on its conclusions, ADB and 1MG signed a miemoran-
dum of understanding in November 1982 to form a single entity called the
Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), incorporating ED, NEC and the development
boards. This decision, when implemented (April 30, 1985), would improve
considerably the management and coordination of the sector (para 41).
Past Bank Experience in the Sector
33.     The first Bank Group operation in the Nepal power sector was a credit
of US$26.0 million approved in 1976 for the Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project
(Cr. 600-NEP), followed by a supplemental credit in 1979 of US$14.8 maillion
(Cr. 600-1-NEP). Project cost estimates during the 1974 appraisal amounted
to US$68.0 million; however, they were subsequently revised to the uLtimate
amount of US$120.8 million due to cost overruns caused mainly by design
changes arising from geological investigations subsequent to appraisal.
Cofinancing was provided by OECF-Japan (US$20.3 million equivalent), UNDP
(US$6.1 million equivalent), OPEC Fund (US$3.3 million equivalent), ]Kuwait



-10-
Fund (US$24.9 million equivalent), and EEC (US$3.0 million equivalent), with
the Government covering US$22.4 million. Kulekhani represented by far the
largest civil works ever undertaken in a single project in Nepal, and with
the participation of an unprecedented number of donors (five). It also
introduced for the first time two donors (OECF-Japan and Kuwait Fund) who
have since remained important sources of development assistance to the
country. Moreover, it offered Nepalese officials and engineers an oppor-
tunity for practical experience with major civil works related to a
hydropower scheme.  The Association also approved in March 1984 a credit of
US$11.0 million equivalent (SDR 10.2 million) to finance the feasibility
studies of the Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose Project, which has a poten-
tial generating capacity of about 3,600 MW, and th(e prefeasibility study of a                  d
smaller hydropower project upstream of Chisapani.
Bank Lending Goals and Strategy
34.     IDA's strategy for power development in Nepal is designed to achieve
the following objectives:
(a) assist HMG in the supply of power required for industrial
and agricultural development as well as for domestic use;
(b) pursue, in cooperation with HMG and other Lenders, the
necessary sectoral reorganization and improved efficiency
in sector management and operations; and
(c) help upgrade local technical and managerial. capabilities
through technical assistance and on-the-job and formal training.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Origin
35.     A team of experts from China first identified the present project
site on the Marsyangdi River in 1966. The proposal included a run-of-river
project with a power generating capacity of 40 MW, which was subsequently
modified by ED to 36 MW with a shorter head. After considering estimates of
load demands by 1991 and comparing many other programs, involving alternative
hydropower sites and thermal options, the Water and Energy Commission (WEC)
selected this project in 1980 to be the next undertaken by Nepal. The
feasibility study of the proposed project was prepared in 1979 by Lahmeyer
International (LI) of the Federal Republic of Germany in partnership with an
Australian firm, Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation (SMEC). LI/SMEC also
provided the detailed engineering and lprepared the tender documents, with
funds for both provided by Germany. Ilt was decided to locate the project
about 140 km downstream of the mouth of the Marsyan,gdi River (a tributary of
the Trisuli River which drains the Gandaki basin and flows ultimately into
India). Because the project is a run-of-river scheme, it will not alter the
daily volume of water flow to India and, therefore, the Association is satis-



-11-
fied that the project would not adversely affect the interests of India. The
Government of India has not raised any objections to the proposed project.
36.     Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington, D.C.
during April 4-13, 1984. The Kingdom of Nepal was represented by a delega-
tion led by Mr. K.D. Adhikary, Secretary, Ministry of Finance. Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 4422a-NEP, dated                      is being distributed
separately. Annex III to this report contains supplementary data relating to
the project.
Project Obiectives
37.     The objectives are:  (a) to meet the forecasted demand for elec-
tricity in Nepal up to fiscal year 1993; and (b) to strengthen the power
sector in Nepal.
Project Description
38.     The project would divert through a run-of-river scheme the waters of
the Marsyangdi River for the purpose of generating power. It is estimated
that it would produce about 462 GWh of energy annually, and would have the
following components: (a) diversion works and diversion weir, with a flush-
ing structure, a settling basin, and an intake structure for the headrace
tunnel; (b) a concrete-lined, circular headrace tunnel, plus a surge tank, a
steel-lined pressure shaft, and three tailrace tunnels; (c) a semi-
underground a power station; (d) provision of various hydraulic steel struc-
tures and electrical and mechanical equipment for the power station as well
as (i) an outdoor 132 kV substation at Marsyangdi, (ii) extension cf the
existing 132 kV substation at Bharatpur, (iii) upgrading to 132 kV the exist-
ing substation at Balaju, and (iv) extension of the local distribut:ion system
in Kathmandu, including transmission line from Balaju to Lainchaur;, (e) two
132 kV transmission lines from Marsyangdi to Balaju (90 km) and to Bharatpur
(40 km); and (f) training programs and facilities, technical assistance,
consulting engineering, and institution building.
Implementation
39.     The project would be implemented by the Marsyangdi Hydroelectric
Development Board (MHDB) which was set up by HMG in December 1981. The Board
is headed by the Minister of Water Resources and consists of seven other
members representing the concerned ministries.  The Project Manager is the
Member-Secretary of the Board. The organizational structure of the Board
includes five divisions/sections: (a) evaluation and planning; (b) civil
works; (c) electromechanical; (d) accounts; and (e) administration, stores
and procurement. The joint venture LI/SMEC would be the consulting engineer
for construction supervision. The project is expected to be comp]eted by
June 30, 1989.



-12-
Beneficiary
40.     Upon completion, the project would be transferred to the Nepal
Electricity Authority (NEA), a new statutory corporation to be set up after
the reorganization of the power sector, currently in process. NEA would take
over the operations of NEC, ED, and the development boards in respect of the
construction and operation of power projects. The transfer of the Marsyangdi
Hydroelectric Power Plant would be made at a date not later than six months
after its commissioning. IDA funds used in financing these components of
the project would be transferred to NEA as debt to be repaid to the
Government within 30 years at 12 percent interest per annum. This interest
rate was proposed in consideration of the projected inflation rate (between 7
and 9 percent) and the current interest on government loans (between 11 and
15 percent) for investment purposes. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by the Borrower.
41.     The responsibilities of NEA would include planning, construction,
operation and maintenance, billing and collection, and customer service
(Section 4.14(a), Development Credit Agreement). Consultants financed by ADB
are currently involved in assisting EHMG design the internal organization and
operation system of NEA. A summary outline of NEA shows four functional
units: (a) generation and transmission; (b) distribution and customer
service; (c) rural electrification; and (d) planning, evaluation and finance.
The management board of NEA would consist of about 11 members incLuding a
part-time chairman supported by a full-time vice chairman. NEA would become
operational by April 30, 1985 (Section 4.14(a), Development Credit:
Agreement). In order for NEA to self-finance a pcrtion of its capital
investment after covering operation expenses and debt service, it has been
agreed that NEA would not declare any dividends before the completion of the
Marsyangdi project, and thereafter, on]Ly after making adequate provisions for
internal funding.
Cost and Financing Plan
42.     The total project cost has been estimated at US$323.3 million
equivalent, including taxes and duties of US$15.81 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange cost of US$248.4 million (about 77 percent). The cost
estimates are based on mid-1984 prices and have been prepared by the consult-
ing engineer after detailed investigation. These have been reviewed further
by a panel of experts. The total cost includes, over base cost, 13.8 percent
for physical contingencies, and 16.4 percent for price contingencies.  The
price contingencies for foreign costs are estimated at 7.7 percent in 1984;
7.2 percent, 1985; 6.5 percent, 1986; and 6.0 percent, 1987 and thereafter.
For local costs, these are estimated at 9.0 percent: in 1984; 8.0 percent,                    4
1985; 7.0 percent, 1986, and 6.0 percent, 1987 and thereafter.
43.     Project cofinancing arrangements on a parallel basis are being final-
ized by the Government. These were discussed in a meeting of cofillancers in
Paris in October 1983 and at negotiations. The IDA credit of US$107.0 mil-



-13-
lion equivalent would cover about 33 percent of the total cost including
taxes and duties, and about 43 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The
Saudi Fund would contribute Saudi riyals 86.0 million (US$25.0 million
equivalent); the Kuwait Fund, Kuwaiti dinars 6.0 million (US$21.0 million
equivalent); and KfW, Deutsche Mark 186.3 million (US$74.5 million
equivalent). Out of the remaining US$95.8 million, EMG is seeking to finance
under a separate arrangetment with external sources8 including ADB, the trans-
mission lines (about US$10.5 million), plus secure additional funding to meet
the total cost of one of the t:wo civil works packages (Lot I; para 45). HMG
would be responsible for any remaining amounts. The effectiveness of the
Kuwait Fund, Saudi Fund and KfW financing agreements as well as the securing
by the Borrower of any additional financing required to meet the tol:al cost
of Lot I would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit (Section
6.01, Development Credit Agreement).

45.     Preliminary works consisting of offices, residences, water supply and
electricity at the project site (US$5.7 million) are already being executed
with the funds provided by HMG. This includes US$0.4 million which is the



-14-
estimated compensation cost for land acquisition. Administrative expenditure
consists of the salary and other incidental expenses of staff of MEDB and
would be financed by HMG. Civil works have been split into two lots. The
costs of Lot I, consisting of the diversion weir, flushing structure, intake
structure, diversion works and site installation is estimated at US$74.8
million, out of which about US$60.5 million represents the foreign cost. The
Saudi Fund and Kuwait Fund would cofinance about US$45.0 million of the cost
of Lot I. Cofinancing for the remainting portion wrould be arranged by 1MG
(Section 6.01(d), Development Credit Agreement).
46.     IDA will finance the foreign cost of Lot II estimated at US$101.2
million, consisting mainly of the headrace tunnel and pressure shaft. The
total cost of Lot II is US$129.2 million.  The coD,tract would be awarded on
the basis of ICB in accordance with the Association-'s procurement guidelines.
The foreign and local cost of equipment (hydraulic steel structures, mechani-
cal equipment and electrical equipment) is estimated at US$56.6 million, of
which the foreign portion is US$51.4 million. All of the foreign portion and
part of local cost, amounting to US$54.6 million, would be financed by KfW.
KfW would also finance the total cost of the substations and local
distribution, which is estimated at US$12.6 million. The contracts will be
awarded after inviting bids from suppliers within the Federal Republic of
Germany. HMG is arranging funds from external sou:rces, including ADB, for
the transmission lines, estimated at a total cost of US$10.5 million. The
fees of the consulting engineer, amounting to US$9.3 million, will be shared
by KfW (US$7.3 million), IDA (US$1.0 million), the Saudi Fund (US$0.5
million) and the Kuwait Fund (US$0.5 million). The components of technical
assistance consisting of the panel of experts fees (IJS$1.3 million), the cost
of the catchment management plan (US$0.3 million), a power sector training
program (US$3.2 million), and supervision of a loss reduction program (US$0.1
million) will be financed by IDA in accordance withL IDA guidelines.
47.     The bidders for civil works financed under IDA assistance aLre in the
process of being prequalified. A price preference of 7.5 percent will be
given to local contractors. The design and technical specifications to be
incorporated in the bidding documents have been prepared by the consulting
engineer and reviewed by the panel of experts. It is estimated that the
bidding documents for civil works will be ready for issue by June 1984.
Disbursement
48.     The proposed IDA credit would finance 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of the civil works Lot II, and 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of the panel of experts, training, catchment management plan,
and supervision of system loss reduction program ancl about 11 percent (with
the Saudi Fund, Kuwait Fund, and KfW sharing the remaining percentage) of the
cost of the consulting engineer. The disbursement would be completed over a
six-year period.



-15-
Training
49.     The project provides for training to upgrade staff for the operal:ion
and maintenance of the power system in Nepal. This would be provided through
a training center which would be established under the project. IDA wou:Ld
provide the foreign exchange cost of the center (US$3.2 million equivalent).
Although the training program would be designed mainly for technicians, there
would be scope for training financial and commercial staff as well as provid-
ing refresher courses for engineers. An action plan for staffing and operat-
ing the training center involving the appointment of a training coordinat:or
and the retention of training consultants has been agreed with HMG
(Section 3.05, Development Credit Agreement).
Tariffs
50.     Compared to the estimated long-run marginal cost of supply
(NRs 2.50/kWh), the present tariff (averaging NRs 0.81/kWh or US$0.052/kWh)
has been underpricing the service. Increases in the tariff levels and
restructuring of the tariff schedules, taking into account the marginal cost
within consumer categories (aud their willingness and ability to pay), are
needed to achieve appropriate financial targets.
51.     The earnings covenant under Kulekhani I Project (Cr. 600-NEP as
amended) approved in December 1975 stipulated that the revenues of NEC be
sufficient to earn an annual rate of return of 6 percent by 1983 on average
net fixed assets in operation. Due, inter alia, to delay in the implementa-
tion of the project, NEC has not been able to date to achieve this rate of
return, even though HMO implemented a tariff increase of 56 percent in August
1983 which raised the average tariff from NRs 0.52/kWh to the current average
of NRs 0.81/kWh. Under the proposed project the Borrower would take all
action necessary, including increasing NEC's current tariffs, to provide NEC
with revenue sufficient to produce an annual rate of return on the value of
NEC's average net fixed assets in operation of not less than 5 percent by
fiscal year 1985; 5.4 percent, FY86; and 6 percent, FY87 and thereafter
(Section 4.06(a), Development Credit Agreement). The Borrower would also
review annually NEC's tariffs and, as necessary, revise them to ensure the
agreed rate of return. Moreover, the Government will increase tariffs by an
average of 65 percent by not later than November 30, 1984.
Government Arrears
52.     Outstanding payments from government departments and agencies on
electricity bills due to NEC amounted to about NRs 12.8 million at the end
of FY83. HMG has confirmed payment to NEC of NRs 4.4 million against total
outstanding electricity bills to HMG departments and agencies. HMG has a:Lso
deposited NRs 3.8 million into an electricity arrears settlement account for
street lighting. A determination of the amount owed for street lighting
would be made by July 15, 1984. The amount so determined, which may be more
than NRs 3.8 million, would be paid by August 15, 1984. The Borrower would



-16-
furnish to the Association by March 31, 1985, a proposal of methods and
procedures to be implemented to ensure the timely payment of future elec-
tricity bills by all government departments and agencies (Section 4.10(a),
Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Justification
53.     According to current estimates, demand for electricity is expected to
grow at a rate of about 13 percent per annum resulting in a system demand of
160 MW by FY89. Compared to this demand, capacity presently installed and
under construction would be 142 MW by that time. Unless additional gener-
ating capacity is created, it would seriously affect development of trade and
industry, irrigation, as well as service to domestic consumers. Industrial
demand for electricity is estimated to grow at an annual rate of about 16
percent; demands for domestic and commercial consumption are estimated to
grow at average annual rates of 6 and 15 percent, respectively. In addition,
from a small base, demand for electricity to operate all the ongoing and
prospective irrigation projects is estimated to grow at a rate of more than
30 percent per annum
54.     The additional power generation from the proposed project would help,
Nepal to realize the potential from past, as well as prospective,
investments. It would avoid investments in thermal power generation and
exploit one of the country's major indigenous sources of energy. The heavy
cost of imported fuel for thermal generation could cause a severe strain on
the country's balance-of-payments.
55.     This project is in line with the objectives of Nepal to meet a part
of its energy demand over the next years through the construction of
hydropower generating stations. The project would also further Nepal's
efforts to train its engineers and technical staff to handle the construction
and management of hydropower plants in the future.
56.     The project is the least--cost solution based on the consideration of
four alternative programs for power development consisting of a mix of hydro
projects, coal-fired thermal, low-speed diesel and gas turbines to meet a
system demand of 391 MW by 2000. Various options of the proposed project
varying the installed capacity (from 50 to 101) MW) have also been examined.
The proposed project remains the most economically designed option. On the
basis of the proposed tariff, an internal rate of return for the project has
been estimated at 5.9 percent. Ak sensitivity analysis on the basis of
increasing benefits by 10 percent raises the rate of return to 6.4 percent.
A similar analysis by decreasing benefits by 10 percent or by deferring the
project by one year shows a rate of return of around 5.5 percent. The true
economic rate of return would be significantly higher if all benefits could
be quantified such as willingness to pay of all types of consumers and
increased system reliability.



-17-
Risks
57.     The risks involved in the execution of the project relate to possible
deficiencies in design and construction, poor project management, inadequate
supply of essential items, and cost overruns. The appointment of a panel of
experts to review design and construction, the supervision of claims, the
appropriate provision of physical contingencies, and the adequate staffing of
MHDB with close assistance from the consulting engineer would help prevent or
certainly minimize these risks. Steps would also be taken by the contractors
and suppliers to insure physical works and equipment against physical hazards
and other risks during handling and construction.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Comittee provided for in
Article V, Section ltd) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the project are
listed in Section III of Annex III.
59.     I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
