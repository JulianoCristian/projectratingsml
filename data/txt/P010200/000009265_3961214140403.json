The\n            project successfully achieved its physical objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was marginally\n            successful, and sustainability is likely. However, both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed less than satisfactorily\n            overall. Several lessons can be learned from this project.\n            First, the successful operation of the Marsyangdi plant\n            suggests that the detailed planning, execution, and\n            monitoring of operation and maintenance carried out in this\n            plant should be applied in other facilities in NEA's\n            system. Second, projects with large, lumpy physical\n            components should be submitted to Board consideration only\n            after bidding for the main components has taken place.\n            Third, the project illustrates the fact that borrowers and\n            beneficiaries tend to own physical project components of IDA\n            projects more clearly than institutional ones. Fourth, a new\n            strategy in line with the current power sector policy\n            guidelines of the Bank Group needs to be developed. Fifth,\n            IDA created a precedent that when HMG and NEA were not in\n            compliance with their commitments, these covenants were\n            shifted to the next projects. Lastly, IDA should ensure that\n            the necessity to undertake rehabilitation and restoration of\n            livelihood of project affected families be accepted as a\n            principle by HMG."}, "docdt": "1996-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
