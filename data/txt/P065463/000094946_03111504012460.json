During construction, a certain amount\n            of vegetation could be permanently disturbed due to dam\n            reinforcement, canal schemes, and road upgrading. Animals\n            that used to live in quietness will be disturbed by the\n            noise. During project plan and design, natural reserves and\n            wildlife habitat should be avoided. Earth borrowing, stone\n            excavation, and waste disposal sites should be located far\n            from those areas as well. Construction machineries should be\n            kept far from those areas too. A comprehensive plan for\n            earth and stone borrowing and dumping should be prepared to\n            keep a balance between filling and excavations to reduce\n            waste materials. To mitigate soil erosion, the area and\n            number of construction sites should be reduced. Lime-clay\n            mixing may cause dust and so mixing plants should be set up\n            far enough from residences, hospitals, and schools. During\n            operation, there is a potential agricultural non-point\n            source pollution as a result of applying agrochemicals,\n            pesticides, and animal manures. Corresponding mitigating\n            measures include improving efficiency of agro-chemical\n            application and control of pesticide use. A program of\n            Schistosomiasis control and health improvement should be\n            developed in the irrigation districts of Pengze and Yongxiu\n            counties in which the low-lying areas are inhabited by snails."}, "docdt": "2003-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
