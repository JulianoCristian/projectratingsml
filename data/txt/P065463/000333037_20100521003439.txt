C.      Project Implementation Status and Reasons for Restructuring

Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural Modernization Project (JIAMP) was approved on
November 20, 2003 and became effective on May 14, 2004. The closing date is June 30,
2010. The project development objective is to improve the livelihood of rural households
in Jiangxi Province through establishment of integrated, economically and
environmentally sustainable, and market-driven agricultural production systems focusing
on productivity and agricultural output of high quality and value. Project performance to
date is satisfactory (See ISR No.9 dated April 3, 2010) with all covenants complied with,
including those related to fiduciary and safeguard issues. By the end of 2009, the project
had completed US$156.55 million of investment (98.2% of total project cost of
US$159.42 million); disbursements from the Bank loan, as of January 8, 2010 were
US$86.9 million (86.9%).

The proposed reallocation is necessary to enable the participating local governments to
utilize the substantial savings in various categories to carry out additional works, as
explained below:

1.        Categories with Reduced Allocations (Total Reduction of $11,984,350)

     a. Goods (Reduction of $2,694,000) ­ Jiangxi Province has decided to reduce
        procurement of vehicles, equipment for training farmers, equipment for farm
        marketing and agro-enterprises. These reductions will not have a negative impact
        on achieving the PDO.
     b. Consulting services (Reduction of $4,068,600) - The cost for irrigation scheme
        design was far less than originally budgeted, and some county governments used
        their own funds for dam safety review.
     c. Training and Study Tours (Reduction of $1,978,100) - After the Wenchuan
        earthquake, the Government decided to restrict overseas study tours and training;
        these were partially replaced by in-country training and study tours. These
        reductions will not have a negative impact on achieving the PDO.
     d. Farm Production Sub-Loans (Reduction of $3,243,650) ­ Demand for these sub-
        loans has been much lower than envisaged at appraisal. This is a small component
        of the project, and the reduction will not have a negative impact on achieving the
        PDO.

2.        Category with Increased Allocation (Total Increase of $11,984,350)

     a.    Works (Increase of $11,984,350) - Jiangxi Province would like to use loan
          savings as a result of the above for the construction of additional farm irrigation
          schemes, and thus contribute to increasing project benefits to farmers. The
          additional works will be completed by the June 30, 2010 closing date.
