F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project objectives are (i) to improve the capacity for increased productivity of
irrigated agriculture in the Ferghana Valley by improving land and water management,
and (ii) to improve safety and regulation of the Kayrakkum Dam and Reservoir, thereby
contributing to enhanced water management security and efficiency at the basin level.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO is to assist the Recipient in: (i) increasing the coverage of drained and
irrigated areas in Bobojon Gafurov and Kannibodom raions, respectively; and (ii)
strengthening the early warning system of the Kayrakkum dam as well as carrying out a
geotechnical study for assessing the risks associated with said dam.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Independence and turmoil, followed by a bloody civil war in the 1990s had
left Tajikistan among the poorest countries in the world. Although real annual GDP
growth had ranged from 6 to 8 percent over several years, in 2004, annual per capita
income was US$300, with about 64 percent of the population of 6.3 million remaining
below the poverty line. Agriculture was critical to Tajikistan’s poverty reduction and
economic growth. It provided the main livelihood for two thirds of the population, and
represented a fifth of the economic output. Of Tajikistan’s 4.6 million hectares (ha) of
agricultural land, only about 780,000 ha were arable and irrigated. Of this, roughly
500,000 ha were under rotation between cotton and cereal crops, with about 290,000 ha
under cotton at any one time.

2.      The Ferghana Valley (FV) was an important region of Central Asia, with a
total population of approximately 11 million, of whom 70 percent lived in rural
areas spread among Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. The Valley
had the most fertile soils and highest population density of any region in Tajikistan. It
was rich in water resources, including groundwater. Its principal water control feature
was the Kayrakkum Dam Reservoir, located on the Syr Darya River. The dam was built
in 1959, and the reservoir was used for seasonal regulation of the river flow to provide
water for irrigation and power generation. Although the reservoir’s water mainly
benefitted Uzbekistan, the dam itself was located in the territory of Tajikistan. Since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems had fallen into
disrepair, leading to unreliable irrigation water supplies, drainage and water-logging
problems, and reductions in irrigated area, soil fertility, cropping intensity and crop yields.

3.      The reduction in irrigated area affected the livelihoods of an estimated 2
million people in Tajikistan’s share of FV, reducing agricultural income and
increasing the incidence of poverty. Tajikistan’s territory in FV covered approximately
700,000 ha of which about 220,000 ha were suitable for irrigation, while the actual
irrigated area in 2002 was only 134,000 ha, due to deteriorating irrigation infrastructure
and weak water management. Other factors that affected water management in FV
included cross-border water management problems, inefficient water use practices, farm
land ownership, and conflicts in water use priorities.

4.     At the time of appraisal, Tajikistan was still in a post-conflict state, and the
Bank was keen to support the country in view of its rapidly increasing poverty levels,
especially in the rural areas. The country’s institutions and overall capacity were also
quite weak, for example, with low or no technical strength in several ministries. The
Government was keen to reduce poverty; however, there were only limited resources
available to address the multitude of issues and priorities the country faced. One of these




                                              1
issues related to incomplete and controversial farm restructuring and land privatization,
which were being addressed under a separate project 1.

5.      The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan’s (GoT) strategy to reduce
poverty and improve water management considered FV as one of the main areas to
be developed, and stressed the need to increase the contribution of water users to
enhance sustainability of irrigation systems. The Bank had gained valuable experience
from on-going operations in the agriculture sector, especially the Rural Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project 2 and the Farm Privatization Support Project (see footnote 1). In
addition, the Land Registration and Cadastre System for Sustainable Agriculture Project
(LRCSP) had just been approved in April 2005 to support farm land privatization. The
Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management Project (FVWRMP) was to be linked to
LRCSP to enhance the benefits of privatization with the concurrent rehabilitation of basic
rural irrigation infrastructure, and to introduce water users associations (WUAs), which
were nonexistent, and there was no recovery of operations and maintenance (O&M) costs
from farmers. FVWRMP was to focus on the Soghd Oblast of Tajikistan and the
westernmost portion of FV.

6.      FVWRMP was viewed as important from a regional standpoint. The Project
aimed to achieve national benefits by rehabilitating local I&D systems and improving
water management, while simultaneously reestablishing the safety and better operations
of Kayrakkum Dam and Reservoir, thereby benefiting downstream countries as well as
Tajikistan. FVWRMP was approved on July 26, 2005 for an amount of US$13 million
equivalent and became effective on January 19, 2006.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.     The PDO was: (i) to improve the capacity for increased irrigated agriculture
productivity in the Ferghana Valley by improving land and water management, and (ii) to
improve safety and regulation of the Kayrakkum Dam and Reservoir, thereby
contributing to enhanced water management security and efficiency at the basin level.

8.      The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were: (i) 70% reduction of flooded and
waterlogged land areas within project perimeters near levees; (ii) 30% improvement in
timely water availability in irrigated areas under project; (iii) WUA established and
functioning adequately in Western Kannibodom; (iv) 80% collection of billed water fees
from WUAs established for more than a year under the project, for O&M of I&D gravity
and pumping systems, particularly tubewell systems; (v) 10% minimum increase in crop
yields; (vi) dam safety management and emergency action plan in place; and (vii)
forecast accuracy for available reservoir storage volumes and inflow/outflow volumes
improved to 70% accuracy level.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

9.      The project suffered from cost overruns in the first three years of implementation
due to ‘under-design’ during project preparation and significant price increases on most
goods and works, as detailed in Section 2. At the Mid-Term Review (MTR) on May 18,
2009, it was believed that project outputs were falling considerably short of original
design and threatening achievement of the PDO. The shortfall was due to a number of
factors, mainly the higher cost. In response to funding constraints in some disbursement
categories, FVWRMP was restructured (Level Two) on February 15, 2010, to reallocate
grant proceeds to enable works to continue until planned additional financing (AF) was
mobilized. 3 The restructuring also included an increase to 100 percent financing to
alleviate the burden of counterpart financing from Tajikistan’s constrained budget.
Subsequently, the project needed another restructuring to address changes in project
scope/outputs. Following discussions with ECA Quality, it was decided to process these
changes together with the additional financing (AF).

10.    On May 25, 2010, the project underwent a second restructuring (Level One) to
include AF of SDR 6.6 million (US$10 million equivalent) to help finance the cost
overrun, complete additional works identified in detailed designs during implementation,
and to expand activities to increase the capacity of Raivodkhozes (district Water
Departments) and WUAs. The restructuring included: a revision to the PDO and the
Results Framework (RF); and a two-year extension of the Closing Date to May 31, 2013.

11.     A key element of the AF was to further understand the safety risk of the
Kayrakkum Dam. The review of the Dam had been inconclusive in determining the
ultimate risk posed by the Dam, especially under earthquake conditions. The consultant’s
draft report had proposed a number of studies and plans that needed to be implemented
over time, as resources (beyond that available under the Project) became available. As a
result, the AF allocated US$250,000 for a detailed geotechnical investigation to
determine the risk level, and, also included a number of measures 4 to improve dam safety,
amounting to a total cost of US$410,000.

12.     The revised PDO was to assist the Recipient in: (i) increasing the coverage of
drained and irrigated areas in Bobojon Gafurov and Kannibodom raions, respectively;
and (ii) strengthening the early warning system of the Kayrakkum Dam as well as
carrying out a geotechnical study for assessing the risks associated with said dam.

13.    The revised KPIs were as follows: (i) reduction of flooded and waterlogged land
areas within project perimeters near levees; (ii) area returned to effective irrigation under
the project; (iii) collection of billed water fees by WUAs; (iv) early warning system


3
  On January 29, 2009, the Government had requested additional financing of US$10 million
from IDA to cover the cost overrun.

emergency supported by an efficient organization and communication systems

executive summary with all the main recommendations prepared to be shared regionally;
and (vi) forecast accuracy for available reservoir storage volumes and inflow/outflow
volumes improved 5.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     Project interventions focused on an irrigated area of 30,000 ha, and were expected
to benefit approximately 250,000 people located in areas south of the Kayrakkum
Reservoir, in Kannibodom and Bobojon Gafurov raions, by reducing flooding of large
tracts of farm land and villages alongside the Southern embankments of the reservoir.
Expected benefits also included improved living conditions and reduced exposure to
waterborne diseases. Other beneficiaries included WUAs created and supported by the
project.

1.5 Original Components

15.      Component 1. Irrigation and Drainage Systems Rehabilitation and
Improvements (US$9.02 million). This component financed design and works for
rehabilitating pumped and gravity I&D systems serving 30,000 ha of farm land in the
Kannibodom and Bobojon Gufarov raions, including: (i) reforming and cleaning main
and secondary off-farm collector drains, and rehabilitating associated drainage pumping
stations; (ii) renovating I&D tubewell systems; (iii) rehabilitating selected major
irrigation pumping station systems; (iv) repairing and lining selected sections of the Big
Ferghana Canal (BFC); and (v) improving selected inter-farm and on-farm surface and
subsurface I&D systems.

16.    Component 2. Strengthening Kayrakkum Reservoir Dykes and Improvement
of Kayrakkum Dam Safety and Reservoir Operation (US$3.03 million). This
component funded: (i) design and works related to the rehabilitation of the Kayrakkum
Reservoir dykes in Kannibodom and Bobojon Gafurov raions; and (ii) technical studies,
dredging and other equipment and instrumentations, and minor works to increase
operational performance and improve management of the Kayrakkum Dam and Reservoir,
to improve dam safety and develop dam and reservoir emergency procedures.

17.     Component 3. Institutional Development and Technical Assistance (US$1.37
million). This component covered the necessary institutional capacity building for: (i)
establishing WUAs; (ii) improving agricultural productivity and achieving more efficient
water use patterns; and (iii) ensuring proper environmental impact mitigating measures.
Activities included training, demonstration programs, and information dissemination
exercises and technical assistance (TA) from international and local specialists.

18.      Component 4. Project Management (US$0.75 million). This component funded
assistance to the central Project Management Unit (PMU) and to the regional Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), and included: (i) establishing and supporting a PMU in
Dushanbe within the Ministry of Melioration and Water Resources Management
(MMWRM), and of a PIU in Khujand; (ii) local and international TA for managerial,
technical, financial, procurement and administrative supervision of implementation
activities; (iii) setup and operation of a project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system;
and (iv) an institutional strengthening program incorporating relevant training.

1.6 Revised Components. The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.    Project activities remained fundamentally the same as in the original project.
Under the AF, the project also planned to establish and support two additional WUAs,
and finance the in-depth geotechnical study. Allocations to Components 1 to 4 were
increased respectively by US$5.9, 3.0, 0.8 and 0.3 million.

20.     On March 15, 2013, FVWRMP underwent a third restructuring (Level Two) to
extend the closing date by one year to May 31, 2014. This restructuring required approval
of the Regional Vice President due to the cumulative extension of three years from the
original closing date. The main rationale was to allow sufficient time to complete
remaining project activities (i.e. construction works and capacity building of WUAs) that
had been delayed. Consultant services to prepare studies for a successor project were also
added to Component 4. Implementation Progress (IP) and progress towards achievement
of the PDO were both rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU) at the time.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.      Project concept and design drew on Bank experiences and lessons from
similar projects implemented in former Soviet countries and globally. These
included: (i) the need for an inclusive approach that covered both physical and non-
physical improvements to the irrigated agriculture sector and addressed social,
institutional, environmental and financial aspects as well; (ii) the need to address both
irrigation (pumping capacity) problems and drainage problems; (iii) the importance of
tackling power system deficiencies (by including rehabilitation of electromechanical
installations) as I&D systems are heavily dependent on power; and (iv) the need to
develop WUAs with system users who are owners or long-term tenants of the lands being
serviced.

22.     The Bank decided to fast-track project preparation despite the limited
availability of data to ensure high-quality preparation. At the time, it was felt that
Tajikistan needed urgent assistance in view of the fragility of the post-conflict situation



                                            5
and the increasing poverty levels, and that a rapidly-prepared project to support poverty
reduction was the most appropriate tool. Although there were possible risks involved,
Bank management made a decision to move head at the time, and believed that any
deficiencies during preparation could be addressed during implementation.

23.     The design failed to properly address some of the key issues/risks that were
identified during preparation. 6 These include: (i) the inadequacy of a single operation
to address the complex water management aspects in FV, compared to a more modest
approach/phased longer-term program of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) or some
piloting. The project included a package of infrastructure, participation, capacity building,
extension services and environmental mitigation in a country where local capacity (GoT
and private sector) was either very limited or non-existent (Aide Memoire, May/June
2009, p.3); (ii) the long time it takes to implement effective privatization schemes and
thereafter set up functional WUAs. WUA development was highly dependent on land
privatization, and FVWRMP needed to harmonize the timing with LRCSP. Although the
project identified the risk of delays in LRCSP, it did not identify alternative actions in
case of possible delays; and (iii) previous experience that indicated the high risk in terms
of sustainability of WUAs, with WUAs seldom able to recover even operations and
maintenance (O&M) costs in similar situations. While the Project provided some office
resources, it lacked support to strengthen management and low institutional capacity of
WUAs. Only at the AF stage did the project address the institutional capacity of the
Raidvodhozes that were working with the WUAs to maintain project investments.

24.     The Project’s design was over-ambitious in terms of expecting to achieve a
complex agenda, given the resources that were made available, and in a country
with poor institutional capacity. The PDO was also unrealistic in stating that
FVWRMP would ‘improve safety and regulation of the Kayrakkum Dam and Reservoir’.
Improving the safety of the dam, where the reliability and stability of the structures were
unknown, would have involved more in-depth investigations and costs. GoT also did not
attach as much importance to investing the time and resources into the dam, given the
number of other priorities the country faced, and the fact that GoT believed that the
Kayrakkum Reservoir was only of interest to Uzbekistan as its water mainly benefitted
Uzbekistan.

25.     The Project suffered from cost overruns partly due to ‘under design’ at
preparation, resulting in delayed implementation, significantly reduced outputs
than envisaged, and necessitating several restructurings. Most quantities and cost
estimates for works and services were underestimated in 2004, as they were based on unit
costs provided by the government and over-reliance on Soviet-based cost estimates. In
some cases, the original designs did not include several key elements (AF Project Paper,
p. 2). For example, the original design did not identify numerous structures that needed
rehabilitation, including the structures on the main irrigation canal that would need to be

                                             6
repaired following canal’s rehabilitation. This necessitated several changes to the
FVWRMP’s design during implementation. Similarly, the design did not include the
structures needed to ensure sustainable land management for crop production. The
original reservoir embankments were under-designed, and required substantial yearly
budget allocations for their maintenance. Significant price increases of most works,
goods and labor during 2007-2010 also contributed to cost overruns and the need for AF.
These factors combined to delay implementation and reduce the project’s reach in terms
of outputs. 7

2.2 Implementation

26.     The Project got off to a slow start and activities fell behind from the
beginning. Several factors contributed to this: (i) the Dam Safety Panel, which was to be
created by January 1, 2006, was delayed until January 2007 due to delays in project
preparation and in declaring the Grant Agreement effective; (ii) the transfer of the PMU
Director and the time taken for the new Director (appointed in June 2006) to implement
project activities and to appoint PMU staff contributed to very little progress in the first
ten months after effectiveness on January 19, 2006. By November 2006, it was clear that
the first year targets for project activities would not be met, and IP was downgraded to
MU. The Bank and PMU agreed on an action plan. As most activities progressed, the
rating was upgraded to MS within a month. However, the project continued to face delays
in 2007.

27.      Cost overruns affected implementation, reduced outputs, and necessitated
additional financing. Other factors that contributed to higher than anticipated costs
included: a sizable rise in construction costs (labor, fuel, equipment and material) that
increased some individual items up to four times during 2005-09; further deterioration of
the I&D networks that required more comprehensive rehabilitation works; the subsequent
need to change the design of the reservoir embankments due to further deterioration (that
increased costs by a factor of five); and the broader scope of geotechnical investigations
of the Dam for safety concerns (that increased costs by a factor of four). For example, the
length of embankments to be rehabilitated was reduced considerably to accommodate the
much more extensive works that were needed to ensure the stability of the embankments.
While this reduced actual project coverage, the team believed that the more
comprehensive rehabilitation was appropriate when combined with better selection of
sites. In addition, given the poor capacity for maintenance, these more extensive works
were expected to mitigate the need for constant maintenance, and support sustainability
of the rehabilitated sections.

28.    Lack of counterpart funding during 2008-09 affected the execution of on-
going and new contracts, and had financial implications for the project. To address


7
  The Project Paper of May 25, 2010 states that without the AF, the works would remain
unfinished and the PDO would not be achieved (paragraph 18, Project Paper). It should be noted
that the ISRs of 12/30/2009 and 10/17/2010 rated progress towards the PDO as ‘satisfactory’.
This rating was only downgraded to MU in the ISR dated 6/22/2012.


                                              7
this situation and mitigate further delays, the first restructuring in February 2010 included
an increase to 100 percent financing of the works for all future contracts.

29.     At the time of the MTR, there were delays in the implementation of Dam
Safety studies. The Panel of Experts (POE) and the Bank’s Dam Advisor had
recommended a reduced scope of dam safety investigations that they deemed sufficient at
the stage. Combined with delays in carrying out the required geotechnical investigations
due to the high reservoir water levels, and the project budget constraints and allocation
issues, the final report on the Kayrakkum Dam Safety was late.

30.     Delays in construction works made it unlikely that all the works would be
completed by project closing and the PDO would be fully achieved, necessitating a
third extension of the closing date by one year, to May 31, 2014. The delays were due
to the very tight window for implementing works that were affected by water levels in the
reservoir; the agricultural growing season; and the harsh winter season. Effectively, for
many of the works, this left only a few months per year during which construction could
be executed. This also required good management and planning skills of the PMU. The
affected works included rehabilitation of embankments, canal lining, rehabilitation of
pumping stations, cleaning of drainage canals and installation of polyethylene pipes.

31.     Slow farm restructuring under the LRCSP delayed execution of Component
3. The local authorities in some areas were reluctant to implement land reforms, and
consequently no foundation was established for setting up the WUAs. As combining land
restructuring with irrigation rehabilitation works and support to WUAs constituted key
elements of the FVWRMP, the PMU worked closely with the local government to
resolve this issue. These delays, however, exacerbated the already weak WUA capacity
to recover costs and conduct maintenance, and contributed to the need for the final
extension of the Project.

32.     The appointment of a new Director (following the sudden loss of the PMU
Director in June 2012) took almost nine months, and further limited progress in
several areas (i.e. construction works, strengthening capacity of WUAs and land
reform). During this period, the signing authority was not delegated to the acting PMU
Director, which led to disruptions to project management and the timely replenishment of
project accounts. Staff salaries were not paid. The absence of a PMU Director also curbed
the interaction between the project and local authorities that was critical for accelerating
farm restructuring, particularly in an environment where some stakeholders were voicing
strong resistance to restructuring, and where frequent interactions between project
management and local authorities was required 8.

                                             8
33.     Project restructurings took place in a timely manner, including following the
MTR, when the team recognized that considerable shortfalls in project outputs were
threatening the achievement of the PDO, and proceeded to reallocate funds to enable
works to continue, and to secure additional financing. The expected activities and outputs
(at approval) were reduced significantly at the MTR, reducing the project’s overall reach
(see Table 1 in Annex 2). The Project’s IP and PDO ratings remained MU until the end of
2013, when they were upgraded to MS 9.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.      M&E design envisaged making use of existing data sources, supplemented by
regular routine project data collection and special surveys to evaluate outcomes. The
project’s RF was comprehensive and included relevant indicators to capture the project’s
activities under each component. The reporting formats for each component and sub-
component were based on the annual performance targets and monitoring indicators as
shown in Annex 3 of the PAD.

35.     Overall, the M&E system was reasonably well maintained. The M&E Specialist
provided regular reports on M&E to the PMU. However, there were issues related to the
methodology/framework of undertaking M&E for the project. The reports submitted by
the PMU to the Bank in the earlier years, around mid-2009, were more focused on project
oversight and centered on the project procurement cycle and the state of each contract
and outputs rather than looking at project outcomes. The scope and focus of M&E
activities were clarified, and the Bank team suggested methods to collect data under each
component and update the status of project intermediate outcome indicators. The Project
also regularly monitored environmental, health and safety measures, including
conducting regular audits of waste segregation and collection practices, tracking waste
generation trends and monitoring of groundwater quality. Monitoring included a final
M&E report on the status of FVWRMP implementation and outputs of all components.10
The independent project impact assessment would have been stronger if the project had
identified a control group at project start-up, or obtained a baseline for a sample of
representative households in FV at project start-up and followed up with a final survey of
changes experienced by the same households as a result of the project (see Annex 5).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.     The Environmental Assessment (EA) confirmed FVWRMP as a Category ‘B’
project as it found no major irreversible, cumulative or longer-term adverse impacts. In
fact, the EA identified a number of positive effects associated with improved irrigated
agricultural productivity, improved public health, reduced water losses and enhanced soil

fertility. The EA confirmed the application of two safeguard policies, i.e. projects on
international waterways (OP/BP 7.60) and safety of dams (OP/BP 4.37). 11 The
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) included a detailed monitoring plan with
indicators to allow the PIU to determine the direct and indirect environmental and social
impacts.

37.     The MTR observed that most of the contractors responsible for rehabilitation
works were enforcing mitigation measures related to environmental management aspects
and workers’ occupational health. However, safety aspects of rehabilitated works
(completed or during their execution) were being inappropriately managed, with no sign
of on-going works and no delineation of work area. This was considered a serious issue
requiring urgent action. The mission suggested putting up signs where preparation work
was being done for reinforcement of the dam embankment. The mission also learned that
chemical/test kits that received ‘No objection’ for purchase were expired for at least four
years. Thus, the mission considered that these chemicals would provide errors in analysis
and advised the lab to provide a current list of used and non-used existing chemicals. At
the Bank’s insistence, new chemicals/test kits were procured. This lack of oversight was
due to the vacant position of the Environmental Specialist at the PMU. Monitoring of
EMP implementation was regularly performed by the PMU Environmental Specialist
(ES) until June 2008, when his contract expired. Although the project M&E consultant
had partially covered these aspects by visual observation, overall implementation lacked
consistent reporting and communication to/from the PMU on EMP aspects since June
2008. At the MTR, it was agreed that the PMU would hire a specialist immediately, and
Environmental Safeguards was downgraded to MS due to weak compliance. The teams
worked out an action plan to resolve these issues 12. An Environmental Specialist was
hired, and the environmental assessment was rated satisfactory by project closing.
However, the overall safeguards rating at project closing was MS, since the KPI on
Safety of Dams was not met.

38.    Procurement. Overall, the PMU followed the procurement processes based on
Bank guidelines and had enough capacity to process all necessary procurement work
under the project. Procurement, however, was downgraded following the Post
Procurement Review (PPR) in 2009, due to the processing and award of contracts, which


11
  For existing dams, under OP 4.37, the Bank requires that the borrower arrange for one or more
independent dam specialists to: (a) inspect and evaluate the safety status of the existing dam, its
appurtenances, and its performance history; (b) review and evaluate the owner's operation and
maintenance procedures; and (c) provide a written report of findings and recommendations for
any remedial work or safety-related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam to an
acceptable standard of safety. The Bank may accept previous assessments of dam safety or
recommendations of improvements needed in the existing dam if the borrower provides evidence
that (a) an effective dam safety program is already in operation, and (b) full-level inspections and
dam safety assessments of the existing dam, which are satisfactory to the Bank, have already been
conducted and documented.

in two instances, deviated from the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines 13. These cases were
addressed in a follow-up letter to the PMU requesting clarification and advice on
preventing the recurrence of such issues in the future. Overall, procurement performance
of the PMU remained satisfactory. Lack of Government contribution of funds, however,
delayed contractual payments to contractors.

39.      Financial Management (FM). The FM review at the time of the MTR pointed
mainly to two weaknesses in project FM: (i) the delay in submitting the Financial
Management Reviews (FMRs); and (ii) the inadequacy of internal controls. FM was
downgraded to MS due to the late reporting and the untimely availability of counterpart
funds. The Bank requested that the PMU hire an assistant to the chief accountant to
facilitate segregation of duties and provide better control over FM issues. The FM
supervision mission in August 2012 further downgraded FM due to several shortcomings,
including significant delays in submitting the project audit, and project IFRs for 2011 and
2012, and weaknesses in the implementation of internal control procedures. In late 2013,
FM was upgraded to MS as the Government submitted the project and AF financial
statement in a timely manner, and the PMU took steps to implement recommendations
(i.e. approval of project budgets for 2013, adherence to procedures in the Project
Operations Manual, finalization of the register of fixed assets).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.      There is a proposed follow-up project, FVWRMP 2 in 2016, to continue with the
activities under FVWRMP, and also ongoing work on the analytical and advisory study
on Irrigation Strategy. Development partners are also focusing their efforts in the
agriculture and irrigation sectors. Under Component 2, the detailed geo-technical
investigation was not conducted, as it appeared that the amount allocated to this activity
was significantly underestimated. Towards the end of FVWRMP, the mission learned
that the EBRD was preparing a new project in support of Kayrakkum dam safety. A
detailed geo-technical investigation has been included into the design of that project and
is expected to be conducted in 2015.

41.     With regard to the WUAs, following recommendations of the Bank, the WUAs
increased the irrigation service fees (ISF), which in turn have allowed them to allocate
more funds for O&M of the on-farm I&D network. WUAs, with assistance from the PIU
and NGO “Zaniya” have prepared budgets and calculated the optimal membership fee
rates that would be sufficient to cover their budgets and maintain the on-farm I&D
infrastructure.

42.     In addition, the Tajikistan Second Public Employment for Sustainable Agriculture
and Water Resources Management Project 14 (PAMP II) project collaborates with the
USAID Family Farming Program (FFP) on WUA development. USAID has extensive
experience with WUA development in Tajikistan and has developed an effective
approach that is widely used by other donors. This approach is based on small grants to
selected WUAs to finance limited improvements to I&D infrastructure, accompanied by
intensive training and capacity building to enable the new WUAs to operate
independently. Where feasible, this is followed by support to establish WUA Federations
to further improve the efficiency of water delivery and water use.

43.      The FFP, which runs from October 2011 to October 2014, is a broad-based
program to support small-scale private farms in Khatlon, including a component to
support WUA development. Of the 12 districts in which FFP is operating, seven overlap
with the PAMP II project. Both projects have the same criteria for the selection of
irrigation schemes for support, and the same approach to WUA development. Based on
this approach, agreement has been reached to work together to increase the overall
number of WUAs developed in the seven common districts. Within these districts PAMP
II will take responsibility for the rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure through the public
works program, and FFP will be responsible for the establishment of new WUAs. As a
result of this collaboration, 42 new WUAs will be established by FFP and 20 by PAMP II.
The cost savings for PAMP II will allow it to provide support for 33 further, existing
WUAs in the Kafernigan basin to strengthen their links with the Mirobs and the new river
basin organization to be established in this basin under Component II. The project will
also benefit from FFP’s assistance with the training of staff to implement WUA
development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

44.     FVWRMP’s objectives remain relevant to the Country Partnership Strategy (CSP)
for 2010-13 (now extended to 2014), and contributes directly to its second objective of
sustained post-crisis recovery through an emphasis on increasing agricultural productivity
and maintaining capital assets for power generation. As mentioned in Section 1.1, FV is a
culturally and economically important region of Central Asia, and agricultural income
from FV affects about 2 million people in Tajikistan. Efficient agriculture, irrigation and
water management remain critical to enhancing the livelihoods of these people. The
Project also maintains its high relevance in a sub-regional context.

45.     The project design was relevant, and its activities and components were a perfect
fit within the context of integrated water resources management (IWRM). However,
FVWRMP’s design had several shortcomings as detailed in Section 2.1. These related to


14
     Approved on November 29, 2012 in the amount of US$45.9 million



                                              12
the complex set of activities to be achieved, including addressing difficult and risky dam
safeguards issues with modest resources, and in a country that had very limited overall
capacity. These design issues resulted in several implementation delays as detailed in
Section 2.2. The Bank’s assistance, however, was responsive to setbacks in
implementation as demonstrated in the project’s restructurings.

46.     At the second restructuring and AF, the project revised its PDO to include the
completion of the geotechnical study of the dam, i.e. an output. This was a complex and
multi-faceted task that required deep analytical and field work, and more resources than
the amount allocated to the activity. 15 FVWRMP was designed (and 70 percent of the
funds were allocated) to support GoT’s strategy for improving agricultural productivity.
This was envisaged to be done through rehabilitating the I&D systems that had fallen into
disrepair and contributing to unreliable supply of irrigation water, drainage and water-
logging problems, and reducing soil fertility and crop yields. Although activities under
Component 2 addressed strengthening the reservoir dykes and minor works to increase
the dam’s operational performance and safety, the main objective was to increase
efficiency at the basin level. At the time of the AF, the project’s focus seems to have
shifted to investigate dam stability and the remedial works needed to address risks of
Kayrakkum dam—a massive structure built in the Soviet era in 1959, where the dam’s
structural integrity was uncertain, and its study would have involved substantial technical
knowhow and bringing in complex equipment. 16 With hindsight, including this complex
and costly study into the project’s objective increased the risk of not fully achieving the
PDO. It would have been more appropriate to include it as a KPI, as the project did,
rather than in the PDO.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47.     This section presents the linkages between FVWRMP activities and outputs
(detailed in Annex 2) and the achievement of the KPIs and final project outcomes.

48.     For ease of comparison, Table 1 presents the original and revised KPIs. At the
time of the restructuring in May 2010, the project had disbursed 75 percent of funds and
completed a significant volume of works and Technical Assistance (TA), including:
rehabilitation of a third of the envisaged tubewells, more than half of the planned primary
supply irrigation canal, and a third of the main drainage canals; four out of nine large
pump stations that were in the final stages of rehabilitation; cleaning of one fifth of the


15
   The project attempted twice to recruit a consultant to conduct the study; however, it did not
attract adequate interest from any firms.
16
   The Panel of Experts’ (PoE) report identified three categories of priorities. FVWMP limited its
activities to the first level (Category 1) that included the completion of a more in-depth
geotechnical study, further investigations of dam stability and the design of any relevant
remediation works, and implementation of an effective early warning system, complemented by
suitable emergency procedures for mitigation of losses in case of a dam failure. The project did
not undertake in-depth works on the dam due to limited resources and the lengthy process of
obtaining agreements from all riparian countries to undertake in-depth works on the dam.


                                               13
envisaged main drainage canals; further clarifying the safety of the dam by conducting
studies and safety measures on the dam and reservoir; and establishing a WUA and
performing yearly field demonstrations (Project Paper, 2010).

49.     The project was having a positive impact on the population in the project areas by
reducing flooding of large tracts of farm land and villages alongside the embankments of
the Kayrakkum reservoir. During the dry season, the project was also contributing to
more equitable and reliable water supply and distribution, and improving the potential for
better harvests and farm income. However, cost overruns and slow implementation were
threatening full achievement of the PDO. Based on the activities and outputs at the time
of the MTR in May 2009 and in October 2010, presented in Table 1 of Annex 2, the ICR
rates the PDO achievement as Moderately Satisfactory (MS) at restructuring. 17

    •   KPI (i): reduction of flooded and waterlogged land areas within project
        perimeters near embankments (ha); and
    •   KPI (ii): Area returned to effective irrigation under the project (ha)

50.     Outputs under Component 1 allowed the project to achieve the first two KPIs and
a key part of the PDO, i.e. increasing the coverage of drained and irrigated areas in
Gafurov and Kannibodom districts. These results were attained by cleaning the basic
collectors and drains, and rehabilitating and repairing I&D off-farm and on-farm
infrastructures. The term “ameliorative condition of the irrigated lands”, which is widely
used in Tajikistan refers to a combination of the level and mineralization of sub-surface
waters and the degree of salinization of the irrigated lands, usually in a meter layer of soil.
Cleaning of collectors and drains allows maintaining the sub surface waters at an
admissible level and carrying out of all field works in the best agro-technical terms,
positively influencing productivity of agricultural crops. Cleaning also promotes
increased filtration speed of excessive soil water in drains and collectors, thereby
accelerating the removal of harmful salts from the root layer. Thus, the ultimate benefit
from cleaning of drains and collectors is the stable maintenance of the irrigated lands in
the best ameliorative condition and the creation of favorable water-air and salt modes of
soils for cultivation of agricultural crops. This benefit is expressed in the area with the
improved ameliorative condition (IAC).




                                                15
51.     According to design data, as a result of collectors and drains (CDN) cleaning, the
level of sub surface waters has gone down from 1.4 meters to 1.0 meter. In total, the area
with IAC from cleaning on all project territory is 6250 hectares (3,850 ha in Kannibodom
region and 2,400 ha in Gafurov region). 18

52.    To decrease the level of subsurface waters and water logging of lands, the project
supported:
 • repair and cleaning of the main and secondary off-farm collectors (117.61 km);
 • repair and rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation pump stations (10);
 • repair and rehabilitation of tube wells of vertical drainage (110); and
 • rehabilitation of tube wells for monitoring the level and quality of underground
    waters (97).

53.    To reduce water losses from canals, and improve the water security of lands, the
works performed included:
 • Lining of selections sections of BFC (11.36 km);
 • repair and rehabilitation of the structures on the BFC canal (161), which helps to
    promote improved water resource management;
 • the area with advanced off-farm and on-farm I&D systems (4,800 ha); and
 • rehabilitation of the Kannibodom Concrete Canal (13.01 km, that is 100 percent
    achievement of the target). The detailed designs of all the rehabilitation works were
    completed.

54.     Reducing sub surface waters by rehabilitating vertical drainage wells (VDWs).
VDWs have great value in decreasing the level of sub surface waters and capturing deep
water streams flowing from adjoining territories. The project helped to rehabilitate 110
vertical wells (81 in Kannibodom district and 29 in Gafurov district) that are used for
drainage of deep underground waters. In most cases, drainage waters from these wells are
used for irrigation of agricultural crops. Rehabilitation of wells allowed improved
drainage on 2462 hectares of the land (1871 hectares in Kannibodom district and 591
hectares in Gafurov district). 19

55.     Protecting land from inundation and flooding by rehabilitating drainage
pumping stations. Drainage pumping stations are intended for pumping out of drainage
waters into the Kayrakkum water reservoir. 20 The total area served by the drainage
pumping stations is 6705 hectares. As a result of rehabilitation of drainage pumping
stations, 3530 hectares were provided protection from inundation and flooding in
Kannibodom district (2330 hectares) and in Gafurov district (1200 hectares). This
represents 100.8 percent achievement of the project’s first KPI.

56.    Multiple outputs and factors combined to help the project to return 7,349 hectares
to effective irrigation (representing 113.9 percent achievement of KPI (ii)). It is not
possible to separately add which works/outputs helped a specific area; therefore these
outputs and links are listed below:

57.      Improving provision of irrigation through rehabilitating the irrigational
pumping station Mahram-1. Pumping station Mahram-1 was constructed in 1975 for
improving the provision of irrigation water for the lands of the east part of Kannibodom
district, an area of about 4000 hectares. There are 8 pumping units in the pumping station,
out of which 6 are of high pressure and 2 are of low pressure. The total discharge of all
units constitutes 12 m3/sec., and the capacity is 11600 kW/h. Water is conveyed by
means of three lines of the pipelines, two of which convey water to the canal BFC and
one to the canal M-1.

58.     The pumping station takes water from the Kayrakkum water reservoir and
conveys it to the Big Fergana Cana. The command area constitutes approximately 4000
hectares of the lands. These are the areas of WUA Dehkan and WUA Mirzomalik, also
the areas of private homestead land plots and the areas that are irrigated above the canal
BFC by means of private small pumping units. Due to depreciation of pumping units, the
system of electrical supply, and the hydro mechanical and power equipment, the pumping
station worked at about half of its capacity, i.e. provided effective irrigation for about
2000 hectares of the lands. As a result of rehabilitation of 6 pumping units of high
pressure and 2 units of low pressure, and also replacements of electrical and the
mechanical equipment, the pumping station has reached 100 percent of designed capacity,
i.e. 4000 hectares provided with water on a sustainable basis.

59.      Reducing water losses from concreting and rehabilitating water outlet
structures of the Big Ferghana Canal (BFC). The Big Ferghana Canal (BFC), which
was constructed in 1939-40, is one of the largest irrigational structures of the USSR, and
originates from the basic source of Syr-Darya River. The total length of the former Canal
is 393 km, which pass across the territory of Uzbekistan (283 km) and across Tajikistan
(110 km). The command area of BFC within the territory of the Kannibodom State water
Management Department (KSWMD) is 15,200 hectares. The lower part of the Canal is in
the western part of Kannibodom, and the higher part comes from Uzbekistan and
traverses eastern Kannibodom. Since the canal originates in Uzbekistan, water delivery is
very unreliable, and hence project investments in pumping stations along the BFC to
pump water from the Kayrakkum reservoir. All of the canal is in the territory of Gafurov
district, and has concrete lining. However, large losses of water were observed along the
unlined sections of the Canal in the western part of Kannibodom. Studies report that
water losses on this section reached an estimated 35 percent (i.e. canal efficiency of 65
percent). According to practical gauging done by the District Water Management Agency,
the water efficiency was increased from 58 percent to 78 percent following concreting
this section of BFC for water for irrigation of about 60 percent of all territory of WUAs
or about 2,000 hectares. This gauging also testifies to reducing losses of water.




                                            17
60.     The project planned to conduct lining of the Canal on an extent of 11,349 m. The
project completed concrete lining of chosen sections of BFC on an extent of 11,361 km.

61.     Along the Canal, in the territory of Kannibodom district, there are 102 water
outlets, which were in poor condition and allowed large technical losses of water. BFC is
additionally fed by waters of the river Isfara by means of the KCC and the Canal Chor
Arik, which head water intake structures begin from the hydro unit of Ravat. Water is
also fed to the Canal by pumping station Mahram-1, on the border of Western
Kannibodom and Khojabakirgan in the territory of Gafurov district. The project fully
rehabilitated 161 structures in all on BFC including water outlets (104), hydrometers (49),
hydro bridges (6), and one water measuring post and one mud flow discharge over the
Canal (see Annex 2 for detailed works).

62.     The value of technical losses from structures before their rehabilitation reached 25
percent from the water intake volume, and after rehabilitation these losses have been
reduced by 80 percent. Prior to rehabilitation, annual technical losses of water from water
outlets in 2012-2013 amounted to roughly 27 to 33 million m3. After rehabilitation, this
decreased to 5.4 to 6.6 million m3. These figures are confirmed by the analysis of change
of losses of water on canal BFC. Comparison of water loss on the average for 2006-2009,
when active interventions in the canal were not conducted, and for 2010-2013 when
structures had already been partially rehabilitated and the canal also was concreted, show
on them reducing by 12 million m3 along all of the Canal, and on the section of command
area of PS Mahram by 4 million m3.

63.     Benefits from increasing Canal discharge capacity through rehabilitation of
Kannibodom Concrete Canal (KCC). The KCC is intended to feed into BFC from the
river Isfara when water delivery from Uzbekistan in BFC reaches a minimum (from mid-
June) and the farms located below crossing of the KCC with BFC lacks water. For
reliable provision to the farms located below crossing of the KCC with BFC, its’
designed throughput capacity should be approximately 17 m3/s. Due to strong speeds of
water in the canal, several sections of the canal were badly damaged and structures
needed rehabilitation and cleaning to increase the discharge of the canal. According to the
information provided by the Kannibodom State Water Management, before rehabilitation,
the Canal’s capacity for discharge to BFC was only 10 m3/seconds.

64.      The project supported several activities to increase the discharge of the canal,
including sedimentation basin cleaning, rehabilitation of water outlets etc. Presently the
canal discharge capacity is approximately 15 m3/s., or 1.5 times greater than it was before
rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of KCC has allowed KSWMD to increase the share of water
delivery of the district on account of waters of the river Isfara from 31 percent to 53
percent. It has lowered the influence of decreased inflow of BFC from Uzbekistan for
irrigation needs of lands by almost 29 percent. It is possible to assert that KCC has
provided increases in water security of the sub command zone of BFC on the area of
11,200 hectares (in total, the sub command zone of BFC including PS Mahram 1 is

65.     Benefits from rehabilitation of on-farm I&D infrastructure of WUAs. On-farm
I&D infrastructure was rehabilitated throughout on area of 4800 hectares in WUAs
Mirzomalik and Kavsari Kandy Kuhan of Kannibodom district for the purpose of
improving water resources management and reducing water loss. The water savings and
efficiency improvements are basically provided by constructing a new pipeline network
that reduces water losses during its transportation to irrigation fields. Moreover, these
pipelines provide water for the fields that are located below a highway and which suffers
most from the shortage of water. The project rehabilitated on-farm sprinklers of WUA
Mirzomalik and of WUA Kavsari Kandy Kuhan to improve water supply.

66.    Before construction of pipelines efficiency of the on-farm network (which is
located on the line with high water penetration) did not exceed 0.6, i.e. losses constituted
about 40 percent from volume of the taken away water. The Efficiency of the pipeline
network equals approximately 0.95, i.e. losses constitute no more than 5 percent from
water intake volume. Overall, the constructed network of pipelines allows the
preservation of about 6.3 million m3 waters that will be directed for improvement of
water security of crops in WUAs.

67.      Overall, project outputs: (i) achieved a decrease in the level of subsurface waters
on a total area of 6416 hectares (4,755 ha in Kannibodom district and 1,661 ha in
Gafurov district); (ii) protected 3530 hectares of land from inundation and flooding
(boggy and impounded riverside lands), including in Kannibodom district--2330 hectares,
and in Bobojon Gafurov district--1200 hectares, through the rehabilitation of drainage
pumping stations; and (iii) provided further protection of lands against inundation on a
total area of 1186 hectares, including in Kannibodom district--666 hectares and in
Bobojon Gafurov district--520 hectares. In all, the return of the lands to effective
irrigation is estimated at 7,349 hectares.

68.    During the final field visits in May 2014, the Bank team observed that farmers
were taking strong ownership of the rehabilitated infrastructure and were investing in
additional irrigation infrastructure. Some farmers had taken over management of VDWs
and were paying for the electricity and repairs. Some had co-financed investments in the
VDWs (as high as 21,000 TJS, about US$4,200 equivalent). The more reliable water
supply has also led farmers to adopt higher value production, thus enabling them to pay
more for O&M.

   •   KPI (iii): Collection of billed water fees by WUAs

69.    The project’s target rate for irrigation fees to be paid to the water supplier was 80
percent. This has been exceeded by all three WUAs, as shown in the tables below.

70.     Project activities that helped WUAs to achieve this outcome are detailed in Annex
2. In terms of establishing WUAs, the project worked extensively with the three pilot
WUAs in the project area (Kavsari Kandi Kuhan (KKK), Mirzomalik and Dehkan,
supporting 6,500 hectares) to provide training and hands-on assistance in the organization
of mechanized and manual cleaning of I&D canals, development of business plans, M&E
of WUA activities, and taxation of WUAs. The WUA Directors and accountants were
trained in cost recovery, calculation of membership fees, and preparation of budgets. In
addition, the project renovated offices of the WUAs, procured office equipment and
furniture, water measurement devices, as well as procured some machinery. 21

71.     Although the process of building WUA capacity was slow and contributed to the
need to extend the project’s closing date by one year, activities came together in the final
year to help raise overall cost recovery. The specific outputs that contributed to this
include: (i) the rehabilitation of the I&D network, which improved water delivery by
WUAs, and, in turn, earned more trust from water users; (ii) training; for example,
WUAs are now capable of calculating an optimum water delivery service fee that would
cover their costs to maintain the on-farm system. They discuss these issues with users at
the General Meetings and seek agreement to raise the fee when needed; (iii) land reforms,
where more users pay their fees compared to a few large farms in the past that had a
tendency to pay directly to the raivodkhoz. For example, the reform of Dehkan Farms
(DFs) in the territory of WUA Mirzomalik resulted in the creation of 507 new DFs
instead of 24 large ones. In KKK, 973 DFs were created; and (iv) procurement of office
furniture, renovation of the WUA offices, and provision of machinery to the weakest
WUA Mirzomalik (located at the end of the BFC). Most importantly, all these
factors/outputs combined to enhance the empowerment of WUAs, which was critical.
WUAs now seem to believe in what they do and have become more pro-active in making
key decisions that improve their operations.




21
     See M&E Draft Report, 2014, p. 112 for details on all contracts/activities completed.


                                                  20
72.     In 2012, the PIU contracted the NGO, “Znaniya” to provide training to the three
WUAs in order to strengthen their capacity. The PIU and the NGO assisted WUAs with
preparation of realistic O&M plans to maintain the on-farm I&D network, and have
closely monitored the actual implementation of the planned tasks.

73.     During the final mission’s field trip to the project area, the team noted that all
WUAs were now functioning much more actively and performing their responsibilities
efficiently. Following recommendations of the previous mission, the WUAs had
increased the irrigation service fees (ISFs), which, in turn, allowed them to allocate more
funds for O&M of the on-farm I&D network. The increased rates were approved by the
WUA’s members at the General Assembly Meetings. The largest increase was in Dehkan
WUA where the VDWs are primarily drainage wells and serve all members by reducing
high water tables. In the other two WUAs electricity charges for the wells were being
billed to individual members who receive water directly from the wells. As a result of the
increase in ISFs that allowed greater budgets for O&M, all WUAs have succeeded in 100
percent implementation of planned O&M works.

74.     Although the performance of WUAs has improved significantly as a result of
project support, continued support to WUAs (beyond project closing) will be required.
There are also other issues beyond this project that need to be addressed, such as farm
restructuring and handling of a large WUA membership, taxation of WUAs and the
transfer of I&D assets to WUAs. 22

     •   KPI (iv): early warning system established/improved and tested; and
     •   KPI (v): detailed dam geotechnical study completed and an executive
         summary with all the main recommendations prepared to be shared
         regionally

75.     Outputs realized under Component 1 that helped to achieve the first PDO
indicator, that is, reduction in flooded and waterlogged land areas in the zone of the
project near the embankments in Kannibodom and Gafurov districts, together with
outputs under Component 2 have essentially helped to improve the management of the
water reservoir, and decrease the risk of breach of Kayrakkum Dam and its consequences
for the population living in lower reaches of the Dam, by working out the procedures for
operation of the Dam in the event of a major force.

76.    These achievements were a result of the following works and outcomes: 23
• Rehabilitation of 6656 meters of embankments of Novostroyka and Yakkaterak in
    Kannibodom district and 2045 meters of embankments in Gafurov district have
    provided protection from flooding on an area of 666 hectares in Kannibodom and 520
    hectares in Gafurov;

•   The safety of the dam has been improved by strengthening of the upper slope of the
    dam; improving drainage of the dam by installing new deep pumps, and rehabilitating
    drainage of the downstream slope of the dam;
•   Specification of sediments’ volumes in the water reservoir, which allows to improve
    its operation at water use planning;
•   Preparation and realization of an action plan on the dam in an occurrence of extreme
    situations; and
•   Preparation, installation and introduction into operation of Early Warning System
    (EWS) of the population.

77.     Early Warning System (EWS). A key project output is the Consultant’s plan
that offers an early warning system in Kayrakkum Hydro Unit in the event of the high
waters, and earthquakes or other natural disasters. This is in three parts: (i) forecast and
threat assessment; (ii) dissemination of the information and instructions for operative
actions; and (iii) fulfillment of the instructions for operative actions. The plan of
readiness for emergencies provides a basis for the assessment of threat, dissemination of
the information and corresponding actions during an emergency situation.

78.     Reaction to instructions. The EWS and plans of readiness for emergencies are
inefficient if the population does not react in an appropriate way to the instruction given.
For this reason, programs for training of the population living in the flooded zone of risk,
caused by potential break of the Dam, and corresponding actions that should be
undertaken, have been completed.

79.    Plan of readiness for emergencies. The Consultant has prepared a Plan of
readiness for emergencies for the location around the Dam. The main responsibility for
emergency readiness and acceptance of necessary measures is born by the Committee of
Emergency Situations. Besides, Barqi Tojik the Administrations- Hukumats of Khujand
also are responsible parties. Therefore, such readiness should be organized under the
supervision of the Committee of Emergency Situations. If it is possible, this Committee
can be engaged in creation of an Integrated Early Warning System that requires
coordination with other neighboring countries.

80.     As mentioned earlier, the detailed geo-technical investigation has not been
conducted despite the fact that the PIU launched the associated tender twice, without
receiving any expression of interest. Upon investigation, it appeared that the amount that
was allocated for this activity was significantly underestimated. Reallocation of resources
was no longer an option as most project funds had already been spent. However, the
Bank learned that the EBRD was preparing a new project in support of Kayrakkum dam
safety. A detailed geo-technical investigation has been included into the design of that
project and is expected to be conducted in 2015.

3.3 Efficiency

81.    The economic rate of return (ERR) and the financial rate of return (FRR)
analysis are presented in Annex 3. The estimated ERR of the project is 24.3 percent.


                                            22
The net present value (NPV) at a 10 percent discount rate for a project period of 20
years is estimated at US$ 28.43 million. The FRR is 19.4 percent.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.     FVWRMP was relevant at the time of appraisal and continues to be relevant. The
project met all but one of the revised KPIs. Project outputs, however, were revised down
significantly during implementation, as shown in Annex 2 (Table on Project
achievements at MTR and New Targets at AF). Issues related to design and
implementation severely delayed project activities and threatened the achievement of the
original PDO and associated targets, necessitating this downward revision of the original
project output targets. The project contributed to increasing the coverage of drained and
irrigated areas in Bobojon Gafurov and Kannibodom raions and strengthening the early
warning system of the Dam, however, it did not achieve part of the revised PDO related
to carrying out a geotechnical study to assess the risks associated with the Dam. In terms
of efficiency, the analysis indicates a reasonable ERR and FRR.

83.     The project had a formal change in PDO. Achievement of outcomes against the
original PDO is rated as Unsatisfactory (U). Achievement of the revised PDO is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory (MS). 24

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
84.     FVWRMP did not explicitly measure impacts on poverty. However, a survey of
100 households (11 households in each target jamoat) suggests that the total income of
households increased from 367,875 somoni in 2006 to 1,044,271 somoni in 2013. 25 The
jamoats surveyed had a balanced ratio of females and males. The project has had a
substantial effect on social development through the formation and strengthening of
WUAs. Of the 10,000 persons trained under Component 3, 4,400 were women. The
project also contributed to social development through farm restructuring, with farmers
receiving user right certificates for the land that was allocated to them. Heads of farms
are now able to exercise freedom in terms of the type of agricultural production, and to




24
   The ratings of U, MU and MS are assigned values of 2, 3 and 4 (see Appendix B, p. 42-45 of
the OPCS ICR Guidelines, August 2006, updated on 10/05/2011). In the case of a formal Bank
Board-approved change in PDO, these values are weighted by the respective percentages of the
total grant disbursed against the original and revised PDOs, to arrive at the final rating. As the
Project had disbursed US$10.43 million of the total of US$23 million (i.e. 45.3 percent) against
the original PDO, the outcome rating is based on the following calculation: [(0.453 x 2) + (0.546
x 4) = 0.90 + 2.18 = 3.08, which is an MU.
25
   This survey included several jamoats where project interventions were minimal.


                                                23
shift from one crop to another without requesting governmental permission or notifying
local authorities 26.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
85.     The project strengthened the capacity of the WUAs (through activities detailed in
Annex 2); although there were considerable weaknesses in recovering costs and
conducting maintenance activities that posed challenges for project implementation until
the very end. By the end of FVWRMP, however, WUAs were taking a strong lead in
managing water and organizing farmers. The stability of WUAs has been reinforced
through developing a contractual system between Raivokkhoz, WUAs and Dehkan Farms
for providing WUA members with water, solution of issues of taxation of WUAs,
conditions and terms for transfer and use of state property. FVWRMP also helped to
establish a Public Council (Fund) of the Big Ferghana Canal as a structure of
participation of key interested parties in democratic management and fair distribution of
water at canal level.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(See Annex 5 for the Summary of household survey.)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: moderate

86.     The institutional risk to development outcome is substantial. The weakening of
WUAs and/or the links between farm restructuring and irrigation management pose the
largest risks to development outcome. As identified at project closure, and mentioned
above in Section 3.2 under KPI (iii)—‘collection of billed water user fees’, there remain
issues beyond this project related to WUAs. These are: (i) farm restructuring and
handling a large WUA membership; (ii) taxation of WUAs; and (iii) the transfer of I&D
assets to WUAs. With respect to (ii) the Bank needs to be closely involved in the
discussions through the PAMP-2 project, in order to amend the WUA law to make it
more effective.

87.      The financial risk to development outcome is moderate. Farmers have taken
stronger ownership of the rehabilitated infrastructure and are investing in additional
irrigation infrastructure on the basis of project investments (Aide Memoire, May, 2014).
Some have also taken over the management of VDWs and adopted higher-value
production, thus enabling them to pay more for O&M. The increasing WUA membership
is encouraging as WUAs will have more contracts with individual farmers, hence
improving their financial standing. However, this also means that WUAs will face a




26
     Aide Memoire, October/November 2013



                                           24
greater challenge in operating a system with large membership. WUAs need to establish a
computer database system to administer water contracts and to monitor the collection of
water fees. The transfer of irrigation assets to the balance sheets of the WUAs will
require an increased budget to cover O&M costs, spare parts and electricity in the future.
While WUAs have been successful in increasing their membership, this will have to be
maintained to ensure adequate cost recovery of WUAs.

88.    The environmental risk to development outcome is low. Since the MTR identified
key environmental shortcomings as discussed in Section 2.4, the environmental
management system has improved. The project is also regularly monitoring health and
safety measures, including tracking waste generation and monitoring groundwater quality.
Data on the sanitary and epidemiologic situation in pilot areas indicate a decrease in
various water-borne diseases.

89.      The social risk to development outcome is low. Project activities and outputs have
enhanced the empowerment of WUAs, which is critical. Also, it is likely that improved
irrigation agricultural productivity and incomes, and better public health of farming
households will improve food security, and the socioeconomic status of the poor in FV.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory

90.     The Bank team drew on lessons from similar projects implemented in the former
Soviet countries and globally. However, it failed to properly address some of the key
risks identified during preparation (as detailed in Section 2.1). These relate specifically to
undertaking a complex package of infrastructure, including dam safety aspects, and
participation, with a modest sum of US$13 million, in a country with very low capacity.
The Bank team was not well-informed or disregarded the costs that would be associated
with the planned infrastructure works, despite having an experienced irrigation engineer
on the preparation team. The project’s design also did not include the structures needed to
ensure sustainable land management for crop production. These factors all combined to
severely delay implementation and the project’s reach in terms of planned outcomes.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The Bank team recognized early during implementation that weaknesses in
project design posed risks to achieving the PDO. The team moved to adjust expected
project outputs to realistic levels, and to include an increase to 100 percent financing of
works when counterpart funding was lacking. The Bank team’s reporting, however, was
not candid through the initial years and until after the MTR. There were repeated
references to delays, and, specifically, the MTR Aide Memoire states that the project was
falling significantly short of its originally stated output objective, while costs of


                                             25
rehabilitation were substantially above the estimated budgets made at project design 27.
These shortfalls in outputs posed a threat to achieving the PDO, hence the need for
substantially lowering the targets and revising the RF. Yet, the project’s progress towards
achieving the PDO was rated ‘satisfactory’ throughout this period (except for an ‘MS’
rating in August 2009, which was upgraded to satisfactory by December 2009). At the
AF, conducting the geotechnical study should not have been included in the PDO, as
discussed in Section 3.1 above. The cost and level of complexity of such a study also
seems to have been underestimated. Supervision improved in the latter part of the project,
when ratings reflected the unsatisfactory performance of the project. The Bank fielded
regular supervision missions and closely monitored progress during 2012-2013 to ensure
that the revised target outputs were delivered. The team was proactive in moving the
execution of Component 3 forward when the LRCSP was delayed (and as a result, land
restructuring was delayed), as it was critical to combine farm restructuring with irrigation
rehabilitation and support to WUAs.

92.    The Bank performed satisfactorily in supervising fiduciary and other safeguards.
The team worked out an action plan with the PMU to correct weak compliance in
environmental safeguards following the MTR, and closely monitored procurement and
FM performance. On FM, the Bank provided assistance to the PMU in facilitating the
segregation of duties to ensure better control over identified FM issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

This rating reflects the ‘U’ rating for Quality at Entry, the ‘MS’ for Supervision, and the
‘MU’ rating for Outcome (ICR Guidelines, p. 37).

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

93.      The government maintained effective interaction with the PMU/PIU at the
national and regional levels. However, poor project design (ambitious project with such
modest resources), lack of timely counterpart funding, and lack of timely replacement of
the PMU Director, which are all responsibilities of the Government severely affected
project outputs. Delays in funding from the government became a serious issue. As a
result, contractors did not receive payments for completed civil contracts, and project
activities were delayed. The Ministry of Finance also delayed responding to written
communication from the PMU to in April 2009 regarding this issue and the application of
penalty mechanisms (after June 2009).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance


27
     Aide Memoire, Jay/June 2009, page 3



                                             26
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.     The PMU and PIU made good efforts to assist FVWRMP to move forward. The
PMU followed procurement and FM guidelines and maintaining a system of accounting
and reporting. There were some issues as mentioned in Section 2.4, especially with
regard to environmental safeguards, and delays in submission of financial management
reviews and project audits. State Executive bodies such as the Ministry of Land
Reclamation and Water Resources, the Ministry of Finance, Hukumats, jamoats and
Raivodkhoz, and Mahalla committees and WUAs made an essential contribution to
project implementation. Changes and reappointments of the PMU Director in 2006 and in
2012/13 however had a substantial negative effect on implementation, as noted in Section
2.2. Specifically, the gap of almost nine months without a PMU Director disrupted the
project management flow.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

This reflects the ‘MU’ ratings for Government and Implementing Agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned

95.     Implementation readiness is critical for project success, and there also needs to be
flexibility in design and more proactive implementation. Especially in fragile and post-
conflict states, there is a risk of implementation delays. Sometimes we take a risk and
sometimes we fail. However, teams have to be prepared to adjust design and be more
proactive in implementation, especially with timely MTRs and restructuring in view of
disbursement levels.

96.    Projects need to calculate the volume of works, consider seasonal prevalence
of works and work out realistic costing/budgeting at project preparation and design
to avoid mistakes. FVWRMP suffered from cost overruns partly due to ‘under design’ at
preparation, resulting in severely delaying implementation and the project’s reach. It is
necessary to conduct a more careful and comprehensive survey of the volume of
proposed works (especially in projects that include large infrastructure building) and
budgets required. Costing exercises need to be realistic.

97.    When project implementation requires harmonizing the timing with
implementation of other projects, teams need to identify to identify alternative
actions in case of possible delays in the other project. WUA development under
FVWRMP was highly dependent on land privatization under LRCSP; however,
FVWRMP did not identify the risks or alternative measures in case of delays in LRCSP.

98.    Farm restructuring needs to be demand-driven. FVWRMP spent time to
convince some farms to implement restructuring, while there were other farms that were
very keen to restructure. The Project should have prioritized these farms and proceeded
on a demand-driven basis at least to begin with restructuring.

99.     Projects should not include major outputs in the PDO. At additional
financing/restructuring, FVWRMP included the geotechnical study as part of the PDO.
This study was a complex task that also required greater resources than was allocated to
the activity. This resulted in the project not achieving part of the PDO.

100. Bank teams need to more attentive to consistency in rating projects. While
many activities were quite delayed and the original targets needed to be substantially
lowered as the team correctly identified that the slow implementation posed the risk of
not achieving the PDO, ISRs continued to rate performance against the PDO as
satisfactory/MS. This should have warranted a rating in the unsatisfactory range. Lower
ratings would have properly captured the difficult challenges that the project faced.

        Outputs under Component 1 allowed attaining the key project result of reducing
flooded and waterlogged land areas in the zone of the project near the embankments, and
the area on which effective irrigation has been renewed. These results were achieved by
cleaning the basic collectors and drains, rehabilitating and repairing I&D off-farm and
on-farm infrastructures. The term “ameliorative condition of the irrigated lands”, which is
widely used in Tajikistan means a combination of level and mineralization of sub-surface
waters and the degree of salinization of the irrigated lands usually in a meter layer of soil.
Cleaning of collectors and drains allows maintaining the sub surface waters at admissible
level and provides carrying out of all field works in the best agro technical terms,
positively influencing productivity of agricultural crops. Also cleaning promotes increase

   The project area is sub-divided into three project sub districts and includes 6 jamoats in
Kannibodom district and 3 jamoats in Gafurov district. The three sub-districts cover irrigated
areas of about 19,000 hectares (of Kannibodom district), 4,000 hectares (conditionally marked as
Western Kannibodom), and 7,000 hectares (Gafurov district). See M&E Report, 2014, p. 36 for
the population in each of these sub-districts.


                                                 31
of filtration speed of excessive soil water in drains and collectors, thereby accelerating
the removal of harmful salts from the root layer. Thus, ultimate benefit from cleaning of
drains and collectors is the stable maintenance of the irrigated lands in the best
ameliorative condition and the creation of favorable water-air and salt modes of soils for
cultivation of agricultural crops. This benefit is expressed in the area with the improved
ameliorative condition.

        According to design data, as a result of cleaning of CDN level of sub surface
waters has gone down from 1.4 to 1.0 meter. The area of improved ameliorative
condition (IAC) in Kannibodom and Gafurov districts amount to 3850 and 2400 hectares
respectively. In total, the areas with IAC from cleaning of CDN on all project territory
equal 6250 hectares.

To decrease the level of subsurface waters and water logging of lands, the project
supported:
• repair and cleaning of the main and secondary off-farm collectors (117.61 km);
• repair and rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation pump stations (10);
• repair and rehabilitation of tube wells of vertical drainage (110); and
• rehabilitation of tube wells for monitoring the level and quality of underground
waters (97).

To reduce water losses from canals, and improve the water security of lands, the works
performed included:
• lining of selections sections of BFC (11.36 km);
• repair and rehabilitation of the structures on the BFC canal (161), which helps to
promote improved water resource management;
• the area with advanced off-farm and on-farm I&D systems (4,800 ha); and
• rehabilitation of the Kannibodom Concrete Canal (13.01 km, that is 100 percent
achievement of the target). The detailed designs of all the rehabilitation works were
completed.

         Rehabilitation of vertical drainage wells (VDWs). VDWs have great value in
decreasing the level of sub surface waters and capturing deep water streams flowing from
adjoining territories. The project helped to rehabilitate 110 vertical wells (81 in
Kannibodom district and 29 in Gafurov district) that are used for drainage of deep
underground waters. In most cases drainage waters of these wells are used for irrigation
of agricultural crops. Rehabilitation of wells allowed improving drainage of 2462
hectares of land (1871 hectares in Kannibodom district and 591 hectares in Gafurov
district).

        Rehabilitation of drainage pumping stations (Horizontal-1, Horizontal-2,
Novostroyka, D-1, Yakkaterak, D-4, D-5, D-6 and D-7). Drainage pumping stations
are intended for pumping out of drainage waters into the Kayrakkum water reservoir.
(See Draft M&E Report, 2014, p. 62-65 for details of volumes and repair/rehabilitation
works of the drainage pumping stations.) The total area served by the drainage pumping
stations is 6705 hectares. As a result of rehabilitation of drainage pumping stations, 3520


                                            32
hectares have been provided protection from inundation and flooding in Kannibodom
district (2330 hectares) and in Gafurov district (1200 hectares). This is 100 percent
achievement of the project’s first outcome or key performance indicator.

        Irrigational pumping station Mahram-1. Pumping station Mahram-1 was
constructed in 1975 for improving the provision of irrigation water for the lands of the
east part of Kannibodom district, an area of about 4000 hectares. There are 8 pumping
units in the pumping station, out of which 6 are of high pressure and 2 are of low
pressure. The total discharge of all units constitutes 12 m3/sec., and the capacity is 11600
kwt/h. Water is conveyed by means of three lines of the pipelines, two of which convey
water to the BFC and one to Mahram-1.

        The pumping station takes water from the Kayrakkum water reservoir and
conveys it to the Big Ferghana Canal (M&E Report, p. 67). The design irrigated area
equals 3500 hectares, but the actual command area constitutes about 4000 hectares of the
lands. These are the areas of WUA Dehkan and WUA Mirzomalik, also the areas of
private homestead land plots and the areas that are irrigated above the canal BFC by
means of private small pumping units. The project supported major volumes of works in
the station including replacement of 3 pumps and repair of 3 pumps, repair of electric
drives of valves, replacement of 3 metal dam beams, and general construction works in
the building of pumping station.

       Due to depreciation of pumping units, the system of electrical supply, and the
hydro mechanical and power equipment, the pumping station worked at about half of its
capacity, i.e. provided effective irrigation for about 2000 hectares of the lands. As a result
of rehabilitation of 6 pumping units of high pressure and 2 units of low pressure, and also
replacements of electrical and the mechanical equipment, the pumping station has
reached 100 percent of designed capacity, i.e. 4000 hectares provided with water on a
sustainable basis.

        Concreting and rehabilitation of water outlet structures of the Big Ferghana Canal.
The Big Ferghana Canal (BFC), which was constructed in 1939-40 with assistance from
about 160,000 collective farmers, was one of the largest irrigational structures of the
USSR. The Canal originates from the basic source of Syr-Darya River, near Uchkurgan
and came to an end near the city of Khujand. It was later extended another 48 km. Total
length of the Canal is 393 km, which pass across the territory of Uzbekistan (283 km) and
across Tajikistan (110 km). The command area of BFC within the territory of the
Kannibodom State water Management Department (KSWMD) is 15,200 hectares.

        The lower part of the Canal is in the eastern part of Kannibodom and the initial
part of the Canal is in the Western part of Kannibodom. All of the canal is in the territory
of Gafurov district, and has concrete lining. Large losses of water were observed along
the unlined sections of the Canal in the western part of Kannibodom where the Canal
passes through the sediments of the detrital cone. Along the Canal, in the territory of
Kannibodom district, there are 102 water outlets, which were in a poor condition and
allowed large technical losses of water. Canal BFC is additionally fed by waters of the



                                             33
river Isfara by means of the KCC and the Canal Chor Arik, which head water intake
structures begin from the hydro unit of Ravat. Besides, water is fed to the Canal by
pumping station Mahram-1, on the border of Western Kannibodom and Khojabakirgan in
the territory of Gafurov district.

         At the stage of detailed designing, based on a study of the results of soils water
penetration in the bed of the Canal, taking into account change of the prices and in
coordination with Kannibodom Hukumat and Kannibodom Water Management
Department, it was decided to conduct lining of the Canal on an extent of 11,349 m. This
site is the continuation of the lined part of the Canal in western Kannibodom. In addition,
water outlets on BFC were done. The project in total contracted to complete concrete
lining of chosen sections of BFC on an extent of 11,361 km.

        Specifically for rehabilitation of structures on BFC, under a single contract, the
project fully repaired 80 water outlets and 33 hydrometers. In each water outlet, flat
sliding gates, frames, lifting screws, and concrete parts have been replaced, and the metal
diaphragms with a designed aperture in conformity of its irrigated area have been
installed. The total quantity of the rehabilitated structures under this one Contract was
113. Within the limits of other contracts, 48 structures on BFC were also rehabilitated.
Thus, in all on BFC 161 structures were rehabilitated, including water outlets (104),
hydrometers (49), hydro bridges (6), and one water measuring post and one mud flow
discharge over the Canal.

       The project also reconstructed storm overflows to protect BFC against mud storm
flows. These works included dismantling of concrete and RCC elements of the storm-
overflow sewer, their use for strengthening of downstream structures and use of metal
pipes in diameter of 2200 mm as an aqueduct over the canal for conveying storm and
mud flows.

Other outputs under Component 1 included the following. These resulted in positive
outcomes:
         Reduction of losses of water from filtration from the concreted section of BFC.
Water leakage was high on an extent of about 17.55 km in the zone of WUA Mirzomalik.
According to a report, the loss of water on this section reached about 35 percent (i.e.
canal efficiency of 65 percent). Through concreting this section of BFC for water for
irrigation of about 60 percent of all territory of WUAs or about 2,000 hectares, according
to practical gauging done by the District Water Management Agency, the water
efficiency was increased from 58 percent to 78 percent. This gauging also testifies to
reducing losses of water.

       Reduction of losses of water from rehabilitated water outlets of BFC. On this
Canal, 104 water outlets were rehabilitated, which allowed to reduce technical losses of
water. Precisely measured data on technical losses are not available, however according
to expert evaluations of the Kannibodom Water Management Department, the value of
technical losses from structures before their rehabilitation reached 25 percent from the
water intake volume, and after rehabilitation these losses have been reduced by 80



                                            34
percent. Prior to rehabilitation, annual technical losses of water from water outlets in
2012-2013 amounted to about 27 to 33 million m3. After rehabilitation, this decreased to
5.4 to 6.6 million m3. These figures are confirmed by the analysis of change of losses of
water on canal BFC. Comparison of water loss on the average for 2006-2009, when
active interventions in the canal were not conducted, and for 2010-2013 when structures
had already been partially rehabilitated and the canal also was concreted, show on them
reducing by 12 million m3 along all of the Canal, and on the section of command area of
PS Mahram by 4 million m3.

        Increase in Canal discharge capacity through rehabilitation of Kannibodom
Concrete Canal (KCC). The KCC joins BFC in the medium part of its command zone in
Kannibodom district. The canal is intended to feed into BFC from the river Isfara waters
when water delivery from Uzbekistan in BFC reaches a minimum (from mid-June) and
the farms located below crossing of the KCC with BFC lacks water. For reliable
provision of the farms, located below crossing of the KCC with BFC, its’ designed
throughput capacity should be approximately 17 m3/s. Due to strong speeds of water in
the canal some sections of the canal were badly damaged and structures needed
rehabilitation and cleaning, and to increase the discharge of the canal, it was necessary to
increase its boards. According to the information provided by the Kannibodom State
Water Management, before rehabilitation the Canal capacity for discharge to BFC was
only 10 m3/seconds.

        The following activities were executed to increase the discharge of the Canal:
•   Sedimentation basin cleaning on the unit Ravot (17700 m3);
•   Rehabilitation of 5 water outlets;
•   Repair of 6 gates on the hydro unit Mahram (located on the western suburb of
    Kannibodom);
•   Rehabilitation water extinguisher and a spillway;
•   Laying of concrete of mark М250 in volume 1370 m3 on the destroyed bottom and
    slopes of the Canal with reinforcing by mesh of Diameter 6 mm, the size 200Х200
    mm and escalating of boards of the Canal for length of 750 meters.

        Presently the canal discharge capacity is about 15 m3/s., or by 1.5 times greater
than it was before rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of KCC has allowed KSWMD to increase
the share of water delivery of the district on account of waters of the river Isfara from 31
percent to 53 percent. It has provided to lower the influence of decreased inflow of BFC
from Uzbekistan for irrigation needs of lands by almost 29 percent. It is possible to assert
that KCC has provided increases in water security of the sub command zone of BFC on
the area of 11,200 hectares (in total, the sub command zone of BFC including PS
Mahram 1 is 15200 hectares).

       Benefits from rehabilitation of on-farm I&D infrastructure of WUAs. On-farm
I&D infrastructure was rehabilitated on the area of 4800 hectares in WUAs Mirzomalik
and Kavsari Kandy Kuhan of Kannibodom district for the purpose of improving water
resources management and reducing of water loss. The water savings and efficiency
improvements are provided basically by construction of a new pipeline network that


                                            35
allows reducing water losses during its transportation to irrigation fields. Moreover, these
pipelines provide water for the fields that are located below a highway and which suffers
most from the shortage of water.

       In total 11 on-farm sprinklers of WUA Mirzomalik were rehabilitated. Their
general length is 10,249 m, and the area where water security will be improved is 1086
hectares. In WUA KKK, sprinklers КР 1 in length of 3320 meters with diameter of
polyethylene pipes 450mm and КР 4 in length 1805 m with diameter of polyethylene
pipes 500 mm have been rehabilitated. The area of improvement of water supply in all
makes 765 hectares (sprinkler КР1 improves water supply of 500 hectares, and sprinkler
КР 4 of 265 hectares).

        Before construction of pipelines efficiency of the on-farm network, which is
located on the line with high water penetration, did not exceed 0.6, i.e. losses constituted
about 40 percent from volume of the taken away water. The Efficiency of the pipeline
network approximately equals 0.95, i.e. losses constitute no more than 5 percent from
water intake volume. Overall, the constructed network of pipelines allows preserving
about 6.3 million m3 waters that will be directed for improvement of water security of
crops in WUAs.

        Outputs realized under Component 1 above provided reduction of the flooded and
bogged up land areas in the zone of the project near the embankments in Kannibodom
and Gafurov districts. These outputs together with outputs achieved under Component 2
have essentially helped to improve the management of the water reservoir; decrease the
risk of breach of Kayrakkum Dam and its consequences for the population living in lower
reaches of the Dam, by working out the procedures for operation of the Dam in the event
of a major force.

These achievements were a result of the following executed works for: 29
• Rehabilitation of river side embankments of the Kayrakkum water reservoir in Gafurov
  and Kannibodom districts;
• Improvement of safety of the Dam by strengthening of the upper slope of the Dam,
  improvement of drainage of the Dam by means of installation of new deep pumps and
  rehabilitation of drainage of the downstream slope of the Dam;
• Specification of sediments’ volumes in the water reservoir, which allows to improve its
  operation at water use planning;
• Working out and realization of an action plan on the Dam in an occurrence of extreme
  situations; and
• Working out, installation and introduction into operation of Early Warning System
  (EWS) of the population.

Rehabilitation of Bank Strengthening Embankments
      As a result of the rehabilitation works, 6656 meters of embankments of
Novostroyka and Yakkaterak in Kannibodom district have been strengthened. In Gafurov


29
  See the M&E Draft Report, 2014, p. 86-87 for a detailed description of the works executed
under this Component.



                                               37
district, 2045 meters of embankments of Horizontal 1 and Horizontal 2 have been
strengthened.

The basic scope of works for rehabilitation of embankments included the following
items:
• Rehabilitation of auxiliary access roads to the embankments;
• Transportation, embankment, consolidation of loam and pebble soils and leveling of
    surfaces of the embankments according to drawings;
• Formation of protective bed out of pebble soil in the thickness of 30 cm ;
• Pitching and packing of the large-sized imported and old stone used in the body of the
    destroyed embankment;
• Removal of a vegetative layer from the crest of the embankment;
• Gravel and pebble covering of the crest of the embankments.

        Calculations and design of the cross-section of a profile of the embankment,
strengthening of its slopes have been executed according to the existing norms and rules, and
the drawings with use of soft program of Auto CAD. The design documentation of this type
allows performing all works of construction and repair of the embankments on a qualitative
level.

        Protection of lands against flooding. The rehabilitated embankments in
Kannibodom district provide protection of the river side lands on an area of 666 hectares,
and in Gafurov on an area of 520 hectares. Size of the protected area depends on the
slope of lands near to embankments. The higher the slope, the lower the area. In
Kannibodom district, on average, 1 km of the rehabilitated embankment corresponds to
100 hectares of the protected lands from flooding. In Gafurov district 1 km of the
rehabilitated embankment allows for almost 2.5 times greater area of protected lands.

        Improvements of water reservoir management and decrease in risk of breach
of Kayrakkum Dam. Improvement of water reservoir management and decrease in risk
of breach of Kayrakkum Dam is a very difficult and multi-sided issue, and demands a
special approach for its solution. It includes carrying out deep field and analytical
research, workings out the actions for safety of the Dam and their realization, in terms of
the kind of services, procurement of goods and performance of works required. The
analysis and development of materials for improving the management of the water
reservoir and for decreasing the risk of breach of the Kayrakkum Dam has been carried
out, with the objectives of: (i) defining the defects (structural and non-structural) of the
Dam and Kayrakkum hydro unit, and the risk degree, connected with these defects; and
(2) the prospective rehabilitation actions needed and the costs of these actions.

       The project selected the Consulting Company Temelsu (Turkey) in association
with the Mot McDonald Company (Great Britain) to conduct this research. The Contract
was signed on July, 21st, 2008 for a period of 8 months. The Contract was completed in
2009. A final report on “Consulting services for improvement of safety and operation of
Kayrakkum embankments and water reservoirs” in two volumes has been submitted to
PMU. The expert notes that for the purpose of decreasing the risk of destruction of the



                                             38
Dam, it is necessary to hold the water level in the water reservoir on lower elevation
marks and urgently carry out the works on the first priority basis. 30

        “The plan of readiness for emergencies of the Kayrakkum embankment”, which
includes classification of levels of emergencies and the basic practical recommendations
on realization of concrete actions at their occurrence, have been transferred to HPP and
other stakeholders. The basic conclusions of the Consultant based on results of the
executed works and assessment of their activities by the Panel of Experts are given in the
M&E Draft Report, p. 92.

         Stability of the Dam. The dynamic characteristic and seismic safety of the Dam
are defined by use of the best assessed structural properties of materials of construction
and soil of the basis based on limited accessible data and results of geotechnical research
at the first stage. Results of evaluation of these seismic studies have shown that the Dam
is rather vulnerable to strong earthquakes, especially for levels of the Maximum design
earthquake and the Maximum Rated Earthquake. The destruction and loss as a result of
destruction of the Dam appear as catastrophic, with secondary influences extending to the
territory outside the flooding zone. The impact connected with the lack of water for
irrigation extends to the essential distances downstream in the territory or Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan.

         Preliminary conclusions indicate that the safety of the Dam can be preserved by:
•    Strengthening and restoration of the downstream and upstream prisms to the initial
     condition;
•    Reduction of levels of subsurface waters within the Dam body on the lower side
     current flow;
•    Construction of stone pylons on the upper prism for discharge of surplus of porous
     pressure which rise to admissible level during the seismic activation.

        However, the Consultant together with the Group of experts considers it necessary
to carry out all-round geotechnical studies for assessment of seismic safety and detailed
design studying. The Project has agreed with an EBRD project to carry out these detailed
studies.

        Early Warning System (EWS). A key project output is the Consultant’s plan
that offers an early warning system in Kayrakkum Hydro Unit in case of occurrence of
the high waters. This is in three parts: (i) forecast and threat assessment; (ii)
dissemination of the information and instructions for operative actions; and (iii)
fulfillment of the instructions for operative actions. The plan of readiness for the
emergencies provides a basis for assessment of threat, dissemination of the information
and corresponding actions during an emergency situation.

        Reaction to instructions. The EWS and plans of readiness for emergencies are
inefficient if the population does not react in an appropriate way to the instruction given.
For this reason, programs for training the population living in the flooded zone of risk,
caused by potential break of the Dam, and corresponding actions that should be
undertaken, in case of the warning about such phenomenon are required. These issues
also are assigned to the Consultant for working out and introduction of the EWS.

        Plan of readiness for emergencies. The Consultant has prepared a Plan of
readiness for emergencies for the location of the Dam and out of the Dam location.
However, such readiness is connected not only with the Ministry of Land Reclamation
and Water Resources. The main responsibility for readiness to any case and acceptance of
necessary measures is born by Committee of Emergency Situations. Besides, Barqi Tojik
the Administrations- Hukumats of Khujand also are the responsible parties. Therefore
such readiness should be organized under the supervision of Committee of Emergency
Situations. If some other components of this project are connected with Readiness for
Emergencies in the future it is offered that such component should be copied by a
Committee established with participation of all governmental parties. If it is possible, this
Committee can be engaged in creation of an Integrated Early Warning System that
requires coordination with other neighboring countries.

WUAs in the project area. These were: Kavsari Kandi Kuhan (KKK), Mirzomalik and
Dehkan. Specifically, the project provided training and hands-on assistance in the
organization of mechanized and manual cleaning of I&D canals, development of business
plans, M&E of WUA activities, and taxation of WUAs. The WUA Directors and
accountants were trained in cost recovery, calculation of membership fees, and
preparation of budgets. In addition, the project renovated offices of the WUAs, procured



                                                   40

• Computer equipment, accounting, geodetic devices and bicycles, which allow WUAs
    to improve the system of planning of water use and reporting, and to execute actions
    for estimating for performance of repair works, gaugings of water and its distribution
    have been transferred to balance of all three WUAs;
• A Public Council (Fund) of the BFC, as a structure of participation of key interested
    parties in democratic management and fair distribution of water at canal level was
    established; and
• Major repairs carried out on offices of WUA Mirzomalik and KKK.

        Improvement of agricultural efficiency and achievement of more rational
system of use of water
Outputs include the following:
• Reform of Dehkan Farms in the territory of WUA Mirzomalik, which resulted in the
    creation of 507 new Dehkan Farms instead of 24 large ones. In addition, the PIU has
    provided an information campaign in WUA KKK where 973 Dehkan Farms were
    created;

•   Active works on training, display, publication and distribution of results of
    demonstrations to promote the introduction of new varieties of crops and technologies
    on almost 19,000 hectares;
•   Over 2008-2012, a total of 57 demonstrations in 29 Dehkan Farms under pilot
    territories were conducted. These demonstrations covered an area of 62.8 hectares.
    Basically demonstrations addressed the following topics: reception and distributions
    of seeds of high-yielding varieties of cotton, the use of the bared seeds of cotton,
    exact sowing time, cultivation of selected saplings of stone and seed varieties, new
    technologies of inoculation, mulching of row-spacing, drip irrigation of cotton, young
    garden, nursery, tomatoes, sweet pepper and cucumbers, the distribution of high-
    yielding varieties of corn, vegetable and fruit crops, distribution of new sub-film
    technologies of cultivation of early crops of cucumbers, and distribution of cultivation
    of carrots (new crops);
•   On demonstration plots, the productivity of agricultural crops was about 24 to 57
    percent higher than on control sites, and profitability of producing cotton is about 13
    to 15 percent, vegetable crops had profitability of 44-125 percent, and grains, 23 to 29
    percent.
•   In 2012, the Consultant executed numerous scope of works demonstrating water
    saving technologies, and as a result considerable savings of irrigating norm (4-38
    percent) and reduction in water consumption for gaining of unit of crop from 26 to
    177 percent have been achieved.
•   Trainings were conducted to cover more than 10,000 persons, out of which 4,400
    were women.
•   Results of demonstrations have been published in the form of brochures,
    recommendations and booklets, which were distributed to participants of trainings
    and Dehkan Farms.

      Mitigation of impact on the environment
  For the dissemination of information, two round tables (July 12, 2008 and July 30,
  2010) were conducted for acquainting interested participants and beneficiaries on the
  environmental component of the Project, and its tasks and planned actions.
  Representatives of PMU, nature protection department, regional and district
  departments of water management, the sanitary-and-epidemiologic control units,
  NGOs, representatives of executive power and managements of agriculture of pilot
  districts participated in these round tables;
• Training modules on various aspects of preservation of the environment were
  prepared. Two two-day trainings for employees of the analytical laboratory of the
  control and preservation of the environment of Sogd regional committee were trained
  on techniques of definition of quality of water using the equipment provided under
  FVWRMP;
• At the end of May and in the beginning of September, 2009, in districts of Gafurov
  and Kannibodom, training and information campaigns were conducted where 1,200
  persons took part. Trainings dealt with subjects such as methods of rational water and
  land use, recycling of waste, use of fertilizers and other aspects of preservation of the
  environment. Booklets and books on various aspects of ecological education were
  distributed to the participants;


                                            42
• Special studies were carried out in selected pilot districts on subjects of social and
  economic issues, legislative and legal aspects, quality of water, the biodiversity
  preservations, the existing ameliorative condition, and assessment of water security of
  the irrigated lands;
• GiS-mapping of results of analytical studies on radiating pollution in the project zone
  was carried out, and gaugings of radiating conditions were executed by means of
  special equipment. Researches of salinity of soils on the Project areas were also
  conducted.
• Trainings on rational use of water (methods of irrigation, reduction of losses, and
  choice of agricultural crops), service regulations and maintenance of the rehabilitated
  irrigational structures after the project’s life time, preservation and protection of water
  resources, national, regional and international standards of environment and
  requirements for reception of permissions, licenses, contracts, etc. were conducted.
• Assistance to carrying out monitoring of environment on the chosen parameters.
  Sampling and the analysis of superficial waters from 10 selected points (superficial
  waters), 4 selected points of subsurface waters - once a quarter for monitoring of
  influence of rehabilitation works carried out by the Project;
• Consulting services to beneficiary concerning preservation of the environment with
  regard to technical, informative and institutional character were rendered;
• A detailed report containing assessment of the existing condition of water use,
  operation of irrigating systems were prepared and actions for water savings and
  service regulations of irrigating systems were offered; and
• Preparation of TV materials, rollers and reports on activities related to water
  resources management of Ferghana valley, including ecological aspects was
  broadcast on Sogd TV.

The project has also contributed to the following:
        Ensuring of increase of collecting of membership fees in WUAs. The size of
membership fees is defined at the time of drawing up the WUA budget, and approved by
general meeting. The project supported activities to explain to farmers about timely
payment of membership fees that would be used to ensure WUA activities. Based on the
results for 2013, the rate of collection of membership fees on average has increased to
99.9 percent (Mirzomalik 99.5 percent, KKK 100 percent, and Dehkan 100.3 percent).
This compares with the averages of 39.6 percent in 2011 and 66 percent in 2012.

       Solution of problems of taxes on property transferred to balance sheet of WUAs.
To resolve this issue, the PMU has employed a Consultant – lawyer, who has presented a
format of the tripartite contract between WUA, Raivodkhoz and Dehkan farms, avoiding
payments of the VAT, contracts about transfers of the state property to the balance sheet

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis 32

1. Introduction
For the economic and financial analysis, several data sources were used. These include:
      •   Final report of Monitoring and Evaluation of the results of FVWRMP
          implementation, Dushanbe, May 2014;
      •   Results of Interviews with farmers, Sugd Oblast Department of Agency of Land
          Reclamation and Irrigation and Sugd oblast Department of Agriculture;
      •   Regions of Tajikistan, 2012. Report of Statistical Agency under President of the
          Republic of Tajikistan.
The project interventions are concentrated in Kannibodom and Bobojon Gafurov raions,
with an irrigated area of about 30,000 ha. About 231,000 people live in these rural areas.
The irrigation and drainage infrastructure in these raions has both physical as well as
operational problems. The result is an unsatisfactory utilization of water resources and
low productivity at farm level.

The actual scope of the planned works was reduced due to (i) higher work and input
prices and (ii) omitted details in initial calculations. On 21 March 2010, the Bank and the
GoT agreed on an additional financing of the project in the amount of US$10Mln. The
date of completion was planned for 31 May 2013, but was extended until 31 May 2014.

2. Financial and economic analysis

2.1       Main assumptions

Project area and cropping pattern

The project covers an irrigated area of 29,874 ha (2013), of which 6,685 ha are located in
Bobojon Gafurov raion and 23,188 ha in Kannibodom raion. There is no significant
difference between the present cropping patterns in both regions. The composition is
presented in Figure 1. The dominating crops are orchards and cotton respectively with
36% and 32% of the total area. The cotton area decreased significantly during the last
years due to decreasing of price to fiber cotton in the world market. Orchards include
different fruit trees such as apricot, peach, pomegranate and others. These are followed
by cereals, including mainly wheat, oats and sorghum with 12.5%. Fodder crops (alfalfa,
maize, including for silage) are grown on 1,194 ha (corresponding to 4%). Others crops
cover 9.5% of total irrigated area and include rice, potato, grapes and others crops.
Except orchards, future cropping patterns will depend on market demand and profitability
of the crops.

  The pre-project economic and financial analysis was conducted by Temelsu Company. The
current economic and financial analysis was conducted by Kamolidinov Anvar.

Project impacts at farm level

The various project components resulted in improving of production conditions at the
farm level. This means an improved irrigation water delivery and a reduction of the
problems caused by flooding and high groundwater levels from Kayrakkum reservoir. An
agricultural extension service and a farm management information system established by
the project further improved the water and land management in irrigated farms.

Due to the rehabilitation of the drainage network and drainage pump stations, the
groundwater table decreased on a total area of 6,416 hectares, including in Kannibodom
district (on the area of 4,755 hectares), and in Bobojon Gafurov district (on an area of
1,661 hectares). An improvement of the drainage collection system allowed control of
soil salinity, increased crop yield and thus raised the profitability of irrigated farming in
the area close to the Kayrakkum reservoir. Rehabilitation of the Mahram-1 pump station,
and concrete lining of the Big Ferghana Canal improved water supply to farms. A better
water supply resulted in higher yields for all crops in the project area.

Training on the improvement of agricultural productivity and a more rational water
management have been conducted for more than 10,000 persons, out of which 4,400 were
women. Results of demonstrations of advanced agriculture and irrigation technologies
have been published in the form of brochures, recommendations and booklets, which
were distributed to participants of the training.

As compared to the beginning of the project (2006), vegetables, forage and orchards
yields increased to 10-20%, although yields of rice and wheat remained stable (Table 1).
This suggests that farmers still have a potential to increase yield of these crops.

In Table 2 the impacts of all project interventions with regard to incremental yields, gross
output and costs are summarized for relevant crops. Crop budgets were calculated for 4
major crops: apricot, cotton, wheat, alfalfa and vegetables. The highest incremental gross
output was achieved for cotton, apricot and vegetables. However, since the highest share
of the irrigated land is cultivated with fruits, it will provide the largest absolute
contribution to the project benefits.

  Accurately measured data on technical water losses are not available. However,
  according to expert evaluations of the head of the department of water use of
  Kannibodom Water Management Department, the value of technical losses from
  structures before their rehabilitation reached 25% from the water intake volume, and after
  rehabilitation these losses have been reduced to 20%.

  Although the costs of irrigation water delivery for the farmer are not high, reducing
  losses in the canals and fields will have a positive impact to improving the condition of
  the irrigated lands, and decreases the pressure on the drainage networks. According to
  this, annual technical losses of water from water outlets constituted 27 million m3 in
  2012 and 33 million m3 in 2013. After rehabilitation they decreased to 5.4 – 6.6 million
  m3, representing a reduction of losses of 21.6 to 26.4 million m3 annually.

Input and output prices

Input and output prices are expressed in constant 2013 values (US$). Financial prices are
based on actual market prices. For the economic analysis, costs and benefits are adjusted
to reflect the real value in the economy. The border prices are estimated for all crops,
including fodder crops derived from the farm gate prices.

2.2        Financial and economic results

The cost and benefits streams and the cash flow calculations were completed based on the
above-mentioned assumptions. The following benefits were included in the analysis (i)
additional production on incremental land as a result of reduced flooding, (ii) higher yield
levels as a result of better, more reliable and increased water delivery, and improved
groundwater control and earlier spring planting, (iii) production of higher value crops as
part of a more diversified cropping pattern, and (iv) reduced pumping costs per m3 as a
result of reduced losses. Other benefits that are difficult to quantify and monetize have
not been reflected in the EFA and include the (i) benefits to downstream irrigated areas in
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan as a result of higher water levels in Kayrakkum reservoir, (ii)
reduced damage to lands from overtopping of Kayrakkum reservoir embankments, (iii)
reduced damage as a result of reduced risk of Kayrakkum dam failure and better early
warning, and (iv) benefits from improved environmental management. Table 5 shows the
results of the financial and economic analysis.

                                                47
The economic viability of the project has been tested by estimating the economic rate
of return (ERR) and the financial rate of return (FRR). The estimated ERR of the
project is 24.3%, which is well in excess of the opportunity cost of capital (OCC),
taken at the discount rate of 10%. The net present value (NPV) at 10% discount rate
and a project period of 20 years is estimated at US$ 28.43 million.

The result is an NPV of US$ 17.96 million and an FRR of 19.4%. These performance
indicators reflect the project benefits on farm level.

3. Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for various risks that the project may face
in order to evaluate the effect on the project ERR and NPV. Table 6 gives a summary
of the results.

Table 6: Results of sensitivity analysis

 Scenario/Performance          ERR                  NPV

 Cost increase + 40%           18.7%                US$ 21.05 million
 Decrease in product prices
 cotton + apricot - 5%         22.8%                US$ 24.29 million
 cotton + apricot - 10%        21.2%                US$ 20.16 million

The ERR is sensitive to variations in project costs or benefits. Increasing of the
total cost of project results in a decrease of the ERR of 5.6% to 18.7%. The ERR
was tested against changes in the assumptions regarding cotton and apricot prices. If
the crop prices are 5% less than assumed, the ERR would be 22.8% and if crop
prices are 10% less than assumed, the ERR would be 21.2%. Overall, the sensitivity
analysis suggests that the project results are very robust.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The PMU contracted the NGO Ehyo and Tarakkiyot to conduct an independent project
impact assessment. 38 The survey included interviews with rural households, dehkan
farms (DF), jamoats and local authorities in Kannibodom and B. Gafurov districts.
Households were interviewed in 9 jamoats located in the project territory of two regions.
These were 6 jamoats in Kannibodom district (Puloton, Patar, Ortikov, Hamroboev,
Sharipov and Lohuti) and 3 jamoats in B.Gafurov district (Histevarz, Zarzamin and
Ispisor). In addition secondary information and statistics were collected from the District
level department of water management, WUAs, District level branches of the Committee
for Environmental Protection and management of Kayrakkum HPP.

The survey covered 100 households (with 11 households on average in each project
district) and 45 DFs. Unfortunately, the report omitted some questions related to several
areas, including the assessment of direct and indirect project impact on agricultural
productivity, the number of project beneficiaries and household income. The survey also
covered households and dehkan farms in Patar and Puloton jamoats (Kannibodom), as
well as Zarzamin jamoat (B. Gafurov district) where project interventions had been
minimal.

The results of the survey showed the following:
- 61% of the surveyed respondents reported that the project improved land condition;
- 61% of the respondents reported that the project improved access to irrigation;
- 61% of respondents reported about their satisfaction with timely delivery of water;
- 64% of respondents reported on improved productivity following the project activities;
- 34% of respondents reported that there was improved quality of drinking water.

In addition, with respect to the 45 DFs surveyed (5 DFs in average in each project
district) in the project area, the results showed the following:
- 58% of the surveyed DFs reported that project improved land condition;
- 62% of the DFs reported that the project improved access to irrigation;
- 82% of DFs reported about their satisfaction with timely delivery of water;
- 91% of DFs reported about the improved productivity following the project activities.

2006 to 1044271 Somoni in 2013, however, it is difficult to attribute this to FVWRMP.


Results of the survey of DFs are of particular interest, as DFs not only benefitted from
infrastructure rehabilitation, but as members of WUAs, they were also able to provide an
assessment of WUA functions. However, the survey did not pay adequate attention to the
three WUAs supported by the project, but provided general feedback on all nine WUAs
existing in the region. 39

  The Bank recommends that the PMU reviews the analysis of WUAs and draws more specific
conclusions based on the raw data available.

Dear Mr. Khasan Aliev,

 Subject: Comments to the World Bank Report No. ICR00003160 “Ferghana Valley
Water Resources Management Project Implementation Completion and Results Report”

The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of the Republic of Tajikistan presents its
compliments to the World Bank Tajikistan Country Office and is hereby presenting its
comments to the Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management Project Implementation
Completion and Results Report.

First of all, we would like to note that implementation of the project was highly important
for improving the well-being of the people living in the project area, whose livelihood is
directly linked with irrigated cropping and irrigation and drainage infrastructure
providing their agricultural fields with irrigation water. In general, the project area
covered 30,000 hectares of irrigated lands and a total of 250,000 beneficiaries.

The project also addressed the issues related to improvement of water resources
management at Kayrakkum Reservoir and strengthening of dam safety and operation
through rehabilitation of reservoir side embankments and conducting of technical studies.
Taking this into consideration, as well as the regional importance of the Kayrakkum
Reservoir for ensuring timely availability of irrigation water to the farmers of the
downstream countries – Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the total number of beneficiaries
and the value of the project outcomes will significantly increase.

Decrease of the level of underground water in the land area of 6416 hectares, protection
of riparian lands against waterlogging and flooding in the area of 3530 hectares and a
total of 7349 hectares of lands returned to effective irrigation should be considered as


                                            54
extremely important achievements of the project. The activities implemented under
project components 1-3 allowed raising the level of crop yield and increase the level of
income of the local population engaged in agricultural activities by 72-107,6 percent.

In terms of shortage of arable land in Tajikistan, where there are only 0,09 hectares of
arable land per person and nearly 90 percent of agricultural products are produced in
these lands, this acquires greater importance, especially in the project implementation
area.

One of the highly important achievements of the project in the field of improving of
water resources management practices at Kayrakkum dam that has to be mentioned is
conducting bathymetric surveys, which helped to obtain more accurate information on the
water reservoir storage, which decreased approximately by 25% (1038,5 million m3)
since its putting into operation in 1956, whereas the usable water reservoir storage
reduced by 426 million m3 or by 16,4 percent. Application of these data for water
consumption planning will allow avoiding shortage of water resources for irrigated lands
attached to the reservoir.

Thus, the project had a substantial direct impact on poverty reduction and improvement
of the well-being of people living in the project districts. The above mentioned
achievements are in line with the priorities outlined in the country strategic documents on
poverty reduction and improvement of the well-being of the population in Tajikistan.

In addition, the project executed major works aimed to strengthen the dam itself,
prepared a dam safety management and emergency action plan, as well as improved the
forecast accuracy for available reservoir storage volumes and inflow/outflow volumes
that will allow avoiding shortage of water resources for the irrigated lands attached to the
reservoir.

However, not all of the project components have been implemented in full volume, which
is reflected in the ICR report. We agree with the authors of the report that inclusion of
detailed geotechnical studies in the action plan for Component 2 was not realistic and
could be considered as an oversight at the design and preparation stage as at that time it
was not possible to assess precisely the scope of work and amount of financial resources
required for implementation of such activities.

Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the original project activities and setting out of
priorities for the future works under this project have laid the foundation for including of
detailed geotechnical studies in the design of the new project on rehabilitation of the

Kayrakkum HPP, which is implemented with the support of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

As regards, the drawbacks, rashness and not very adequate management during the
project preparation, we would like to note that to our opinion they were connected with
the following circumstances difficult to foresee a priori:

   -   The project was prepared by the well-known Turkish Company “Temelsu” that
       was not able to fully apply the Soviet-time methods for assessment of the scope of
       works and cost estimation;
   -   The global economic crisis of 2008-2009, which negatively impacted Tajikistan’s
       fragile and weak economy, provoked an increase in the cost of resources in the
       markets.
   -   A 50-percent rise in prices for energy resources in Tajikistan in 2010 following
       the introduction of customs duties by the Russian Federation.

Taking account of the positive results achieved by the project, including the improvement
of agricultural productivity, positive lessons learned by the project during the dehkan
farms reform (which is presently implemented in Tajikistan at a large-scale), ensuring
sustainability of WUAs (this experience is already replicated in other projects, e.g.
PUMP-2), strengthening of Tajikistan’s capacity in management of similar projects, as
well as achievement of other goals and objectives of the project, the Ministry considers it
only fair that the overall project performance rating could have been assessed as
moderate or even moderately satisfactory.

The Ministry, taking into consideration the good interaction and regular joint monitoring
during the project implementation period, as well as the above mentioned circumstances,
assesses the performance of the World Bank and the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan under this project as moderately satisfactory.

The Ministry expresses its thankfulness to the World Bank for the invaluable support
provided during the implementation of this project, which undoubtedly helped address
numerous problems and promoted the improvement of the well-being of the people living
in the project area, and looks forward to implementation of the next (sequel) project,
which is expected to consolidate the results achieved and help address other complex
problems in other regions of the country.

The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of the Republic of Tajikistan would also
like to express its sincere gratitude to the World Bank for the continued support in the
implementation of other projects aimed to address socioeconomic issues in Tajikistan and

assurances of its high consideration.


                                       Sincerely,
