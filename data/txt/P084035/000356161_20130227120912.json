It is to extend the closing date by an additional\n            year to May 31, 2014. The extension is necessary to complete\n            all works and strengthen the Water User Associations (WUAs).\n            Construction works can only be implemented during a few\n            months per year. As a result of this, some of the works have\n            been delayed. It would be challenging to recover these\n            delays as only a few months of effective construction time\n            remain before the closing date, by which time it is unlikely\n            that all works will be completed.
