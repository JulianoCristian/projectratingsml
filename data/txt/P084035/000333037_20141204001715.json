were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: projects need to calculate the volume of works,\n            consider seasonal prevalence of works and work out realistic\n            costing/budgeting at project preparation and design to avoid\n            mistakes. When project implementation requires harmonizing\n            the timing with implementation of other projects, teams need\n            to identify to identify alternative actions in case of\n            possible delays in the other project. FVWRMP spent time to\n            convince some farms to implement restructuring, while there\n            were other farms that were very keen to restructure. The\n            project should have prioritized these farms and proceeded on\n            a demand-driven basis at least to begin with restructuring.\n            At additional financing and restructuring, FVWRMP included\n            the geotechnical study as part of the PDO. This study was a\n            complex task that also required greater resources than was\n            allocated to the activity. This resulted in the project not\n            achieving part of the PDO."}, "docdt": "2014-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
