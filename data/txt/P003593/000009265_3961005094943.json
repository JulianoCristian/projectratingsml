participation by increasing the\n            productivity and marketability of crop, fruit, livestock and\n            aquatic products. The project will increase hectarage of\n            productive lands by: (a) expanding irrigation and drainage\n            facilities; (b) developing unutilized wastelands, including\n            introduction of soil and water conservation; and (c)\n            developing intertidal areas for aquaculture production. It\n            will also diversify crop production from corn to rice and\n            wheat, and invest in livestock production and agroprocessing\n            activities to make use of surplus corn and other by-products."}, "docdt": "1994-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
